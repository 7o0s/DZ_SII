So he asks his father to teach him the art of fighting, and together with his fairy friend Runa he begins to train to become stronger. One day, however, something very strange happens: Chael and Runa find themselves projected into an alternative reality, a world populated by menacing creatures but also by benevolent populations, who however are going through a period of serious difficulty. Invested in the classic role of ~chosen one~, the boy will therefore have to work to restore order to things and eliminate the monsters that threaten his new friends. Let's start right away by saying that the originality of the plot is certainly not the strong point of Zenonia 3: The Midgard Story, Gamevil's latest effort available for a few weeks on the App Store. The Korean team has undoubtedly wanted to take up the best elements of the first and second episodes of the series, smoothing out the edges (for example, the ~tiredness~ factor has been eliminated as regards the character) and focusing strongly on the contents to face a competition now fierce enough. The numbers, moreover, speak for themselves: Zenonia 3 boasts the beauty of one hundred and thirty-six different quests, more than two hundred maps, forty-eight achievements to be unlocked via Game Center, two online game modes (cooperative and competitive) and four classes to choose from at the beginning of the adventure. Chael will therefore be able to become a Sword Knight, or a warrior capable of launching slow but highly effective attacks; a Shadow Hunter, a sort of very fast ninja with spectacular combos; a Mechanic Launcher, who specializes in ranged weapon attacks; finally, a Nature Shaman, or a magician who can cast spells of all kinds. The gift of synthesis The gameplay of Zenonia 3: The Midgard Story is very simple: from time to time our character is tasked with completing missions that take place within the maps that are already available. Very often these quests involve the collection of items that are obtained by randomly defeating enemies, so just walking around slashing for a while 'of time to succeed. The combat system is immediate but fundamentally bare, and you come across situations with a certain depth only during the boss fights, when you have to move and / or implement counter-moves in order not to succumb to the attacks of the monster on duty. The standard opponents, who fortunately do not appear before us through random appearances but must be intentionally approached (except then reforming when we return to the same area), offer the best possible support for the growth of Chael, who can enhance his own abilities with each new level reached main skills as well as accessing objects that were previously closed to him. Inventory management and any crafting undoubtedly represent the strengths of Gamevil production, with a huge number of weapons, armor and objects that the character can buy, sell, build and equip. RPG enthusiasts will certainly remain enthusiastic about this aspect of the game, while perhaps they won't jump for joy in front of the dialogues, which are far too long and distracting (all in English, however) compared to the portable nature of the game. The interface proves to be practical and functional, with a button that is always clearly visible to save the game and a virtual d-pad which unfortunately proves to be quite awkward and inaccurate right from the start. Nothing to say about the graphics, however, very well designed and equipped with discrete animations, while the musical accompaniment gets boring after a few seconds due to its extreme repetitiveness.
