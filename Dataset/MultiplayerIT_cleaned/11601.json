{"name": "Tower Wars", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tower-wars.html", "text": "The premises of this Tower Wars do not appear so absurd only if the origins of the product are known: the game is in fact inspired by Tower Defence, an extremely popular webgame among the PC public which sees the user engaged in erecting a series of defensive towers to counter the advance of the enemy army. In-Fusio has therefore done nothing but integrate the same playful structure with a slightly more substantial storyline, which would allow, among other things, the exploitation of the most disparate locations: the adventure begins in prehistoric times, but over the course of the various levels you will come across essentially all the most important historical periods. Time jumps aside, however, the gameplay has remained more or less unchanged compared to the original: each stage therefore presents a path intended to welcome the enemy advance, which is suitably dotted with defensive towers, which will automatically target opponents in transit within a certain range. At the beginning of each level, the user has some time available to organize his line-up, choosing from a variety of towers with different functions and costs: once the countdown is over, the march of the villains begins, who must stop before they reach their goal (under penalty of losing points and vital energy). Attacks occur in waves, between which the player can find time to spend the money earned to build new towers or upgrade existing ones. Simple strategic but with an incessant rhythm, Tower Wars compensates well for its fundamental structural banality with an adequate variety of towers and types of enemies, both with weak points that contribute to a correct balance of the clashes. The In-Fusio title therefore offers an intriguing challenge, which however is not best supported by the level of difficulty, low in the first few bars and which undergoes a sudden surge that risks affecting the fun factor. The control system, on the other hand, is very simple and effective, which delegates the various operations to the directional cross and a couple of keys. Graphically, however, Tower Wars is not very exciting, offering the sight of somewhat spartan 2D scenarios framed from a bird's eye view, on which sprites certainly not top quality move. On the other hand, the sound is of a high level, which amazes with orchestral music that certainly does not represent the norm within the mobile panorama.
