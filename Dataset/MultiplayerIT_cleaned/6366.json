On the one hand there seems to be an intrinsic limitation in the mode of use, perhaps the fact of holding a relatively small screen in your hands makes total immersion and the sense of tension necessary to instill fear in the player difficult, on the other hand the control necessarily pushes towards alternative solutions compared to the classic survival horror. The result is a positive need for experimentation which has led to experiences of great impact, such as Year Walk by Simogo or Papa Sangre by Somethin' Else. Amazon Game Studios has chosen a much more traditionalist path for its Lost Within but has still managed to build a well-structured horror, capable of attracting attention also thanks to its high-profile technical realization. It starts from a real classic: a police officer must carry out one last check inside the dilapidated psychiatric hospital Weatherby Asylum which must be razed to the ground within 24 hours. Obviously he has to do it alone and just as obviously he finds a child in danger inside, or so it seems, because of which he finds himself increasingly entangled in exploring the meanders of the disturbing manor, which clearly is not at all uninhabited as it should. Although the premises are strongly clichd, Lost Within still manages to involve thanks above all to the skill with which the settings were built, to the choice of the subjective shot, to some game design choices and to the construction of the ~lore~ that characterizes the is obscure Weatherby Asylum, set from the classic abandoned documents and rebuilt with the device of flashbacks but also fully breathed in the dark corridors, from the disconnected writings on the walls to the encounter with the various creatures. It is a pity, from this point of view, that the horror instilled by the building and its inhabitants ultimately translates mainly into the scare induced by the classic ~cheap thrills~ (and the fact that the enemies basically resemble squatters with the backpacking doesn't help) and the more subtly psychological and profound note that such a setting seems to promise is soon abandoned. Lost Within is a haunting journey into the world of mobile horror Alone in the dark Instead of trying to pursue the console gaming experience by proposing a reduced action setting, the Human Head development team relied on a structure more similar to adventure, with a particularly happy choice in conceptual terms. In this way Lost Within adapts perfectly to the touch screen interface, which therefore does not represent a bottleneck for achieving perfect enjoyment of the game but becomes an integral part of the experience. In the setting represented in subjective, we can therefore move easily from one place to another simply by touching the corresponding points, interacting in this way with the objects and possibly collecting them, combining them and using the inventory to defend against enemies and solve puzzles. Certainly the ~indirect~ control of the movement through the pointer can't help but seem cumbersome in a game that makes tension, direct involvement and constant danger from which to escape its key elements, and in some cases the system does not make it easy perform perfectly the movement you would like, but it is still a solution superior to any virtual pad. The fact that Lost Within also focuses more on the need to flee and hide from enemies rather than fight them head on, with the fear that also derives from the unequal balance of forces between the inhabitants of the Asylum and the protagonist alone helps to create the right atmosphere and insufficiently armed. For the rest, the puzzles present do not represent great challenges and the development of the story is quite linear: despite the free exploration of the environments, in fact, the path is somewhat forced between the corridors of the structure, the objects are highlighted and the progression well marked between the various chapters, leaving very little room for personal approaches. A particular mention should be made to the engine used by Human Head and Amazon, which is extremely handsome both in terms of graphic richness and general fluidity, which represents an excellent capital to invest in other projects for mobile platforms as well.", "date": "2015-05-04", "grade": "8.0"}
