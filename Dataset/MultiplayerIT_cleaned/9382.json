{"name": "Fortuna o strategia?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/86928-the-witcher-versus-fortuna-o-strategia.html", "text": "After the great success of the action RPG The Witcher, released for PC in 2007, the Polish developers of CD Projekt have seen fit to focus again on the character of Geralt and his background, fruit of the imagination of the writer Andrzej Sapkowski. Thus was born The Witcher: Versus, a free-to-play browser game that allows players from all over the world to compete in a virtual arena in order to gain experience, enhance their alter ego and climb the world rankings . The recent reduction of the same game for iPhone represents the finalization of the project, which therefore becomes cross-platform and allows PC users and those in possession of an Apple device to challenge each other freely and enter the same leaderboard. An interesting concept, right? Let's see how this particular strategy rich in RPG elements works. Once the game has been purchased on the App Store (the introductory price has been set at only 79 cents, and the impression is that it will remain low for a while yet), we must first register our profile and of the nickname: a few taps are enough to do it, and it is a completely free procedure. Once this is done, the game shows us a short but complete tutorial to explain how to move between the various options. The graphic interface, very well made and agile, allows us to access the various sections simply by scrolling them on the touch screen, without waiting for any loading. The first screen presented to us is that of the ~News~, in which special events are promptly reported, such as our steps to the next level. And the challenges, the fights? We'll get there right away. From Magilandia, fifth dimension bluuuuu... It only takes a few minutes to discover that the gameplay of The Witcher: Versus is divided a bit between giving and receiving. The most important sections are in fact three: ~Arena~, ~New Challenges~ and ~Fight History~. By accessing the first we can look for our potential opponents, sorted by experience level, and then decide to challenge them. Once a user has been selected and the ~fight!~ button has been pressed, we are presented with a screen in which to decide our attack and defense strategy over a total of six rounds (not all of them will be available at the beginning, however). At this point we have to fill in the turn boxes with the desired maneuvers, then confirm and eventually move on to challenge someone else. It's important to note that we throw down the gauntlet immediately, but that the fight actually only happens when the other player wants it to. Whatever the outcome of the fight, we will not have any repercussions, both in positive and negative terms, until we have witnessed the battle through the ~Fight History~ section, where therefore the challenges we have launched and which have been archived collections. Although it is a ~deferred~ comparison, what we see affects our statistics, rewarding us or possibly taking away points from the point of view of the global ranking. And the ~New Challenges~ section? Well, there we are called to accept the challenges of other users, determining our combat strategy starting in this case from defense and then moving on to attack. When registering we are asked which of the available characters we want to control between the Witcher (a warrior), the Sorcerer (a sorceress) and the Frightener (a giant insect), and depending on our choice we will have certain strengths available and weakness in relation to some maneuvers. The Witcher is in fact specialized in physical attacks, for example, and is therefore at ease enhancing these maneuvers. Speaking of upgrades, thanks to the experience points earned on the battlefield it is possible to make the three categories of attack and defense more effective, as well as add more effective variants. In the end it's a bit like playing with ~rock, paper and scissors~, since the quick attack must be countered with the parry, the heavy attack with dodging and the magical attack with a defense... magical. As for the technical sector, it is a series of pre-calculated sequences that have little to do with video games proper: pleasant to look at, without a doubt, but rather repetitive after a while.
