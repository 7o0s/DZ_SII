In a nutshell, you pay to touch a product that is still being optimized, effectively financing its development. A few months ago we told you about the PC version, the first to have reached its final form, while today it's the turn of the conversion for Microsoft consoles. Elite: Dangerous comes to PC. Mission accomplished or space disaster? To infinity and beyond! We already know the game well, but let's go over the salient elements anyway. Elite Dangerous is a space simulator that immediately puts us in the shoes of a pilot who can become anything he wants: trader, miner or pirate. We will shape the future based on the missions we choose to do; in fact, there is no story, main quest or narrative element, we will be the story while the whole universe will be the pages in which we will tell it. Said like this it might seem like an exciting adventure, but the first obstacle of Elite: Dangerous will be figuring out what to do. In fact, the game will do very little to put us at ease and give us indications, even trivial ones. To learn how to move in space, how to activate hyperspace or understand why someone managed to attack us while we were using it, we will have to rely on the internet and the hundreds of tutorials and videos available. So it's very probable that we won't spend the first few minutes of Elite: Dangerous flying and building a reputation like Han Solo, but hunched over the Wikis taking notes. A solution that is undoubtedly very atypical for the world of consoles and decidedly strange for a game that absolutely wants you to feel part of a stellar experience, so much so that it supports Oculus Rift. Of course, there are some basic tutorials that will explain how to deal with a collision with other space ships and some basics of landing, take-off and navigation, but their usefulness is equal to that of illustrating the functioning of the on-board entertainment system while an emergency landing is being attempted with a scheduled Airbus. To date Elite: Dangerous is a title divided in half. On the one hand there is the more spartan and simulative aspect, the most difficult to swallow for those approaching the game fascinated by the sirens of space flight, that of the landing procedures and the long waiting times to obtain resources. On the other hand, when trade routes give way to lasers and homing missiles, the game becomes decidedly very exciting; the memory of that battle against three space pirates near an asteroid belt is able to remain in our memory for a long time. Fascinating, sometimes exciting, but dramatically inaccessible for those who don't really have much time to devote to it, even when the route doesn't seem set towards fun and action, this is Elite: Dangerous. Another very important thing to consider is that, although the game boasts of the title of MMO, in each session there are only 32 players and, given the vastness of the map, meeting them is a rarity. Everything under control The Xbox One version also has a feature that distinguishes it from the PC version: the control system. While the original game could in fact be managed with keyboards, joysticks, pedals and, if desired, pads, its incarnation for consoles had to be able to map each type of input only on the controller. All in all, the result is satisfactory, the two sticks control rudder, yaw, roll and pitch, while by pressing the left stick it is possible to switch to pilot mode and move the head left and right to interact with the on-board computers. In this way it is possible to choose possible destinations around the galaxy, communicate with space stations to request landing permission and so on. The main command functions such as hyperdrive management, targeting functions and so on have been assigned to the four standard buttons of the pad. By holding them down, you can access additional functions that also require pressing the directional cross. Using the pad may not be the best for a purist of the genre, but the solution chosen for this Xbox One version is a more than acceptable compromise that allows you to command your spaceship without losing too much head between dozens of different keys. Obviously a stick is undoubtedly the best solution, especially when coupled with OculusRift, but this is clearly a very rare configuration right now, especially on consoles. Some problems with the hyperdrive motor Visually speaking, the Xbox One version looks essentially identical to its PC counterpart and runs at 1080p. Even the economic system is the same: console and PC users do not meet but still share the same market fluctuations in terms of the materials they can trade, so in a sense they ~play~ together. However, the graphics show some small slowdowns that make you turn up your nose, especially when you enter hyperspace mode. Although the effect is in fact very nice and similar to that present in Star Wars, during our test, out of ten times the game has taken off conspicuously on at least three or four occasions before starting the journey, which is undoubtedly not the maximum when you have to pretend that your living room is the control room of a spaceship. Another much more serious problem are the crashes which in some cases can even lead to the total block of the system, with consequent restart of the console. This unfortunate incident has usually happened to us in the phase in which we were approaching our destination and had to ~detach~ from the hyperdrive system to enter the orbit of a planet or a space station. Fortunately, this defect has become increasingly rare update after update, but still every now and then it happens that you have to shout some stellar curse. The big news of this edition is the CQC mode, or Close Quarter Combat. In this part of the game, totally detached from the main one, we will be able to engage in PvP clashes based on various rules of engagement (team deathmatch, FFA, capture the flag) and use standard ships, without the risk of having to laboriously put that one on the plate obtained with months of honest stellar brigandage. The objectives of the CQC mode are obvious: to give something new, immediate and fun to an audience that is not interested in the several minutes required for a particularly long interstellar journey and that undoubtedly does not appreciate the tasks present within the game that are often they are limited to being an express delivery simulator with a beautiful landscape. Combat in Elite Dangerous is a war of nerves and skill where it's not enough to simply stand behind your opponent and shower them with lasers. We'll have to know how to manage shields, engine power and some elementary aerial warfare maneuvers if we want to win over our opponents who, trust me, already give us a hard time when they're bots... let alone those humans!", "date": "2015-10-08", "grade": "8.8"}
