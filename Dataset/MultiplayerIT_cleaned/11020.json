{"name": "Pro Evolution Soccer 2009 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pro-evolution-soccer-2009-recensione_b.html", "text": "Once again this year the challenge to determine which is the best football simulation on PlayStation 2 is perhaps as fierce as ever. Konami responds to the progress made by the competition with its ~traditionalist~ Pro Evolution Soccer 2009, yet another chapter in a saga that does not seem to know (fortunately) an end. Last year the one for the Sony Monolith was recognized by fans and insiders as the best available version of the game (secondly there was the PSP version from the converted one) in terms of gameplay, precisely because it is similar to the old chapters of the saga. And even this edition stylistically maintains itself on the traditional tracks, for a game that is, all in all, fairly packaged, which, like its next-gen console counterpart, proves to be fun, yes, but with few significant innovations and mechanics that are less and less simulative and more based on immediacy. But let's analyze the game well starting from the available modes. And let's do it by pointing out a sore point, unfortunately, namely the absence, in this version, of the Champions League whose rights Konami has acquired in recent months and already used for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 counterparts. Reason for this choice by of the Japanese softo? We do not know. What is certain is that the news will not please the multitude of fans who still rightly enjoy the PlayStation 2 and who, after years of waiting, finally hoped to be able to play this competition in Pes. For the rest, apart from the graphic change of the menus, the game options available are basically the same as last year, except for a brand new, very nice one, which among other things is the most consistent novelty of this 2009 edition. We are talking about the mode called Become a Legend which allows the user to take control of a single emerging player to take him from suburban fields to the national team. Choose a 17-year-old footballer, give him a physical appearance by customizing it as you want, a role and give him a couple of parameters to improve those already assigned by the CPU (you have 20 points to distribute among the various skills initially). Then embark on the adventure. Success depends only on you and your skills. If you assert yourself on the pitch, you will become the idol of the fans and the observers of the other clubs will make you contract offers worthy of Del Piero or Ibrahimovic. Even if it won't be easy. Once in the game, the things you can do are typical of the simulation, at least as regards the played aspect of the match. You have to occupy a specific point of the field according to the position chosen for your virtual alter ego, get used to the camera and its movements, as well as the basic commands which provide, among others (the classic Circle for the cross, Square for the , etc) also the use of the back buttons of the pad to call for the ball or ~push~ the player to cover the field position most congenial to his role. On the other hand, you do not have direct control over the line-up put on the field or substitutions, since this task is entrusted to the manager managed by the game itself. He will decide when and whether to send you onto the field during a match, and it will be up to you to be ready to earn a starting position for the next matches. The series Pro Evolution Soccer is a series of football video games created by Konami (in the past the internal KCET team, i.e. Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo, was particularly involved in it), whose progenitor can be considered International Superstar Soccer, a fun arcade released way back in 1994 on the Super Nintendo console. Over the years and with the birth of new platforms, the saga has been able to evolve to the point of greatly refining its gameplay and becoming the best football simulation available on the market, at least until recently, whose qualitative apex in this sense according to many fan was reached with Winning Eleven Olympic 2000 on PlayStation. None...'evolution' On the other front, that of ~normal~, classic matches, there is little to highlight. Immediately after kick-off there are no major changes in terms of playability compared to the past. This appears to be a little slower than the 2008, slightly more fluid in the general manoeuvre, but as mentioned in the introduction, without substantial changes such as to innovate the product too much or to free it from that ~already seen, already played~ feeling that it pervades the gamer after a few games. It almost seems that the developers are no longer as committed as they once were to improving and solving the problems inherited from past editions of the game, almost as if they were content to propose those schemes that every enthusiast knows by nowby heart and which have been dragging on for perhaps too long now, with little real news. It is true that for some it may even be okay, since the game in this way is always pleasant, but for those who were used to seeing AI and physics updated every year for ever better and more realistic gameplay, not semi-arcade like now , just updating the player database (by the way, in this sense everything is ok with Berbatov at Manchester United or Sheva at Milan) or the change of the commentary which we will talk about later cannot be enough. Just as we can no longer tolerate the absence of various licenses or the presence of a few tournaments to play. It doesn't claim to have the Polish or Danish league which frankly, no offense, nobody misses or would miss here as in any other football title, but at least the major ones plus a couple of new tournaments (the Champions and the German, Argentinian or Russian?) yes of course. Instead, we also have to be satisfied with a half-baked Spanish Liga, with only two English clubs such as Manchester and Liverpool and little else. And some incredible bugs, such as the one that in some cases causes the replaced players to be back on the field shortly after as nothing had happened, while their substitutes are on the bench but no longer usable. The Leopard and Altafini show The sound sector deserves a separate discussion. This, in the Italian edition, has undergone a clear improvement as regards the commentary. Without intending to offend the professionalism of Marco (Meccia) Civoli and Mauro Sandreani, we can now say that PES finally has a real comment. Having eliminated the robotic, monotonous and clearly recited one of the two aforementioned, Konami has now entrusted the task of accompanying our actions to one of the best pairs of Sky reporters, the one formed by the excellent Gianluigi Pardo and the very nice Jos Altafini, who with his jokes it will not fail to elicit a few smiles from the players. The result is an effective commentary, much more interesting and with introductions to matches worthy of those made live. Certainly there are defects, such as a certain slowness of the same, the lack of a shouted comment after a goal or a certain repetitiveness of the sentences due to the few sampled files compared to the competition (by eye we would say that FIFA has three times the sentences of PES) . However we feel that in the Japanese version. With some expedients in the sampling phase, we are sure the commentary in the future will be up to or almost equal to that of FIFA and Caressa, which despite all its defects remains fantastic, with goodies such as the reporter who comments on the changes in real time tactics operated by the video gamer or by the CPU (trident, defensive scheme) or which appoints the teams or players in specific actions (slides, deflections, feints). On the other hand it is said that Rome was not built in a single day. Speaking of backing vocals, it must be said that unfortunately they are still of poor quality. There are more and for more teams, they are more specific, but they always seem too fake to consider. While the graphics compared to Pes 2008 have very few changes, we dare say almost zero. However, there is still good graphics for the PlayStation 2.", "date": "2008-11-25", "grade": "7.4"}
