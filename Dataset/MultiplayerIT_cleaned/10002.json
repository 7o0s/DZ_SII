{"name": "L'evoluzione della specie", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/77388-sbk-x-superbike-world-championship-levoluzione-della-specie.html", "text": "Version tested: PCOn the occasion of the review of SBK 09, we wrote: ~Perhaps the products made under official license are only asked to update the teams and change the order of the races, and it is therefore natural to feel the lack of an alternative mode to the usual , but it is also true that in this way the target of the product moves only to diehard enthusiasts.~ Well, our words obviously didn't fall on deaf ears. The Milestone developers have duly considered the opinion of critics and the public, reaching the conclusion that the SBK series had to be ~re-founded~ in some way to meet both the tastes of the most expert and demanding players and those of the ~casual gamer~ who decide for the first time to try their hand at a motorcycle simulation. The renovation work catches the eye right from the start screen, when we are asked if we want to access the arcade mode, the simulation mode or the multiplayer. The latter, on balance, is the only one that has remained almost unchanged compared to the 2009 edition of the game: it is possible to play races for up to sixteen participants, select the type of approach (arcade or simulation) and create a game or join to an existing session, then choose between single events or even short championships even in team co-op mode. There is even the time attack, to compare to the sound of lap times rather than in a direct battle on the track. At the time of writing the review, the multiplayer servers were still empty and therefore we did not have the opportunity to test the quality of the online experience, which however we believe cannot differ substantially from what we have already seen in SBK 09, where everything worked to perfection and the commitment of the challengers gave life to truly exciting and spectacular races. Simulation... So far Milestone has accustomed us to a selection of riding style based on skill, allowing us a gradual approach that starts from an ~assisted~ and undemanding experience and then reaches complete control of the bike, in a ruthless and real context that does not admits distractions. This type of choice is still present in the simulation mode, the fulcrum of which is made up of a career that sees us starting from scratch, with a rider created from scratch and a contract with a team in the Superstock championship (where production bikes race, with minimal performance changes). In this context, everything revolves around reputation (in terms of points lost or gained) and race weekends often alternate with skill tests which, if passed, allow us to earn some extra components to make the bike faster. It goes without saying that our goal is constant improvement and the best possible placement in each race, a result that will allow us to snatch more important and profitable contracts, as well as racing with the strongest teams and finally moving first to the Supersport championship and then in the Superbike championship. The race weekends have been reproduced in their entirety, as usual, and skipping sessions on even footing to get straight to the race is a strategy that proves to be counterproductive, especially during the early stages: you start last on the grid and he finds himself having to chase faster opponents, with very little hope of slipping through them. A reasoned and patient approach is therefore necessary, which involves setting up the bike together with the team engineer (who can suggest the best setup, if we don't want to start experimenting at our expense) to gain those tenths that will be able to make the difference within one or more sectors of the track. A route which, of course, should be memorized in its hairpin bends and straights so as not to be caught unprepared. As mentioned above, it is still possible to adjust the options in such a way as to obtain a greater or lesser degree of realism: the basic setting includes driving aids and puts us on the saddle of a motorcycle that responds promptly to our solicitations; the intermediate one is the best compromise between realism and fun; the advanced one does not tolerate errors, provides for separate management of the front and rear brakes and a really shrewd gas dosage, especially in curves. These choices are accompanied by a whole series of further adjustments that give the complete picture of how well SBK X: Superbike World Championship has been taken care of: it is possible to use the automatic or manual gearbox, decide whether or not the physics of the game should take into account the weight of the pilot, activate the trajectory suggestions, etc. The career already in itself offers entertainment of great depth, but is still accompanied by the inevitable champion modeborn, race weekend and time attack. It is interesting that the editor for creating your own driver also provides for a different driving style (also selectable from a rose), which is particularly evident during cornering. ...or arcade? Great novelty of this 2010 edition, the arcade mode also allows us to try our hand at a championship, with a single race or with the time attack, but is enhanced by the presence of a story mode made up of continuous skill tests that bring us to earn the experience points necessary to move from the Superstock championship to the Supersport championship and finally to Superbike. In this context, we don't have to worry about adjustments, separate brakes and tire grip, nor about the sophisticated Evolving Track system, which in the simulation mode makes dynamic changes to the track as the weather conditions change or the presence of greater ~tyres~ occurs due to the repeated passes of the competitors. Our pilot can bend and detach to the limit without getting too many problems, after all falling into arcade mode is quite difficult. To add some spice to the races, the developers have inserted a boost system that allows us to obtain incredible accelerations (underlined by a special graphic effect that removes saturation from the scenario and increases the motion blur in sliding objects) and which results fundamental in the more advanced events, when the difference in performance literally forces us to push the bike to the limit in any sector. The presence of rather short but increasingly demanding game sessions, which often revolve around specific parts of the race rather than a weekend as a whole, constitutes a valuable element for the gameplay of the Milestone title, which in this way manages to offer players a complete range of experiences and sensations: from the ~Super Hang-On~ with the turbo and drifting curves to the career with contracts, teams, adjustments and increasingly realistic vehicle behaviour. We tested the game using a perfectly supported Xbox 360 controller, and we can only confirm the excellent layout of the controls (with the A button which activates the boost in arcade mode, while in simulation mode it activates the rear brake), with the motion that reacts promptly to our inputs but returns a different ~agility~ depending on the degree of realism desired. As regards the technical realization, the new graphic engine adds quite a few details compared to SBK 09, with the polygonal models of the bikes much more realistic, the audience in the grandstands finally in 3D, a good realization of the sky and a good system of lighting. With the test configuration, at a resolution of 1680 x 1050 pixels and with all the effects activated (v-sync included), the game travels at 44-50 fps and therefore remains rather light and manageable even with below average hardware. The reproduction of the fourteen tracks appears faithful, with some nice landscapes in the background and a good number of moving objects. The series lacks the exaggerated polygonal count of the best racers, and it must be said that the creation of the supporting characters (the PR, the consultant, the men in the box) is unfortunately mediocre, but otherwise there is very little to complain about. The sound sector defends itself very well from the point of view of the effects, with the engines roaring in a truly realistic way, especially during the change of gears, while the music is limited to accompanying the action without acute details.", "date": "2010-05-21", "grade": "8.0"}
