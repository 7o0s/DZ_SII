{"name": "Capcom Vs. SNK2: EO", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/capcom-vs-snk2-eo.html", "text": "GRAPHICS If it is true that it is not only the graphics that decide the success or failure of a game, it is still true that the first thing that catches the eye when we turn on our console and insert the disc is the visual aspect of the product. In the case of Capcom VS SNK 2 this first impact, sad to say, is not the best. Of course, if you have already taken a look at the photos scattered on the page, you will surely have noticed a good use of colors, which makes everything very lively and my statement may have seemed ~inappropriate~ to you. Unfortunately what drives me not to give a good judgment to the graphics is the choice to use two-dimensional characters on pseudo three-dimensional backgrounds working on a console like xbox it was easily possible to create an excellent entirely two-dimensional title, in the classic capcom&SNK style, instead of opting for this two-dimensional hybrid. The thing that displeases most is that while wanting to approve this choice you can't help but notice some discrepancies, not only on an aesthetic level in general, but also purely technical, between your character and the background: in fact, while the latter is ' very well made and in high definition (even if sometimes a little stripped of details), your digital alter ego seems to be made in a really hasty way, with poorly defined sprites especially when compared with the definition of the background. It must be said, however, that despite these defects, you will be able to appreciate the title for its vivacity of colors and for the fact that all the SNK and some Capcom characters have been redesigned from scratch, giving them a more than convincing look. . PLAYABILITY Let's talk about the most important aspect of this game, namely the playability which, moreover, has made both the Capcom and SNK series famous. First we see that the feature that distinguishes this xbox version from the ps2 and dreamcast version is the possibility to choose before starting the game, whether or not to set up the EO game system, which is none other than the acronym of Easy Operation: in this way you will have the possibility to perform the special moves simply with the use of the right stick of the pad; excluding the EO system instead you will have the coin-op version of the game at home, without any kind of facilitation and therefore with all the difficulties and satisfactions that derive from it. Analyzing the game modes, there are: arcade mode training mode survival mode vs mode In addition to these classic possibilities, the original replay mode that will allow you to review some phases of your fights, and the color edit mode, which instead will give you the possibility to change the colors of your character, also peep out on the initial screen. What can I sayoptions that are useless for the purposes of the game, but nice and therefore welcome! The game can be played in six different modes called grooves: each of them is combined with a different management of the moves of your characters; so you can try them all until you find the groove that suits you best. The arcade mode, which is the heart of the game (the one in single!), you can also face it in three modes: you can in fact choose the classic one-on-one, or the three-on-three, in full ~king of fighter in which you will create your team of three characters who will fight one at a time in the sequence of your choice, against three other characters; the third mode is the so-called ~match ratio~ in which you have 4 points available which represent the value of a character, to be distributed among a number of fighters ranging from 1 to 3: you can therefore decide to fight with only one character you have assigned all four points therefore very strong, or distribute the 4 points among 2 or 3 characters. Your enemies that you will fight will be grouped according to the same rules and therefore you may find yourself playing with three fighters against for example a single CPU-driven enemy who is rather tough to defeat or vice versa. To guarantee a good long-lasting challenge over time, the so-called ~style points~ will take care of it, i.e. the points that will be assigned to you during the clashes depending on the amount of supermoves you will perform. In short, from this point of view, enthusiasts have nothing to complain about, also thanks to the avalanche of characters available and the pad that does its job well, performing precisely and quickly not only the basic commands but also the various supermoves of the characters. SoundThe music confirmed what was said in the preview, settling on mediocre or barely sufficient levels, while the sound effects produced by your shots on the opponents and the voices of the opponents are well doneand the characters. LongevityYou may be wondering what novelty I was talking about at the beginning of the reviewobviously I was referring to the support of Capcom vs SNK 2 of the online game thanks to xbox live!, which makes the longevity of the title in question virtually infinite. Even if you can't take advantage of the game on the net, the game can guarantee a good longevity in the single player due to the variety of situations proposed, thanks to the vast number of characters and the various game options. Comment Ultimately this is a highly recommended title for fans of the Capcom and Snk fighting games who will surely once again find bread for their teeth thanks to the presence of many, but really many characters available in the game and excellent playability; but it is also recommended to anyone who can take advantage of the online game, made available by Microsoft: in fact, the support for online gaming is the strong point of Capcom vs SNK 2, without which, in all honesty, it would not have been too much unlike many other titles of the genre. Pros: Lots of characters Excellent gameplay Support for xbox live Cons: Improved graphic aspect Music not up to par Every gamer worthy of the name, whether or not he is passionate about the fighting game genre, will know at least part of the history of the two software houses in question: Capcom and SNK. The first became famous in this genre now years and years ago, thanks to the Street Fighter saga that depopulated in arcades and homes all over the world with its episodes, starting from the first incarnation up to the most recent Street Fighter Alpha. SNK on the other hand didn't sit idly by, but churned out a series of very valid products such as the famous Fatal Fury series which saw the light not only as a coin-op, but also in a home version thanks to the neo-geo. The history of this videogame genre has therefore been studded with episodes, some very valid others perhaps a little less because of the simple revisitations of the previous episodes with the addition of some new characters One fine day the Dreamcast market was invaded by a certain title called Capcom vs SNK, an aggregate with various fighters taken from the respective sagas that have made the history of 2d fighting games, after a few re-editions the moment has come, in which we xbox owners can enjoy this new version ...... with the support of the game Online.", "date": "2003-04-07", "grade": null}
