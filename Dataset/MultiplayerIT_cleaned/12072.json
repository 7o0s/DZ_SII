{"name": "Custom Robo Arena - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/custom-robo-arena-recensione.html", "text": "model making The Custom Robos are combat robots, which evidently represent a fundamental element in the world in which the game is set: all social strata have something to do with the Custom Robos, and fights between them are the order of the day, and fundamental to everyone's reputation. These robots are actually very small, sort of automatic models with high destructive potential, at least within the arenas intended for combat. It is precisely the spirit of modeling and pure collecting, which widely pervades the whole atmosphere of the game: you start with a basic model of Custom Robo, but as you progress through the game it will be possible to buy an enormous amount of spare parts and additional weapons , which in addition to changing the aesthetics of the robot heavily transform its characteristics and abilities. In total, we find about 150 interchangeable parts for our ~fighting iron~, obviously of increasing value and rarity as the experience level progresses. For a large part of the time spent in the game, we will therefore find ourselves selecting which body parts, armor and weapons to apply to the robot in view of the imminent fight, strategically calculating the strong and weak points of our opponent, assembling it in order to undermine the enemy's defenses. In addition to this we will also have to constantly keep in mind the maintenance of the robot, and we will have to clean it (literally rubbing the cloth on it with the stylus and touch screen) constantly to keep it as efficient as possible. To underline the modeling component of the game, it is also possible to insert the Custom Robos inside editable dioramas, and arrange them in the poses we prefer. The customization possibilities are actually very wide, with a wide range of different robots that can be assembled and different combat styles that can be implemented, even if there is a tendency of the game (at least in the single player) to reward the use of the components anyway more expensive and recent at the expense of any strategic approach to battle. Role playing game The RPG-like structure has the function of amalgamating, narrating the story and basically making sense of the succession of fights between robots which, in fact, represents the main structure of the game. This is a solution very similar to what was seen in the Pokmon series, where the protagonist finds himself wandering around the various areas, interacting with the characters, waiting to trigger the new battle and get into the action. In these sections we find ourselves following the story of our protagonist, who at the beginning of the game receives his first Custom Robo as a gift on the first day of the new school he will be attending. With the classic ~bird's eye~ representation, the glance is typical of the JRPGs of the 90s, but the structure is so simple as to result in a simple and feeble narrative track to follow, conversing with the characters who from time to time from time to time they will show us precisely the direction to follow and every now and then they will give us useful objects to continue the adventure. Nothing more than a simple way to tell the story and provide a pretext for the numerous fights, therefore, also considering that the plot absolutely does not shine for originality and depth (becoming the Custom Robo champion, meeting friends and fighting against many enemies, one more stronger than the other). and action games The real core of the gameplay is entirely kept within the combat sections between robots, in which the setting changes radically, becoming to all intents and purposes an action game, with shooter elements. Duels take place in holographic arenas called ~Holosseums~, where users guide their robots through a kind of mind control. In these phases the graphics, and the representation of the game itself, change radically, becoming entirely 3D and showing a battlefield usually characterized by a quadrangular base and some objects positioned to create barricades and cover elements for the robots. The fights are vaguely reminiscent of Sega's glorious Virtual On, albeit on a much smaller scale, and with the emphasis placed on several features. It is possible to run and jump inside the arenas (with possibilities that vary depending on the configuration of the robot), and the aim is essentially to knock down the opponent. To do this we can use the three fundamental weapons that can be applied to your Custom Robo: the firearm, the explosive and the pod, which is a support weapon with different functions. These have infinite ammunition but after a discharge they need a few seconds to be reloaded, thereforethe timing with which to use the weapons and the right sequential combination with which to fire on the enemy is fundamental for strategic purposes (in addition to the ability to dodge shots, of course). The fights are all quite easy, and the game does everything to simplify things by offering the possibility of inserting a handicap against the opponent after a certain number of attempts gone up in smoke, which does not greatly favor the level of challenge in the single player . Another limiting element is the imbalance that characterizes the power of the various weapons: some are extremely effective, and the game does little to avoid using the same set of components or a particular weapon practically from start to finish. In any case, the combat phases are quite fun, representing the core on which the entire game is based, and also enjoying the good playability provided by the multiplayer. Multiplayer Particularly appreciated is the introduction of multiplayer within the game, both in wireless LAN mode with one or more cartridges, and with the convenient connection to the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. The first option allows for a greater number of settings and different possibilities with which to characterize the games (with more cartridges available), but obviously the second has the advantage of always putting multiplayer combat at hand. The setting of online matches is similar to that seen in Metroid Prime Hunters, therefore rather advanced (by Nintendo DS standards), with the possibility of creating matches with friends present in the list or of finding an opponent from a global base, by selecting the experience level or not. As a restriction, online matches only allow you to face an opponent in the best of 3 rounds, and with a time limit of three minutes, but it must be said that the matches are fast and do not seem to suffer from lag or latency of any kind. with a lot of voice chat possible in the pre and post game lobby (but only with players on the friends list). Technically Custom Robo Arena does not particularly shine in terms of technical realization, neither from a graphic point of view, nor as regards the audio sector. The RPG-style stages have an aspect that could be described as archaic: minimalist 2D graphics that are deliberately stylized, but with an almost grotesque effect. Seeing the character move around the city, with men as tall as buildings, one can't help but think that such a product would have disfigured perhaps even at the time of 8 bits. The matter changes in the sections of combat between robots, where the 3D graphics appear fast and fluid, and the whole game acquires an unsuspected vitality, compared to the other phases of the game. Occasionally, rare full motion video footage of appreciable workmanship also appears, to mark certain phases of the narrative. The musical accompaniment is represented by the typical tunes with a purely Japanese taste, which still fit well into the game action. Comment Custom Robo Arena is a product purely intended for those who appreciate Pokmon-style games, and who have a certain passion for modeling and collecting Japanese robots. It does not have a deep structure like the one that can characterize the Robot Taisen series, for example, and the vastness of combinations with which it is possible to characterize the custom robo are not actually an indication of a great strategic depth, but rather of the simple pleasure of ~collect them all~, but the fights between robots are still fun and enjoyable in their almost purely action structure. The addition of online multiplayer represents a valuable incentive for the longevity of the game, which in single does not really represent a great challenge, and exponentially increases the interest. It's definitely not a game for everyone, but those who fall into the category of collector, Japanese robot modeler, Pokmon aficionado and the like will find it quite interesting. Pros: Fun fights Good online multiplayer mode The collector/modeler will have more enjoy Cons: Simply boring RPG stage In single player it's not much of a challenge Technical realization fluctuates The Custom Robo series represents a successful trend in Japan, but little known in the West, also due to Nintendo's decision not to officially release the chapters outside the Japanese market, at least before the Gamecube version. On the other hand, it is a game that fully falls within the taste of the Japanese public, designed in such a way as to exploit the driving force of various other series, merging them with eclectic characteristics taken from other extremely popular hobbies in the Rising Sun. Basically, CustomRobo responds to the need to merge the well-established structure of RPGs with that even closer to the Nintendo reality of Pokmon, adding to these a good dose of passion for collecting and modeling based on robots. All these characteristics put together form the structure of the game, strongly aimed at those who appreciate the elements listed above, and very little attractive for all the others. It is therefore a question of following the exploits of the boy who is the protagonist of the story, narrated in the typical form of Japanese RPGs, as he makes his way into social relationships and into the backbone of the game: the fights between Custom Robo, built like action game phases, until he becomes the best Robo Commander in the area.", "date": "2007-08-08", "grade": null}
