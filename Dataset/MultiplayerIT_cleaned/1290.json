{"name": "Malice: Kat's Tale", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/malice-kats-tale-2.html", "text": "How to cast a shadow... Malice is action, platforming and simple puzzles, but every aspect is sadly uninspiring. The control is imprecise. Items like weapons and spells have zero complexity, nor do they come across as simple means to pound into the wild. The puzzles encountered are obvious and derivative, and the levels are unlocked by defeating the usual enemies that stand in front of us with the two or three moves available, and with missions continuously interspersed with dialogues and plot without weight on the gameplay. The action is also quite repetitive: the sections are few and tied together by an all-engaging storyline, devoid of appeal in its pseudo-fantasy attempt and in its sprinkles of weak humor. Controlling the peppery and slightly cheeky protagonist to defeat the Dog God by going back and forth to help a talking clock mechanism that in the center of the cosmos runs a crazy universe is certainly not a plot capable of justifying weak gameplay like Malice's. The most serious shortcomings, however, are those of the control system: there is no feeling of physicality, the shots are imprecise, the jumps even more, with an inadequate bordering routine of the platforms. The only technically noteworthy aspect, in addition to the beautiful music, is the 'Shadow Caster', a routine in the service of shadows in real time that should offer an extraordinary sense of realism and detail to the settings and characters. But the system doesn't work miracles at all, and the beauty of some shadows or environments only exacerbates the contrast with the poor quality of certain textures, certainly not at miraculous resolutions, and with the generally disappointing animations, not to mention the low frame installments. If in some moments the backdrops appear very well defined and some characters well characterized, overall the realization leaves something to be desired. Comment Malice is an uninspiring title, beyond the age groups. From a technical point of view it turns out to be a disappointment, with a big denial of the hype of the first announcements as a tech demo for Xbox. The artistic style is pleasant and sometimes pleasantly surreal, but certainly not exceptional, while the graphic design has few positive aspects that stand out mercilessly against other bad elements. The weak character design, including the protagonist herself, and the copycat plot reserve moments of fun that are however far from exciting. Ditto for the gameplay, whose sporadic successful moments drown in a repetitive coming and going of obvious puzzles and unable to give satisfaction, while the control system makes us regret the fussiness of the criticisms that are often fiercely reserved for titles of light years of quality. Even if platformers aren't exactly the best reason to have a PS2 rather than other systems, the console has by now equipped itself with a decent choice: Malice, for its part, had presented itself almost as a killer application, but it absolutely fails to expand the offer in this genre. Malice is one of those titles whose historical prototype can clearly be a title like Rise of the Robots. Judging by the official announcements they should turn out to be milestones. They keep themselves waiting for centuries. In the end, when they see the shelves, they manage to amaze by being worth even less than they already suspected. Already planned for Xbox, of which it was a tech demo, Malice has gone through a long history of press releases that promised it as one of the flagship action/adventures for PS2, followed by just as many tormenting changes of publisher, which should speak volumes about the final quality of a product whose ill-treated workmanship has been struggling for a couple of years. Argonaut Software has always been a tech company, except for the legendary StarGlider for C64 and a fruitful history of collaboration with Nintendo for big titles such as Starfox and for the famous SuperFX chip. For years, however, a long history of mediocre or barely sufficient titles. Malice had to combine quality gameplay and storytelling with the appeal of exceptional graphical routines, especially in terms of shading and depth effects. Everything is abundantly denied: the new Argonaut is technically average, it is not at all ~narratively complex, dark and comical~ as many paid magalogs claimed or ~equipped with a remarkable depth and variety of gameplay and an over the top technical sector~. Skip the collaboration of the singer of No Doubt for the interpretation of the voice of the ~captivating~ protagonist, there is hardly an aspect of Malice that has not collapsed like an inflated balloon.", "date": "2004-06-10", "grade": null}
