It is one of those games incredibly rich in variables and possibilities in which a large part of the fun comes from being passionate about the stories of one's characters and which give their best if those who play it, in addition to trying to understand the main mechanics without too many tutorials, put a pinch of personal imagination. So, let's see together how we fared in our personal odyssey. Exploration, knowledge, colonization, chaos and horrific deaths - welcome to Rimworld! The laws of chaos Rimworld allows us to shape every aspect of our story or just get carried away by randomly generated data. Generally we will always start with three settlers, but everything else is a mystery. We could be a family of very rich steel tycoons who decide to give the Earth the middle finger to start from scratch elsewhere, a group of convicts on a prison ship that had the misfortune to crash on an arctic planet, a group of very rich VIPs whose shuttle broke down in the desert and so on. Even the stories and characters of our characters can vary between rock singers with a green thumb, mechanical engineers with the habit of nudism, interior decorators with a keen sense for firearms and so on. Each character will therefore be composed of skills, incapacities, fears, phobias, passions that will modify their behavior and reaction to any traumatic events. At this point there is nothing left to do but choose the landing point and, above all, the narrator. Under this name hides the artificial intelligence that will decide the pace of the game and we will be able to choose between three personalities. One that constantly increases the level of the challenge, with increasingly tough unexpected events, one that leaves ample space to recover between dangerous situations and one that is totally random. Once this choice has been made, all that remains is to set the difficulty level and we are ready to begin. From survival to prosperity In Rimworld the survivors will move almost entirely independently, carrying out the tasks they can do and trying to perform actions that are useful. However, in some cases we can decide to take direct control of them, making them ignore any instincts, for example when a settler persists in building a table while the house is on fire or is about to be attacked by a snake. For the rest we will decide what to have him build, with what material and where, the areas responsible for the accumulation of materials, where to cultivate and so on. We will also be able to decide which will be the most important activities to devote to, such as the search for new materials and new objects to build, the taming of animals, which can be used as a source of food or defense or the discovery of new settlements with which to trade or fight. All in all, everything takes place through an interface that is quite clear, but very rich in icons, variables and buttons which may initially seem a bit disorienting, but which all in all is able to make us understand how to build a house and what the colony needs to go after you. The rest of the game is up to you and the thousand things that can go wrong, often your fault for not realizing your settler's incredible need to wear luxury clothes and now he's stuck at home drinking out of depression , or the one who hates eating with others and now tries to kill them. The sad story of the first colony To give an example, in our first test we had built a first outpost made safe by the use of two settlers' weapons and some traps, immediately after we started using the nearby mountain as a warehouse, with the aim of creating a sort of civilization in the mountain. Unfortunately we were attacked by a group of space pirates who killed a colonist, but we managed to drive them away, capturing one who was badly injured. Since we couldn't cure it and hadn't yet developed a cryogenic storage system, we did the only sensible thing: use it as a temporary organ bank. Luckily the colony had a surgeon, so we transplanted an arm from the dead pirate onto one of the wounded. Don't look at us like that, desperate times call for desperate measures. Unfortunately, the surgeon was also the good one at setting traps, too bad one exploded in his face, killing him, right in front of the cave entrance. It so happens that one of the sOne survivor had a phobia of blood, it drove him insane, leading him to kill the other survivor and eventually wandering naked through the woods, until a sudden 60 degree heat wave killed him. If you are passionate about this story, know that it is only a very small slice, an infinitesimal remnant of what could happen in Rimworld, a title that hides under its cute and cuddly guise a universe of absurd and amusing variables, in which every choice involves causes and effects that may only become apparent after a long time. The classic game for those who love building parallel worlds, personal anthills where failure can be as fun as triumph, as long as you're not that pirate turned organ bank.Well done, full of variables and virtually infinite, Rimworld is probably one of the best management roguelikes currently out there. Between desert colonies where people lock themselves in the fridge for stress, colonies of kittens, underground cities and tropical outposts ruled by pirates, it's hard to get bored. For a certain type of gamer, those who still play Dwarf Fortress could be the game of the century, but even if the genre is not yours, we recommend that you give it a look, even if the price might make you give up.", "date": "2016-07-23", "grade": null}
