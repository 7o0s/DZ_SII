A mission that is far from simple to complete, judging by the silhouette that stands out in front of the Kai Knight: the terrible tower of V'Taag, an impregnable fortress controlled by hordes of Giak, Drakkar, Gourgaz and Vordak, who at the if necessary, they can also call in packs of ravenous Doomwolves for help. These huge black wolves, equipped with deadly jaws, however, are not the only new threat in Joe Dever's Lone Wolf - The Dawn on V'Taag. In addition to the aforementioned General Zungar, in fact, we will also have to face several times a mirror version of the Lone Wolf himself, a shadow born from his fears and his resentment, which takes shape in a dreamlike dimension due to a spell that hovers between the tower rooms. All the ingredients needed for an ending with a bang; and after finishing the game we can safely say that we were not disappointed: the fourth act puts on the table exactly what was expected from the final part of this amazing mix of gamebook and RPG, therefore a large number of increasingly complex battles but, at the same time, a narrative capable of keeping interest alive, which puts us in the role of the hero and makes us experience his adventures, in a continuous contrast between human uncertainties and the ruthless effectiveness of the Kai discipline. Joe Dever's Lone Wolf: Dawn over V'Taag is the worthy conclusion of a saga of exceptional quality We are what we choose to be The character that we have carried forward in the previous acts, whether it is an elegant and shrewd swordsman, a fast and lethal ax master or a powerful expert in the use of iron maces, arrives at the appointment with The Dawn on V'Taag now mature, equipped with a complete repertoire of moves and an inventory that has no more secrets, which must be disposed of wisely between one area of the map and another, trying to recover the energy lost during the furious fights through the use of potions or the consumption of food, rest at a merchant's inn or a (risky) pause for meditation. The balance of difficulty developed by Forge Reply appears almost perfect, given that it takes into account the evolution of our warrior but does not trivialize it, neither in terms of physical characteristics nor in terms of equipment, which thanks to crafting we can repair or boost. We are therefore not in a situation of (unfair) adaptation to upgrades like that seen in some famous freemium titles, clearly devoted to monetization. After all, Joe Dever's Lone Wolf is a premium production, which has nothing to do with these logics and which must be purchased in individual acts or with the traditional season pass to save money. We were saying, the character we have forged is mature and in the same way the functioning of the choices we are called to make during the narrative is clear, as well as the mechanics that regulate the spectacular turn-based combat. The consistent degree of challenge of the clashes requires the adoption of specific strategies to conclude them victoriously, and conservative approaches often prove counterproductive. When you hit your opponents, therefore, you have to use your resources and concentrate your attacks on the most dangerous target to eliminate it quickly. Resorting to the Sword of the Sun and the Kai power is often the best solution to inflict the damage necessary to influence the fate of the duel, finishing the job with traditional maneuvers or throwing a few knives or darts. All notions learned during the first three acts and which we were able to put into practice in the freest and most devastating way possible in this final part, despite this incurring several game overs in the salient phases of the adventure. The experience is therefore confirmed as demanding, engaging and endowed with an uncommon depth among mobile games, as well as with an absolutely excellent technical sector, which perfectly captures the spirit of Joe Dever's work and delivers us sequences of great visual impact, accompanied by a perfectly themed (albeit, after four acts, a bit repetitive) soundtrack.", "date": "2014-11-20", "grade": "9.0"}
