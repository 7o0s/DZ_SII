A terrible curse or a gift from heaven? Probably the second, at least in this moment of difficulty for his village, which is invaded by monstrous creatures who kidnap the inhabitants. Will the little pig be able to save them? We'll find out by completing all the levels of the game, with more and more demanding challenges and a series of elements capable of adding depth to the experience. Gesundheit's control system! it works like that of an RTS, i.e. the character goes to the point on the map that we touch with a finger. You have to be very careful though: in each level there are one or more monsters that will try to devour us as soon as they notice our presence. Our little phlegm-shooting pig actually cannot defend itself, so being discovered in most cases translates into a game over, also due to a poor ~elasticity~ of the game to implement our indications. In short, to complete each stage, one must act astutely and plan movements well. Our phlegm, for example, attracts monsters (who are greedy for it) and can therefore allow us to make them move in the direction we want, especially if there is an even bigger monster in their path, capable of eating them in one bite. Ptuh! So how can we ~shoot~ our phlegm? In a very simple way: just touch the piggy on the touch screen and draw a line opposite to the direction in which we want to ~launch~. As if we were tending a slingshot, in practice, but complete with a reticle that assures us where exactly the green mucus will end up. It may happen that you make a mistake, hit a nearby obstacle and therefore smear your face with it yourself (a very funny skit), also due to collision management that is not always very punctual, but in principle the operation will prove to be effective every time that we will need it. As mentioned above, to complete a level, the monster or monsters must end up in the jaws of an even larger creature, and to obtain this result we will have to induce them to reach a certain point on the map, trying in the meantime to collect the stars scattered all over the place. inside the scenarios. The puzzles will gradually become more complex, and sometimes will require some experimentation before identifying the right strategy to solve them. Extra elements will be introduced such as teleportation gates or an upgrade in our ability to spit, all following a constant progression, without nasty surprises. A gameplay that is at the same time immediate but has a certain depth, in short, which however plays a secondary role with respect to the technical sector of this particular production. The music played on the recorder that immediately enters your head, but above all the beautiful hand-drawn graphics are the real strengths of Gesundheit!, which from this point of view stands as one of the most original games available on the App Store, a sort of nice fairy tale for children that really hits the mark with respect to what are its prerogatives.
