A concept practically impossible to explain to those who have never played tennis, difficult to grasp even if you have picked up a racket for a short time, yet very clear to anyone who plays this sport. Not magically it is the sum of various characteristics, namely the speed of the shot, its direction and its rotation. In short, if a shot by Nadal ~only~ bounces off half of your court, yet lands against you at shoulder height over the baseline, it will be heavier than a very fast, predictable flat forehand a la Berdych. Even if it's shorter and slower. And with this ~weight~, in fact, every tennis player has to deal with. Because a heavy ball to be rejected requires a different preparation time than a light one, a less marked arm opening, a more stable posture and better reflexes. In a word, timing. One thing that SEGA has understood very well: however arcade it is, however much its players dive and arrive at almost inhuman technical gestures, the weight of the ball, with all its consequences, in Virtua Tennis is very clear even to those who do not know what is it about. And it was quite clear even in Mario Tennis 64, before the successor hit the GameCube, before the invasion of super shots, absurd spins and substantially massless balls arrived. Mario yes, but also tennis Luckily Camelot must have realized the mistake, because in this new episode for 3DS it's back to playing tennis. There are three shots, the canonical flat shot, topspin and backspin - plus short ball and lob - and each one behaves as you would expect in reality. Above all, the loading time has returned to count a lot, that is the moment in which you start preparing the shot: the sooner you start opening your arm, the more effective your shot will be. No improvised super-finish as in the previous game: in short, if before to make a good shot it was enough to reach the ball and click twice on a button, now you have to prepare in advance, without necessarily re-pressing the button at the moment of impact, but taking into account the position of the sphere. As in reality. The players themselves are well differentiated: versatile Mario and Luigi, skilled Roger Federer, Isner-esque brawlers Wario and Bowser, Yoshi a Hewitt-style runner, Peach with an elegant touch a la Llodra, Boo and Baby Bowser - limited in their effects compared to the GameCube - of crazy jugglers like Dolgopolov, Waluigi, and here the only oddity, he is defined as a defender, but in reality, if guided by the CPU, he goes continuously into the net, the only hard and pure exponent of the serve&volley inserted in the roster. Big beach tennis The basic mechanics work very well, they represent a pleasant synthesis between realism and the inevitable Mariesca exaggeration, but their application is not as good as it could have been. Because, quite simply, the Camelot developers have put a lot of effort into getting everyone to play. Not only through the optional automatic movements (just lift the 3DS vertically, change the shot and the character moves by itself), but also by simplifying the various shots. If we said earlier that finally we need to take the ball into account when preparing shots, unfortunately we must also add that, at the cost of not making the game too difficult, finding the ideal position to hit is all too simple. If in Virtua Tennis it is difficult to make a perfect gesture, because you have to position yourself in the right place at the right time, with the consequent modulations of intensity of the conclusion, in Mario Tennis Open the ball is almost always hit well. Even worse: either you hit really badly - rarely - or you take it perfectly, and it is all too evident how the CPU automatically adjusts the position of the character to make it more suitable. The worst consequence of this simplification is that there are too many perfect shots, so few winners and rallies that are too long and elaborate. If exceptional hitting becomes the norm, then it ceases to be exceptional. And here the main paradox of Mario Tennis Open arises: to remedy this barrage of perfection, ~magic circles~ have been inserted, which allow, by impacting the ball inside them, to make even more powerful shots. Not super shots, because they are never irrecoverable conclusions, but only more effective than normal. And it would also be appreciated if it were declined sensibly based on what happens on the pitch: I kick the opponent off the pitch, a ~smashed~ circle appears near the net, it helps me close the point. Perfect! But that is rarely the case. Much more often the circles appear untidily, and - howyou will have understood - being linked to a single shot - there is the circle of super topspin, that of super short ball and so on - they force you to perform a certain action if you want to win the game. In addition to being frequently out of context, we point the finger at the super drop, the only ~magic circle~ that is not very credible due to the boomerang effect it gives to the ball: in short, rather than catalyzing the shot, it really transfigures it. Grand Slam There are eight tournaments to be faced, two circuits, one simple and the other difficult, both made up of four fields similar in characteristics to our slams: the slow terrain, the slow one with high rebound, the fast one and the fast one with low rebound. The traditional fields (earth, concrete, grass) are relegated to exhibitions, in the main mode you only encounter mariesco-themed stadiums, more or less full of imaginative infiltrations: from slippery frozen ground to elastic wood, up to shapeshifting fields with rebound delirious. Some variations are spot on and fun, but most make you regret the dear old land: to make everything more comical, the visibility of the ball is often sacrificed, so that the intelligibility of the game is compromised. The post-tournament prize collection is effective - rackets, clothes and gadgets to collect - their practical application is much less interesting, since they can only be used on your Mii, whose statistics, although indicative for the character's balance, cannot be compared to those of the main cast. Precisely the management of the Mii is the last remnant of the complex RPG mode that characterized the entire Mario Tennis portable series: although its exclusion has made more than one nose turn up, it is clear that this episode is the son of the home console versions, not those for Game Boy, an element that would have made it extremely difficult to insert a similar mode on 3DS as well. Of course, it would have been an added value, but Mario Tennis Open cannot be blamed for this lack. Still regarding the longevity of the title, completing all the tournaments is quite simple, but in general it is the level of difficulty that is badly calibrated: the difference between the penultimate stage and the last is abysmal. Suffice it to say that an experienced player can win every tournament without losing a single set, and then struggle to earn a single point in ~champion~ level performances. The multiplayer is great, and the online implementation, while spartan, is key. Technically it is a commendable work, visually as rendered it surpasses the GameCube version, also revealing itself to be more accurate in detail, in particular in the animations, more appropriate than in the predecessor (the characters' jumps while the game is stopped are an example).", "date": "2012-05-30", "grade": "7.0"}
