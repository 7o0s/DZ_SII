Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. The solitaire game is an indisputable classic, which also works very well in the digital version, especially when the developers don't limit themselves to reproducing the traditional mechanics but integrate them with some new ideas, whether they are bonuses, upgrades, obstacles or particular challenges . Two years ago we saw an excellent example of this, that Fairway Solitaire with which so many people still enjoy themselves today, which offers an interpretation of solitaire mixed with the game of golf, with an irresistible ~nemesis~ in its expressions of anger at every our victory. Today is the turn of Pyramid Solitaire Saga, the new freemium product by King that arrives on iOS and Android devices after having enjoyed great success in the form of an application on Facebook. The context in this case is the Egypt of the pyramids, which we will have to explore in the role of an adventuress who never separates from her trusty little mouse. The interface of the game is therefore themed, as well as the different areas that we will have to cross within the long single player campaign, as well as the objects that will appear from time to time on the board to block or make it more difficult to use certain cards. In reality, King's developers didn't dare that much, but above all they chose a sometimes limiting solitaire approach, very much based on luck and little on our strategic ability. Let's try to explain ourselves: during some stages we will be asked to eliminate the cards that are at the top of a pile, but the success or failure of the mission in this case will depend exclusively on what comes out of the pile. Overcoming some stages, therefore, will turn into the traditional sequence of trials and errors, waiting for the ~right time~ and possibly waiting for our lives to recharge, an operation necessary after a certain number of game overs, as happens in many other freemium productions . Pyramid Solitaire Saga is a light-hearted and interesting take on the classic solitaire game Draw your card Pyramid Solitaire Saga starts slowly, rather gradually, with the inevitable social integrations that show where our friends are on the board, what results they have achieved in the various levels and so on. The handful of gold bars initially available can be used, in small quantities, to unlock the new areas from time to time and therefore continue the adventure without having to dip into your wallet, which we never felt compelled to do during the hours we have dedicated to the game these days. In short, King's approach to the freemium model is confirmed as permissive, with some inevitable limitations (see the paid-only boosts) which, however, can be remedied simply with patience and perseverance, or by trying over and over again a mission that initially it seemed really difficult to complete successfully. Things get more complicated when the minimum requirements come into play, such as the obligation to make a combo of ten cards that includes a blue one, then finishing the table with the inevitable collection of gold cards, which determine the end of the internship. To our rescue, however, in addition to the classic jokers, we have a feature of a certain strategic value, namely the possibility of ~setting aside~ the current card in the deck to use it later, perhaps in the final stages of the game. The final result, pleasant but not that much both from the point of view of graphics and sound, in particular afflicted by some too many carelessness in the connections between one jingle and another or in the Italian translation, turns out to be pleasant and fun, but for the original value of solitaire rather than the way the developers interpreted it in this case.", "date": "2014-07-19", "grade": "7.0"}
