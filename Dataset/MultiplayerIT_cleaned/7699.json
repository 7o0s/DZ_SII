{"name": "Halo: Spartan Assault", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/121643-halo-spartan-assault-halo-in-miniatura.html", "text": "It is curious how the Halo series, after being born in prototype form on the PC, moved away from it by releasing only two conversions, including that porting disaster that was Halo 2. Microsoft attempted to exploit the notoriety of the title to spread Windows Vista, but the operation did not go exactly as planned. Yet many years later, in a certain sense the Redmond house intends to try again once again. Halo: Spartan Assault is in fact an exclusive product of Windows Phone and Windows 8, the only operating systems on which this spin-off can be played. The case is even more curious if we think how the game developed by 343 Industries and Vanguard Games (those of Gatling Gears) is not a new FPS, but a ~dual stick~ shooter, i.e. belonging to that particular type of shooter with a tall or isometric, as in this case, where we move our character with an analog and with the other we direct the shot by firing at the same time. The combination works fairly well, it must be admitted, but the product, although sold at a bargain price, has not completely convinced us. Expanded universe wanted The story of Halo: Spartan Assault unfolds over 25 levels, divided into five episodes, throwing us into some of the most important battles of the war against the Covenant. We will take on the role of two Spartans that we will lead in missions with rather diversified objectives. The cutscenes are of decent quality, but the plot is practically non-existent, reducing to a minimum the involvement that one could instead expect from a title based on the Halo universe. It's not that bad if you consider the lighter nature of the gaming experience offered by a product like Halo: Spartan Assault, but the opportunity could have been taken to tell some secondary plot or enrich the expanded universe with details dedicated to the more experienced fans as happened with Halo: Wars. Under the glittering shell of this spin-off we find an absolutely genre gameplay, albeit competently packaged. The game situations are not particularly brilliant but they do their duty by throwing the user against waves of Covenant to be killed by controlling your Spartan. Drawing heavily from the tradition of the series, we find pleasant diversions such as vehicles to drive and turrets to exploit. Even the arsenal proposes all the samples of the main episodes, offering a fair range of options. We find the now classic power-ups, such as the hologram to distract enemies rather than the energy shield where to take shelter and so on. We will obviously be able to steal weapons from the Covenant, for a decidedly varied and complete arsenal. A less superficial artificial intelligence than expected is noted, even if for obvious reasons the depth of the gameplay does not aspire to emulate the original first person shooters. If you manage to govern the control system, Halo: Spartan Assault will offer you good quality entertainment in short. When mouse and keyboard make you want a pad We mentioned the control system for a specific reason. Halo: Spartan Assault belongs to the ~dual stick~ shooter genre, as mentioned, yet Microsoft for some obscure reason decided not to include gamepad support. To control the Spartans, the combination of mouse and keyboard will be adopted, with the classic WASD keys dedicated to movements and a cursor to direct the shot. This tried and tested combination also works quite well, but it doesn't explain the absence of the option to play with the Xbox 360 controller and thus enjoy the title as one would expect. Apart from this detail that we hope will be corrected by a patch, Halo: Spartan Assault offers various elements aimed at enriching the gameplay, otherwise limited to overcoming 25 levels. In full tradition with the series, we find six Skulls that introduce modifiers to the game, allowing us to start a mission with one or two handicaps in order to acquire more experience points. These can be spent to buy additional equipment, going to customize the four available slots which include the two weapons, an active power-up and a passive enhancement. Unfortunately, even this feature manages to be ruined by poorly acceptable choices. In fact, it is in this context that the options linked to micro-transactions appear. Quite simply, only one item per category can be purchased with experience points, the rest of the equipment proposed in the customization menu must be bought with credits which, as you may have guessed, are obtained by spending real money. We are not talking about facilities dedicated to those who have no problems opening their wallets, butof objects totally closed to those who are not willing to shell out additional euros. This policy seems really bizarre to us when we consider that Halo: Spartan Assault is not a free game. The very low price does not justify such limiting in-game purchases for less wealthy users. Halo becomes a top-down shooter in this up-and-down spin-off Miniature Halos From a technical point of view it is difficult to complain something to the guys at Vanguard Games, who have been able to take classic settings and stylistic features of the Halo series and adapt them to the isometric view. The levels are both pleasant to look at and designed with a certain skill. We're not talking about groundbreaking design, but we're not talking about hurriedly made anonymous arenas either. In fact, there is no shortage of appreciable gameplay cues such as frequent shelters to hide behind to wait to recover the energy of the shield or alternative routes to be exploited to try to get around the enemy. The variety is also good, ranging between more or less all the major scenarios of the saga. The good effects don't tire the graphics engine in the least, always very fluid, but the opposite would have been strange. The same goes for the sound purchase, which re-proposes the well-known samplings and music directly taken from or inspired by the always splendid score of the first trilogy. The title is not particularly long-lived, given that the levels can each be completed in a few minutes, but the presence of Achievements, online rankings and various extras enrich an offer that is still satisfactory.", "date": "2013-07-30", "grade": "7.0"}
