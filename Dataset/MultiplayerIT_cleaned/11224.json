{"name": "de Blob", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/de-blob.html", "text": "Characterizing a video game, making it unique, giving it a precise identity through graphics is not easy nowadays. We need to resort to ideas and style, rather than mere technology: look for innovative solutions rather than photorealism, even and above all if we find ourselves working with systems that are anything but ~nextgen~. It's kind of what David Perry, historical game designer, seems to want to do with his new creature, de Blob. Developed exclusively for Nintendo DS and Wii, the game can use the peculiar characteristics of these two consoles to obtain spectacular results, beyond their technical capabilities. And thus a whole world of fantasy was created, in which the evil Inkts rule the law and force cities into a prison made of shades of gray, where colors are banned and plants wither. Our task is to start a real revolution, and to do so we will play the ~clothes~ of a squishy blob, a decidedly out of the ordinary creature, which can dye itself in many different colors and ~transmit~ them to everything it touches. The game is all about running and bouncing, with our blob slamming from one building to another and as he passes he transforms the scenery from gray to colorful, very colorful. The movies available so far have shown de Blob in its Wii version, characterized by very fluid graphics (although at the moment it seems to suffer from an annoying pop-up) and, above all, by a really nice and original style. The version that will run on the Nintendo DS has not yet been shown, and therefore we do not know whether or not it will be similar to the mobile reduction curated by THQ Wireless. The game, however, seems to maintain its prerogatives: within four large urban districts, each divided in turn into four districts, we will have to control a blob and color a series of buildings with the aim of totaling a certain score within a certain time limit. Our creature starts with a neutral color, and has to touch balls of paint to take on the hue, to then switch to anything it touches through single and multiple bounces, which color the buildings and revitalize the grass, plants and inhabitants of the room. city in dynamic and spectacular sequences. Each time we come into contact with a new ball of paint, we will be able to change hues as appropriate (if we are yellow and touch the red paint, we will become orange) and change the size of the blob through four different measures. If the objective of each stage is to score a certain score within a time limit (we will be able to check the progress of the mission via an indicator located at the bottom of the screen), it is also true that there will be numerous optional missions, which we will be able to access simply coming into contact with the icons that represent our guide character: sometimes it will be a question of participating in fast races between the buildings, sometimes of coloring the highlighted elements in a few seconds. We will also find special buildings, which can only be colored in the indicated way and with the blob of the right size, so to succeed in the enterprise we will have to not only find the right paint, but possibly use one of the many fountains to clean up and return to the starting size . We will be forced to follow the same procedure when we are attacked by the Inkts, who will dirty us in black forcing us to flee towards the water if we do not eliminate them at the right time: just press the 5 key when the relative indicator appears to jump on them and crush them, but the further you go, the more complicated it becomes because of the speeds you reach. The graphics of the game are a feast for the eyes: although the various city districts end up looking alike and don't boast who knows what level of detail, the coloring effect is done very well and does not detract from the dynamism of the action, which can also be enjoyed by smooth scrolling without slowdowns. Excellent colors, therefore, and excellent design in general. The action is accompanied by moderate quality MIDI music, with an independently adjustable volume, which however on some terminals can produce some slowdown and after a while ends up being very repetitive: turning it off won't be a bad idea. PRO Fast and colorful graphics Each stage is full of side missions Simple gameplay... AGAINST ...maybe even too much Anonymous sound The quality of the d-pad plays a major role", "date": "2008-09-03", "grade": "S.V."}
