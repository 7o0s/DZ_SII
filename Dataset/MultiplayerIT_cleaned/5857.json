This is proved by the fact that modern consoles allow you to capture snapshots of the screen with great ease and, increasingly, AAA games offer internal photographic modes complete with filters, effects and free camera management. There are also video games where taking photographs is the fulcrum of the gameplay, such as New Pokmon Snap by Nintendo or, to mention one among many, TOEM, one of the PS Plus Essential games of September 2022. Among the many themed products we now also find Penko Park, precisely in its Nintendo Switch version. Available since October 2020 on PC, Penko Park arrives today on Nintendo Switch, where he clearly hopes to find a new audience, after having convinced Steam enthusiasts. Here is our review of Penko Park. An abandoned park Our guide to Penko Park Penko Park is a long-abandoned animal park, home to over 140 strange, somewhat creepy, somewhat cute creatures. Born in 1952, the park has lost prestige following mysterious events. Now, we return to this forgotten place with our faithful Penko Snap-A-Lot 9000 ready to take lots of pictures of its particular residents. The adventure takes us to five different places, each characterized by its own creatures that live in the local ecosystem. We will have a forest, a volcanic area, an underwater area, a snowy area and more. Each level is a journey lasting a few minutes, full of interaction points that tell us details about the park and the creatures. Structurally, Pokmon Snap fans already have an idea of what to expect. Each linear path sees us advance automatically, taking pictures in all directions with the aim of getting a good shot of the creatures of Penko Park. The voting system is very simple and immediate: one to three stars are obtained immediately, without further numerical scores. Getting three stars is easy and just don't be too far away. However, the route is also full of other prizes, that is a series of objects and boxes, which reward with hats for our guide to wear. One of Penko Pak's creatures Initially we will only be able to take pictures, but as we get them we will earn points that will make us level up and unlock other routes and additional functions. One of them is a flower ball that can be thrown to interact with many types of Penko. In fact, each Penko does not have a single ~form~ or ~state~. A Penko usually stands there looking at us, but by throwing him a ball he could get angry or happy: the new emotion allows you to get a different shot. Understanding which ~states~ are still to be unlocked for each creature is very easy because simply by framing it we will be provided with a list with the number of stars obtained for each ~state~. We will then unlock the possibility of collecting collectibles, activating ~ghost~ areas where spiritual Penkos will appear, playing a flute (after discovering the right melodies) to interact with specific areas and Penkos and pulling levers to unlock additional areas. In fact, each level includes detours that allow us to reach a different section of the region. The volcanic biome of Penko Park Considering these elements, even if you have access to advanced areas, there is always the need to go back several times to the previous ones and retrace your steps to find not only the Penkos that have escaped at first glance but also those that were previously hidden by elements with whom we could not yet interact. You can't unlock all the new stuff with just one exploration of each area. The unlocking of all the basic components of the game takes about three or four hours, while for 100% you have to expect about six or seven hours. We are far from the times of completely more massive works like New Pokmon Snap, but obviously the price also goes hand in hand. Style and sound An angry Penko Park creature Penko Park cannot be compared to New Pokmon Snap even from a technical and stylistic point of view. Nintendo's game easily wins the hearts of fans of the saga with its valid 3D models of the various creatures of the generations created by Game Frek, while Penko Park has to rely only on the production resources of an indie. The environments are very basic and not particularly detailed. Creatures are nice on the other hand, if you like things a little crazy. You will find lemons with wings, singing shells, blobs of various kinds, a strange porpoise, piles of stonesre with eyes and things that we could not describe in any other way than as ~strange faces mounted on top of what we assume to be the body~. Don't expect particular consistency or too much attention to detail. The Penko Park photo and sticker collector Finally, Penko Park offers a pleasant soundtrack, which accompanies without disturbing the adventure. Many creatures then have their own verses, which are heard above all when we go to disturb them. The Switch conversion works well and the lack of the mouse is not a problem since the progression of the levels is not particularly rapid: in the advanced stages the possibility of stopping at any time and for as long as you want is also unlocked, therefore obtaining the perfect shot becomes simple even for those who have motor problems or simply not practical with the levers. However, the possibility of controlling the view with the gyroscope is missing: it is not always the most comfortable choice, but one more option would not have hurt.", "date": "2022-09-27", "grade": "8.0"}
