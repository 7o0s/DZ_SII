The non-linear ~mission~ game structure is very reminiscent of Rockstar's masterpiece, as is the dual possibility of moving around the city both on a vehicle and on foot, wandering through the city's aerial streets or visiting indoor locations. As regards the flight mode, the main autonomous means of transport is represented by nice and imaginative flying vehicles, while as regards walking, it is possible to take advantage of public transport such as the subway, which allows you to move from one district to another of Scrapland in moments. It is thus possible to create a real fleet of machines to be used in every situation When GTA meets Short Circuit Ships are fully customizable; in specialized workshops it will be possible to purchase and assemble new pieces that increase performance and firepower. It is thus possible to create a real fleet of machines to be used in every situation, exploiting the more aggressive characteristics of each individual car. The use of vehicles is very important for the purposes of the game missions, and often the races and bets to be overcome take place right on board the spaceships. Wandering through the busy airways of the city it is possible to come across power-ups and bonuses to be exploited to increase the life points of the car or the number of bullets and long-range missiles. The management of weapons is taken care of, and it is possible to improve the efficiency of the vehicle's guns by preparing upgrades that improve, for example, the automatic aiming speed or the firing speed. During the aerial combats, a good dose of strategy is also required as we are called to keep an eye on parameters such as the level of overheating of the weapons which can leave us defenseless right at the most beautiful moment. By frequenting the most infamous clubs of Scrapland it will then be possible to hire mercenaries who for a discreet sum will lend their defense and collaboration services during combat missions, while causing many problems in those situations in which the scarcity of power-ups will lead them to compete with the player to grab the precious items. Many clothes The action in Scrapland is not the exclusive prerogative of air battles, in fact many headaches await poor D-Tritus even inside the buildings. One of the most appreciable features of the game is the possibility of assuming the appearance of 15 different automatons with really interesting properties, copying their appearance and features through the terminals of the ~Great Database~, a sort of container of the ~souls~ of all the robots of Scrapland. To complete the missions it will in fact be necessary to take on the appearance of another robot to access otherwise unreachable areas, or to take advantage of its unique characteristics and special shots, very useful in many circumstances. The appearance of the individual druids is truly varied and goes from the clumsy structure of the policemen, with an imposing body supported by tiny little legs, up to more bizarre solutions such as those of the small spy robos able to fly in any direction. Obviously every advantage has a price to pay, and for D-Tritus to take on the appearance of another robot means trying in every way not to submit to the attentive gaze of the Scrapland police, ready to recognize the exchange of personalities after a few moments and to reciprocate it with a good dose of laser beams and machine gun rounds. In the third person mode, the game takes on the typical outlines of the action game, at times assuming stealth characteristics a la Metal Gear Solid (if you allow me for once a slightly blasphemous comparison). Some missions require you to move secretly around a map, to gather information or take pictures on behalf of the newspaper; in these situations, to escape from the watchful eyes of the policemen and flying cameras, we will have to rely on the radar which will constantly keep us updated on the position of hostile robots and the relative orientation of the visual field, represented by the characteristic triangular segment. A second indicator will then show the degree of attention of the enemy until the alarm is triggered which will definitively attract the attention of all the robots located nearby who will begin to point to D-Tritus to facilitate its capture by the police. The mixture of actions carried out inside the buildings and in the open air is successful and homogeneous, capable of creating an engaging continuity, without abrupt cuts and jumps in the plot. It is often requestedthe player to move from one location to another and at the same time to deal with the headaches related to air transport in particularly ~hot~ areas. The structure of the missions is quite varied, and allows the player to experience a considerable number of different and complex situations. All in all In an overview, the gameplay appears captivating, albeit devoid of revolutionary innovations capable of making people cry out for a miracle. It is clear that the stubborn fusion of an aggressive ~GTA-style~ genre with a captivating and irreverent setting still gives Scrapland the peculiarity of arousing even the most critical and shrewd eye a truly precious source of curiosity. As regards the construction of the plot and above all the creation and characterization of the characters, we can say that we are faced with a small masterpiece of refined and sagacious satire: the scene of the murder of the archbishop, in the early stages of the game, it is really tasty and the richness of the details makes it even more satisfying. Details that recur in every nuance like a happy motif indicating the degree of quality that this production in any case achieves. The creation of the character models, like that of the script and direct direction like that of a real animated film are all really positive components that substantially influence the overall caliber of the game. Longevity increased by a multiplayer mode that focuses the attention of players (up to 16 at the same time) on the most lively aspect of the game, the one related to combat and speed races with fully modifiable futuristic vehicles. The graphics sector is not affected by noteworthy heaviness, and even on a medium power configuration, with all settings at maximum, the game appeared fluid. we can say, we are faced with a small masterpiece of refined and shrewd satire All in all The use of textures that are not too complex, but at the same time pleasant, and the richness of the play of light, the complexity of the structures and models of the characters give Scrapland the typical aspect of animated films which for some years now are depopulated in cinemas around the world. The localization of the title is limited to the subtitles, but the English dubbing gives a good idea of the atmosphere that is being experienced, giving the characters an appreciable depth. Comment Overall Scrapland did not disappoint expectations proving to be a title of thickness, while not abandoning the more sarcastic and irreverent tones. It's not the usual American McGee, there's no blood, no violence (explicit, even if some situations are clever satirical transpositions, really appreciable), no bloodthirsty girls. Scrapland is not hallucinatory, but fun and light-hearted, a concentration of really cool fun and variety, and we are sure that D-Tritus will enter the hearts of many players. Recommended for everyone, no special requirements. Just the desire to have fun, with style. Pros: Varied and satisfying graphics, never heavy Engrossing and fun plot Varied gameplay Cons: At times too ~arcade~ The darker shades of the plot tend to clash with the overall ~carefree~ aspect of the game Not your usual McGee Scrapland is the latest product of the brilliant mind of American McGee, a well-known face in the videogame world and dear to all those who love dark themes, with decidedly gothic traits, typical of his most well-known productions (Alice in primis, ending with the brand new project ~Oz~ which provides a horror-tinged remake, this time in a cinematic version, of the story of the Wizard of Oz). Yet the title in question has nothing to do with the grotesque world so dear to the screenwriter of McGee, but if anything it totally entrusts its potential to the genius of a mind capable of creating situations at the antipodes, but equally engaging. Taking on the role of a friendly android called D-Tritus, the player is called to experience a witty and captivating adventure on the edge of the galaxy, among robots and colorful spaceships, darting through the streets suspended in the void in an immense and extremely futuristic city. dump. Scrapland is a real space dump where automatons deprived of any prospect of a dignified life have decided to rebuild their independence away from the abuses of hated human beings. While purged of the unwelcome presence of humans, Scrapland society suffers from all the typical deviations and malevolent forms of corruption attributable to man. As in a sort of hyper-technological Far West in Scrapland the various factions of robots share power as best they can, creating no pochi problems with public peace. The police are corrupt and disorderly, the economic power is in the hands of a self-styled organization of robotic bankers capable of controlling not only money but also all forms of information, while the robo-priests, under the orders of the archbishop, try to keep apparent dignity by preaching peace and serenity among robots. In the general chaos poor D-Tritus, unemployed and in constant search of a source of income that is as honest as possible, but above all profitable, has to get by to stay afloat in this chaotic situation. Having arrived at the city registry for registration, and having received the first instructions on the laws of the city, he was entrusted with a job, from which moment he will be a photo reporter for the colony's newspaper. But the ways of earning money in Scrapland are numerous and very twisted; D-Tritus will soon discover that taking pictures for the newspaper is not the only opportunity offered by the square and will soon make the acquaintance of clandestine gambling dens, illegal betting rounds, shootings and speed races aboard spaceships.", "date": "2005-02-10", "grade": null}
