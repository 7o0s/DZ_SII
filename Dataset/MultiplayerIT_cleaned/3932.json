{"name": "This War of Mine per Nintendo Switch", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/this-war-of-mine-nintendo-switch-recensione.html", "text": "This War of Mine: Complete Edition marks the dutiful debut of the 11 bit studios survival game on Nintendo Switch, with an edition that includes not only the base game in its most updated version, but also DLCs that add further, dramatic stories to the experience. For those who don't know this title yet, a brief introduction is needed. Imagine suddenly finding yourself in a war scenario, with the city you live in being besieged by a hostile army, forcing you and your family to hole up in your house waiting for it all to be over. After a few days of indiscriminate bombings and assaults, the streets become the most dangerous place to be during the day, at the mercy of snipers hidden on the roofs, and you therefore have to go out at night in search of food, objects and medicines. The watchword is ~resist~, but amidst a thousand difficulties the situation can become really complicated, and in situations like this, looters and criminals willing to do anything to get a meal emerge among the survivors. This is exactly the formula on which the gameplay of This War of Mine rests, acclaimed at launch on PC and brought a year later also to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One with the contents of The Little Ones expansion, which adds the further challenge of having to look after children during the siege, trying to feed them and take care of them to the best of our ability. Gameplay This War of Mine is a survival game born with mouse and keyboard controls in mind, so even on Nintendo Switch the adaptation made by 11 bit studios is a bit cumbersome at first and, in general, can give rise to some inconvenience for via context menus to be selected using the d-pad. Fortunately, it is possible to switch from one character to another by using the back buttons and thus let one of the survivors take care of digging, for example, to eliminate a pile of rubble that is blocking his way, while another perhaps dedicates himself to preparing a hot meal and yet another takes advantage of the few hours available to sleep. The gameplay is divided into two distinct phases: day and night. The group of survivors that we will have the task of managing finds itself in an unknown building, to be explored thoroughly during the first moments to collect all possible resources and kick off a crafting phase that can deliver us useful objects such as chairs, the already mentioned bed, stoves, tools of various kinds and specialized workbenches for the creation of tools, weapons, water filters and so on. The daytime hours are therefore spent in preparation for what will happen at night, when one of our characters will have to go out in search of food, medicines and materials, going to one of the locations that will gradually appear on the map, for a total of twenty-four different scenarios . There are indications that prepare for the possible presence of potentially dangerous people within these places, people with whom it is better not to deal, or the possibility of exchanging with other survivors. Often we are faced with moral choices, such as whether or not to steal food from an elderly couple holed up in their home, or help a woman threatened by an armed man. In these situations, you can switch to combat mode by pressing down on the d-pad, but this should only be done when we have a weapon and the situation appears favourable: if our character is killed, we will not be able to recover it and the group will therefore lose a member. Aspects such as the noisiness of footsteps, presence control and the possibility of hiding in the dark underline a very concrete and ruthless stealth component, which aims at realism and which therefore should not be abused, unless you want to run big risks . Returning to the refuge by five in the morning (under penalty of running into further danger along the way), we will be able to use the collected objects to build something useful, deliver food to the hungriest characters, or treat the injured or sick ones, trying to do so that certain situations do not get worse by compromising progression. Sometimes someone will come knocking on our door to offer exchanges, or in search of help for dangerous missions, or even to ask to be welcomed: what we decide will substantially influence the progress of the adventure, in a difficult balance between morality and survival spirit. Will we be able to resist until the end? Structure and technique From the This War of Mine: Complete Edition home screen, you can access classic mode or Stories, the series of DLCs currently in publicaction, currently present only with the first episode, The Promise of a Father: the other two will be added later. We played this short expansion first, which highlights the formula conceived by the authors to tell new stories set in the same scenario as the game, in this specific case the story of a father determined to save his sick little daughter. Structurally, the experience is the same as always, but from a narrative point of view, the events unfold as we explore new locations, in order to collect clues useful for finding the girl before it's too late. Switching instead to the classic mode, it is possible to choose between the ~Survive~ option, which allows you to select a group of survivors from five different teams (two of which are initially blocked) and then randomly generate the map, the events, the difficulty and the duration of the siege; or access the ~My Story~ option and create a custom game by changing the characters, the number of days, the severity of the conflict, the seasons and the locations. We are therefore talking about a respectable set of contents, while remaining in the wake of the system packaged by 11 bit studios, with its edges and its ingenuity which however take a back seat to the atmospheres. A full-bodied, engaging, often harsh and ruthless experience, which is assisted by a technical sector characterized by an original ~designed~, monochromatic style, which on Nintendo Switch performs very well in docked mode but reveals a little too much aliasing when play on the go. However, the loadings are rapid, which is very important, and the musical accompaniment helps to create that sense of sadness and resignation so associated with this production.", "date": "2018-11-26", "grade": "7.4"}
