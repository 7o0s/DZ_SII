{"name": "Secret Agent Clank - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/secret-agent-clank-recensione.html", "text": "Ratchet & Clank: Weapons of Destruction was the very welcome return in style of a series that is perhaps not particularly well known but of considerable value, demonstrated right from the first episode for PlayStation 2 which in 2002 received excellent critical and public success, reinvigorating a genre, the platform, decidedly little represented on the second Sony console, and enriching it with humor and videogame influences. Among other things, defining the series ~platform~ is absolutely reductive considering the variety and depth of the experience, always topped off with well-characterized characters and simple but not trivial plots. Ratchet is a sort of inventor and adventurer, Clank his pedantic robotic sidekick: around them gravitates a universe of extremely funny creatures that offer moments of sincere fun. And in this new episode for PSP, humor still reigns supreme, thanks to the protagonist, a Clank in the brand new guise of a secret agent who will have to shed light on a theft apparently perpetrated by his friend Ratchet himself... Spies, galactic heroes and convicts Secret Agent Clank is actually a cauldron in which the main ingredient is certainly the robotic protagonist, but that's not all: during the adventure the player will also play the role of Ratchet and Captain Quark. However, the main phases of the game are dedicated to Clank, as can be understood from the certainly more complex and original mechanics. From the very first stage, the approach of the player who impersonates the robot will have to be particularly ~stealth~, so forget kamikaze attacks by holding futuristic firearms: it will be important to keep out of the enemies' field of vision, wait patiently for the lights and cameras to move, blend in with furnishings in pure Solid Snake style. It is in fact possible to attack every guard or enemy you meet, but the achievement of an objective with the discretion of a secret agent as well as being more satisfying is also well paid, with the classic bolts whose function will already be clear to anyone who has played at least one episode of the series: upgrades of weapons and various gadgets, which also in Secret Agent Clank are not lacking and indeed stand out for their originality, as well as new special attacks relating to the Clank-Fu martial art. However this portion of the game with Clank as the protagonist, which then leads straight to the classic final confrontation with the architect of our misfortunes, instead of raising its difficulty curve by requiring greater cunning and precision on the part of the player, instead seems to align with the much more caciarone spirit than the other episodes of the series: although the game remains fun until the end, the return to more classic schemes, however tested, is welcomed with a touch of bitterness, despite the numerous stages that require slightly more particular skills, mixing shoot'em-up, rhytm-game, racing-game and other game styles, however well blended and never forced. ... the achievement of a goal with the discretion of a secret agent as well as being more satisfying is also well paid ... Spies, galactic heroes and convicts As already mentioned, Clank is not the only one to face a thousand vicissitudes in this adventure: some amusing interlude stages are in fact dedicated to Ratchet and Quark. In these cases the game mechanics are certainly less inspired and much more conventional, with the sole purpose of destroying every hostile element in the environment, but both offer a frenetic interlude entertainment, especially the Quark missions, extremely amusing and in line with the ridiculous character created by Insomniac, who will involve us in some of his fictitious intergalactic adventures, introduced and commented by his theatrical exaggeration. The stages in which we will take control of Ratchet are certainly the most boring and repetitive, synthesized in large rooms in which dozens of enemies will fall to be destroyed using a generous arsenal of weapons, many of which come directly from the previous episodes. Final thoughts... As in the case of the previous Ratchet & Clank: Height Doesn't Matter for PSP (and PlayStation 2) also Secret Agent Clank does not directly boast the signature of the Insomniac team. In fact, the development of the game has once again been entrusted to High Impact Games which, taking advantage of the criticisms reserved for the previous PSP software, has guaranteed us this time a truly excellent three-dimensional engine, whose only defect is perhaps the impossibility of rotating the camera in any direction at will. The rest is decidedly well cared for, although the textures of the various locations are perhaps a little poor in detail, the same cannot be said of the excellent polygonal models of protagonists and enemies, detailedi and full of very personal animations. The action remains fluid even in the most chaotic sequences, and the various non-interactive sequences with which the story is told deserve particular praise. Compared to L'Altezza non Conta, moreover, the improvements have not only been graphic, but also sound: the dubbing remains of high quality and entirely in Italian, but the music has undergone a marked improvement, now resulting even more catchy and pleasant. Comment The second portable adventure of the most bizarre couple in the PlayStation toy library is a really excellent synthesis of the best features of the Ratchet & Clank series: humour, varied and always fun gameplay, lots of action and an infinite number of weapons and gadgets. Compared to the prequel, decisive progress has also been made from a technical point of view, and Secret Agent Clank is certainly one of the most remarkable products made for the Sony handheld. The adventure will keep the player busy for about fifteen hours, but as per tradition there are countless goodies to unlock and secrets to discover, as well as an additional level of difficulty: truly an unmissable product for fans of Ratchet and his sidekick Clank. Pros Great variety of game and situations Very good technical aspect Well calibrated difficulty and lots of extras to unlock Cons Ratchet's stages are boring Some problems with the camera The main missions lose originality in the second half of the game", "date": "2008-07-07", "grade": null}
