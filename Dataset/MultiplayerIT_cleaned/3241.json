The new edition, inevitable, introduces new content, extra missions and new characters to further enrich an already impressive roster, which has over 170 fighters from the various Dynasty Warriors, Samurai Warriors, Orochi Warriors and more. In fact, figures such as Ryu Hayabusa, protagonist of the Ninja Gaiden series and presence fixed in the fighting game Dead or Alive; Joan of Arc, who appeared several years ago in Bladestorm: The 100 Years War; Achilles, protagonist of the spin-off Warriors: Legends of Troy; and then again Gaia, Hades, Yang Jian and Perseus, the latter at the center of an additional campaign that fits between the original chapters of Warriors Orochi 4, also adding secondary missions and a new ending. The news If you have already played with the base episode, Warriors Orochi 4 Ultimate will reward you with a nice package of resources, very useful for further enhancing the characters you usually use in the party and thus face the new challenges of this edition with more peace of mind .As mentioned, the main contents revolve around the original campaign, adding new interesting but not essential chapters, however pleasant for those who still have a great passion for the Musou. This despite the well-known refractoriness of these productions to renew themselves both on a structural level and on that of gameplay, even if it must be said that the attempt to transform everything into an open world with Dynasty Warriors 9 has not been successful in the slightest. In short, we are talking about superfluous extras if you feel by now that you have ~already given~, even considering a price for the upgrade alone that is not exactly cheap: a good 39.99 euros on the PlayStation Store, where the complete package is sold at an also exaggerated figure , all in all, of 69.99 euros. Fortunately, the unpublished contents are not limited to the new characters and additional missions, but also see the presence of unpublished challenges in the Challenge Mode, some modified mechanics and an interesting mode called Infinity Mode, in which we will have to overcome twelve towers created by Zeus to win his throne on top of Olympus where, as is known, there is a magical city. The experience is quite chaotic, there are timers to respect for the completion of the various ~plans~, a large amount of loot to collect but also and above all an independent progression system, parallel to the campaign, which will therefore force us to unlock the various protagonists again. Playstation 4 trophies Warriors Orochi 4 Ultimate's fifty-three Trophies can be obtained by completing the various chapters of the campaign, defeating huge numbers of standard and official enemies, upgrading weapons and perfecting the bond with them, as well as performing particular actions, such as completing a mission without suffering any damage. Gameplay, structure and technical realization Being Warriors Orochi 4 Ultimate a simple extended edition, the basic experience of the Omega Force title remains almost completely unchanged, presenting itself with the classic Musou formula: you arrive inside a map besieged by enemies and from time to time points of interest are highlighted which must be reached in order to free the area from the adversaries, especially the commanders. The degree of repetitiveness of the action is very high, even if everything possible has been done to stem it: you can switch character to another (limited to the selected trio, however), there is an upgrade system for weapons and fighters between one assignment and another, and finally the repertoire of combos and special moves appears quite rich, which allows at least change the type of attack used to defeat enemies. Of course, at the intermediate difficulty level everything is so trivial that in the end completing the missions turns out to be a mere matter of time. From a technical point of view, no improvements have been made compared to the original edition - on PS4 Pro the game generally runs well, using an unlocked frame-rate which however is often subject to uncertainty. However, the amount of enemies on the screen is enormous, we are talking about hundreds of polygonal models that move at the same time, and the traditional pop-up effect that used to plague the series is substantially reduced. Of course, this is not a visually splendid game: the scenarios are dull and empty, sometimes dark and ~dirty~, and serve as a simple background to the action. The audio commentary is adequateato, with some very good music, but the Japanese dialogues are a bit too thick in the middle of the gameplay and it is impossible to follow them: yet another drawback of a plot with great potential which however is lost in excessive and useless verbiage.", "date": "2020-02-16", "grade": "7.0"}
