{"name": "Crusty Demons", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/crusty-demons.html", "text": "The game mechanics of CD are very simple: aboard your motorcycle or other vehicles included in the game (about 30 models) you have to perform spectacular moves in huge and totally interactive settings, trying to inflict as much damage as possible on yourself, your opponents and pedestrians, creating spectacular accidents and breaking every record. The peculiarity of this title is in fact that of obtaining better evaluations the more you break your bones! This is, according to the editor's memory, the first game in which to win you also have to get hurt. Just start a stage, direct the vehicle towards an objective (a trampoline, a wall, a person, etc) and press the Triangle or Circle button at the right moment to obtain a spectacular movement and the relative score, or to put it underneath. But the absurdity is that if you want to earn more points, by pressing L2 you can let go of the vehicle and throw yourself against a wall or on the ground. Crusty Demons boasts a fair number of gameplay options, both single and multiplayer. But the focus of the title remains substantially two, the ~story mode~ and the ~devil rush mode~. The first sees the Crusty Demons team travel the world in an attempt to redeem their souls through increasingly violent spectacles. This mode appears to be the most interesting of all, as it is possible to move more or less freely from mission to mission. By talking to some of the characters you meet around you can get challenges that the Devil himself wants you to complete to repay you, once completed at best, with a certain score. In these situations, in addition to the canonical motorcycles, you can also use other motor vehicles, such as mini pimp cars, buggies and even the ice cream truck. The other mode, ~devil rush~, is ~set~ in the same scenarios as the ~story mode~, but changes in terms of the exhibitionistic aspect. Not only in this session you can only use the bikes, but you will have to perform as many reckless actions as possible or reach a certain goal, within a certain time limit. In some respects it is somewhat reminiscent of Tony Hawk's classic mode: there is a checklist of things to do and two minutes to execute or complete them. Conclusions Crusty Demons is one of the strangest games ever: while on the one hand it boasts an all in all discreet technical realization, on the other hand the gameplay is not free from imperfections. Furthermore, the concept behind the title appears quite unusual, the idea of reckless ~freestyle~ performances is not new, but that of smashing against the walls yes, and at times even fun but boring in the long run. So if you like titles of the genre but with the addition of this strange variant, then CD is the game for you, otherwise stay away. Pros: Fun when played with friends. Fairly long-lived. Good multiplayer. Cons: Long monotonous when played single. Gameplay not great. A title dedicated to reckless stuntmen: this is the summary of the game concept expressed by Koch Media in its Crusty Demons. Inspired by the spectacular performances of the eponymous team of daredevil bikers Seth Enslow, Jeremy Twitch Stemberg, Ronnie Faisst, Kenny The Cowboy Bartram and Dan Pastor, in Crusty Demons violence, madness, extreme sport and freedom of action, blend in a mix of instant fun and no frills. At least for fans of the genre. But let's go in order. First of all, let's better explain who these acrobats are and what their shows consist of. The Crusty Demons of Dirt, as mentioned above, are a freestyle ~gang of bikers~ who travel around the world performing daring stunts while driving motorized vehicles. During exhibitions these individuals are used to performing incredible feats, such as crashing on purpose into a row of parked cars or burning bins. In the game, the elements that make up the group sign a pact with the devil who offers them immortality in exchange for their souls. From that moment on, the aforementioned bikers obtain the ability to collide and destroy each other as many times as they wish without fatal consequences. Subsequently however, the CDs reconsider and, to avoid spending eternity in the company of the Prince of Darkness, they agree to participate and try to win the ~damnation game~ which will allow them to atone for their sins and purify their souls ( sigh!)", "date": "2006-12-28", "grade": null}
