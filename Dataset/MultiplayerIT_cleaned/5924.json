However, there are more and more titles that deserve to be played on smartphones both for artistic and design values, with the latter often simplified compared to the great productions of our times, but no less intriguing and satisfying for this. If there's a software house that has managed to make a name for itself in the mobile development environment, it's definitely Bad Seed, a small company founded a few years ago by a handful of courageous industry veterans who, with their previous works (Sheep Up first and the more recent Sleep Attack) has achieved considerable success in terms of audiences and critics above all for the ability to combine refined game mechanics with a visual style that is always colorful and extremely pleasant. In addition, something not to forget, Bad Seed has Italian birth and soul, and right in the Milan studio The Beggar's Ride took shape, a two-dimensional platform seasoned with interesting puzzles already available for iOS and in the pipeline on Android. The very Italian Bad Seed scores once again with The Beggar's Ride The Wonder Mask The title developed by Bad Seed puts us in the shoes of a nice old man of whom we know practically nothing, except that after finding a mysterious mask he was catapulted into a parallel world, from which he is desperately looking for a way out. The Beggar's Ride is a successful mix between two-dimensional platform and puzzle game in which the succession of runs and jumps in levels scattered with traps, enemies, ravines, handholds and suspended platforms alternates with the resolution of environmental puzzles that are always stimulating and never excessively banal, the whose overcoming revolves around the use of the aforementioned mask and all the powers contained therein. Being of divine origin, we will be able to use it to control the sky and the earth, as well as the rain and even the planets, alternating day and night. By holding your finger down for a few seconds on our virtual alter ego, this will wear the mask and the scenario will change completely turning yellow and highlighting the interaction points useful for solving the puzzle and moving on to the next scenario. For example, we can superimpose several clouds to generate a downpour, or rotate the image on the screen with two fingers to tilt the setting and move some boulders placed in our path, all apparently very simple situations that will require a certain amount of concentration when the various powers will have to be combined with each other. The most complex skills to use are those concerning the management of the sun and the moon, essential for accessing the more advanced stages of the game. However, there will be a good number of enemies to scatter the various levels, all quite insidious given that the protagonist is not at all accustomed to fighting, but rather to using intelligence to face every situation. Moving between platforms with the right timing, dodging blows and bullets will be necessary actions to reach the end of the level since a single blow is enough to knock us out and decree the game over. In this sense, it should be emphasized that the checkpoints are frequent with almost instantaneous loading, facilitating the repetition of the sections and consequently partially dampening that sense of frustration that could peep out in the more complex sections. It took us a good three hours to complete the title, however leaving a good number of gold coins on the road, usually located in platforms and secondary sections that require a good deal of patience and timing to be completed. Platforms and puzzles What is beautiful about The Beggar's Ride is that it unwinds like a continuum, an adventure that will accompany us in the exploration of a parallel world without the canonical division into levels, leading us to face a story centered on loneliness, hope and courage of its protagonist, but which will also have interesting repercussions on the same God who created the mask and will not fail to leave room for some reflections for the more sensitive players. Beyond the introductory movie and sporadic cutscenes, the most important facts are narrated by a voiceover while some text lines will appear on the screen aimed above all at giving some clues to help solve the puzzles. In both cases, Italian is among the selectable languages. One of the major criticalities of the Bad Seed title lies in the system of csometimes inaccurate control, present in a double guise that can be interchanged at will from the settings menu: the first is based on touch and the second on a virtual stick that appears on the screen in correspondence with the positioning of the fingers. We much preferred the latter over the touch system as it is much more practical and effective in more complex passages, where a minimal positioning error or a delay in the jump can lead us to fall into the void or get hit by an enemy. In addition, the commands are not fixed on the screen but appear in correspondence with the pressure of the fingers, with the eight-way analog on the left and the jump button on the right, a very convenient solution especially with the small screens of the iPhone 5 and 5s and in all those typical portable device situations where you don't always have the opportunity to sit comfortably and play in peace. With the touch system, however, by touching a point on the ground or a platform, the old protagonist will move in that direction and to make him jump we should touch a point above his head. Apparently it is a more intuitive and precise system, but in case of leaps on platforms or holds in succession you risk making mistakes much more easily, especially due to the difficulty of giving the command to jump with the right timing. On the technical front, The Beggar's Ride defends itself well, thanks to a very colorful, simple but impactful cartoon graphic style accompanied by an excellent soundtrack that goes well with the dreamlike atmosphere of the title.", "date": "2015-11-02", "grade": "8.3"}
