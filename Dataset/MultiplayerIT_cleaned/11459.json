Speaking limited to the single-player campaign, the plot crafted by Ubisoft's creatives leaves a lot to be desired: except for a small unexpected turn in the unraveling of the plot, everything that will happen will be absolutely linear and will follow the usual stereotypes of the threat of the world and you as the only salvation for the Earth; moreover, unlike what happened in the first chapter, the feeling you will have will be that of being thrown from one mission to another without a precise common thread and sometimes you will have to work with your imagination to fill the narrative gaps. Enemies IQ The displeasure for the lack of a solid plot is unfortunately not balanced by significantly new game mechanics: in the first Vegas you found yourself, essentially, constantly breaking into a room, eliminating the first threats thanks to the surprise and then, with a rather amusing tactical work, coordinate your team to go around the enemy's positions, jumping from one cover to another, until you reach an advantageous position and win the battle. In Vegas 2, you'll do exactly the same thing, but this time with significantly crappy AI: it's hard enough to mess up something good you've created in an attempt to improve it, but the developers have succeeded. More than once your enemies will remain in the open to take your blows, limiting themselves to leaning out of their cover at regular intervals: all you have to do is stay calm behind your cover, wait for them to show a part of their body and shoot. Even the most intriguing and spectacular aspects of the special forces, which they exalted so much in the first chapter (such as breaking in from a rope through a glass), here it sounds a lot, too much like heated soup and the deficient artificial intelligence does not allow seasoning the all with the thrill of the challenge. Towards the ascent Probably the veterans of the first chapter will be disappointed by the potential lost by the single player of Vegas 2, because between permanent statistics, penetrability of the surfaces (finally the blows pierce the vases) and other little goodies, something equal to the predecessor could have been achieved, if not even higher. But the unexpected fortune of Rainbow Six: Vegas came from the multiplayer aspect, to which the developers have paid a lot of their attention: first of all, you can replay the entire single player campaign with a friend of yours, making the game much more intriguing. gaming experience, even if the problem of shameful artificial intelligence remains. The real spearhead, which saves Vegas 2 from ruinous political sufficiency, are the online game mechanics: imagine replacing bots with flesh-and-blood players, imagine being able to talk to your teammates and organize raids and tactics of circumvention in real time, imagine coordinating the irruption into a room asking one of your friends to launch a flashbang and the other to eliminate a specific opponent: Vegas, already in the first, but especially in this second, will offer truly unforgettable multiplayer sessions, which alone are worth the purchase of this title. The human mind Comment We expected more from Vegas 2: leaving aside the gross programming errors, which now afflict many of the cross-platform titles on our PCs, this second chapter presents a truly disappointing single-player mode, either for the obvious plot, or for the intelligence artificial undertone. The game is saved only thanks to the multiplayer, where the developers have preferred to concentrate their efforts, to ensure many hours of fun and reward the most assiduous players with permanent statistics. Buy it only if you intend toend up online, otherwise think seriously about a return to the first Vegas, superior in plot and AI by several hands to its successor. Pros Exciting multiplayer The charm of Special Forces Cons Graphically fluctuating Single player disappointing A few too many bugs Rainbow Six: Vegas 2 is available for PC, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360. The tested version is the one for PC. The art of the Bug Vegas 2 is not free from defects: one of the main problems, in addition to poor performance with version 1.0 on dual core processors, is given by the frequent memory leaks affecting the game executable. This wouldn't be a big problem, but just annoying, a pity that at each crash the program generates a log (called error.log), which quickly reaches dimensions close to a single GB and, if the user is particularly inattentive, can even reach consume a lot of space on your hard drive. Add some instabilities and some graphical glitches to realize the bad optimization work of Ubisoft. PC - System Requirements Vegas 2 showed a rather solid framerate for almost all of the game, dropping below 15 frames per second only in some overcrowded environments: however, it must be said that, for the quality of the graphics, a slightly better job could be expected Minimum Requirements Processor: Pentium 4 2.0 GHz or AMD 2200+ RAM: 512 MB Video Card: Direct 3D compatible with 64 MB Disk Space: 6 GB Recommended Requirements Processor: Pentium 4 3.0 GHz or AMD 3000+ RAM: 1 GB Video Card : Direct 3D Compatible with 128 MB Test Configuration Processor: Intel Core Duo E6700 @ 2.7 GHz RAM: 2 GB Video Card: NVIDIA 8800 GTX Operating System: Windows Vista Ultimate There is talk of a job shortage, but the special forces sector seems unaffected by this problem and Las Vegas is once again threatened by a dangerous terrorist organization. This time, you won't take on the role of Logan Keller, but the first interesting innovation that Vegas 2 introduces is the ability to customize your alter-ego, which will accompany you throughout the single player campaign and in multiplayer matches. Note that this is not a simply aesthetic element: by blasphemy, we could say that Ubisoft wanted to integrate the game mechanics with RPG elements, allowing you to modify the equipment, the uniform and a whole series of accessories (handbags, watches and bracelets) of your character, going to affect the ability to move, effectiveness in combat and so on. The atrocious dilemma will therefore be that of preferring an armored soldier like a tank, but with the agility of a bedside table, or a graceful gazelle, but as fragile as a crystal vase.", "date": "2008-04-24", "grade": null}
