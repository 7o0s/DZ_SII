The version for the Apple terminal does not disappoint and remains roughly at the level of its PC counterpart, albeit with some predictable cuts. Nothing has been overlooked: the customization of the protagonist is of good quality thanks to the fair number of details and objects that can be used immediately, and for the lazy there is no lack of the random option. The same goes for the different possibilities dedicated to the character of the Sims, a fundamental component for the development of the game. As usual, the player has at his disposal a small house, some monetary funds and a map of the city in which to look for work, visit the neighbors or visit the lake. So the priorities will be to work, bring home lots of money for groceries, learn to cook by buying recipes and ingredients and so on. The Sims can also learn to repair electronic objects thanks to the purchase of a dedicated kit or fish by buying the relative rod first. Too bad for the absence of a method of construction of the house, which will therefore remain of the initial dimensions; obviously remains the faculty to furnish it according to one's tastes. On the other hand, the idea of inserting mini-games in the actions that the Sims must perform is excellent, for example for cooking you have to be careful not to burn the dishes by cooling the pans thanks to the touch on the iPhone screen, or to repair electrical objects you are called to complete a circuit by replacing the damaged parts, all obviously through the movement of our fingers. Little Sims grow up Many behaviors will be different from character to character thanks to the character alignment chosen: in some cases our Sims will be able to perform actions that are not always appropriate such as for example stealing at work; obviously we did not miss the opportunity and the result was the outright dismissal. To spice up the experience, the much-acclaimed achievements have been added to The Sims 3. As is the case with many home console games now, side tasks are the key to the longevity of the game, and in The Sims 3, each task will be more exhilarating than the next. In the form of ~desires~, the protagonist of the game will be able to try to carry out some very particular actions such as overturning a neighbor's bin, flirting with a girl and making his partner jealous or using other people's showers (and let's not forget the desire ~go fiki fiki with someone~!). The Sims 3 is satisfactory in terms of hardware optimization. The touch of the now Apple console responds perfectly to the commands given with the simple touch of the fingers while a series of icons activate the various sub-menus useful for purchasing various objects, moving between cities and homes and many other options. The entire graphical interface has been perfectly implemented to give the user the feeling of having everything at hand, and the aim has been achieved thanks to the compact but truly complete menus. The graphics sector appears to be fairly well made. Technically the polygonal models are modeled with great attention above all to the details, even if it must be said that the frame rate is certainly not exciting. As for the audio, the recognizable background symphony alternates with the classic voices of the Sims arguing in their unmistakable language. The tested version is 1.0.85", "date": "2009-07-01", "grade": "8.0"}
