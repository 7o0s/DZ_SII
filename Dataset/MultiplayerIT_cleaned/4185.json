{"name": "Hollow Knight", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hollow-knight-recensione-nintendo-switch.html", "text": "In recent years, someone must have found the Dragon Balls and expressed a desire to bring the Metroidvania back to life. It may also be, much more realistically, that the love for a genre that is still fun, exciting and in some cases very demanding has found new lifeblood in some small development teams: and here come some truly unmissable pearls such as Guacamelee, Owlboy, Steamworld Dig, just to mention the first ones that come to mind. Hollow Knight represents in all respects one of the highest points of the genre, at least of its modern declination: a production that you cannot ignore, that you must not ignore, and that you now have the opportunity to fully enjoy on Nintendo Switch as well. It took a whole year to convert Hollow Knight and bring it to mother Nintendo's hybrid console, all right, but was its announcement one of the most welcome surprises of Nintendo's E3 2018 or not? Let's remember that Team Cherry is a tiny team of developers, that we could count on our fingertips. A Dark Plot: Back to Hallownest The ~plot~ of Hollow Knight represents one of the winning points of the title, thanks to an evanescent, mysterious and intriguing narration that never ceases to pursue the player: one tries to continue, to explore every nook and cranny, not only to end the game and get to the titles of what, but also and above all to understand something of everything we have experienced up to that moment. It is a way of narrating in some respects very close to that of Souls and Bloodborne: a few pieces of text engraved on a marble slab, some evocative phrase or warning on a strange statue belonging to the past, and the considerations of a few characters who have now become the shadow of yourself. Sacrednest, the bizarre game world, is dominated by shadows and dust: strange creatures stir in its depths, now prey to madness. Everyday life seems to have reached its conclusion, there are only ruins, inhabited by a few survivors still endowed with lucidity: among these our protagonist, a curious and likeable little creature halfway between an insect and a Japanese spirit (recalls very Bleach Hollows). In reality, all the supporting actors too are anthropomorphised versions in a dark sauce of insects, snails, cockroaches and the like, all rigorously drawn and animated by hand, like the precious illustrations of the backdrops, game maps and objects: even just wanting to evaluate the artistic and visual sector of Hollow Knight, it would be a sacrilege not to promote it with flying colors. Returning to our protagonist and his mission, like every metroidvania we will find ourselves exploring every nook and cranny of the depths of Nidosacro, dealing with its disturbing guests and an atmosphere of constant tension. There are many features of Hollow Knight that collaborate in the presentation of an extremely valid product, among these some mechanics and particular situations designed by the developers. For example, the lack of any map as soon as one enters a new unexplored area: ~orientation~ is just a word in these situations, and one proceeds a little at random, hoping to remember the direction from which we came and to find an outlet later, also because in case of death it is very easy to lose all the coins collected up to that moment. If we really want a map, we will first have to meet a nice cartographer hidden in the new area and buy it, or buy it later at one of the shops in Pulveria, the main hub, a gathering point among the many hidden areas of Nidosacro. Very bad gameplay, even on Nintendo Switch Our hero will gradually begin to get stronger, to resist longer in his exploration, to stand up to the various bosses, but you will never have to relax even for a moment: even if fully armed it is easy to be annihilated following a distraction. Because Hollow Knight also shares basic rogue-like mechanics, and will punish us for carelessness. The checkpoints are few, the fast travel points too, every death brings with it all our pennies: to recover them we will have to go back to that point and face ~our spirit~, if we die again they will be lost forever. New skills are unlocked to continue in previously inaccessible points, as in any good metroidvania; you can restore your health by sacrificing enemy souls, a bizarre idea in the gameplay that is both evocative and functional, as well as highly strategic, because it is that same (limited) energy that allows us to launch special and particularly powerful shots. Better to heal or risk an attack? You have to choose quicklyand there's no going back. You've probably noticed it yourself by now, but so far we've talked about Nidosacro and Pulveria: this means that yes, even on Nintendo Switch Hollow Knight brings with it an excellent translation of its texts, and is therefore available in Italian. There are also internal achievements, to tease the completionists a little more: as if the many secrets, the collectibles, the bestiary to complete and backtracking in general were not enough. There is HD Rumble support, designed in an intelligent and accurate way: one shot at our hero and we will undergo immediate tactile feedback in response, to underline how our carelessness is to blame. In short, the conversion on Nintendo Switch is excellent, also from a technical and graphic point of view, since we have not noticed a single hesitation or loading that is too long. Enjoying Hollow Knight on your sofa, with a nice pair of headphones connected to the hybrid console, is an experience that we strongly recommend you try: but be careful not to throw the console against the furniture in a moment of frustration.", "date": "2018-06-27", "grade": "9.0"}
