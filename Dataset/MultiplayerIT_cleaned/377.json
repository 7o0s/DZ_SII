{"name": "Urban Chaos: Riot Response", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/urban-chaos-riot-response.html", "text": "Conclusions Passed almost quietly among fans, especially after the release of the excellent Black, Urban Chaos turned out to be a good representative of the Fps genre on balance. With its adult storyline and very high longevity, as well as the fair level of challenge offered during the various stages of the adventure, the game is to all intents and purposes considered a product to be taken into consideration in your very personal toy library. Pros: Challenging and fun. Good longevity. Great variety of weapons and situations. Cons: Enemy AI not always inspired. Some difficult scenarios to complete in advanced levels. Urban Chaos: Riot Response (Riot Response), which was originally supposed to be titled Zero Tolerance, is a strange first-person shooter set in the present day, in an American city where some gangs, after a harsh terrorist attack in the city subway, are causing massive damage to people and things, generating terror and death with their violence. The forces of order thus intervene en masse and in particular entrust the task of restoring calm to the area to a team of anti-riot and urban warfare specialists called T-Zero. This elite unit is trained precisely for city combat, is equipped with advanced weapons and technologies, and is led by an ex-US Army Marine named Nick Mason, a man hardened in every battle but not immune to pain and to the desperation caused by the daily vision of the acts of violence committed by the offenders he fights. Precisely in the role of Nick, the gamer will have to restore calm to the city by reclaiming the areas involved in the phenomenon with the help of his men and working side by side with the Police Department, emergency medical services and firefighters. The game structure of UC: SA does not differ much in general from that seen in other products of the genre. Even if the introduction of rescue missions complete with the recovery of injured people make it a title that is in some ways unique and a little more varied. In each level, introduced by a ~live~ news that updates the user on the situation in the city (it should be noted that the game is synchronized with the internal clock of the Ps2, as happened for some titles on the Dreamcast, therefore the in game will be the same as yours on the news), there are various objectives to be completed, some almost a game within a game. Cross-platform The PS2 and Xbox versions are very similar to each other, with greater definition and graphic cleaning regarding the latter. The choice of which version to buy therefore depends solely on the console in your possession. Popular uprising Such as those that allow, if completed, to receive important prizes at the end of the level, perhaps following the killing of a certain number of enemies with a headshot (you get the ~Shotsman~ medal), or discovering some masks scattered along the way (~Detective~ medal). These objects do not only have a ~statistic~ function but are subsequently used to upgrade weapons (which are many) or the shield supplied, which is very useful in riot control mission phases), or to receive new weapons unlocked perhaps in ~Time Attack~ mode Furthermore, to break the monotony of some missions, the programmers have seen fit to insert some short but interesting sections on board military vehicles, such as the one for example that will see you engaged in firing a machine gun from above a helicopter. eleven normal levels and the six bonuses, the option to play online or in LAN (to be played as an agent or thug) the longevity of UC proves to be very high.From a technical point of view Urban Chaos presents a respectable realization: although not showing incredible cosmetics or special effects of who knows what kind, the graphics sector does its duty well, with globally well-made settings and scenarios.In this sense, the excellent work done by Rocksteady Studios programmers and graphics in the reconstruction of realistic and dynamic environments, taking advantage quite well, considering the hardware limitations of the Ps2, the potential offered by the Havok 3 graphics engine. The sound is also good, which has a complete localization in our language for speech (complete with curses) and theme music , and the control of the character itself, even if it must be said that the polygonal models of the enemies could be a little more varied.", "date": "2006-09-07", "grade": null}
