As in that case, once again the basic idea was to combine old and new, in this case keeping the foundations of the gameplay intact and adapting the entire graphic layout and various playful aspects to today's standards: if however for Prince of Persia Classic the final result had been appreciable, this time the developers seem to have overplayed the less noble components of mobile gaming, ending up sacrificing the enjoyment of the entire experience. Remake so to speak Indeed, that of remake is a term that does not quite fit Prince of Persia: The Shadow and The Flame, considering how the structure of the levels and the general design is very far from that offered by the original title. To be honest, the developers of Ubisoft Pune don't even seem to be interested in maintaining narrative coherence, given that the story that in 1993 was told through pleasant static images, here is just sketched out and liquidated with scrolling text that sometimes even appears meaningless. These are just the first signs of a product that too easily abandons the path traced by its inspiring source, pursuing some modern ambitions (did you really feel the need for stealth elements in a Prince of Persia?) destined to surely make the admirers turn up their noses of the classic gameplay of the series. Not that all the new ideas brought to the play structure appear unpleasant or out of place, of course: for example, the choice to make the white-weapon fights more dynamic by inserting elementary dynamics of combos and countermoves is appreciable, as is the decision to equip the internships of various forks useful to stimulate the spirit of exploration of those who aim for 100% completion. Too bad that these are good insights only on paper, defused by an all too summary execution of the fundamentals by Ubisoft Pune. Prince of Persia: The Shadow and The Flame does not honor the game from which it takes its inspiration Princely confusion We start with a really imprecise control system, although there are two versions of the commands, one based on a series of swipes to be performed with the finger on the screen and the other centered on more conventional sticks and virtual keys: in both cases the prince often struggles to grasp user inputs promptly, with the result that the most demanding segments can prove particularly frustrating. A problem whose gravity increases if we consider the cunning expedient devised by the developers to foment in-app purchases: in case of death, in fact, you can decide to start the level over again or immediately return to life using a special potion, an article in which very rarely comes across the game world but which conversely crowds the virtual shelves of the store set up by Ubisoft. For a product sold at an average price by mobile gaming standards, Prince of Persia: The Shadow and The Flame tends to exaggerate in the emphasis placed on microtransactions with real money, reserved yes for elements that are not essential to complete the adventure but which nonetheless they are advertised in a fairly invasive way at practically every interlude screen. It is sad to see how an important name such as that of the second chapter of a legendary franchise has been wasted for such an artificial and soulless action, even in the face of a more than good job done from an aesthetic point of view: graphically the game defends itself in fact more than good, staging colorful backdrops rich in details and excellent animations especially as regards the protagonist. However, this is one of the few merits of an operation that would have benefited from more respectful planning in the design phase: nobody expected a slavish remake of the original, but not even a product that had in common with the 1993 game only the title.", "date": "2013-08-01", "grade": "5.0"}
