Its purchase can only be made together with the rest of the series, at a price of 22.99 euros. The text contains some plot spoilers. The way Telltale Games has set up its story of the Dark Knight has particularly fascinated us. You will certainly already have it if you have read the reviews of the first three chapters of Batman: The Telltale Series, entitled Realm of Shadows, Children of Arkham and New World Order. The new Guardian of Gotham is no less, continuing to tell the story built on many classic elements of the world of Batman, in some cases, however, distorted as in the one relating to the link between the underworld and the Wayne family which is the background to the series. In the fourth and penultimate chapter, which anticipates the end of the games scheduled for the Christmas period, we find ourselves in the stages following the final twist and cliffhanger of the third episode, waking up as a still groggy Bruce Wayne in an Arkham cell Asylum. A series of flashbacks suggests what happened while the protagonist was drugged, to then leave room for the appearance of the inevitable welcome committee in the criminal asylum. It is precisely in these initial stages of the episode that one of Gotham City's most famous villains makes his first appearance in Batman: The Telltale Series: we are of course talking about the Joker, presented to us in an unusual guise as a savior as well as a helping hand, even if in ways that reveal the true nature that we all know. Archived the initial phase dedicated to the Joker and Arkham Asylum, Guardian of Gotham then shifts its attention to Harvey Dent, now completely transformed into Two-Face. The madness definitively ignited by Selina's betrayal and the intention to eradicate the so-called Children of Arkham lead Dent to make some questionable choices, thus putting Bruce's conflict with his former friend at the center of the entire chapter. Those who expected a more decisive Guardian of Gotham after the interim phase of New World Order will instead find an episode with relaxed times again especially at the beginning only to then press on in the finale to prepare for the showdown with the Cobblepot gang and ~Lady Arkham ~. Bruce Wayne vs. Harvey Dent is the first Batman: The Telltale Series showdown! Important choices The previous chapters of Batman: The Telltale Series confirmed the conservative choice of the developers in full line, who also in this fourth chapter do not add new features to a now standard game system. Therefore, the phases in which we take on the role of Bruce Wayne and Batman continue to alternate, with the first ones more oriented towards dialogue and the second ones devoted more to action based on quick time events. As a bat man, you also access a crime scene to reconstruct through the investigation minigame that we have seen in the past, but once again everything remains as it was: the puzzles are simple to the point that it becomes difficult even to define them as such, since the links between the various clues are practically in front of the player's nose. We continue to consider it a pity, because by going a little further it would probably have been possible to give life to a title with a completely different flavor of novelty, or at least demonstrate that we listen to those who ask for something new on the gameplay front. We will see from this point of view what the third season of The Walking Dead will tell us. Returning to Guardian of Gotham, on the duration front we are once again around an hour and a half to complete the episode, in which however a couple of crucial choices appear that lead to scenes with different places and characters. Seeing how things would have gone in the other case is more of a temptation, so the total time spent on Guardian of Gotham could increase, albeit slightly. On the technical front, the problems encountered in the past in terms of performance remain, although thankfully not at the breaking levels of the first episode: the Xbox One version used for the review continued to show a number of frames per second dancer, which ends to knock out speech and cut out some of the animations. Fortunately, the dubbing (English only, including subtitles) and the artistic vein of the design are still appreciable, even if from the initial phase set in Arkham Asylum we would have expected to see a less anonymous and more ~crazy~ place.", "date": "2016-11-23", "grade": "7.0"}
