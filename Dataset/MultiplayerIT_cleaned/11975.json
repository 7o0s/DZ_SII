It might sound like your usual Counter-Strike or Battlefield-flavored soup, but in reality Quake Wars adds some decidedly tasty elements that justify the vote at the end of the article: firstly, the tactical aspect violently takes over, where more than ever will require collaboration with other members of your team. To do this, the developers have provided maps with a series of objectives to be completed in a pre-established order and only by a certain class: this will force you to adapt to the needs of the map and the team, sacrificing your selfish vein in order to complete the mission: if, for example, the objective is to build the bridge, it could be a good thing to play the role of the Engineer (or Strogg counterpart, of course) to unlock the next objective. Obviously, this is not a forced choice, and you will therefore be free to choose the class that best suits you: this is because, in any case, you will be called upon to provide a more indirect collaboration, having to defend the aforementioned engineer who, during construction, he will generally find himself quite exposed to enemy fire and unable to defend himself. Each class, regardless of the one you choose, will still force you to collaborate with the rest of the team: Quake Wars therefore lends itself very well to clan play, even if nothing prevents you from remaining freelancers and fully enjoying this splendid title, thanks to the creation automatic of teams that bring together all the players who play the same role. Discovering the species Thus we come to talk about the classes, another strong point of the game. In total there are five different roles for each faction, substantially mirroring each other: you will find the classic Soldier / Aggressor, the backbone of any game and suitable for demolition missions, thanks to its powerful charges; if you prefer to stay away from the fight, or sneak behind the enemy for petty kills, you can impersonate the Covert Ops / Infiltrator, exploiting his ability to disguise himself as an enemy and infiltrate behind enemy lines, perhaps sabotaging defensive turrets; if, on the other hand, your passion is medicine, the Doctor/Technician class is for you, able to heal wounded comrades and revive those who have been overwhelmed. The picture is completed by the Field Ops/Oppressor class, a sort of field commander in charge of distributing ammunition (only for the GDF faction) or requesting air strikes and, finally, that of the Engineer/Constructor, able to parachute lethal defend turrets and repair enemy vehicles, as well as obviously build sensitive objectives such as bridges and towers. Such a schematic listing, however, does not do justice to the micro-distinctions that make each class unique: while, for example, the GDF's Covert Ops can fire a single shot with its sniper rifle and then wait to reload the rifle, on the contrary the 'Infiltrator Strogg, relying on his Railgun, can fire a first shot and then also not wait for the weapon to fully load, so he can fire two shots in rapid succession, perhaps finishing off the targeted opponent quickly. The absence of ammunition would suggest, at a superficial glance, that the balance needle hangs for the alien faction: on the contrary, to keep the two factions fairly balanced, the developers have provided a complicated damage management system. If, to return to the example indicated above, the Infiltrator Strogg fires the second shot when the weapon is only 10% loaded, it will not inflict the maximum damage possible (as it happens for the GDF counterpart), but only a tenth. Similarly, the classic iron sight (the view through the viewfinder of the rifle), will allow you to eliminate the malus that afflicts each shot fired by half, thus increasing the damage caused; in the same way you will have to consider that each weapon has a certain optimal range, beyond which it loses a certain percentage of damage as the target gets further away: to this value of damage, thus calculated, you will have to add any bonuses/maluses attributable to the part of the model you hit (calculate a 250% damage increase if you hit the head, 150% for the chest, 100% for the rest of the torso, and 50% for the legs). Do you have confused ideas? It may seem pointless to make such calculations for a game, but that's what makes the difference between a casual gamer and the true hardcore gamer. What do you want to play today? There are three different game modes in Quake Wars. The one called Campaign will see you engaged in facing three distinct maps in succession (all grouped by continent), technically connected by a subtle semblance of a narrative plot. The simpler Mission, on the contrary, involves the battle on a single map chosen, in rotation, among those loaded on the server: unlike what happens in the Campaign mode, you will have more time for the battle. The last type of game, dubbed StopWatch, will force you to fulfill the objectives of the map before time runs out: simply frenetic. Agip thousand points Great calculations behind this chapter of the Enemy Territory brand, but hidden so well that you will feel like you are playing the most classic of shooters: and how many shooters do you know that don't allow you to drive vehicles? You will therefore have the opportunity to drive not only vehicles, but also some aircraft to undertake dangerous and lethal (in the sense that the first flights will always lead you to suicide, they are so difficult to master) aerial duels: the GDF, as predictably, it deploys a rather classic fleet of machines, providing for fast reconnaissance quads, amphibious and non-amphibious transport vehicles, a heavy tank and the colossal MPC, a mobile bunker only available in some missions and which you will have to drive to complete certain objectives. peak of excellence which, given the reputation of id Software and its press ads, we expected to reach Agip thousand points The variety comes with the means of the Stroggs, many of which provide an alternative mode: among all emerges the Icarus, a comfortable jetpack to reach unattainable areas of the map, or the nice Hog, able to carry out a kamikaze attack and destroy, instantly , most enemy vehicles. A special award goes to the gigantic Cyclops (the full name is Cyclops Heavy Walker), a large mech that can anchor itself to the ground, in a mode called Siege, making its profile smaller (and therefore less easy to hook as a target) while simultaneously increasing its devastating rate of fire. To dispel any doubt it must be said that any class can drive a vehicle and, as proof of the fact that cooperation is encouraged in Quake Wars, many vehicles provide a place or more for other players, who for the occasion will play the role of the gunner or shooter, thus increasing the firepower of your vehicle. Also in this case, each vehicle (including the wheels!) has its own specific resistance value, a damage factor deriving from the mounted firearms, which differs depending on whether the target is a player, another vehicle or even just an object : for our goodness we leave out all the complex mathematical calculations and the articulated equations elaborated by the developers to integrate into the game a damage system that is as balanced as possible. Fairytale design We can, however, assure you that during the online sessions you will not dwell on an aesthetic detail for too long or criticize a texture that is not properly aligned, so much will you be involved in the adrenaline of the action. The clashes in Quake Wars, whether on foot, in vehicles or in the sky, will always be frenetic and will leave you little room to carefully plan an offensive or defensive strategy: in this respect, the title of Splash Damage draws heavily from that stone milestone is Quake 3: Arena, the true and only King of online shooters; however, the need to coordinate with the rest of your team breaks up the hectic pace in favor of a few brief planning breaks. Thus the due applause is introduced to the map designers: while some are faithfully taken from the previous chapter of the Enemy Territory series, as in the case of Volcano, others are particularly varied in action, showing both wide open spaces, a real paradise for campers or for those who prefer to kill from afar, both narrow corridors, with the need, to complete the objectives, to face the enemy in claustrophobic indoor conflicts. This basically means that you will not find in any map a class that predominates over the others, and sometimes you will be forced to abandon your favorite character to select something more suitable for the places of battle: being armed with a sniper rifle, at inside a corridor, to fight a forest of irritated Strogg is not, properly, the knowbest solution. Of all the maps, we would like to mention some that are really fun: without a shadow of a doubt, the one called Pacific Canyon gets the first prize, given its absolutely immense size and which will see the foot soldiers engaged in fighting in the mountains while the vehicles will play thrashing on paved roads, generating clashes that, on some servers, reach epic proportions, with sounds, explosions, the comings and goings of radio communications and rapid raids by aircraft. Slipgate is also excellent, where for the first time two micro maps are presented within a single, large mission: after the GDF has liberated a citadel in Africa, their MPC (a sort of mobile base), controlled by a player, will have to go through a Dimensional Portal by accessing a completely different map, with the aim of defeating the Strogg directly on their territory. The special critics prize was won by the Refinery map, absolutely difficult in the last objective, which sees the Stroggs barricaded in a building, intent on repelling the continuous suicidal attacks by the GDF: the peculiarity lies in the fact that the structure, inside, presents itself as a series of small continuous corridors, which more than once will lead you to find yourself facing your opponent. Comment The moment of final judgment has arrived and, without a doubt, Quake Wars will delight many fans of the series and not. Thanks to proven playability and a particularly successful map design, this new chapter of the Enemy Territory brand represents one of the best online shooters of 2007, also thanks to the immense charisma of the setting and the exaltation that one feels in playing the role of a bloodthirsty Strogg. The developers of Splash Damage have dispelled any doubts about the possible heaviness of the title and their Megatexture technology, perhaps going so far as to excessively sacrifice the aesthetic aspect, the only real big drawback of the title: however a negligible aspect given the gaming experience that , on the whole, is offered to us. An absolutely excellent title that will help us get through this harsh winter, even if, to be honest, we are unfortunately far from the revolution that some expected. Pros A 100% condensed Quake Adrenaline and with many tactical elements Perfect damage system A libido for clans Cons Graphically not up to expectations Some small balancing issues High gnawing rate Enemy Territory: Quake Wars is available for PC and will be available for 360 and PS3. The version tested for this article is the PC version. System requirements Minimum Requirements Processor: Pentium 4 2.8 GHz or AMD 2800+ RAM: 512 MB Video Card: Geforce 5700 or ATI Radeon 9700 with 128 MB Disk Space: 5.0 GB Recommended Requirements Processor: Intel Dual Core RAM: 2 GB Video Card: Geforce Series 8x00 or Radeon 2X00 Series Disk Space: 8.0 GB Test Configuration Processor: Intel Core Duo E6700 @ 2.7 GHz RAM: 2 GB Video Card: NVIDIA BFG 8800 GTX Operating System: Windows Vista Ultimate The game showed up, on our system test, absolutely fluid with all the details and filters activated, at the resolution of 1680x1050: the average framerate was around 50-55 FPS, making the gaming experience absolutely fluid under any circumstance. It was inevitable that, sooner or later, that genius of Carmack would churn out a product completely oriented to multiplayer on the world of Quake: what could be the most glorious sum for a brand, if not to see the two opposing factions face each other personified by fleshy individuals and bones, instead of limiting itself to duels between player and processor? Except for the small cameo in Quake 4, in which the player saw himself transformed into a Strogg after a bloody ~integrative~ process, we had never been given the opportunity to impersonate these biomechanical beings as cruel as they are fascinating: how can we therefore resist the charm not to be, for once, on the side of upright and just humans, but to put on the uncomfortable and mechanical clothes of a conquering and bloodthirsty alien? And especially, how to resist the temptation to overwhelm yet another newbie who has landed from the lands of his boring World of WarCraft (and here we brought Pierpaolo's wrath upon ourselves)?", "date": "2007-10-01", "grade": null}
