This XBox version includes two new levels and several graphical innovations compared to the PS2 version. Obviously these innovations have a heavy impact on the final version for XBox, where it will be possible to perform very reckless and exciting stunts, all in the vicinity of very detailed stages where there will be numerous and deadly obstacles that will put even the most daring of Bmx bikes to the test. All this then seasoned with a fairly intuitive and immediate control system, all to ensure great fun and good longevity. Game mode This title inspired by the deeds of the Bmx wizard or Dave Mirra, allows us to measure ourselves against as many challengers in 10 different game levels. The levels, in this version for XBox, are very large and detailed, very rich in shortcuts, obstacles and surprises of various kinds. In addition, in the various game scenarios there will be numerous moving vehicles which could surely turn into a serious obstacle even for the most crazy of riders. The missions and objectives will increase in difficulty as the missions and levels pass to ensure a truly exhilarating level of challenge. Control system The already more than good control system of the PS2 version has been further refined and optimized for the XBox Pad, guaranteeing excellent playability. In addition, all defects relating to the control system present on the PS2 have been definitively eliminated, so as to ensure a quality product from all points of view. Graphics and Sound From a graphic point of view, the game in question certainly does not make one cry out for a miracle but evaluating it as a transposition of the PS2 version, it gets along very well. First of all, the presence of the hardware anti-aliasing filter present on the XBox guarantees a really high image cleaning as well as the quality of the same, obviously nothing stratospheric when compared with sacred monsters of the caliber of Dead Or Alive 3 and Halo, but the everything is pleasing to the eye. As for the sound, our performances will be accompanied by motifs in line with the style of play proposed by the title. Comment Ultimately this is a good quality title, which all in all guarantees a discreet graphic aspect and a good audio department. Recommended for Bmx enthusiasts and for those who intend to dive into this acrobatic world told and represented very well by Dave Mirra BMX. For all the others, I recommend aiming for titles of a much different thickness, less niche. Pros: Excellent conversion from the title for PS2 Spectacular stunts Cons: Discreet graphics Dedicated especially to enthusiasts Materials: Tips Let's dust off the old BMX Although all the eyes of gamers are currently focused on what is the most followed extreme sport, namely Tony Hawk's skateboard, at the moment there is another title that should arouse the interest of the most reckless and contemptuous of danger hearts: Dave Mirra 2. Grab your seat and get ready to hop on your flaming BMX for daring stunts alongside Dave Mirra.", "date": "2002-03-13", "grade": null}
