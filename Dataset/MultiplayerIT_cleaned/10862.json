{"name": "The House of the Dead: Overkill - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-house-of-the-dead-overkill-recensione.html", "text": "Let's face it: while clearly inspired by the poorest horror films of the past decades, The House of the Dead series has always taken itself too seriously. Improbable protagonists who find themselves in situations bordering on the paradoxical, in this case fighting hordes of zombies in completely infested cities, and not even the shred of a plot that can explain why all this happens or what reasons the characters have to risk their lives to put things right. So here is the new episode exclusively for Wii, The House of the Dead: Overkill stands as a breaking point with the past and projects the series towards decidedly different atmospheres, overloaded with ~black~ and politically incorrect humor. No attempt to make the plot more complex or convincing, in short, but the absurd dialogues between the mysterious Agent G and the surly policeman Isaac Washington, studded with vulgarity and double meanings (the game is recommended for adults only), transform each cut-scene into a moment of great fun, with ~Pulp Fiction~ dialogues underlined by a soundtrack that ranges from country to funk. The original voices are extraordinary for cue and interpretation, making one forget the many (too many!) dubbings in English that are absolutely anonymous and devoid of conviction. We will also be able to listen to them in the Italian version, localized only as regards the subtitles and screen texts. Shoot what happens to you The evil Pope Caesar has unleashed an unknown chemical agent into the air, capable of turning anyone it taints into a violent, cannibalistic zombie. On his trail are Agent G (a ~rejuvenated~ version of the classic protagonist of the series The House of the Dead) and Isaac Washington, who form a truly bizarre couple: the first is a novice government agent, with more discipline than character; the second is a foul-mouthed and antisocial detective, determined to avenge his father's death. The story mode boasts the typical structure of lightgun shooters, so we will have to complete seven episodes in which we have to shoot everything that moves on the screen (or almost, watch out for innocent civilians to save) using the Wii-mote's pointing system as already seen in the compilation The House of the Dead 2 & 3 Return as well as in the spin-off Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles. The controls are simple: you shoot with the B trigger and reload with the A button, while the - and 1 keys are used respectively to throw grenades (when we have them available) and to switch from primary to secondary weapon. Scattered around the stages we will find bonus objects that must be hit to earn extra points, to activate a sort of ~bullet time~ (with music and voices that slow down in parallel with the action) or to recover some energy. As usual, we will suffer damage if the zombies come close enough to hit us or if we are hit by a throwing weapon, even if the game proves to be extremely generous from this point of view, giving us three ~continues~ for each stage. To this must be added the usual lowering of the difficulty given by the possibility of moving the crosshair on the screen rather than actually aiming. It is possible to adjust the sensor to bring the experience closer to that of a classic lightgun shooter, although the result of such calibration can be disappointing. Is it possible that no one has yet thought of creating a device to be used with this type of game? The minigames of the dead In addition to the ~story~ mode and the ~Director's Cut~ mode (which adds some new sequences, new weapons and greater difficulty to the first one), The House of the Dead: Overkill offers us three nice minigames to organize matches in which up to for four players: ~Eye of a lynx~ is the classic target shooting found in amusement parks, in which you have to hit targets that move faster and faster and according to different trajectories; ~Survival~, as the name suggests, is a test that involves eliminating all zombies in a fixed location, respecting a time limit that can be increased from horde to horde; Finally, ~Assistance to the victims~ sees us play the role of the sniper and shoot zombies to allow innocent civilians to reach the exit inside a prison. Weapons of destruction As mentioned above, during the action it is possible to switch from the primary to the secondary weapon by pressing a button. At the end of each stage, in fact, we will be able to access a shop where we can buy new weapons or enhance those we already have, acting on the damage values, rate of shots, magazine capacity, reload speed and recoil. The difference between an arbut normal and one boosted to the maximum is clear, and makes life much easier for us. We will be able to buy new weapons by choosing from a catalog that offers us pistols, rifles and machine guns, categories which in the ~Director's Cut~ mode (available once the story mode is finished) are enriched with alternative and lethal models (see the revolver, a relative of the pistol of ordinance but capable of knocking out enemies with a single blow). As we progress through the stages, the game naturally becomes more complex and the zombies we will have to shoot increase, so much so that in the most crowded situations we will notice annoying slowdowns which also end up temporarily blocking the movement of the viewfinder. The greater difficulty, unfortunately, also highlights a defect concerning collisions: in a product of this kind, precision is very important, especially when you intend to fill up with bonuses, but when the action is fast, several shots sign are not detected correctly which can be quite frustrating. The management of the bosses is the classic one of the series: each monster is ~presented~ by a loading screen in which its weak points are highlighted, or the parts of the body that we will have to hit a certain number of times, shooting at the right moment. In this sense, the ~bestiary~ is varied and picturesque, even if it too disappoints in terms of challenge: sometimes defeating an unbeatable monster on paper turns out to be a piece of cake. Technical realization The developers of Headstrong Games have not worked miracles from a purely technical point of view: the polygonal models are simple, the textures are very blurry (the guns, during the cutscenes, are even unwatchable ...) and the most crowded situations put the graphics engine in crisis , which ends up slowing down. Zombies react differently depending on which part of the body is hit, losing limbs or ending up on the ground and then crawling, but these are things that the SEGA series had already accustomed us to during the last generation of consoles. Some locations are quite interesting, but who knows what level of complexity is never reached and the interactivity with the scenery is almost nil. A separate discussion, however, must be made for the style: the direction of the game and of the cutscenes is extraordinary, the ~old film~ effects are wasted to underline the ~pulp~ atmosphere of this production and finally, as mentioned, the curtains between the two protagonists are absurd, irreverent and hilarious. Finally, the soundtrack is really excellent and abundant, thanks to a series of ~signed~ songs that make the experience more engaging. Comment The House of the Dead: Overkill is a classic lightgun shooter, which does not revolutionize the genre while adding some interesting innovations in terms of available weapons and their enhancement. The action is a lot of fun, as usual, but proves a bit too easy due to the Wii-mote's pointing system, which makes the experience very different from that obtainable with a dedicated peripheral (and the extra calibrations, in that sense, they don't help that much). To this we must add a longevity in line with the genre or perhaps even narrower, given that the seven episodes are completed within a few hours and the ~Director's Cut~ mode does not constitute who knows what complement to the story mode. In short, a failed experiment? Absolutely not: the game distances itself from the previous episodes and offers us truly great and hilarious atmospheres and situations, drawing on the typical humor of Tarantino's films, sometimes even exaggerating. Therefore it offers us something short but very intense, through an approach that we hope will be taken up again in the future, perhaps dressed in graphics that are not saved only for cinematic gimmicks and style. Pros Extraordinary cutscenes Fun and addictive action Great sound Against Graphics full of gimmicks, but decidedly ~oldgen~ Reduced longevity Improved hit detection", "date": "2009-02-23", "grade": null}
