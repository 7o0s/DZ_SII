Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. Word-based games for mobile devices all seem to follow the same process: distributed for free (or in any case with a free version without particular limitations, as in this specific case), they start from the ground up to build a solid user base and a few months later they boast literally millions of active users. It happened in the past with Angry Words, which we reviewed some time ago, and it happens again with Ruzzle, which we tested for you in the free version available on the App Store. Let's make it clear right away: the game can be downloaded and used for free, with only two small ~limitations~: the first is represented by the tiny advertising banner that appears at the bottom of the screen; the second from the lack of statistics and the online ranking, available only for the premium version (which can be unlocked by spending 2.69 euros via in-app purchase). Once these doubts have been dispelled, let's analyze this nice product, which is nothing more or less like a digital clone of Boggle. In fact, in every game we are faced with a table made up of sixteen boxes (four by four), each with a letter of the alphabet and a different numerical value inside. Over three rounds of two minutes each, our task is to touch these boxes and form as many words as possible, obtaining a higher score if we use the letters highlighted by bonuses that double or triple the value of the single letter or the whole word. At the end of each round, the score we have obtained is compared with that of the opponent, and at the end of the three rounds, whoever managed to get the most points wins. Dangerous crossings As in many similar products, Ruzzle's online multiplayer works asynchronously, i.e. the two competing players can make their moves when they want and then see the final result at the end of the three rounds. Once you tap the ~Start a new game~ button, you can draw your opponent from your Facebook friends list, Twitter followers, Ruzzle friends, or select one at random. It is even possible to play in offline mode, alone, to familiarize yourself with the simple game mechanics before making a fool of yourself (knowing it first...). Once in play, the action reveals itself to be immediate and frenetic, in fact it is necessary to identify the possible compositions with a quick glance and then ~draw~ them on the touch screen of your device, immediately taking advantage of any plurals but always trying to focus pay attention to the boxes with a score multiplier, because in the end they will weigh more than anything else on the outcome of the round. Several matches can be activated simultaneously, carrying them forward when we want and receiving notifications with each update. From a technical point of view, as was to be expected, Ruzzle carries out its task without infamy or praise, providing us with clear and easily readable graphics, accompanied by an almost absent sound sector.", "date": "2012-10-27", "grade": "7.6"}
