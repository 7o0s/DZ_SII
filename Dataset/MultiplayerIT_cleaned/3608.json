The feeling of playing a Castlevania of the highest level again, as if it were a true heir of the never forgotten Symphony of the Night, returns that sense of nostalgia and fulfillment which is exactly what the team has been trying since the announcement. A few days after the first release, the version for Nintendo Switch also arrives, which, unfortunately, is also the worst, with absolutely unjustified negative peaks. After the review of the PC version by our Simone Tagliaferri, the judgment on the port in question also arrives. A short summary Let's do a brief summary regarding the game, before dedicating ourselves to the problems of the version in question. Bloodstained lives its own life, inserted in a universe and a context that has nothing to do with the Castlevania lore, except for some very marked references regarding settings and enemies. The protagonist is this Miriam, a not totally human woman, part of the so-called Shardbinder: or individuals capable of absorbing some demonic elements, as well as using them at will. Awakened after a long sleep, she finds herself facing a trail of death and destruction, which she soon discovers is being carried out by her old partner Gebel. He solemnly swears to save mankind from destruction, which is how the main events of the campaign begin. The game is clearly the spiritual heir of those Castlevanias that made the fortune of the genre and of the author himself, trying to modernize the system with an extremely marked RPG component. The game is in fact full of weapons, armor, accessories and there is the possibility of creating and eating assorted dishes of all kinds. To add meat to the fire there are five different types of demonic fragments that can be acquired, which allow you to activate active and passive skills ranging from classic spells to the summoning of a multitude of familiars. Each of these elements, whether they are rings, helmets, swords (or the inevitable whip) or even fragments, can be enhanced and fused together, transforming them into truly destructive skills. The choice is vast, although this does not always reflect an adequate level of utility: many of the elements you will find (which also change the protagonist aesthetically), are in reality mere fillers. This does not mean that the team must be recognized for a considerable creation effort, which goes hand in hand with work on environments and enemies of the highest level. Here, unfortunately, the problem of the graphics engine comes into play, which returns a good three-dimensional sense within the 2D scrolling, but which suffers in the face of productions of the same kind and damned more successful, because they are often dedicated to a hand drawing work that now allows extraordinary screen yields. To conclude the overview of the contents, there is a longevity of around ten hours for a normal campaign process, which turn into at least fifteen (if you are quick and lucky) to discover 100% of the map. You can only play on the normal difficulty level with the first pass, but there are two more. A series of additional contents will then arrive in the months that could lead the playful offer to be really substantial, compared to a current price that is not particularly friendly. The Switch disaster With a few days of unjustified but bearable delay, the Nintendo Switch version of Bloodstained arrives on the market. Last iteration made, on which work began even after the (later cancelled) PlayStation Vita version, it is also the one that many backers of the project have chosen during the development phase, precisely because of its inherent proximity to a console like the hybrid from Nintendo. Kept hidden until the end, it was immediately clear how this version lived on some more important problems than expected. It was reasonable to expect a lower aesthetic quality and a greater visual dirt of the code, but what we have faced categorically responds to something very close to a disaster. Already a year ago we reviewed another port (in that case even worse) for Switch, RiME. Bloodstained manages to return to the count of playable titles, but demonstrates how the team's choice of engine was absolutely unfortunate. The graphical downgrade is impressive, leading to a level of aliasing and sagging din resolution and detail which is totally unjustified, considering however the choice to lower the frame rate to thirty frames per second. As if that weren't enough, the latter are far from stable, on the contrary they constantly collapse until they halve in some sections. To add further problems there is an annoying input lag not present on the other version we tested, the PC one, which instead turns out to be a technical jewel from the point of view of fluidity and response to commands. Unfortunately we also have to report a couple of annoying crashes, which hit us even after upgrading to the latest version: a patch which, to tell the truth, has begun to resolve a number of important limitations. Just in the last few hours, the team has recognized the problems of this version and has reassured everyone that it will work to fix the errors made as much as possible, through further patches that will arrive at more or less regular intervals. What is sad is that, at this point (and we always think so) it would have been better to postpone the Switch version for a few weeks, rather than just a few days, trying to go out on the market as close as possible to the performance of the other versions.", "date": "2019-06-30", "grade": "7.5"}
