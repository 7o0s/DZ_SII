The first given by reality, certainly more limiting than the imagination, and the second due to having to follow the events and the setting narrated in the reference writings. To tell the truth, both obstacles have been overcome without major problems: the Eastern Europe of Mount & Blade: With Fire & Sword is presented quite well both in the reconstruction of weapons and costumes (some wonderful) as in the architectural styles of the various cities, even if a little more life and details wouldn't have hurt, while the characters and little more remain of the novels, leaving the aforementioned freedom of action as open as possible. Instead, what the game stumbles upon is due, ironically, to the most successful motif of the series, or rather that modding that has done so much to give fame and honors to the series and which today beats the developers themselves, confirming the parable of the pupil who sooner or later surpasses the teacher. Kill my king, and I will kill yours Mount & Blade: With Fire & Sword presents itself from the beginning as the series has accustomed us to: the creation of the avatar goes hand in hand with what was seen in the predecessors, even if the possibility of having noble births and in general to choose the origin of the character. Once the name and physical features have been decided, the first points must be distributed among the usual characteristics (obviously the skills devoted to the use of firearms are added) and finally the first mission which also serves as a tutorial is tackled. Once this is done, With Fire & Sword gives the player the most absolute freedom of movement between Sweden, Crimea, Poland and neighboring territories, leaving the possibility of choosing which missions to carry out, under which flag to take sides or whether to take command of a band of outlaws or mercenaries without country or honour. However varied and diversified the factions are, however, an Italian player will perhaps find it difficult to become attached to one of them, given the great cultural and historical distance between us and the contents of the game, when instead the nations of the old Mount & Blade, despite representing a non-existent Middle Ages, were perhaps more stereotyped and therefore closer to our experience. In any case, this is not the real problem of the title, but rather its total lack of innovation compared to the rest of the series: it is not enough to insert a few rifles and new costumes to renew the concept, as different firearms and historical periods are the basis of most of the modifications, some of which are so accurate as to overshadow not only Warband, but even Mount & Blade: With Fire&Sword itself - we are referring to masterpieces such as Old Frontier or Mount&Musket. Renewing a Mount & Blade is not even preventing the recruitment of regular soldiers if you are not enrolled in a faction, limiting the search for warriors to mercenary camps (all secondary features of this latest expansion), but rather improving its AI in combat and strategic group controls, increase the importance of interpersonal relationships and so on. In With Fire&Sword the same commands of Warband remain, both as regards the control of the character and of the army, and the lines of dialogue between the protagonist and other characters remain the same, sparse as they have always been (~what do you do?~, ~ how's the war going?~, ~can I help you?~, etc.), both towards nobles and fellow adventurers. Obviously no one expected complex Dragon Age plots, but a minimum of relationship that is not updating the skills and equipment of one's men would not have hurt, just as we would have appreciated a greater depth in juggling the favors and enmities of the various sovereigns, the whose moods towards us are once again shown by a numerical scale and a few lines of text. The advancement of the era itself hasn't changed the cards on the table much compared to previous experiences, if not by slightly increasing the difficulty (a rifle shot kills, regardless of whether it is a sniper or a second-level looter who fires it) and giving an excuse for redesigning uniforms and weapons from scratch, which now gain in detail and finesse, reaching in some cases real joys for the eyes. As long as you like the era. On the other hand, the cities and interiors are less cared for, rather bare and empty as always, just as the animations of the firearms are a bit disappointing, some of which reproduce those usedfor crossbows, obviously no longer present. Basically, playing single player Mount & Blade: With Fire&Sword doesn't change much in mechanics and possibilities compared to what we saw in Warband, except for already tested armaments and clothes in amateur modifications - by the way, mods for Warband are incompatible - and not they are certainly small additions such as the possibility of street fights and a greater number of quests from the burgomasters to change the cards on the table. It must be said that, with a view to increasing longevity, it is necessary to carry out more missions to have good relations with the lords and therefore be accepted as fighters by one nation rather than another, as well as the increase in prices of weapons and equipment encourages more tasks for the burgomasters and more trade. All for one Regardless of the more or less evident evolution of the single player experience, it is in the multiplayer that many hoped to finally find a different and new experience compared to what was seen in Warband, undermined by various bugs and imbalances. In Mount & Blade: With Fire&Sword we have bigger maps, different modes (even one where each character commands a department of bots!) and support for a very high number of players (up to 250!): starting from single duels and small team deathmatches of 20 fighters up to immense battles and gigantic sieges, with some moments of rare epic and immersiveness. The game system remains the same, and given its effectiveness this is certainly not a bad thing: each player has a certain amount of money to spend on equipment - horse, weapons, armor, ammunition, etc. - and more is added to the initial amount as you kill enemies, thus giving you the opportunity to equip yourself with increasingly powerful / resistant objects and armor, in order to have a clear advantage over the other players. However, the balance still remains a utopia and firearms have not affected the game system so deeply, so much so that many prefer to continue using bows and arrows, certainly less powerful but also with much higher rates of fire. It is known that asking for 30 seconds to reload a musket is a bit much when fighting against real opponents and for this reason the craze of carrying even three rifles has taken hold. Two-handed weapons remain the power they once were, while shields are diminished. Unfortunately, the bug/error that most contributed to ruining the Warband experience remained, i.e. the lack of weight of objects: seeing a man in full armor armed with a two-handed sword dodging bullets and then jumping, catching a knight is an embarrassing thing to say the least, especially in those servers where respawn times are very slow. Considering the high mortality in the game even for ridiculous causes, such as improbable headshots at tens of meters or sword blows thrown at random by those who walk around you by continuously pressing the attack button, it is easy to understand how the line between fun and frustration is dangerously narrow. Staying on the subject, lag and problems on the server front are unfortunately still at the orders of the game, albeit in less massive quantities than in the past, while the crashes have fortunately been reduced.", "date": "2011-05-11", "grade": "6.8"}
