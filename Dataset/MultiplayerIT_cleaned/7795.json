In fact, the Paradox Interactive game still enjoys excellent health, thanks to the double support from the modder community and, obviously, from the ~official~ development team, which has continued to churn out new features to add to the (already potentially infinite) basic version of the game. After the expansion The Republic, seen at the beginning of 2013, the time has also come for The Old Gods, a new series of game content with which Paradox hopes to make us add more hours to the conspicuous total amount of time spent in front of Crusader Kings II. To do so, he decided to go against the grain of The Republic, in the way we're about to see. Sons of Odin In the period following the year 1000 that we have had the opportunity to experience so far in Crusader Kings II, Europe was certainly not an example of civilization, but the flourishing of the republics boded well for what would later have been the exit of populations since the Middle Ages. With The Old Gods, instead, we go back in time 200 years, arriving to Anno Domini 867 to be exact: a particularly turbulent period for the entire continent, but above all for those who found themselves having to deal with populations like those vikings. A particularly complex geopolitical situation therefore, which will lead us as a first consequence to remain even more alert towards our neighborhood. Not to mention the religious question: if before only Christians and Muslims were involved, now the arrival of paganism brings with it a whole series of implications, which will see even more often different territories joining in the fight against a common enemy, under the flag of the same faith. If in The Republic the military component took a back seat to that dedicated to trade, The Old Gods completely overturns this characteristic of the previous expansion, enticing the player who controls one of the new populations to become a warmonger in every way. Among the Nordic populations, for example, the king is frowned upon if he remains inactive for too long, also risking developing a malus applied to Prestige, one of the parameters linked to the figure of our alter-ego in the game and his relationship with vassals. The problem is that to enter into conflict the presence of a casus belli is necessary, i.e. a justification which is however easier to obtain now, thanks to the opportunity to start a war of religion, invading territories such as the British ones ( still far from being united) by exploiting their military power. Remaining on the Nordic theme, the local kings may also decide to have the ambition to subjugate a larger area to their will, such as Denmark or Sweden, thus giving themselves a pretext to invade their neighbors without too many compliments, in what is a practically endless series of riots. Still with regard to the casus belli, there is also the possibility of using the members of one's council to carry out various tasks, including that relating to the ad hoc fabrication of pretexts to claim a certain territory. Looting what a passion After having conquered regions not belonging to their area of origin, as we said, the pagan populations will reveal little inclination to manage them, preferring the possibility of exploiting them in any way, obtaining as much as possible in terms of resources to feed the accounts in the own zones. To do this, Paradox has introduced the raid system, thanks to which we tell our units to raid around the region where they are, to bring home the loot we need. Not without consequences, of course, consisting in the possibility of developing a justified hatred towards us and the birth of pro-independence factions. But never mind, because if it is true that in 867 we find ourselves with a powerful army, as history teaches us, over time the harvest will prove to be fundamental in resisting the growing attack by the Christians against the pagan populations, destined to to disappear. Beyond the novelties of The Old Gods closely related to the latter, such as the possibility of taking concubines and making human sacrifices, the expansion also adds various elements to the basic gameplay mechanics of Crusader Kings II, giving further space to modders to work on their projects. The Old Gods is the icing on the cake of Crusader Kings 2. A must for fans of the Paradox game", "date": "2013-06-07", "grade": "8.5"}
