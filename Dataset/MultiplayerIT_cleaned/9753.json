It is no coincidence that in recent months Electronic Arts has often stated that the PC version of FIFA 11 would have been up to its counterpart for 360 and PS3. Well, even if the promise has not been completely kept, there has been a leap forward and finally even PC users can enjoy the manual control and the 360-degree control that has radically changed the EA Sports series Relatively better Finally, even the PC has a FIFA next gen but already from the first moments of the game it is clear that this version is closer to FIFA South Africa 2010 World Cup than to FIFA 11 for consoles. Of course, the models are more detailed and rich in polygons and the physics have improved to some extent, but some problems related to artificial intelligence remain, such as the goalkeeper who sometimes paralyzes himself in an unbelievable way in the face of rather predictable headers. It also happens to see the defense running on the wing even if the action is directed towards the goal and often the opponents persevere in direct and self-defeating tackles that they turn the field into a pinball machine. Fortunately, things are better in attack with excellent coordination of the players who launch effectively on the wing and, if well positioned on the pitch, are reactive and ready to receive through balls and rebounds. However, the defects become relative if we compare this FIFA with the last computer incarnation whose shortcomings were such as to arouse strong criticism both from the players and from the specialized press. In fact, before examining the methods and differences compared to the console edition, it is good to specify that FIFA 11 for PC is a valid football title that finally brings the manual and completely free control system that revolutionized the EA series to an overlooked user. Sports. We are not 11 FIFA 11 allows the player to manage the player database and to create new ones with the appropriate graphic editor. On the playful side, we can obviously throw ourselves into a tournament in no time but we can also take on the coaching mode that allows you to manage the team and play or simulate matches by dealing only with the managerial aspect. Furthermore, the title offers us the possibility of playing as a single champion through the professional mode. Unfortunately this feature is still to be fixed, and is obviously inferior to the console counterpart which allows you to play 11 against 11, and this is reflected in the multiplayer mode which, while allowing you to simulate a real game, is as far from reality as you can imagine. In fact, the camera behind you, which during the run with the ball becomes a sort of shaky handycam a la Gears of War, largely limits the frontal view. But the problems don't spare even the dynamic camera which should allow us to observe a large part of the field when we don't have ball possession. In fact, the view is so distant from the player as to prevent any type of identification with the player and does not rotate effectively during the front changes that see the ball splashing across the field. And the problem is exacerbated when it is necessary to understand where the offside line is or when the ball lifts too much and the visual marker that should signal the point of the fall ends up outside the view of the camera. But if nothing else, in single player pro mode, the AI isn't bothered by our player switches and is much more coordinated and a pleasure to watch. Furthermore, despite the flaws, it is certainly an interesting mode, a variation to experiment with and a future perspective that could lead to a new way of understanding football video games. Sure, as long as you have an organized group or a clan since coordinating several random players from the network is practically impossible. FIFA 10.1 The physicality of the players is excellent. You can feel it during shoulder-to-shoulder tackling and even just watching player animations. In fact, the movements are decidedly softer and more credible than the past edition and to a minimum extent they are even better than the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa. For the rest, spectacular crowds and not particularly convincing collisions included, from a technical point of view we are faced to the console title released last year, with the obvious possibility of setting very high resolutions that improve the shot d'general eye. Pleasant to look at therefore, and relatively fluid even with the minimum requirements, but all the novelties of FIFA 11 are missing. The new models are missing, and the markedly misshapen old ones are not exactly the best to see, and also all the new details and new facial textures that are present in the new FIFA for consoles. Predictably, the new system linked to player statistics is also not present and the ball does not always react in a plausible way. In fact, in certain situations the ball appears too light and the physics linked to the touch of the ball is lower than that of FIFA 11 even using manual control. And this unfortunately invalidates the tackles which are practically inevitable given that it is almost impossible to dribble without using feints or progressions. Furthermore, all those additional physical variables are missing, such as pro passing, which have given FIFA 11 for consoles an edge. But the least understandable lack, given that the voices were sampled in any case, concerns the audio commentary. And it's not just a question of the quantity or quality of the samples. In fact, all too often, what comes out of the commentators' mouths has absolutely nothing to do with what happens on the pitch and the direct consequence is a vertical collapse, obviously downwards, of the football atmosphere. In any case, the sound sector includes sideline vocals, several choirs and the usual excellent selection of rock, pop and indie. In addition, the stadium speaker announces player changes and underlines goals in the language of the teams playing the match.", "date": "2010-10-07", "grade": "7.5"}
