For this new release, however, SEGA has decided to mix the cards on the table and transform the arcade racer par excellence into a ... managerial. Well, a sort of managerial: let's say more of a simple ~clicker~, that is the type of product that asks the player simply to touch the screen again and again, observing any progress in exchange for little effort. However, the incipit is intriguing: the taxi company that has always been the protagonist of the franchise is sailing in bad waters and there is a need to get it back on track; also and above all due to ruthless competition from a technological point of view, that represented by a rich unscrupulous entrepreneur who will not fail to make fun of us for the pitiful state of our fleet. In short, we will have to get busy, but how exactly? Taking as many customers around the city as possible and getting them to their destinations quickly? Sure, yes, but indirectly: just touch the customer's icon on the screen and one of our taxis will run to pick him up and take him to his destination in a few moments, collecting the money automatically. Too, too simple In short, the gameplay of Crazy Taxi Gazillionaire is incredibly simple and immediate: just touch the icons on the screen, ~exploding~ the taxi-airships of the competition as needed, to ensure that our coffers are gradually filled with money. How to use it? Primarily by upgrading our cars so as to allow them to obtain greater bonuses when a certain modifier appears on the screen. Secondly, by buying new taxis for the taxi drivers that we will have unlocked in the meantime, as they become more and more shrewd and determined to help us get back on top. At some point, therefore, we will find ourselves making a lot of those touches on the screen, because we will have a rather rich fleet. Our cars will draw crazy trajectories, occasionally performing spectacular stunts in favor of points and gradually increasing the amount of compensation. That's all? Yes, that's all. It's clear and obvious that a product like Crazy Taxi Gazillionaire is suitable for the most carefree and impromptu game sessions, when we can't guarantee either time or concentration for our smartphone or tablet. The merits of the game lie mostly in the cel-shaded graphics, which recall the atmospheres of the original arcade, and of course in the soundtrack signed by the Offspring, although those punk rock songs do not fit this latest interpretation of the franchise.", "date": "2017-06-09", "grade": "5.0"}
