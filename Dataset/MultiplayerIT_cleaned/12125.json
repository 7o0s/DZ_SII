{"name": "Football Manager Campionato 2007", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/football-manager-campionato-2007.html", "text": "We want to start our review with a criticism: in fact, the real point that can be made to the game developed by Microjocs, under license from Codemasters, is that certainly a title that has always been complex and profound like Football Manager 2007 Championship is ill suited to the mobile market, of quick matches perhaps on board the subway or bus, between one stop and another. This objection certainly has its reason for being, but it's also true that in the end the road test is what counts and we assure you we were overwhelmed, twenty minutes waiting at the barber's and mid-season away with Udinese . The time to devote to Football Manager Championship 2007 is necessary, especially if you have never played a title in the series before. There are many options, in some cases perhaps too many, and therefore the learning curve is quite steep but once you get the hang of the various menus and sub-menus you will be able to manage your team quickly. We will be able to choose whether to start playing with a formation that refers to the 2007 football season, therefore with real players, or whether to lead a fantasy team. First of all, we will have to set up the team with its game form, enter special training sessions taking into account the progress of the season and, after thoroughly consulting the squad available to us, go to the transfer market to place a few shots and maybe grab a young talent. rather than an established but very expensive champion. In addition to establishing the type of game that our team will try to set up on the field, we will have to learn to organize everything that team managers or top management usually deal with. We are talking about sponsorships and infrastructure management, such as the stadium, the parking lot, the training ground, the gym, to name a few. The administration of these aspects is essential given that if well exploited they will give us strong collections, just think of parking tickets or tickets paid for by spectators. The availability of a good training field and a well-stocked gym will only increase the capabilities of our team. The matches will be the key to our success, we will always have to face them with the right attention. Football Manager Championship 2007 lets us choose whether to skip them, and go directly to the result of the match, or view the match told by short sentences of text or view it in two dimensions. These last two ways allow us to intervene in the match in progress to make adjustments to our formation. We will always obtain the fundamental information in the management of the club via email, in fact through a special menu we will be notified of all the sponsorship offers, or the completion of the works of some structures, or market contacts. We almost forgot that many options can be delegated to the management by the AI of the game, allowing us to concentrate all efforts on our team and its method of play. From the point of view of criticism we can only highlight the fact that in the absence of an official license of the numerous championships present all the names of both the teams and the players are crippled, so we will find ourselves challenging Verona Gold, Milan Blues and Genovese and play against Inzeghe, Juliu Croz, Recube, Rouniy and Roneldu. Fortunately, the editor allows us to modify them completely. Technically the Codemasters product is valid even if based on fixed screens it doesn't need too much to hit, the studied interface still proves effective.
