With the complicity of the postponement of the release in our parts of the new console produced by Sony compared to North America, the version of the Young Horses title we are dealing with today is in fact the one for PlayStation 4. Not bad though, because net of a 'additional wait that should still be short, today remains a more than valid opportunity to take a look at Bugsnax in full. Unveiled at the Future of Gaming event last June, the new effort of the Octodad developers: Dadliest Catch was able to immediately carve out a fair amount of space among the games expected on the new generation. Part of the credit undoubtedly also goes to the distribution policy with which Sony has decided to bring Bugsnax to PlayStation 5, where the adventure will in fact arrive free of charge for owners of a PlayStation Plus subscription. Those who want to buy it will instead have to pay 24, 99 euros or 19.99 euros, depending on the desired platform (PlayStation or PC). That said, get ready: the hunt is about to begin! The plot: a journalist at home The only game mode of Bugsnax is represented by the main story, within which you can catapult almost immediately from the game's minimal menu. Our role is that of a journalist who through a video is invited by the explorer Elizabeth Megafig on Snaktooth Island, an island populated by the creatures that give the adventure its name. Arrived on the spot, the protagonist discovers that in the meantime Elizabeth and his partner have gone missing, while the rest of the grumpus (the humanoid creatures that populate the world of Bugsnax) who had built a village on the island have moved away from the community to remain alone. The only one who is trying to fix things is Filbo, our first meeting, with whom we will try to bring back to the village all the grumpus who have abandoned it. Meanwhile, the protagonist's journalistic soul will also lead him to investigate the reasons for Elizabeth's disappearance. To do this, of course, we will have to go hunting for the bugsnax found on Snaktooth Island, half-insect and half-snack creatures to catch thanks to the tools that we will gradually insert into our inventory. In terms of progression, the story proceeds in a similar way to that of an RPG, even if Bugsnax obviously cannot fit into this genre: each grumpus has a series of tasks to assign us before deciding to return to Snaxburg and indulge in the our questions, thus composing the main line of missions. It is also possible to obtain a series of secondary tasks from the grumpus, thanks to which we can obtain bonuses such as increasing the space in our inventory or discovering more details about the characters and the island. Focusing only on the main storyline, the duration of Bugsnax is around seven hours, with the possibility of increasing the amount of time played by also tackling the other requests of the local inhabitants, or dedicating yourself to catching all the bugsnax on the island . From this point of view, the work of Young Horses to entice us to get to know the characters more can be said to be successful: each grumpus has its own well-defined personality and many of them also have some ~secret~ to deal with, thus managing to raise the player's interest beyond the main storyline. The latter is quite linear and does not offer particular twists, on the contrary leaving a large part of the epilogue to be guessed before it presents itself before our eyes. What in recent weeks had even been defined by someone as Bugsnax's horror vein is in reality made up of a few moments a little darker than what one might expect from such a colorful title. In terms of level of ~fright~ and general atmosphere, these moments reminded us a bit of the dear old Scooby-Doo: nothing that can therefore really be compared to a horror film. Compared to a normal game dedicated to the youngest, Bugsnax nevertheless touches on topics such as homosexuality, marital crises and cannibalism in some moments, with dialogues and jokes that therefore wink at the older ones. The gameplay: catalog and capture The gameplay of Bugsnax revolves around the bugs-snack that we find around Snaktooth Island, divided into areas that the player can unlock by progressing through the main story. Each area of the island has its own different biome, to which the creatures that we can find in it are also associated: from the woods to the beach, from the desert to the mountains, everything around us is populated by thesestrange beings mostly cute and cuddly, but also aggressive in the wildest areas. To capture them it is necessary to use the tools in our possession, together with a pinch of ingenuity. Figuring out how to catch a particular bugsnax is actually always quite simple. Being able to do it as well, except in some cases where it is necessary to plan an interaction between two different bugsnaxes to succeed in the enterprise. In general, the level of difficulty is therefore quite affordable for everyone, making Bugsnax a game that can also be enjoyed by the youngest from this point of view. Adults, on the other hand, could find the activities to be completed all too simple and monotonous, even in the face of a plot that, as already mentioned, does not shine for originality. Among the fundamental objects present in the protagonist's equipment we find a camera, to be used to analyze the food-insects, thus detecting their weak points that can be exploited. These are also noted in the in-game journal along with other information, letting perfectionists know how many bugsnax are missing from those scattered across the island. Finding them all is not exactly a very simple undertaking, it must be said, as some of them are able to hide between ceilings, vaults and cracks. The missions that are entrusted to us by the characters controlled by the CPU consist for the vast majority of the time in capturing a bugsnax to feed it to the grumpus on duty, thus gradually managing to convince it to collaborate with our investigation. Every time they eat one of these particular insects, the grumpus see a part of their body transform into the snack they just swallowed. Taking advantage of this feature, going on in the game the protagonist can also decide which part of the body to transform into snacks, thus changing the appearance of all the other grumpus on the island to his liking in agglomerations of chips, hamburgers and various fruit in some cases even a little creepy. Playstation 4 trophies Bugsnax arrives on PlayStation 4 with twenty-eight Trophies. In addition to the usual platinum type, the list consists of six gold, ten silver and eleven bronze. To unlock all the objectives, the player has to work hard, given the need to discover and capture all the bugsnax races found on the island. Graphics and sound The atmosphere of Bugsnax described in the previous paragraphs is supported more than well by the colorful style given by Young Horses to his own effort. Starting from the grumpus we find creatures quite curious in their nature, also supported by an excellent quality English-language dubbing. Those who find themselves uncomfortable with the absence of spoken Italian can find subtitles, so as not to miss any element of the plot.Grumpus aside, the stars of Bugsnax also in terms of graphics are undoubtedly the little creatures that we find on Snaktooth Island. Among over one hundred different species scattered in the various areas of the island, the developers have had the opportunity to indulge themselves in numerous ways to blend together insects and foods of various types, arriving at hilarious results such as the pizza-moth or the praying mantis made up of Mexican food spicy. Each bugsnax also emits a verse of its own, which makes it unmistakable to the player's ears: once you get to know the scaraburger, you will hardly get his bonga-bonga-bonga out of your ears. The soundtrack is also of good quality, as anticipated at the time by the song by Kero Kero Bonito with which Bugsnax presented himself to the world.", "date": "2020-11-09", "grade": "7.0"}
