{"name": "Battlefield 5", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/battlefield-5-recensione.html", "text": "A few days after the first encounter with Battlefield V, we have finally arrived at the review of the new chapter of the DICE war series, a first-person shooter that retraces the path of its predecessor by pushing on increasingly articulated multiplayer battles, an episodic campaign with a marked historical breath and several poetic licenses, sometimes rather pushed as in the case of the holographic viewfinder. But although the structure is almost unchanged, the new Battlefield is transformed in substance by adopting new mechanics, abilities, more articulated maps, rebuildable fortifications and some important changes to the Large Scale Operations which acquire a broader scope, that of a great battle fought on more days. Among other things, a new mode is not missing, while the aesthetic customization is enriched and will be extended to vehicles at the beginning of December, all seasoned with the entry into the field of female soldiers, already promised with the previous chapter. However, the Firestorm Royale mode is missing, the fundamental one to get noticed in the current panorama of multiplayer shooters, destined however to arrive later with the cooperative and several other contents, this time free. And it's a big change for a franchise that has accustomed us to tons of paid DLC and which this time is also giving up prize boxes. Seemingly small but decisive gameplay changes As anticipated, the gameplay structure of Battlefield 5, already available with EA Access and arriving on November 20 for all the others, is very similar to that of the previous chapter, with the combat, including that aboard vehicles, which is excellent , with precise hitboxes and 60hz tickrate, as well as immediately familiar to anyone familiar with the DICE series featuring large 64-player battles, lots of vehicles, differentiated recoil for each weapon, non-simulated but believable physics of shots, destructible buildings and a definitely satisfying and intuitive gunplay. All this remains at the heart of the experience, but it is enough to play a game of Battlefield 5 to feel the weight of some important changes to the basic game mechanics, changes that concern the limitation of the spontaneous healing abilities of the soldiers and the reduced availability of ammunition . These are two factors that reinforce the line-up game, absolutely necessary to deal with modalities that, as we will see, have become more articulated and complex. But with the new chapter, teamwork also grows, thanks to the possibility of reviving our three companions regardless of which of the four available classes we are impersonating. Without a doctor, men's health is rapidly reduced to a thread that keeps them hanging feebly from life, but autonomy still grows and guarantees greater chances of survival even without the need to have all the classes available. These, however, remain fundamental and are even more so in the case of the engineer who is faster than the others in the reconstruction of the fortifications (also among the most important additions) and is the only one capable of building emplacement weapons which significantly increase the ability to defend an outpost. Among other things, the weapons of the support have suppression effects and allow you to reveal enemies for a few moments, like the scout, provided you choose the gunner specialization which, like the others, is unlocked at grade eight. However, some advantages of the basic role are missing which should not be underestimated, as in the case of the assault which allows you to find some more ammunition from the corpses of the enemies. But this does not detract from the evolution that guarantees weapons, explosives, anti-tank rifles and skills that extend to vehicles, which in turn are characterized by a skill tree that recovers some upgrades already seen in the past in the series and adds new ones. In short, nothing is missing to guarantee immediate game possibilities and a good sense of progression, this time seasoned with greater aesthetic customization that will soon extend to vehicles. War on a grand scale: between new and old modes Battlefield 1 has taken the first step towards a multiplayer that seeks to emulate a large realistic battle, introducing the mode Large Scale Operations which is still very played despite the not always perfect design and mechanics that do not do much to push on team play. All of this, thankfully, gets better with Battlefield 5, and it's not just thanks to changes to the core mechanics. The merit also goes to the large maps which, between cities, mountains and rebuildable fortifications, are more varied and better structured than those of the previous chaptersoriginators, giving us more exciting battles even where there are no transcendental changes in the modes as in the case of Frontline, Deathmatch, Domination and Conquest. Instead, some things change for Rush who gives way to Breakthrough and asks us to conquer two or three objectives at the same time to allow us to proceed from sector to sector until victory. It goes without saying that also in this case the goal of DICE is to foster teamwork, which is also fundamental for the Air Force which instead revolves around parachuting onto enemy lines to recover bombs and place them on sensitive targets. And the latter mode extends to 64 players when it falls within the sections of Large Scale Operations, which in Battlefield 5 does not change its name but is transformed into substance. In the new version there are in fact different modalities that intertwine with a narrative structure that marks three days of battle, each of which can chain parachute jumps, objectives to conquer, fronts to maintain and structures to destroy, guaranteeing an experience that engages and rewards every effort. In fact, the side that manages to conquer all the objectives gets a bonus on the following day, while in the event that the third round of clashes ends in a draw, sudden death is accessed with a shrinking map and no rebirth, even if it is possible to roll up comrades as long as they are alive. A nice change that, combined with 8 large maps that crop and modify according to the mode, works great, forcing us to follow the movements of a fluid front that catapults us into a real battle, between tanks, fighters that storm the ground of lead and enemy soldiers raining down from the sky. A real show, provided you accept the well-known anomalies of a decidedly complex respawn system and bear the fact that in some maps the snipers have too many advantages, with Fantozzian scores reminiscent of those of previous Battlefield vehicle exploits. On the other hand, however, the means seem well balanced and even the most open of maps does not lack hills, canals, cracks in the rock and buildings that leave the possibility for each class to hide, gain ground and outflank the enemy. Technical compartment: a pleasure for the mind, eyes and ears Battlefield V's sumptuous audio doesn't miss a beat between well-differentiated samples for each weapon, battlefield screams translated into Italian, realistic ambient noises and an exceptional soundtrack that incorporates the melodies of Battlefield 1942 hitting the old ones straight to the heart fans of the series. The work done is undoubtedly up to the technical sector which still lacks RTX support, but gets along very well without it. Reflections on the nacelles, breathtaking textures, expanses of burning flowers, hundreds of leaves that rise with explosions, bombers in flames and excellent quality effects literally invest our eyes, inevitably increasing an already high involvement. And things get even more spectacular in the countryside with real-time reflections, breathtaking wooded areas, castles and huge structures immersed in a thick blizzard. In some situations the degree of environmental destructibility is minimal, but in these cases we are repaid with immense constructions that guarantee greater variety in missions that manage to effectively combine good freedom of action with a strong common thread. And it is thanks to these elements that after so many years Battlefield has finally begun to mesh with the single player, already valid in Battlefield 1 and even more refined in this chapter which takes up the heroic tones of the previous one adding humor, characterization of the characters, greater variety and longer cutscenes. All supported by a slightly higher challenge which, however, fails to compensate for a very short duration. And it is here that we must necessarily talk about the upcoming content that will be important to allow Battlefield 5 to face a direct competitor who has given up on the campaign but who has become particularly fierce on the multiplayer front. It is no coincidence that DICE has postponed the launch for a month to make sure that everything is working properly, especially with regard to the balancing of the changes made to some game modes. And it is for this same reason that according to Florian Le Bihan, a former professional and head of basic mechanics with whom we had a chat in Stockholm, the decision was made to wait until March to make Firestrike Royale available. In fact, the mode will arrive with the third act of Tides of War, the new online servicededicated to Battlefield which will introduce free daily quests, new maps, modes and content on a regular basis starting with a training map, a new war story dedicated to the Tiger tank and a new map, called Panzerfaust, which boasts the same quality of those present. Furthermore, between here and March, a Greek setting, cooperative missions and several other contents, such as the fifth war story, will also arrive, which will continue to arrive later.", "date": "2018-11-12", "grade": "9.0"}
