{"name": "Sacred 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sacred-2-recensione.html", "text": "On the good side or on the bad side The genre of games to which the Sacred saga belongs is the same as titles such as Diablo and Titan Quest, usually referred to as Hack and Slash. All game action happens in real time, and even in the pause menu, if you don't have the foresight to activate it in safe places, it is possible to be subjected to attacks from enemies. Sacred 2: Fallen Angel introduces the player to its game world through an excellent computer graphics movie, which partially narrates the events described above. Once finished, it's time to create the character with which to face the adventure, and it is already from this menu that we understand that the game leaves nothing to chance. Although it is not possible to create your own hero from scratch, Sacred 2: Fallen Angel offers six types of characters, each totally different from the other, with its own peculiarities and special abilities. Serafina is certainly the more balanced choice, especially recommended for beginners, even if she can only take the path of light, just like the Inquisitor, a sort of black magician, can only opt for the path of shadow. Apart from the two types mentioned above, the remaining characters can take both paths, even if the choice must be made at the time of their creation. Too bad that this important decision brings changes only to the plot of the game, and not for example to the way civilians relate to us, which will remain identical in both situations. The remaining selectable characters are the Shadow Warrior, that is the classic all-muscle ~beater~, the High Elf devoted to magic, the Dryad, an expert in magic and ranged weapons and to conclude the review there is also the Guardian of the Temple , a sort of cyborg powered by ~Energy T~. Each type of character has its own special moves and above all an exclusive mount, not to mention that many pieces of equipment are diversified for each class, making them wearable only by the one dedicated to it. Lastly, it is necessary to choose a patron deity, also linked to the type of path selected, which gives a certain special ability to the character. Map that fits you Very little time passes from the moment the confirmation button for the creation of the hero is pressed to the first fight. In fact, it only takes a few seconds to exit the dungeon in which Sacred 2: Fallen Angel opens to find yourself in the cemetery above and start dealing with the first enemies. In this sense, the control system is intuitive and completely mappable, even if far too static, especially using the Shadow Warrior, dedicated only to beating. All this takes place by pressing the left and right mouse buttons, the first of which allows you to perform a normal attack, while the second activates the selected special move. Obviously the keyboard serves as a support as a shortcut for the use of potions and various objects. Each defeated enemy bestows a certain number of experience points which fill the appropriate bar located at the top left which, once completed, allows the character to level up and increase their skills. Movement in the game world takes place in two ways: the first, certainly more comfortable and intuitive, is the one using the mouse, in fact it will be enough to hold down the left button and move the peripheral to go towards the selected direction, a bit like it happens from always in titles of this genre. The second method, a little more cumbersome, uses the arrow keys on the keyboard as if they were a directional pad. Camera control is initially delegated to the WASD keys, while other letters are used to open the various game menus, but as mentioned before, everything can be totally modified at will at any time. We need a satellite One of the first things that catches the eye when playing Sacred 2: Fallen Angel is the excellent graphics engine used, certainly impressive for the number of details and the quality of the textures on medium-high-end PCs and also excellently adaptable to PCs low-end, despite some sporadic slowdown in both cases and almost always in the city. The most striking details are those of the water, whose effect is among the best ever seen and above all the grass, capable of moving in contact with any element of the game. Just the grass plays an ingenious and at the same time disturbing role: in fact, it often happens to see it move due to an enemy who is approaching while the hero of the moment draws his weapons to discover shortly after that the phantom enemy was then an innocent Bunny. The problem is that all of this is not buoy freeg indeed, the game has far too many not yet resolved with the first patch, mostly graphic and decidedly frequent. The first impact with the map of Ancaria is decidedly disarming, partly due to its lack of clarity and partly due to its size. In fact, initially, by pressing the M key it is possible to view the entire map of the game in paper version and totally in black and white. Visiting it then everything takes on color and begins to become clearer, but for example the quick map allows you to see only the parts you have already visited. It all boils down to continuous road errors or ten-minute walks between various enemies and then realizing that a river is in the way and that it is necessary to go around on the opposite side. This is the only flaw related to the game world, because otherwise it is probably the best in terms of characterization and vastness ever seen in a game of this genre, outclassing even Oblivion in many ways. Nothing is missing in Ancaria: big cities, small towns, camps, quarries, dungeons of various types, rivers, seas, mountains, countryside and so on and so forth. Each territory has its typical fauna and its enemies that are divided into two types: normal enemies and champion enemies. The former, displayed with their name in white, are the classic enemies, while the latter, whose name appears in yellow, are a sort of evolution of the former, much stronger but which obviously give away many more experience points. Then there are also real bosses, whose killing often requires reasoned action and a certain tactic that often makes the brains stretch quite a bit. Spoiled for choice Sacred 2: Fallen Angel is literally littered with side quests, which allow you to gain experience and special items as well as ~disconnect~ from the main mission a little. Mention due for the quest starring the heavy-metal group Blind Guardian which requires you to find the musicians' epic instruments to then unlock their concert in the game! However, it is in the secondary missions and in the main quest that the real problem of this title lies: in fact, the plot is often narrated too lightly, making it almost a superfluous element, while the secondary quests are bestowed almost at random, without a logical connection that connects them to the world around them, reducing them to one way as another to gain experience points. Fortunately, however, the cities seem decidedly alive, with their day-night cycle (obviously present throughout the game) and with their inhabitants intent on daily chores, whether they are tending the fields, shopping or a simple walk. They also serve as a refreshment point and as a base. In fact, practically every city has a resurrection monolith, a sort of pillar which, once activated by clicking on it, allows you to restart from it every time the character falls in battle. In addition to this, the inhabited centers obviously have the various shops, often summarized in three types: the merchant, from whom to buy weapons, potions and equipment, the rune merchant, with whom to exchange the runes in our possession and finally the blacksmith, capable of forging weapons and giving them special abilities. Let's join forces for Ancaria! The sound in general is well done, starting from the effects of weapons, magic and environmental sounds up to the dubbing, sometimes capable of eliciting a few laughs for the phrases shouted by the various characters during the fights. Here, however, another small drawback of this Sacred 2: Fallen Angel emerges, inexplicably in fact the voices of the protagonists are in Italian, while those of the enemies are in English. Nothing irreparable, but a decidedly inconsistent choice for the purposes of identification. The music during the fights is predominantly metal-oriented, and often starts and ends randomly. It therefore happens to walk alone while the combat music still comes out of the PC speakers. The game difficulty can be selected from three types: bronze, silver and extreme, the first of which is accessible to all, the second more recommended for veterans and the third a real challenge since with the death of the character it is canceled from the disc fixed. Multiplayer is one of the cornerstones of Sacred 2: Fallen Angel. In fact, it is possible to choose whether to play on the internet (subject to free registration) or whether to participate in a game on the local network. The modes offered satisfy even the finest and most demanding palates ranging from the ~campaign~ mode that allows up to five players to experience the game's story together up to the ~player vs player~ mode that allowsto challenge your opponents in place of the various monsters, then moving on to the free mode, the true heart of the game, in which up to sixteen players can explore the world of Ancaria with their own character and a special island for multiplayer. The servers and their management seem to work well for the moment, even if it is advisable to always play with friends since entering a game at random is decidedly disorienting due to the size of the map. Comment Sacred 2: Fallen Angel is a good game, and certainly the worthy successor to the first chapter that everyone expected. However, it does not bring with it news worthy of note or particular innovations, perhaps even not wanting to distort the now proven formula of hack and slash. We are not even dealing with a title free from defects, and those few are decidedly annoying for the gaming experience, not so much for the bugs, which can be solved with future patches, but for the superficiality with which the game plot is narrated and the related quests, elements that are fundamental in titles such as the one under examination. Despite this Sacred 2: Fallen Angel can be played with pleasure, from start to finish and without ever tiring particularly, especially thanks to its great variety and care for the world of Ancaria. Definitely a title that cannot be missing in the soft library of fans of the genre. especially in light of the incredible budget price with which it is sold.
