{"name": "Space Junkies", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/space-junkies-recensione.html", "text": "Space Junkies tries to carve out a space within a vein, that of competitive shooters in virtual reality, which currently sees some titles clearly above the competition. However, the interpretation proposed by Ubisoft Montpellier tries to differentiate itself from Firewall Zero Hour-style atmospheres, to cite an illustrious example, by focusing on the immediacy and simplicity of an experience that lends itself very well to impromptu use, when you feel like to play a quick game without having too much time available. From this point of view, the formula works great: after a quick tutorial to familiarize yourself with the control system, you find yourself catapulted into a series of quick matches involving from two to four participants, with the possibility of customizing matches only where you can invite friends. A solution that, a few days after its release, is very easily explained: despite the cross-platform between PC and PlayStation 4, the current Space Junkies community is not particularly numerous and it is a bit difficult to fill the lobbies. The developers therefore wanted to avoid further fragmentation of the user base, waiting (hopefully!) for better times, which however we imagine will only come with a price cut or perhaps a transition to the free-to-play model. Controls and structure Let's start with the basics: the Space Junkies control system has few defects, indeed it adapts very well to the needs of virtual reality, with several alternative possibilities to perform the same maneuvers and the ability to offer fluid and gradual movements even in the most agitated situations. thus avoiding triggering episodes of motion sickness. The view can be controlled by moving the head, but with significant support from the analog sticks to instantly turn forty-five degrees left or right and to adjust the height of the flight in a zero-g environment but with only a minimum of inertia . The collection and throwing of weapons, as well as the activation of any secondary tools and the shield, is instead activated using the back buttons, triggers included, and aiming by pointing the DualShock controller in the desired direction, almost always assisted by a laser sight . The tutorial we mentioned at the beginning allows you to familiarize yourself with the commands through a real challenge in which we are first asked to correctly follow three-dimensional trajectories, then to hit as many dynamic targets as possible in order to score a certain minimum score . Once this is done, you can finally access the competitive modes, which as mentioned are generally represented by quick matches that adapt structurally to the number of participants, consequently presenting a cycle of options: one-on-one duels, team deathmatches, all against all and king of the hill. While the first three picks are basically based on the number of eliminations scored before time runs out, the last one involves collecting a crown and holding it for a certain number of seconds in order to get the points necessary for victory. In all cases, the prizes are represented by unlockable objects that allow you to modify tags, icons and other aesthetic aspects of the avatar. Playstation 4 trophies There are thirty-seven Trophies included in Space Junkies, and they are all obviously related to performance during online matches. We will be able to unlock the achievements by winning our first games in all available modes, flying a certain number of kilometers, making a certain number of kills with each weapon and achieving victory in all six maps included in the package. Gameplay and technical realization In short, the amount of Space Junkies content is sufficient to guarantee a fair variety, together with a battle royale-style approach to gameplay, similar to Fortnite: at the beginning of each game and at respawn you start with a random weapon and little ammunition , therefore it happens that you have to move around the arena to get another more effective one, and it is in this situation that the most dangerous sorties by the opponents can occur. One-on-one duels often result in waiting plays where you lurk in a raised area of the map, waiting for your rival to show up and then target him with everything you have. However, the design of the six available scenarios lends itself very well to evasive maneuvers, thanks to the presence of numerous tunnels, moving objects (even dangerous ones, see the hydraulic presses) and obviously bonuses through which you can recover health points and armor after a firefight in which we almost lost our lives.The situation becomes decidedly more eventful with four participants, given that it becomes complicated to hide and therefore happen to run from one side to the other, looking for shelter and then turning around and returning fire, provided that someone else has not joined in the meanwhile in the fight. The arsenal includes very different and well-characterized weapons, ranging from pistols to light machine guns, from Gatlings to missile launchers, via shotguns and railguns. We therefore remain simple but with an eye to concreteness: a discourse that also applies to the technical realization, which uses binaural audio to precisely position the effects in three-dimensional space and brings into play sufficiently clean and detailed polygonal models, although often a bit generic and lacking in character. The impeccable fluidity of the experience is in any case the daughter also and above all of conservative choices in terms of textures and effects, aspects that seemed functional to the action.", "date": "2019-04-05", "grade": "7.0"}
