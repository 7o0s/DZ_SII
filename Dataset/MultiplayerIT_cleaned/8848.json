Precisely to take advantage of the tow of the name of this last episode, the present chapter for 3DS has abandoned the original title of Ace Combat 3D to become known as Ace Combat: Assault Horizon Legacy: let's find out, therefore, if it was a simple commercial move or if this chapter also offers some significant variation on the theme. Automatic pilot The illusion that Ace Combat: Assault Horizon Legacy shares the same taste for storytelling as its big brother on consoles fades within seconds of selecting Campaign mode from the main menu - to say the story is sketchy is an understatement when it isn't. introduced by any sequence and finds space only in the insipid text boxes that accompany the briefing of the first mission. The player plays the role of a pilot of the Scarface squadron, engaged in war against an opposing faction, and this is practically all that is given to know during the 23 missions that make up the adventure: what is the conflict, what are the parties involved, the background of the characters and so on are all ~details~ that Ace Combat: Assault Horizon Legacy does not bother to clarify, making the progress in the Campaign a cold succession of objectives that really leaves a lot to be desired. Certainly the narrative system has never been the strong point of the Namco Bandai brand, but when such a paucity is accompanied by a structure and variety of missions that can also be decidedly improved, a rather difficult mix is created to swallow even for the die-hard dogfight fans. The tasks entrusted to the user are resolved in the vast majority of cases with the mere destruction of all the objectives on the screen, with some imperceptible variations on the theme: a truly indulgent challenge rate also thinks about throwing fuel on the fire, which allows you to complete entire missions in a matter of minutes without breaking a sweat. Tellingly, at the end of our Campaign session, the clock showed a playing time of just two and a half hours, and that went by without ever missing an objective or being knocked down by opponents once. Things improve slightly by increasing the difficulty, but the flatness of the gameplay always remains the same, despite the fact that the product is anything but stingy with content. By completing the tasks, scenarios are unlocked in the appropriate Challenge mode, and credits are earned to spend in the hangar to buy new planes or upgrade those already in your possession in terms of equipment, maneuverability, armor and so on : there is also some license for purely aesthetic personalization of the livery and cockpit, and paradoxically this is the only truly distinctive aspect, given that upgrading the statistics of your fighter does not seem to have any practical effect on its behavior in flight. The 3D effect Surely the clear skies that make up the daily bread of the game do not represent the best showcase for the three-dimensional component of the Nintendo portable: the elements on the screen are always rather scarce and mostly distant, therefore it is not possible to perceive a great sensation of depth, and indeed with the slider at its maximum you almost end up seeing double. By halving the 3D effect and using the internal camera, things go better, but in the long run it becomes preferable to play Ace Combat: Assault Horizon Legacy in the traditional way. What a sky there is Ace Combat: Assault Horizon Legacy is therefore largely a classic episode of the series, which pays for an evident lack of personality and a general carelessness, fueled by the few innovations brought to the gameplay. Directly from the console episode comes the possibility of loading a special indicator according to the ribs of an opponent, and then performing a special stunt to place himself directly at six o'clock and go practically without fail: an undoubtedly spectacular element, but which it also proves to be too powerful a weapon in the hands of a player already placed in conditions of clear superiority over the enemies. Again, when you are hooked by a missile, simply press the Y key together with the direction indicated on the screen to perform an evasive maneuver and easily avoid any attack.co. All too comfortable for a title that can undoubtedly be played, but without transmitting practically any emotion. It would have been nice to be able to test similar mechanics in a special multiplayer mode, but Namco Bandai's decision not to include it in the play package leaves a lot of bitterness in the mouth. At least from a technical point of view Ace Combat: Assault Horizon Legacy does not disappoint expectations, offering graphics that make good use of the potential of the Nintendo hardware, showcasing the cornerstones of the series: the planes are therefore perfectly made and cared for in all details , and they whiz within scenarios that are not detailed but decidedly extensive and framed by an almost always constant frame rate, which wobbles only in the presence of close-up explosions. Too bad that the cockpits appear very bare and neglected and that the game menus and the information box that occupies the touchscreen are characterized by a dated and also rather confusing look, but in general we can be satisfied with the work done by Namco Bandai. The sound, on the other hand, puts powerful and credible effects on the plate, anonymous but sufficiently fitting music and an English dubbing from the Z-series Top Gun which is not annoying in any case and indeed favors the feeling of involvement in the action.", "date": "2011-12-20", "grade": "6.6"}
