This ambitious work by Hideki Kamiya and the PlatinumGames is almost unanimously acclaimed within the genre, due to an almost unlimited dose of personality and its being a sort of splendid showcase of the skills of the Osaka team. Wonderful is, in a nutshell, a cornucopia of systems, quotations and ingenious gimmicks, so rich in merits that it can deal with any contender head-on. Being able to play it again on much more popular hardware with the knowledge of a possible (and well-deserved) resurgence warms our hearts, and we believe that there are very few video games that are as worthy of a second chance on the market. That said, we want to be completely honest with you: the Kickstarter dedicated to the Remaster version of the game was a fair bit of crap. Kamiya himself admitted that the project didn't need the extra funding to be completed, and that the platform was used more to win interest in the game and rekindle public interest than for actual fundraising. Not bad, given that the success of the thing eventually led to the promise of additional content for the future, but it is still an inappropriate use of Kickstarter, which could create unpleasant precedents. However, today we are not here to evaluate the behavior of the team, but the final product, therefore we will try to describe in detail the characteristics of this peculiar ~remaster~ (and the quotation marks are a must), and to be exact of the Nintendo version Switches. Wonderize review! a bit of history: ultra sentai The Wonderful 101 was born as the second title in Hideki Kamiya's ~superheroes trilogy~, a triptych of games that for now only partially exists in the head of the legendary director, given that the third video game of the group - recently unveiled under the name of Project GG - is still out, where the first is the fantastic Viewtiful Joe. In all respects, these are works inspired by the Japanese superhero universe, with Joe markedly influenced by Kamen Rider, the new upcoming project taken on by Ultraman, and The Wonderful 101 largely based on the Super Sentai. The latter are, to make it easy, groups of heroes committed to defending the earth from a mortal enemy (usually a classic alien invasion), which represented the original mold for very famous western series such as Power Rangers. In the case of The Wonderful 101, however, there are no origin stories in which team members obtain their powers: we immediately start in the middle of the action, with an already well-established team of one hundred heroes called the Wonderful 100, part of the group Land Defense Centinels. However, the fact that there is little space for the premises should not mislead, since the invasion of the fearsome GEATHJERK aliens is less stereotyped than one might believe, and The Wonderful 101 is a title with a significantly richer narrative than one might expect. could wait. It should be emphasized, however, that this is not a title where the story is a fundamental element: the Platinums have avoided taking themselves too seriously, creating a demented campaign most of the time, and almost alienating in its absurdity and in its excesses in some moments; everything is designed to enhance the spectacular nature of the action and the scenes, and fortunately the developers have succeeded in their intent, creating a very tasty and hilarious cocktail from start to finish (in particular the final peak is something crazy), also thanks to the caricatured personalities of the many protagonists involved. However, the element of the group related to the super sentai does not affect the plot alone: it is the core of the experience, around which the entire gameplay is built. And what a gameplay ladies and gentlemen. Gameplay: controlled chaos We didn't sand your gonads singing the praises of this work by PlatinumGames at the beginning of the article for a quirk: pad in hand (or, in this case, joycon in hand), The Wonderful 101: Remastered is one of the most amazing video games out there . The system that moves everything is a mixture of mechanics taken in part from the most well-known technical actions of the Japanese team, but the backbone is the possibility of performing complex actions by tracing signs with the right analog (or with the Switch touch screen ), from which most of the usable maneuvers start and develop. The first, and perhaps most significant, is the simple ability to switch weapons, as seven tools are unlocked in the game in combatexperience advancing in the campaign - fist, sword, pistol, whip, claws, hammer and bomb - to which are added other specials related to unlockable characters and secrets. Apparently it may seem like a simple more complicated version of the weapon switch of several other action games, yet the possibility of ~drawing~ is directly related to the number of characters used at that moment, to the consumption of special batteries for the use of maneuvers, to the ability to perform alternative actions - including lifting and throwing objects and enemies - to the game's elaborate combo system, and the constant need to use the right tool at the right time. In The Wonderful 101, in fact, switching from one weapon to another becomes at a certain point a sort of second nature, as if you were performing fighting game movements connected to each symbol used. Initially the gameplay does not appear very intuitive; things get better when you understand how you can enter complex inputs before activating each tool to activate special moves upon spawn, increase your damage multiplier by creating bigger weapons with more party members involved in the transformation, and even start of multiple combinations by activating signs for your companions to use weapons, while using the main one separately. It is a remarkable idea, which allows - once most of the available maneuvers have been unlocked - to indulge in virtuosity of rare beauty, not to mention that everything becomes even more challenging at the maximum unlockable difficulty, in which the passage of time no longer automatically slows down while drawing marks (at which point the ability to draw faster with extra skills and pressing one of the triggers becomes paramount). The only problem? The game is not always perfectly accurate in reading the will of the player, even if he executes very clear movements. In fact, it will often happen to you during the first few hours to unleash the whip while tracing a non-perfect symbol because the title read it like a scribble, and avoiding similar errors almost completely requires a lot of practice. Furthermore, for a matter of speed and precision, we strongly advise against the use of touch controls. Analog is much more reliable. A weapon for every situation For the record, if what has already been described seems complicated to you, hold on tight, because we have just scraped the surface of the combat system of this absurd video game. Remember when we talked about the need to switch weapons often? Well, because we weren't kidding: during the adventure The Wonderful 101 confronts the player with a plethora of extremely differentiated and easily recognizable enemies, with characteristics that make them very difficult to contain if you don't exploit their weaknesses. Large armored turtles must be smashed with the hammer before they can be attacked properly, certain alien mechs' lasers must be knocked back with the blade of the sword, fire moves absorbed with the punch, spiked armor eliminated with the whip, and so on, with lots of opponents with whom it is even mandatory to use defensive maneuvers carefully such as dodging or ~pudding parry~, to obtain a few seconds of stunning and the possibility of throwing in the air for a combo. The system even contains a group attack, which leads some of the Wonderful to climb their opponents and stun them after a while, and allows you to activate a sort of auto-aim in a game where the top view would make the classic targeting of enemies quite redundant. This puzzle element typical of most battles gives an impressive heterogeneity to the gameplay, further invigorated by the complexity of the general mechanics. The main flaw lies, as we have already mentioned, in the very poor accessibility of the game, which not only does not bother to explain very well its more advanced mechanics with decent tutorials, but forces you to be constantly attentive to a considerable number of factors, from companions who can be stunned and thrown around the map even when the leader takes no damage (and they must be recovered or there is no raw material for transformations), battery consumption and recovery for moves and signs, up to the need to counter the opponents in a clever way to bypass their defenses. Add to all this a considerable aggressiveness of the enemy artificial intelligence even on normal difficulty, and a view from above that is often a little too close, and you will get a truly chaotic game at times, which could scare most. In short, TheWonderful 101 is a monstrously niche and elitist creature by nature, but we still advise you not to give in, learn the system slowly and not worry excessively about the end-of-mission score during the first hours (yes, the evaluations return as in most of the Platinum titles): slowly you will learn to manage the fights, and there are few action out there capable of making the player feel like a god at the level of this when the systems are mastered. Quality on Switch PlatinumGames' work shines not only during the classic battles, but also in the cutscenes, especially numerous during the stratospheric boss stages. ~Variety~ is the watchword for this game, and everything has been done to submerge the player with ever-changing situations, ranging from simple timed QTEs to platforming stages, passing through moments that bring the game closer to a shooter scrolling, and curious puzzles of easy resolution. The changes are constant and no one level is the same throughout the campaign, with some stages breaking up the pace really cleverly, and scattered clues that more or less always clearly indicate what to do to advance. In this version, however, even the dual-screen moments that made use of the WiiU paddone have been re-proposed, with an obvious but functional superimposition of the secondary screen on the action. Paradoxically, certain phases are even better usable this way, also thanks to the possibility of enlarging the second view as desired or playing with the split screen, however this is almost the only real praise that can be given to the remaster operation because ... this new version of The Wonderful 101 is to all intents and purposes a direct port, with very minor changes. In fact, the work of Kamiya and company has the same problems as the original related to the delirium of certain situations, the imperfect management of the camera and the non-crystalline tutorials, but they are minor flaws if we consider all the positive elements of the production. However, calling this new version ~Remaster~ is rather dishonest, because on Switch the performances are extremely similar to the original for WiiU, and only a handful of changes have been applied to the values of the upgrades to be purchased at the end of the mission (some previously available skills go now bought, while the costs of the two main defensive techniques have been enormously reduced). Overall, a decent job has been done: the game travels around a fairly stable 60 FPS - with some negligible drops in very hectic situations - at 1080p, and its cartoonish look has aged beautifully; pity that there do not seem to be any technical tweaks of any kind, and the Switch version appears identical to the one from which it all started. So it's time to reiterate it: we are dealing with a port, not an improved version of the original, so much so that some of the bugs have remained here too (we haven't found anything devastating, even if there have been a couple of moments in where bugs forced us to reload the last checkpoint, as happened on WiiU). Of course, it should be noted that the build we tested is the one that arrived to the backers a few days in advance, and that there will certainly be future corrective patches in addition to the one that will add extra content. Even forgetting the bugs, however, it remains clear that the work done is not particularly titanic, and we cannot overlook this thing in the review. Perhaps it is appropriate to make some final clarifications before closing: while the copies for Switch are stable and quite technically valid, it seems that on PC the game is not optimized perfectly, and more than one user has complained of frameskip problems ( curiously solvable with external apps), and of little consideration for the most powerful configurations (with the title that for some users is almost unplayable in 4K). We have not had the opportunity to test the PC port unfortunately and we cannot confirm, but given the testimonies it is perhaps better to wait for some corrections before jumping headlong on that version.", "date": "2020-05-12", "grade": "8.2"}
