{"name": "Cars: Motori Ruggenti", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/cars-motori-ruggenti.html", "text": "If the vast majority of cases wants games inspired by films of the genre to be structured in such a way as to slavishly follow the adventures already admired on the big screen, the reality for Cars is slightly different: the film itself is quite static (obviously we speak of settings, defining a car static would be comical), the story takes place between the Piston Cup tracks and the semi-abandoned town of Radiator Spring, once a major meeting point along Route 66 and now abandoned due to than a nearby and faster expressway. The game then begins in the months following the end of the film, the previous Piston Cup has been daringly assigned (obviously we don't say how, we don't want to ruin the film that we -obviously- recommend) and the time has come to prepare for a new season. The playing area is entirely represented by Radiator Spring and its surroundings: the city becomes the starting point of many missions and races, and in the same way, outings allow the protagonist, Lightning McQueen, to run into particular areas useful for increasing your ability at the time of driving or simply to compete against other cars residing in the area. The game is divided into chapters, each of these presents a series of missions to be accomplished to unlock the final event represented by one of the stages of the Piston Cup: as in a real motor racing championship, Lightning McQueen will find himself interspersing official races with training sessions , special missions and games of skill. While not offering particular novelties, the missions in the game act as an excellent diversion from the canonical races and are, except in some cases, devoted to improving the driving skills of the driver While not offering particular novelties, the missions present in the game act as an excellent diversion from the canonical races and are, except in some cases, devoted to improving the driving skills of the pilot, allowing the player to use wheel skids, turbos, jumps and so on in order to become the number one driver. As previously mentioned, not all the missions are limited to the growth of the driver but they offer fun off-roading linked to the more comical situations seen in the film: you will compete in reverse driving sessions, you will participate in the by now legendary raid to scare the tractors during the night and you will help Luigi to collect all those poor abandoned tires in the area around Radiator Springs. The real races are made up of two essential elements: the first is represented by the race itself, made up of 12 laps during which the objective will be to overtake as many cars as possible in order to be able to cross the finish line first; and the second element, equally important for victory, will be linked to the inevitable pit stop in which, thanks to a series of events along the lines of quick time events (press certain keys in a certain sequence, rotate the analog sticks, press several times a button to pump petrol,...) it will be possible to carry out all the operations related to the stop in the pits; obviously the shorter the time spent at the pit stops, the greater the chances of coming out on top once back on the track. As in the Disney tradition, the game offers a considerable amount of extra modes and elements to unlock: in addition to the story mode (backbone of the game) it will be possible to compete on any of the tracks present in the game, as if you were playing any racing game, in addition to the tracks, it will be possible to select one of all the cars present in the film (some of these, also in the Big Foot version, or raised and with very large wheels). Together with the arcade mode, it will be possible to compete in 1vs1 competitions, choosing from one of the many machines present in the game (and in the film). The list of modes is completed by the menu for unlocking events, characters and objects: in fact, during the game, depending on the victories obtained, you will get a whole series of points useful for buying objects from the shop. The list of objects present does not disappoint the expectations of Disney enthusiasts, in fact it will be possible to buy unpublished parts of the film, clips of the film itself (completely localized), cars to be used in arcade and duel modes, and finally sketches and concept art related to the birth of the movie Cars. Graphics and sound keep up with their cartoonish counterparts, certainly losing definition (the PS2 palette does not enhance the colors expressed by the film) and comic rhythm but all in all defending themselves admirably; the engine, on the other hand, does not suffer from particular frame drops apart from rare occasions of traffic on the track. If compared of course to the visual splendor of the film, the video game disfigures without half a termini, but it still proves to be an intelligently made product, created to fully satisfy very different categories of users ranging from children to teenagers, even going so far as to entertain more mature gamers. Cars is a pleasant game, one that can be played with a clear mind and without putting too much effort into it. Well made, well thought out and with lots of goodies to unlock especially for those who enjoyed the film. However, the game is not without flaws including, above all, excessive loading times and some problems related to re-spawn following off-track (often and willingly it reappears later than it should). Despite everything a good product, suitable - thanks to its versatility - for different age groups. Pros: Great for those who enjoyed the movie Long enough and fun to play Lots of extras to unlock Cons: Loading of biblical length Some minigames are a bit repetitive Some flaws in the design of the races Cars is available for GameCube, PC, PlayStation 2, Xbox and Xbox 360. The tested version is the one for PlayStation 2. Punctual as taxes (but decidedly more pleasant) the annual Disney film comes back in a video game version, ready to entertain young and old thanks to the particular game setting - a true trademark of THQ / Disney productions - which allows you to experience the game adventure in a complete way for the older ones and in a more simplistic version for the little ones who often and willingly rely on games of this kind to start their fledgling career as gamers. This year the turn to play is up to Cars: Motori Roaring, a highly appreciated animated film by the now well-known Pixar. The step from computer graphics to video games is often short, will it still be enough to make Cars a good game?", "date": "2006-11-06", "grade": null}
