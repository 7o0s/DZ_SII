Describing it is simple: it is an arcade flight simulator  la Ace Combat, or H.A.W.X if you prefer, set during the Second World War. On paper it has some respectable features, with six single player campaigns, the possibility of playing with arcade controls or more simulation (don't expect any of that, they are just less assisted), a competitive multiplayer based on skill in dogfights and various extras such as unlockable aircraft and a story to tie together the different missions. The problems come from playing. The first campaign is deadly boring. It's not nice to use the term ~boredom~, also because it is too subject to individual fluctuations, but in this case how else to describe practically empty maps where you have to fly from point A to point B fighting or dodging a handful of enemy planes? It's true that they don't last long, but it's also true that they never go out as they're flat. Fortunately we have the habit of finishing games before reviewing them, otherwise the final grade would have been miserably lower and penalizing. But let's keep talking about the first missions, which we haven't fully explored yet. The main problems are the lack of things to do and the use of slow and underperforming planes. We understand the need to introduce the game gently, but here we went too far; also because it is not that there are many concepts to understand. In short: entire missions dedicated to the bombing of one or two artillery positions, or to the shooting down of three enemy planes are not the best. Also, we tried to play on the medium difficulty level initially, but found it really too easy, which didn't bode well for the fun. We therefore opted for the medium/high level, where the challenge proved to be more reasonable, although certainly not impossible. This is why we advise you, if you are an expert player, to start immediately from this difficulty level or higher, otherwise Air Conflicts: Secret Wars will be a walk in health. Another big problem of the first maps is the general ugliness of the graphics. Why put the worst levels at the beginning? In some cases you find yourself flying over bare deserts drawn by poorly detailed textures and a flat geographical conformation that seems to come out of a bad PS2 game. Luckily the plane models are well done, with the ability to change the camera position to get a better look at them. So far, complete disaster. The war continues Fortunately, since about the second half of the second campaign, things have been improving and Air Conflicts: Secret Wars has improved to the point of becoming an enjoyable product. Not perfect, but not even the debacle that the first levels suspected. The missions get longer, the things to do increase, the dogfights get more challenging and, finally, the scenarios become watchable. In reality there is never the sense of wonder of an Ace Combat, but some inspired moments come out and we arrive at the end quite satisfied. Deserts disappear in favor of forested areas filled with cities. The plot is enriched with historical facts hardly addressed in video games (such as the Chechen question) and some moments are challenging enough to require more attention. For example, having to collide with dozens of enemy planes is fun, as we appreciated the mission in which you have to attract the attention of the powerful Russian air force, first friend, to destroy a key character in the private story of the protagonist DeeDee (what a name) . Of course, there is always the lack of attention to detail that makes a great game, but you certainly don't find yourself fighting with the arrogance of the first missions, which becomes just a memory (or a nightmare for those who want to play all over again). Sadly though, there are other issues to consider. These are minor issues, but they give a good idea of some ingenuity behind the development. The most obvious one is the size of the maps. Sometimes you find yourself fighting in neighboring areas at the end of a map. When you leave the game area, a red arrow appears inviting you to return to the designated area. Now, why put targets right on the edges? It's genuinely annoying not being able to maneuver as you want or risk ending up off the map and being penalized for it. The surrender As already mentioned, technically Air Conflicts: Secret Wars is not a good game. Some maps are much better than others, but they never hit the mark and are inexorably flagged for lack of detail. Someone will say that, inbottom, you fly and therefore you have little time to look down. Unfortunately this is not the case. One of the gameplay features is the ability to become invisible to enemies by flying at a low altitude. Translation: in some maps you always fly close to the ground and, therefore, you have the opportunity to ~admire~ the ugly textures that make up the scenarios, as well as the various objects that populate them. From the sky the situation improves, with some pleasant light effects and the explosions of the enemy planes well done, but the few positive points, as well as the already mentioned three-dimensional models of the planes, are not enough to rebalance an obsolete technical part. The lack of interactivity with the scenario should also be noted. Forgive the sadism, but it would have been nice for the bombs to produce other effects than a simple black spot on the textures. But nothing: trees and buildings are indestructible, apart from those that concern some specific objective. Honestly we are used to something else.", "date": "2011-08-01", "grade": "5.8"}
