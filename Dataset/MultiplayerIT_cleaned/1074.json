{"name": "Recensione Fight Club PS2/XBox", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/recensione-fight-club-ps2xbox.html", "text": "The first steps The first impact is not bad, if nothing else speaking of the menus, which go from Xbox Live support to the creation of a personalized character that we can heal, reinforce and whose statistics we can see in the ring; then the classic modes remain Story Mode, Survival, Arcade and Training. Once we enter one of the menus, which lead to a combat mode, we can choose some characters built on the protagonists of the film, our personalized character or one of the four secret characters among which Fred Durst, leader of Limp Bizkit, sound icon stands out linked to the name of Fight Club. By creating our character we are asked to choose a fighting style among three available: grappler, martial artist or brawler; after which we will have some experience points available to increase the basic characteristics of the fighter. A career fighter, or the customized character, can take advantage of a further choice, namely that of fighting in ~Hardcore~ mode where too many serious injuries and too many fractures will cause forced retirement from the scenes. Satisfied with the repetitive background music we can then dive into the fight. Fighting style The setting is strongly linked to realistic combat, a factor that is logical to find in a product that bears the name of Fight Club and the first matches unleash an orgy of blood splatters and forbidden blows flanked by direct kicks and decidedly painful falls. Grapples are no less characterized by nose-butting headbutts, extreme twists, and devastating flurries of jabs. As if that weren't enough, once an opponent has been weakened by bringing his energy close to a minimum, the holds change, transforming themselves into lethal blows capable of breaking arms, legs and ribs with a remarkable ~x-ray~ effect that allows you to see the incorrect twisting of the bone. if that weren't enough, the grips change into lethal blows capable of breaking arms, legs and ribs Fighting style Unfortunately, after a few matches and after trying the three fighting styles attributed to the characters, the painful notes are not long in coming. The most obvious concerns the fight that does not evolve by learning new moves, but is limited to unimaginative series of kicks and punches; the three styles, in addition to being the only differences between one character and another, are flat and the approach is similar forcing the player to use a rush move whenever possible. What changes from one style to another are the grapples, two frontal and two from behind, and the damage of grapples, kicks and punches, and with just three styles the fight can be completely gutted in a few hours by any player. As if that weren't enough, the technical balance is practically absent and it is possible to win with a few randomly repeated moves, even in multiplayer, while in single player mode the question becomes even embarrassing with the implementation of a poor artificial intelligence and even capable of enhancing the technical flaws of the title. A high-level opponent simply waits for a hole in the player's attack to respond with a combo or a hold, without any changes. If, by pure chance, we find ourselves in difficulty, it is enough to trip him five or six times in a row to make our opponent continue to fall to the ground like a ripe pear. A weak retelling The story mode would seem to be the only sensible mode in a game linked to a famous film. Yet, even in this case, the effort of the programmers is minimal. The movies, which except the first and last are characterized by images accompanied by sound, represent everything that Fight Club never wanted to represent. Sequels of insults and bar fights accompany our search for the inner ~I~ and none of the dialogues is more interesting than a Marzullo broadcast. The atmosphere is devastated and crushed up to an ending that badly mimics the film. The only character who generally respects his role is that of Bob, the giant with a Pamela Anderson-style windowsill, but this does not save the modality and emotions are scarce, settling close to absolute zero. Tyler and his companions appear as a band of rogues and nothing remains of the hallucinations of the film, except for some badly dubbed caricatures. Fight Club worldwide The multiplayer mode is available on both PS2 and Xbox and offers the possibility to play either using the pre-generated characters, or as your own avatar to train fight after fight. Fight Club's multiplayer, while free from latency issues, suffers from the limitations of the game. The fightersiments are limited to obsessively repeated series of kicks and punches in the hope that the opponent does not equalize all the blows, and the construction of a personalized ~hardcore~ character, while forcing greater attention with the fear of losing the character, does not adds nothing striking to a decidedly meager title. As if that weren't enough, the presence of only three fighting styles further reduces the challenge and inexorably flattens the technical side of the game. The fights are limited to obsessively repeated series of kicks and punches in the hope that the opponent will not equalize all the blows Fight Club worldwide In addition to new music tracks, through the Xbox Live content download, it will be possible to download new characters via the internet who, however, will always be linked to the three fighting styles present in the game and differing only in appearance. Technical notes The characters are well built, with well-defined muscles on display, realistic clothes and more than satisfactory animations. The lighting has no obvious flaws and the levels do not lack three-dimensional spectators and atmospheric effects. Even the damage, wounds and blows, albeit limited in number, are well done and decidedly realistic and the characters have expressions of pain, panic or anger that well represent the specific game situations. Unfortunately the levels, although equipped in some cases with destructible objects and secret areas accessible after breaking through a wall, are not able to represent the settings from which they are taken. The textures are below average and the colors extremely flat, although on Xbox the area closest to the wrestlers is saved thanks to the implementation of bumpmapping. On PS2 the characters are slightly less defined and the frame rate, in very rare cases, has slight uncertainties. Sonically Fight Club still doesn't impress under any heading. The dubbing of a dazed thug and the repetitive music that tries to ape the soundtrack of the film are, in themselves, a bad blow even for those who have not been fascinated by Fight Club, and if in some cases you seem to hear a song from the film or, if nothing else, something pleasant, do not doubt that soon your ears will be tormented by low-key heavy metal. As if that weren't enough, the already limited sounds associated with blows, breaks and falls sometimes cease to exist or appear muffled and distant, also removing the little satisfaction generated by the violence of the combat. Comment Fight Club can neither retrace the atmosphere of the film of the same name, nor offer anything valid as a fighting game. The project, from the setting to the possibility of an interesting story mode, was not without potential, but the programmers' work proved to be insufficient and superficial. A product that offers very few attractions, if not those related to the violence of the fighting, and which proves to be repetitive and poor from too many points of view. Pros: Character models are not bad implements career mode Cons: but offers no particular appeal the entire title is limited to three slightly varied fighting styles ruthlessly slaughters Fight Club memory We are in the digital age and everything, sooner or later, is codified in small series of ones and zeros, chained together to guarantee a brand new videogame product. The impact is hard for all brands and if Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings manage to maintain a pinch of magic it is really difficult that this can happen with a film called Fight Club and which has anti-materialism as its banner at the end century. Once the paradox has been overcome, all that remains is to hope for a good fighting game capable of embodying the atmosphere of the film and bringing us some healthy, senseless violence.", "date": "2004-12-24", "grade": null}
