{"name": "The Elder Scrolls Online: Markarth", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-elder-scrolls-online-markarth-recensione.html", "text": "Finally, we have almost reached the conclusion of this shattered 2020, which in the world of MMOs has been a transitional year. The releases of new massive online games are less and less and those present continue to consolidate their market shares through more or less frequent updates. 2020 was also supposed to be the year of World of Warcraft Shadowland, the latest expansion initially scheduled for last October, a date that would have crushed all more or less known competitors under its immense weight. In short, if Blizzard had kept faith with its original plan, even The Elder Scrolls would certainly have seen that inevitable drop in players, but the postponement to a date closer to December allowed the Bethesda protg to enjoy a full-fledged DLC. Only a few days ago The Elder Scrolls: Markarth, whose review you are reading, arrived on the game servers, the last piece of a narrative line made up of quests and characters known to the public of The Elder Scrolls dedicated entirely to the world of Skyrim. This last piece of the Dark Heart of Skyrim takes us again to fight vampires, werewolves and sects of witches, this time however by throwing us directly into a decidedly familiar place. Welcome back to Reach Abandoned the steep valleys of Greymoor, the new DLC invites us to visit the western border of Skyrim, a place where magic and ancient traditions have blended together for centuries. The Reach welcomes us with a request coming directly from the throne room of Markarth, a stone city that is not particularly large in terms of extension but refined down to the smallest detail in terms of construction and atmosphere. We hadn't picked up our Argonian Warden full stamina for a few months and fortunately this new patch hasn't changed anything significant. Of course, the builds have undergone some adjustments in terms of balancing and interesting pieces of equipment have appeared here and there to recover, but the backbone of the title has remained unchanged, especially for PvP lovers. Indeed this is perhaps the main weak point of Markarth, a final expansion that makes the narrative its backbone, focusing a lot on dialogues, instances and content for PvE deliberately putting everything else in the background. It is a package that concludes an adventure that began almost a year ago, a cycle that wants to end in the most peaceful way possible, most likely ready to overdo it later. We thus find ourselves in a new area full of missions, both on the surface and in the underground dwarven cities, the impact of which, unfortunately, is decidedly less effective than when we saw them for the first time on Greymoor. The feeling of deja vu haunts us a bit throughout the DLC to be honest, but on the other hand it was also quite predictable. In the end, the enemies are more or less always the same, although we must say that mechanical behemoths have a completely unique charm, and even the fight against vampires and werewolves, having reached this point, has lost some of its initial thrust . To bring home the new setting, sets and quest line you will have to shell out 2000 crowns for the basic version and 4000 if you want the enhanced version with a mount and other extras which however are most likely not worth the price of admission unless you are really super fans of The Elder Scrolls Online. But there is some interesting news! If up to now we have given you a solid but not mind-blowing vision of Markarth, what surprised us and makes this update particularly interesting is undoubtedly the solitary arena Vateshran Hollows. Here you will have to deal with a dungeon where you can put your equipment and skills to the test in a single player challenge worthy of the name. Three bosses await you ready to tear you apart with sophisticated and not too predictable attack patterns, especially as regards the final battle, and alternative paths to explore, also taking advantage of the teleportation mechanics that rage in the new setting. A little more fat that adds up to the titles, the achievements and obviously also the inevitable collectibles that will give you to play for several dozen hours, especially if you want to throw yourself into the hunt for the World Events scattered around the map and explore every single nook. Update 28 also arrives on the game servers with Markath, an update that mainly brings a new system for collecting weapons and armor, to be rebuilt thanks to the transmutation stones and leave you much more space available in the bags.", "date": "2020-11-10", "grade": "7.0"}
