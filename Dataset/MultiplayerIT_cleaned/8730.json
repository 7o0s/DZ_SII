The idea is simple, you maneuver and rotate a block made up of four squares of up to two different colors within a grid, placing them at the base you have to form blocks made up of at least four squares of the same color. Unlike Tetris, where blocks are canceled immediately, in Lumines this happens when a metronome in continuous horizontal movement crosses them, in such a way as to be able to create more or less extensive combos. This already interesting mechanic is enriched by the perfect integration with the music sector: each level is called a skin because it is accompanied by a different graphic design in terms of background and blocks, as well as for the background music. Music and effects that are connected to what happens on the screen: when you move a block or rotate it adds a specific effect, when you give rise to a combo the track is enriched with new riffs and so on, for an exceptional result in terms of involvement and to be enjoyed absolutely with headphones in order to obtain an almost psychedelic experience. The subsequent chapters of Lumines on PSP and on home consoles have not repeated the success of the original one, first of all for a decidedly less inspired soundtrack and skins (the various Mondo Grosso and company replaced by anonymous or poorly amalgamated artists), you want for less interesting content and for the very few variations on the theme. Playstation 3 trophies Strangely, Lumines: Electronic Symphony offers 13 non-platinum trophies, despite the fact that it costs 35 euros (in digital download) and is a complete game in all respects. In any case, they are obtained by unlocking the various skins / avatars, making some combos and completing all the skins of the Master mode, the most difficult ones to complete successfully. Puzzle X Music History repeats itself however, as we were saying, Lumines: Electronic Symphony arrives at the launch of PlayStation Vita and confirms how this title is perfect for a portable experience, adding some welcome novelties and finally accompanying a soundtrack worthy of the name and beautiful skins to see, thanks also to the OLED screen of the Sony console. The game mechanics are the same, but with two important innovations. First of all, the presence of a chaos block which, once placed on the grid, changes the color of all adjacent ones. This variable, although sometimes annoying, actually becomes a panacea when the screen is full and there is the risk of ending the game prematurely. The second novelty is represented by the fact that now all avatars have a special ability, which can be called every certain amount of time and allows for example to change the color of all the blocks that are about to arrive or slow down the speed of the metronome and the blocks themselves. These two innovations fit perfectly into the gameplay and into the main mode, called ~Journey~, with the possibility of tackling the levels in sequence which become more complicated because perhaps the blocks go down faster or more asynchronously than the metronome that cancels them. There are forty-three skins available and, as the title suggests, the songs (here the complete list) come mainly from electronic music and include artists such as the Chemical Brothers with ~Hey Boy Hey Girl~ and ~Dissolve~, the Aphex Twin with ~ Windowlicker~ and then Benny Benassi, Goldfrapp, 808 State, Orbital, Pet Shop Boys and many others. The result is really excellent, some act as an excellent musical base while playing while others are very aggressive and blend perfectly with the gameplay, completely alienating the player during a game. The skins themselves have often delightful graphic styles, with animated but non-invasive backgrounds and very different artistic influences, for such a well-made work that we have not seen since the first Lumines. All the factors mentioned above contribute to making Lumines: Electronic Symphony a great title. In terms of longevity / replayability there is also a growth system linked to one's results: each score returns experience points which increase the level and allow you to unlock skins and new avatars with related skills. This is because there is also the Playlist mode, within which it is possible to choose how many and which skins to play, and then save a list to be tackled and shared with your friends via Near. Unfortunatelyo there is no online mode, but only the local battle against other PlayStation Vita owners and within which new avatar skills are used to get the better of the opponent. Further single-player modes are those timed according to different intervals and the one called ~Maestro~, in which Lumines veterans can try their hand at completing five different unlockable areas and represented by skins that are extremely difficult to complete due to the speed of the blocks and the metronome that erases them.", "date": "2012-02-23", "grade": "9.0"}
