{"name": "Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/geometry-wars-retro-evolved-2-recensione.html", "text": "The story of Geometry Wars is the clearest example of what can happen when a simple idea is made to evolve into a real long-term project. Born as a hidden bonus among the bits of Project Gotham Racing 2 on Xbox, the ~little game~ by Bizarre Creations has evolved to such an extent that it has become a real flagship of the new Xbox 360 Live Arcade, as well as generating two spin-offs on Wii and Nintendo DS. After the transition to Activision, this Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved 2 takes up the series departing from its predecessor with small adjustments, which make the difference and which compose the most complete and fun episode ever. A real drug for lovers of shooters with two analogue levers: one to move the spaceship; the other to shoot 360 all around. How do you change? Sports commentators are fond of saying that Americans will never really be passionate about soccer because to them, a sport that ends in scores of 1 to 1, 2 to 1, or 0 to 0, isn't spectacular enough. Much better is Basketball with its 90 to 76, or American Football with teams that almost never stay below 10 points each. This is the philosophy that Bizarre has followed for the new episode, in which the best will not be those who manage to get close and exceed 2 million (leaving aside the world-class phenomena), but those who will achieve scores of tens of millions of points . This is because, compared to the past, it doesn't matter how long you manage to survive, but what you manage to do while surviving. In fact, the geoms are back, small green diamonds, already introduced on Wii, which must be collected after the destruction of an enemy and which are used to increase the multiplier, forcing the player not only to avoid the enemy ships and their shots, but to study maneuvers impossible to be able to recover these gems before they disappear. This time, therefore, we are continually faced with the choice between fleeing to safety and collecting geoms without which the score does not go up. At the same time, when you die, the multiplier does not reset and it will not be impossible to find yourself after a few games with scores of more than 10 million with an astronomical multiplier. The other most evident novelty is the introduction of six different modes, that push you to improve in each of the skills you need to become real champions of the game. Everyone can find the one that suits them best and one in which to be more competitive with friends, whose position in the standings is indicated for each mode, at the beginning of each game, in a very clear selection screen. Among other things, the start of the games is even faster and faster and it is not uncommon to end up entangled in sequences of tens of minutes played in a desperate attempt to beat a friend's record which is constantly indicated to us in the upper right part of the screen and which is replaced by the one immediately above it, as soon as the previous one is knocked down. All supported by an ever so spectacular visual sector that also supports native 1080p and which, precisely by virtue of such a clean look, allows you to recognize your spaceship even in the midst of hundreds of bright sprites on the screen, without any slowdown whatsoever . With an audio that underlines every moment with touches such as a stop and go of each soundtrack, after each death, so as to further increase the sense of precariousness and uncertainty of each game. Coop and Versus Multiplayer is entrusted to the possibility of playing the same modes as single player, up to 4 players, both in VS and in coop (with the addition of some rotating stars which, if collected, give bonuses to dueling players). The funniest (very fun) modes are those in which, on the same spaceship, one player controls it, while the other takes care of directing the shot. The disappointing aspect is the inexplicable lack of possibility to play online, but only locally. In addition to the fact that the modes played in 4, especially in versus, are resolved in a kaleidoscopic delirium in which very little is understood. However, laughter is guaranteed. Six ways of destruction! Impossible not to find a mode in which to get entangled in this GW : RE 2. In Limite, you have 3 minutes to achieve the highest possible score, with infinite lives, thus leaving the player free to choose the most suitable tactic, without worry too much about your own deaths (except that the timer keeps running even while waiting to be reborn!). In Real, the spaceship is only able to fire when it is in a series of circles that must be activated and which shrink until they disappear aftersome time. So what to do? Run to the closest circle and resume shooting, or pick up some exploding geom while you were safe? There is only one life and every choice is decisive. Evoluta is nothing more than a new version of the previous episode with the difference that the shot is not enhanced after a few points and that there is no longer the alternation between the two different types of shots, one with more range, but slow, and the other more concentrated, but much faster. Only the second remains and the spaceships of the Onde mode are added. Pacifism is the evolution of one of the achievements of the first Geometry, the one that was unlocked by surviving without shooting for 60 seconds. Here, life is only one and the spaceship does not shoot. It can only pass through rods that connect two explosives, blowing them up and destroying all enemies around them. We soon find ourselves in a flood of blue spaceships that chase us from all sides, with the difficulty of passing exactly between the two explosives, given that, touching one of them, death is inevitable. Hence this is exactly the GW version contained in Project Gotham Racing 4, introducing these waves of orange spaceships that relentlessly cross the board in horizontal lines. Breaking rhythm and, above all, trajectories. Sequences is the grand finale. An explosion of technique with a series of levels that are always identical, marked by a 30-second timer, within which you must have eliminated each opponent. As soon as you die, the game considers the single stage failed and projects us to the next one. There are 3 lives and they must be used to go through all the levels, up to the end. Real heart-pounder! Comment Is it possible to improve a practically perfect game? Evidently yes, or at least it is evident for Bizarre, who benefited from the passage under the protective wings of Activision. This real sequel to Geometry Wars is a concentrate of adrenaline, a spectacularization of a series of gameplay elements now so refined as to represent a real point of reference for Live Arcade shooters and beyond. The score could have been even higher, but it's jarring not to find the online versus and cooperative modes, especially since some are a real blast. Pros The new modes all work Infinite challenge Very fun multiplayer... Cons ... even if in 4, too confusing Nothing online Xbox 360 - Goals As is often the case, when a 360 game is successful in every element, the achievements are well integrated and fun to unlock. The 200 points of GW RE 2 are easily obtainable, by deepening some aspects of the different modes, for an amount ranging from 100 to 150 points. To get to the full loot, however, there will be a lot of sweat. Especially for the smile to be made in the Sequence mode, which gives a good 25 points.", "date": "2008-08-11", "grade": null}
