In the case of the Geostorm here present, expectations were set even further downwards due to the dubious quality of the film of the same name that inspired it, due out in Italy in November and which - to put it mildly - does not seem destined to revolutionize the world of the seventh art. The title created by Sticky Games, on the other hand, is surprising in some ways, even if it does not invent anything new and indeed draws heavily on what Square Enix has achieved with the award-winning Lara Croft GO. So much for climate change! Briefly hinting at the plot of the film, Geostorm presents a futuristic world in which man has managed to contain climatic disasters through a complex system of satellites which takes the name of the Dutch Boy project: unfortunately this network is sabotaged, causing as consequence catastrophic natural events in various parts of the planet. The game follows the story of three characters involved in various capacities in the program, stationed respectively in Dubai, Afghanistan and Orlando, committed to surviving the extreme conditions that have suddenly occurred and to recover and send fundamental data to resolve the crisis. Put down in playful terms, all this translates into about thirty levels that host gameplay, as mentioned before, extremely indebted to Lara Croft GO: the settings are therefore divided into boxes on which the protagonist on duty can move thanks to the swipes made by the user on the touchscreen, aiming to reach the exit of each stage. To do this, it is necessary not only to carefully avoid the dangers (one contact is enough to decree the death of the character on the screen) but also and above all to solve puzzles which in most cases involve moving elements of the scenario and interacting with switches, buttons and so on. It never borders on excessively bizarre, but the puzzles are well constructed and varied enough to keep the attention alive from start to finish: if anything, compared to the more illustrious Lara Croft GO, Geostorm can be objected to a well-developed level of challenge more than affordable and a substantial lack of incentive to retrace one's steps once the adventure is completed, two aspects that obviously affect global longevity. However, it should be noted that a forthcoming update of the application will add an entire new chapter, set on the space station that houses the Dutch Boy control center, intended to conclude the story and which probably was not made available immediately also to avoid spoilers. who would like to see the film first. Despite being a product with distinctly commercial ambitions, Geostorm does not exaggerate in the application of free to play mechanisms, proving to be much more permissive than many other mobile games that share the same formula: everything revolves around advertising videos lasting up to thirty seconds that it is necessary to watch (unless you want to remove forever by paying the usual obolo) to move from one stage to another or to activate the suggestions in case you find yourself stuck in a certain situation. Finally, the technical realization is also good, with graphics framed by an isometric view that compensates for a somewhat impersonal style with excellent attention to detail and a wise use of colors and light effects.", "date": "2017-10-13", "grade": "7.8"}
