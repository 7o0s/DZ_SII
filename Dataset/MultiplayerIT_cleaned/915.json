Alien archaeology It cannot be denied that the fictional-archaeological cue of the plot has its charm: the developers have drawn on the controversial theories that Zecharia Sitchin set out in the seventies in his book ~The Planet of the Gods~ (Piemme edition) and which indirectly also inspired the Stargate movie. The Russian scholar claims that the human race was created by extraterrestrials who arrived on Earth 450,000 years ago to extract gold. These aliens would come from Planet X which, according to the interpretations of the cuneiform language of Sitchin, would correspond to the twelfth planet of our solar system, what the ancient Sumerians called Nibiru or ~Planet of the crossroads~: it is the twelfth if, as the Sumerians, in addition to the nine planets known so far, there are the Sun, the Moon and Tiamat, which would have been destroyed. Proponents of Sitchin's theories believe that while the Sumerians already knew all the planets in our solar system, it is also true that there is a twelfth. Astronomers themselves have for years hunted for a ~Planet X~ with characteristics matching those of Nibiru and in March 2004 a NASA press release announced the discovery of a tenth planet, dubbed Sedna. Inexplicably, however, the news did not have a great impact... that its potential repercussions on evolutionary theories and the positions taken by orthodox archeology towards Sitchin are a little too embarrassing for the scientific community? But let's go back to our adventure: at first glance, the presentation and the sensation of immersion are rather poor, perhaps also because the protagonist is as bland as a bowl of unseasoned salad, but later the story keeps us on our toes thanks to a fast pace, an all in all exciting plot and the rapid succession of discoveries and twists. Point-and-click never goes out of style The handy inventory appears at the bottom of the screen. Nibiru is a third-person graphic adventure with the most intuitive of ~point and click~ interfaces: to interact with the game, all you need is the mouse and the cursor changes shape according to the actions that can be performed in the various areas of the screen. Access to the inventory is immediate, just move the cursor towards the bottom of the screen, and all the objects it contains can be combined with each other or used in the scenarios by simply clicking on them and dragging them. By pressing the Tab key, all the exits available in the settings are displayed and, with a double click on one of them, you arrive at your destination, skipping any intermission animations. The only peculiarity to note is that the game has inherited the use of the right mouse button for deeper interaction with objects on the screen from its predecessor, The Black Mirror. Nibiru is a third-person graphic adventure with the most intuitive of point-and-click interfaces. Point-and-click never goes out of style Most of the puzzles revolve around inventory and dialogues, but there are also the classic sliding puzzles and some codes to decipher. Generally the difficulty is increasing but not excessive: only one or two are illogical or out of place. There are some that are timed, but absolutely elementary to solve and never frustrating. The adventure lasts a total of fifteen hours, although the solution times vary according to the user. Dialogue-based puzzles can be misleading and reduce some stages of the game to a slavish alternation of exploration and feedback conversations with the characters that populate the various settings: it often happens that you get stuck just for not having repeatedly spoken to a character, with whom you he thought he had run out of arguments by now. The fact that certain objects cannot be collected or combined until the protagonist deems it appropriate further complicates things: it is said that, when we are allowed to, we do not have clear ideas on the actual usefulness of the article or we remember! You can't escape pixel hunting, unfortunately, as well as even a minimum of trips back and forth between one setting and another, made unnerving only by the fact that the protagonist really doesn't want to know how to run (he walks away a few steps and always walking calmly even to shelter from the explosion of a stick of dynamite)! All-terrain technology Despite the main menu, which is unusually sloppy, Nibiru is a feast for the eyes: it features highly detailed two-dimensional environments, enriched by a particular uselarly intense and lively color. The characters that populate them are three-dimensional, they blend harmoniously with the backdrops and are modeled and animated with relative naturalness. The graphics engine adopted is essentially the same as The Black Mirror, but appears visibly enhanced and can rely on a wise use of anti-aliasing and volumetric effects. Prague by night. The animations of the backdrops are quite convincing, albeit limited: the presence of some passers-by, the arrival of a tram or a flock of birds flying in the distance, in fact, are not sufficient to enliven some of the settings, which inevitably end up appearing static, like frozen on the screen. Good effects of light and shadow, discreet atmospheric ones. The musical accompaniment is marginal and not at all remarkable. The sound effects are decent but certainly not unforgettable. The dubbing in Italian, on the other hand, is decidedly professional and the localization is always up to par. Comment Nibiru is certainly a well-made product: the plot and the assumptions are worth a few more points for the originality and the meticulous technical realization that will not fail to satisfy even the most demanding enthusiasts of the genre. The solid structure and coherent puzzles guarantee a fun and fulfilling gaming experience, even if the limited duration leaves a bad taste in the mouth and player immersion is not always sustained. The only taint of the adventure is perhaps the lack of bite, of personality: Indiana Jones has charisma on his side, Broken Sword and Runaway play on humor... Nibiru shows no particular signs, the story is intriguing and well packaged , but almost told on the sly. A real shame, because a slightly less anonymous protagonist would have been enough to make it unforgettable! However, it remains a title that stands on good quality levels, to be recommended to all lovers of ~point and click~ and made even more irresistible by the incredible price offered by Power Up. Pros: Original and compelling plot Good technical realization Coherent puzzles Cons: Silly protagonist Limited duration Superfluous passages in the structure of some puzzles Alien archaeology The Czech developers of Unknown Identity made themselves known and appreciated last year with a purely traditional point and click adventure, The Black Mirror. This time, they have abandoned the horror genre and the dark themes of their debut work to throw themselves into pure adventure, with a nod to Indiana Jones and the X-Files and always drawing heavily from the legacy left by the classics of this videogame vein , with undoubted references to the Broken Sword saga. And once again they offer us a respectable product, which every fan of the genre cannot ignore and which stands out for its accurate technical realization and a fairly original plot. Here is our hero! Martin Holan, the protagonist of this story, is Indiana Jones' nerd cousin: despite being an archaeologist himself, he has never abandoned the archives in which he works and has very little of a man of action. However, his life takes an unexpected turn with a sudden call from his uncle, an expert historian and enthusiast of Mayan legends, who invites him to investigate the recent discovery of a World War II mine in Bohemia, in the bowels of which the Nazis would have conducted research top secret about a mysterious alien technology. To trace the origins of the Ni.Bi.Ru project, in which the Germans seemed to be on the eve of a sensational discovery, our improvised hero will be whisked from Prague to Paris, then landed in South America and plunged into ancient myths Maya. During his travels he will also have to contend with the ugly thugs on duty, equally interested in discovering the secret of Nibiru, to which the Third Reich had entrusted its last hopes of survival, and ready to do anything to succeed.", "date": "2005-06-14", "grade": null}
