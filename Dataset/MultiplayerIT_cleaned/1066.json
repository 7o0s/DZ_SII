{"name": "Colin McRae Rally 2005", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/colin-mcrae-rally-2005_a.html", "text": "Be portable and not feel it Usually, when a game born and raised on home consoles is converted for a laptop, the result falls into two distinct categories: either in that of extremely simplified titles compared to the original, or in that of overly ambitious and therefore unsatisfactory productions. On the contrary, Colin McRae Rally 2005 for N-Gage succeeds in the truly rare feat of keeping intact practically all the characteristics that have distinguished the ~major~ versions, making perfect use of the qualities of the Nokia console. From the very first moments of the game it is in fact clear that this is a ~true~ episode of the successful Codemasters series: in fact, the menus present all the classic modes, combined with the multiplayer ones which we will discuss later. Whatever the choice in this sense, once you get on the track you immediately realize the goodness of the work done by the Ideaworks3D programmers; the glance is in fact really pleasant, with excellent 3D settings and cars. Roughly in terms of polygonal complexity we are at the levels of Psone, but the small screen and the good frame rate certainly contribute to giving a better aesthetic result. The variety of routes is guaranteed by the different locations scattered around the world where the races take place, all reproduced with care and fidelity; you go from asphalt to sand, from mud to ice, just like in the best tradition of titles of this type, accompanied by meteorological variability that can bring rain or snow to make the player's life even more difficult. The sound component, as is required of a simulation title like Colin McRae Rally, rests solely on the roar of the engines, on the environmental sound effects and on the navigator's voice, always precise and punctual in the indications on the track. Pocket simulation However, what certainly represents the most interesting part of the Codemasters production must be found in the complexity of the mechanics offered by the guide system, really extremely close to the versions for home consoles. Abandoning any idea of simplification that would have distorted the original concept, the programmers have decided to bring a realistic driving model to the N-Gage, in which drifts and flat straight lines are intelligently combined with braking, cornering settings and counter-steering, with as little off-piste excursions as possible. Colin McRae Rally 2005 on the Nokia laptop therefore keeps its features intact, including the car settings (steering, brakes, suspension, tires, etc.) and damage. The latter, while only minimally affecting the appearance of the cars, can substantially change its behavior; much better therefore to avoid particularly heavy impacts if you want to aspire to an acceptable time. The control system makes good use of the N-Gage's keys, mapped with intelligence and rationality; the only real flaw in this sense lies in the lack of an analog stick, ideal for brushing the trajectories without having to continuously correct the trajectory with ~taps~ on the directional cross. Colin McRae Rally 2005 isn't stingy when it comes to multiplayer modes either; the most obvious is the one via bluetooth connection, which allows you to challenge a human opponent also equipped with N-Gage and a copy of the game. Alternatively, there is also an appreciable solution through the N-Gage Arena, through which it is possible to enter your own ~ghosts~ online or download those of other users to challenge; all this is then managed through a world ranking, obviously based on the best times. It is therefore not a real challenge in real time via GPRS connection, but it remains a good alternative given the limits of this technology, especially with a view to increasing the overall longevity of the title. Comment Colin McRae Rally 2005 for the N-Gage easily imposes itself as the best racing game for the Nokia console, that goes without saying. But the merits of the Ideaworks3D programmers do not stop there, since their effort represents a very valid and in many respects surprisingly faithful transposition on a portable console of a series so famous in its incarnations on systems with decidedly greater potential. In fact, this conversion manages to bring with it not only an excellent technical aspect completely in 3D, but also a realistic driving model capable of satisfying every lover of the sport in question. Ultimately, together with Pathway to Glory, Colin McRae Rally 2005 is undoubtedly the best game currently available for the N-Gage. Pros: Excellent graphics component Surprising driving model Deep and complex as per tradition Cons: Withnot very precise digital control Not suitable for arcade lovers Having recently lost the status of the most technologically advanced portable console, N-Gage has inevitably found itself having to really rely only on the quality of its games, in an attempt to give consumers the real reasons to buy the Nokia handheld that so far they've been on the run. After the intriguing Pocket Kingdom and the excellent Pathway to Glory, the Finnish house drops another card of great weight with this Colin McRae Rally 2005, conversion of the most famous and appreciated rally series from Psone onwards. The result? Unexpectedly good", "date": "2005-01-06", "grade": null}
