{"name": "Vampire Night", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/vampire-night_a.html", "text": "Mode and poverty Essentially we have two ~big~ differences: each enemy has its own weak point, visible when the monster approaches, which facilitates the killing and instead of men to be saved we have natives who, like in Alien, act as an incubator for vampires. Again a precise shot where indicated and i. game is done, that's all. In short, as a total conversion, it's not bad. As in a DVD, we also have other sections, more accessory than anything else: a long and demanding training and a mission mode. The second mode seems interesting at first glance: do you play an RPG with a light gun? Not at all, it's just small quests that the natives of the place ask us to carry out; useless, futile and deadly boring stuff. We will also have shops where you can buy various bonuses and power ups. That's all. Unfortunately Vampire Night is too arcadey, it doesn't work as a home game. It is not very long, it will not take much effort to complete it, and as it was once the only way to lengthen the challenge is to adjust the level of difficulty and the credits available. An unfunny trip to Transylvania. There's not much more to say, once finished it will only be played again if you are lucky enough to be able to play it in two. Graphically speaking, the title is decidedly on good levels even if sometimes we have to deal with decidedly dull flat backdrop textures. On the other hand, the creation of the end-of-level bosses is exhilarating, a riot of special effects and various transformations, well animated and with a decidedly spot on design. the effects of reflection and translucency are also very nice. The dubbing in Italian is very negative, simply ridiculous and not very serious. Ultimately what are we dealing with? Vampire Night would not even seem too bad, but the practically non-existent longevity undermines its home use. In the arcade it's one of those titles that make us spend a fortune on tokens, but even there, once finished, you look at it as you would a hunting trophy. And if you don't have a light gun available, although the control is easy and all in all precise, the approval curve of the title drops practically to zero. What remains in the end is a decidedly unattractive, short and boring game, which has nothing to do with masterpieces of the caliber of Time Crisis and House of the Dead itself, which starting from a fundamentally repetitive gaming experience, manage to keep the fun threshold high. A Vampire Night title that gives its best as a rental product, better sitting comfortably on the sofa at home than jostling in a smoky arcade. In short, a wasted opportunity. Pros: Good graphics Fun with the Light Gun Cons: Too short Not much variety Vampire Hunter, the sequel to House of the Dead..... Vampire Night is the product of a very unexpected cooperation between Sega, Namco and Wow Entertainment. V.N. is a classic light gun shooter, direct conversion of a recent coin op. The story is a typical variation on the theme: instead of hungry zombies we will have to deal with an infestation of vampires, in a setting more suited to our enemies. No more Venice (House of the Dead), instead now we will roam in places that remind us a lot of what cinema and literature have taught us about Transylvania. Vampire Night seems to all intents and purposes a direct evolution of the old Sega title: bosses and non-linear progression remind us of the true birthplace of the title, even if we find something that diversifies the two games.", "date": "2002-06-03", "grade": null}
