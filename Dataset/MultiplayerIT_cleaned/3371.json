There were ups and downs, of course, and the huge expanded universe dedicated to this titanic brand often took paths that were difficult to comment in a positive way... yet the colossus created by Lucas was able to transmit something magical to any medium , so much so as to give life to classics of the caliber of Jedi Knight, TIE Fighter and Knights of the Old Republic even in our cheerful panorama. Oib, we well know that these cult games have been accompanied by immodest rubbish (coff, Masters of Teras Kasi, coff), but at least in that glorious decade anything that was hand-in-hand with Jedi, Empire and company had a a good 50% chance of deserving a jaw drop; today, however, the name Star Wars unleashes many more doubts and negativity than we have ever seen - even during the ~prequel~ period - and, all taken up with television and film projects, Disney seems to have largely ignored the world of video games, giving the clearance for mostly disappointing (though not necessarily evil) titles. The exploitation of the Electronic Arts license, in particular, has not given the desired results to longtime fans, despite the fact that the US giant has spent a monstrous amount of money and resources for the creation of potentially valid products. After the bizarre parenthesis Motive and the shooters of DICE, therefore, EA has decided to bet on its most promising racehorse: those Respawns who have boosted the accounts of the house with Apex Legends, and have already demonstrated an exceptional talent with the two Titanfalls. These veterans coming largely from the original Infinity Ward were therefore entrusted with Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order: on paper, the great action that the publisher has been trying to complete for years, stumbling here and there. Will their talent be enough to restore balance to the Force? Let us find out in this review. The deception of the dark side In truth, we do not want to start the article in the name of analysis, but with an important warning: for God's sake, do not rely on the first few hours of the campaign to evaluate Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. In fact, Respawn's work is really deceptive during the opening bars, so derivative that it seems like a sort of demo created specifically for the trailers and forcefully glued to the real game. And it is not an exaggeration, also because this videogame takes its hands full from other titles - it is a sort of soup of mechanics and structures, created with a basic philosophy not unlike that of the Darksiders - but its introductory phase seriously gives the impression of being studied at the table for a presentation in front of investors completely unaware of what a good video game is, to the point of making it seem like an uninspired copy of Uncharted despite the very respectable visual impact of the settings. Nothing is further from reality: Fallen Order takes a handful of hours to fuel, and having overcome that introductory wall it shows all the talent of the team that created it, transforming itself into an action packed with ingenious and solid gimmicks in every aspect. On the other hand, there are respectable designers at Respawn, and the basis chosen for the combat system that carries everything forward should not be underestimated. The skeleton of the combat system of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is in fact very close to that of Sekiro, the latest work of From Software, and in the Los Angeles team of fans of the good Miyazaki's house there must be several, because their creature follows the road traced by Japan also in the management of the maps, which seem complex and elaborate (not to mention a couple of gimmicks already seen, which we don't want to reveal to you). In a nutshell, this fusion of formulas tries to initially unite cinematic scenes close to the adventures of Nathan Drake and unmistakable settings taken heavily from the universe of Lucas, to later absorb elements from the three-dimensional Prince of Persia and metroidvania like a whirlwind, and flank them to battles built around reflexes and predicting opponent patterns. So believe us if we tell you that when everything starts to take shape in a concrete way, Fallen Order really leaves you speechless for the management of locations and pace, going so far as to overshadow some flaws that risked compromising the recipe. The Empire doesn't miss a beat Taking into account that even Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order bases its battles mainly on parries, counterattacks, and dodges at the last moment, we need to describe some cafeatures that make the combat system less refined and precise than the one created by From Software. In fact, the Respawns have slightly let go of the accelerator as regards the defensive mechanics, and the good Cal Kestis, the Jedi protagonist, does not respond with the speed of the Wolf of From, raising his sword with a few moments of delay which prevents him from effectively parrying burst combo and pushes to use normal parry for many attacks, focusing on more predictable attacks for counters. This significantly changes the approach to the game, making it impossible to approach the same timing as Miyazaki's work, and significantly favoring the use of Force powers, incredibly effective on almost every occasion. That wasn't enough, in Jedi: Fallen Order the ~tracking~ is more marked than that of Sekiro, and it is therefore not particularly sensible to move in advance to avoid enemy attacks in certain battles. Better to explain in more detail, because we realize how the ~slang of action games~ can be incomprehensible to most. Tracking is basically the tendency of enemies to carry out research attacks, which point to you regardless of your lateral movements, forcing you to use a defensive maneuver with invulnerability frames (a parry, in fact, or a sudden dodge). It was a rather marked problem, for example, in the second Dark Souls - where the use of maneuvers such as parrying was not the focus of the system - while in games such as Sekiro and Jedi: Fallen Order it is a sensible choice, since their battles are built around defensive mechanics, and it's okay for enemies to ~force~ the player to use them. Where, however, in the From Software game some of the most demanding battles boasted attacks that could be circumvented even just by moving worthily (so much so that some pad monsters did runs without dodging or parrying the bosses), in Jedi: Fallen Order this thing is so heavy as to make a similar strategy is extremely difficult. Just think, using one of the first powers at your disposal, that is the slowdown of the enemies, you will happen to see them rotate on the spot towards your position, with no possibility of escape even with a shot. If we consider, however, that the response of parries and dodges of the EA game is slightly less precise and reliable than the title that inspires it, the opponent's attacks can be annoying in brawls against large groups. Abuse the Force Does this imply that we are faced with a mediocre combat system, or even more difficult than that of Sekiro? Fortunately no; because it will be true that Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order lacks refinements in the clashes, but at the same time boasts a rather brilliant subdivision of the difficulty, which facilitates the response times in parrying and decreases the damage and frequency of enemy attacks by lowering the level of challenge. This already makes him accessible to most (even if in Grand Master Jedi he will seriously hurt you), but then, as mentioned before, Cal has numerous powers at his disposal, and a series of skills that favor the recharging of the Force and its consequent abuse of enemies, allowing not only to manage large groups of opponents but also to circumvent very difficult battles by exploiting individual powerful techniques (the slowdown already mentioned above all). If, therefore, in the beginning you will find yourself doing little apart from last-minute parades and spectacular repulses of enemy blaster shots, in the middle of the campaign you will find yourself out of nowhere sending missiles back to the sender, hurling soldiers and little monsters off cliffs, to slow projectiles in the air and move guards in their path, along with a whole host of other goodies, melee attacks, and the ability to switch between two different lightsaber modes. In short, maybe it's not the most technical action out there, but Respawn have still set up a game where the battles are hilarious, and the clashes really rarely disappoint. All the other qualities of the system shine even more as soon as the combat finds its dimension, to which we go from repetitive climbing on walls to wall-to-wall runs with double leaps and more than interesting platform phases, we go from basic maps to underground complexes full of well-crafted puzzles and ingenious gimmicks, and you are driven to explore the various planets not so much for the customizations found for the maps, but because you seriously want to understand to what extent the developers have managed to exploit each location. For God's sake, not that the customizations suck: there is the possibility of modifying Cal's lightsaber and clothing in detail, passing through the ccolor of his own spaceship and the small droid BD-1. Nonetheless appreciated goodies, which reward wanderers. A difficult time for the Jedi Speaking of BD-1, the little droid (in addition to being adorable) represents a skilled ally who not only offers Stim capable of healing you, but analyzes enemies and maps to give additional information on the narrative background and offer useful strategies in battle, and it can project a beautiful three-dimensional map of the planets capable of showing all the explorable and blocked areas with great clarity. It's hard not to get attached to him, or even to the other supporting actors given the good general job of managing the characters. Ok, not that Jedi: Fallen Order is an unforgettable masterpiece from a narrative point of view, but it's not that we expected big surprises: we are still talking about a game included in the Star Wars canon after Order 66, therefore at the level of storyline there was little that Respawn could do, and it is quite predictable where the events of Cal Kestis and his companions end up. But the game oozes with love for the original Star Wars, and while it falls into shameless fanservice at times, it handles its scenes with enough heart and slyness to excite a fan of the saga. It's not a trivial matter. On the other hand, the technical sector is less good, which although often amazing for the art direction - some planets are bloody beautiful, and there are ~wow~ moments during the progress of the plot - demonstrates a certain inexperience of the team with the Unreal Engine, and every now and then it shows a few too many bugs, in addition to a curious skating of the characters during the animations and some wobble of frame rates even on PlayStation 4 Pro. We were lucky, and in our games we rarely found stuff in capable of ruining our lives - a problem that would have ruined the campaign a lot, because the checkpoint system is punishing and taken in turn by the Souls and Sekiro, and dying from a bug means losing your experience points until you hit again your killer or you don't go back to the death zone - mostly witnessing a series of quite hilarious bugs. We talk about trinkets like enemies being knocked out through walls, clothes fluttering in the wind in hermetically sealed Imperial bases, execution animations placing directly over a ravine, and other similar crap... but it's really a shame that such a well-crafted title fact has not had some extra tweaking in this area. Finally, the Italian dubbing is of passable quality, although the original one is advisable, if only for a considerably more heartfelt participation of the actors in the events.", "date": "2019-11-15", "grade": "8.7"}
