{"name": "Tandem: A Tale of Shadows", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tandem-a-tale-of-shadows-recensione.html", "text": "The first thing that comes to mind when you look at Emma, the London girl with a cerulean white complexion with a penchant for investigation, as well as the protagonist of the game, is that she would be perfect as the heroine of a Tim Burton film, with her skinny little legs and long dressed in a pair of black striped stockings, hidden under a large blue dress decorated with a large orange and black bow. She looks small, but she's not one to shy away from danger. His latest investigation concerns the magician Thomas Kane, who disappeared under mysterious circumstances. While wandering the streets of a gloomy Victorian London at night, he sees a teddy bear fall from a carriage, which instead of remaining on the ground as it should, gets up and starts chasing its master. Emma recognizes it because she has already seen it in a photo: it belongs to Kane. He therefore decides to pursue him, reaching an ancient villa full of traps and monsters that seem to have come out of a haunted house. To be able to overcome them, she will have to collaborate with Fenton, the teddy bear, who will form an indissoluble couple with her for the entire adventure. Broadly speaking, this is the story behind this puzzle game with platform elements created by a studio specializing in 3D graphics, Monochrome Paris, but with a passion for video games. Let's find out how it went in the review of Tandem: A Tale of Shadows. Black and white puzzles Solving the puzzles requires you to switch between both characters Despite the convulsive introduction, it is immediately noticeable that Tandem: A Tale of Shadows has very slow and reflective rhythms. The peculiarity of the game is not so much that you drive two characters, but the change of perspective that occurs when you switch from one to the other. Emma is framed from above and acts in what we can define as our reality, while Fenton is framed from the side and moves in a world made of lights and shadows, where the latter take on a solid state and can become a cage, like a ramp or a platform that help the teddy bear reach otherwise inaccessible places. The fundamental idea of the gameplay is precisely that of managing two characters so that Emma exploits and manipulates the light sources of reality to allow Fenton to advance and reach levers, buttons and anything else needed to clear the way for the little girl. The two help each other for the entire game, using their respective skills and discovering the peculiarities of the five settings they have to cross, starting from the garden of the villa, passing through the basements, the interior and so on until the solution of the case. The black and white world of Tandem: A Tale of Shadows In total Tandem: A Tale of Shadows is made up of forty different levels, which keep you busy for more than a few hours. The playing time varies according to the skill demonstrated in solving the various puzzles and the desire to look for the secrets scattered throughout the levels, the latter initially quite simple, but gradually becoming more and more difficult. The objective of each level is always the same: to get Fenton to reach a fragment which he will then throw at Emma to form the key with which to open the next area. The game structure is linear, in the sense that you have to solve the puzzles in the order dictated by the developers, thus following a pre-established path. Not bad, since the focus is definitely not on exploration. In this sense we are faced with a pure puzzle game, beyond the richness of the imagination that forms the background to the action. The controls of the two characters are very simple: Emma can walk, run and grab objects, moving them as needed. For example, some puzzles require you to move chests, while others require you to activate valves. Some puzzles are really ingenious Furthermore, the girl will often have a lamp in her hand, with which she will have to learn to cast shadows correctly, to favor Fenton. The teddy bear, on the other hand, can only jump and interact with some button or lever, in many cases by jumping on them. As the adventure progresses, things will get a lot more complicated, with the addition of elements that will introduce new types of puzzles and new difficulties. Furthermore, after the first relatively quiet levels, enemies will also arrive, such as giant spiders and shadow tentacles, also linked to puzzles. Facing them directly is equivalent to committing suicide, so you need to arm yourself with ingenuity to figure out how to overcome them without getting caught. Final crescendo One of the scenarios in which the game is set Despite being a puzzle game, Tandem: A Tale of Shadows also offers some spectacular moments, especially when facing the last levels of each area, which have their own unique characteristics. For exampleme, in the last puzzle of the garden it will be necessary to use a very long jack-in-the-box puppet to get to the end, while at the end of the dungeons it will be necessary to deal with giant tentacles. In general, the puzzles are of a good level from the beginning to the end of the adventure and have been built with a certain ability and with great awareness, between trolleys to push, enemies to block, chasms to overcome and so on. Some are quite difficult, but never really insurmountable, so much so that you advance with relative agility, never getting stuck for too long. From a narrative point of view, however, the story develops very slowly for the first two settings, and then increases in pace in the following ones, becoming more central to the whole experience, also supported by good 3D graphics (for the game's production level ). Fenton's world is black and white The latter deserves a little applause, because between stylistic refinement, well-characterized characters and a great scenographic taste, it really cuts a figure and helps a lot to immerse yourself in this gothic fairy tale with unpredictable implications. Tandem's only real problem: A Tale of Shadows is that once exhausted it offers very little reason to return to it. It's true that each of the forty levels is well structured and layered, so much so that it offers multiple challenges to the player, but once they're finished there's really no reason to play them again, unless you go in search of the aforementioned secrets. Another problem is that, however well done and packaged, it lacks that pinch of enthusiasm that never hurts in a title like this, something truly memorable that the player carries with him for the rest of his life. The substance is that we are faced with a solid and well-crafted title, which however never shows essential creative flashes.", "date": "2021-10-21", "grade": "8.0"}
