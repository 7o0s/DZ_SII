He certainly didn't have the slightest idea that that electronic puzzle developed with a couple of friends would become a real piece of pop history and, although he had created a primitive multiplayer version with his own hands, he hardly expected a party game future for his promising creature. In over twenty years, Tetris enthusiasts have witnessed the release of countless clones and iterations for the most varied platforms, most of which, and on this they all seem to agree, failed miserably in their attempt to recreate the feeling of the original Game Boy release; questionable were also the intentions to alter a perfect formula, showing tacky interfaces or adding tetriminos with the most senseless shapes. However, the excellent feedback received two years ago by Tetris Party on WiiWare, considered by many to be the best incarnation of Tetris on home consoles, have created optimistic expectations for the landing on the shelves of its Deluxe edition, with new game modes and a more content-rich multiplayer experience. For those who missed the downloadable version, Tetris Party Deluxe is, as the name eloquently suggests, a party game that expands the classic mechanics of the franchise into a branched competitive challenge, while not neglecting that large slice of enthusiasts who prefer a more solitary game. in which the only opponents are concentration and reflexes. We were 4 friends at pad Maybe it's time to immediately take the pebble off your shoe: if it is true that this ~shelf~ version adds a lot of meat to the fire compared to Tetris Party for WiiWare, it should immediately be noted that it is similar enough to the latter not to justify, in case of those who have already purchased the original, a higher cost. The game is in fact sold at a budget price, but users who don't feel the need for a truly complete multiplayer experience will probably be attracted to the cheaper downloadable version. As anticipated, there is no shortage of modes designed specifically for those who love to play single-player, but the heart of the title beats strong only with two or three friends sitting next to it. The classic Challenge mode allows four players to face each other in a rather traditional way, enriched however by the possibility of using objects capable of annoying the opponent: these power-ups are over a dozen, and allow, for example, to block the tetrominoes of rivals, stop them from spinning or increase their falling speed for a certain amount of time. Some objects, such as bombs or smoke bombs, will have to be placed in the opponent's field by pointing the remote control at the screen, which sometimes proves to be a rather inconvenient solution, since the controller is generally held in a horizontal position, with the arrow keys moving the tetromino and the 1 and 2 keys that rotate them clockwise or counterclockwise. In Shadow mode, instead, it is asked to cover a certain playing area by combining the various blocks, but the most extravagant options are undoubtedly those entitled Climber and Runner. The first adds a small character to the scenario, who will try to climb the blocks present to reach ever higher heights, but will only be able to climb one step at a time; the player's aim will therefore be to reflect on each placement, so as not to block or complicate the way for his Lilliputian friend. The Runner mode, on the other hand, transforms the classic Tetris into a real racing game, in which you have to move the tetromino within a track made up of blocks, in an attempt to reach the finish line without crashing or getting stuck. As trivial as it may seem at first, continuously rotating the piece while rushing it towards the goal requires concentration and quick reflexes. Players who wish can even connect the Balance Board or use the Wii Wheel to move the tetrominoes, but the initial excitement due to the sense of novelty soon gives way to the awareness that keys and the directional cross are the most comfortable and intuitive solution. Surprisingly, all the modes present in the game, including those described above, can be played locally against other players, giving a liveliness never seen before in a Tetris chapter, and for less competitive friends there are even cooperative options: one of one sees players teaming up in a larger field in a classic game of Tetris, while another splits the participants into two teams. Unfortunately the online experience is not aEqually deserving of applause: although the game allows you to communicate with challengers via WiiSpeak, or even to face owners of the WiiWare version, the only mode playable via Wi-Fi Connection is the traditional one. It's not the first time that a good Wii game has been neutered by a lackluster online component and, since some modes are meant to be played with friends, it seems unjustified why the developers have decided to exclude them from the experience online. The same disengagement can be seen in a lack of attention to aesthetics: Tetris Party Deluxe is far from being an eyesore and, although it is a game in which the mechanics really count, uninspired backdrops and repetitive music certainly does not honor such an iconic franchise.", "date": "2010-09-14", "grade": "7.8"}
