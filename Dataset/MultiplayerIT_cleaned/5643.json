The various MapleStory, Elsword, Combat Arms and many others come from this label, which may say little to the western public but are real mass phenomena especially in Asia. The landing of such a company in the mobile sector is easily associated with types of consumer products, capable of attracting a good mass of users but also characterized by a rather high-level production, and the new Legacy Quest fits perfectly into the ideal Nexon mobile gaming profile. It is a hack and slash-style action RPG strongly focused on the exploration of dungeons and on the collection of loot, elements in themselves already appreciated by large sections of the public and capable, moreover, of creating that addiction that can be connected well to a free-to-play structure also quite Machiavellian. Indeed, from this point of view, Nexon has studied the mechanics of the game well, creating a sort of roguelike in which in-app purchases emerge with a certain force within the structure: first of all, by providing time limits to the experience of game, given the need to wait for the torches to recharge in order to access further dungeons (or to bypass the wait by purchasing them with real money), then inserting a sort of permadeath that requires players to spend precious gems (also purchasable with micro-transactions, given their rarity) to be able to continue after the death of one's character with his ~legacy~, or rather the legacy that transfers the same level of experience to a new fighter as well as all the equipment. It is true that the latter are still transferred even without redeeming the legacy, therefore without spending anything, but in this case it is necessary to start from scratch from the point of view of experience. If you combine this system with the typical grind that emerges after a few hours of play, it is easy to understand how the mechanism of in-app purchases soon reveals itself as quite present, although it is still possible to play without spending practically anything and simply by taking forced breaks. Legacy Quest has all the ingredients to be addictive: dungeons, character growth and loot The game of roles The most convincing aspect of Legacy Quest is perhaps its deep role-playing structure, which emerges well despite the fact that the game wants to seem like a rather simple title. We find ourselves exploring numerous dungeons scattered in 7 different main settings, plus obviously the classic section outside the missions and dedicated to character management and the buying and selling of objects. There are only three macro-classes of characters, namely mage, warrior and rogue, but there are many intermediate nuances between one class and another that allow you to customize your fighter to the maximum. Despite the obvious predilection for ranged or short-range weapons and attacks, there are no severe limitations on the equipment that can be used by everyone, which allows for the creation of intermediate classes with mixed characteristics, thus developing very different fighting and playing styles between They. If this is combined with the enormous amount of weapons, armor and accessories that can be discovered by crafting the materials found in the dungeons, we understand how Legacy Quest is a well-reasoned action RPG capable of being appreciated by focusing both on the classic principles of 'Diablo-style hack and slash that on the possibility of evolving the character in different directions, thus also enhancing crafting as an essential element. To all this is added a particularly apt graphic characterization, which recalls the cubed style of Minecraft but using it in a different way, with a sort of chunky voxel that is pleasant to look at and with a considerable technical impact that manages to give a strong identity to a game which would have otherwise risked falling back into the classic fantasy clichs of the genre. The same elegance and simplicity is not found in the user interface, both as regards the control system and the menus. As far as the first sector is concerned, we are faced with the usual uncertain solution of the virtual stick, which is in itself rather reactive but associated with movement management that is not always precise and fluid, even if in the heart of the action, i.e. during combat , there are no problems responding to commands. Much more confusing is the management of the menus, which even in such a game represent an important element on which to pass aa good amount of time but which here force several superfluous passages and in general are not very intuitive.", "date": "2016-03-21", "grade": "7.4"}
