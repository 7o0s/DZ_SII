This particular connotation makes it in some ways superfluous to puzzle over what exact evaluation to give to the DLC: it's free, ergo you download it regardless. The real question, however, is another: does the addition of Dead Kings to the Unity package make the offer of the latest episode of the Ubisoft series more attractive? Particularly in the eyes of the skeptics and/or the disappointed, therefore of those who didn't want to trust the controversial action game based on parkour and contracted killings again, after years of stagnation and lack of novelty? Let's find out together. Underground The events of Dead Kings take place after the conclusion of the Assassin's Creed Unity campaign, but in reality, to access the expansion, it is enough to have completed the fourth game sequence, although proceeding in this way implies exposing oneself to some inevitable advances on the plot. Once the package has been downloaded, the scenario that forms the backdrop to the new adventure appears on the map as a possible destination next to a carriage: it is the city of Saint-Denis, renamed ~Franciade~ during the period of the revolution, and it is the where the remains of King Louis XVI were buried. Once he reaches the place, Arno goes to an appointment with the Marquis de Sade, who asks him to recover a mysterious manuscript kept inside the catacombs, right where the sovereign was buried. However, this is only the starting point of a story in which we will see Napoleon Bonaparte again, now corrupted by his own power, we will come across a wily boy who will make us reflect on our role and finally we will explore one of the Precursor temples in search of a particular relic. The main storyline is well told, even if a certain superficiality remains with regard to the figures of de Sade and Napoleon, who play the simple role of extras from the point of view of the plot, focused more on the ~redemption~ of the Arno and on the discovery of artifacts than the fans of the series know well, rather than on the ~fictionalized~ deepening of the events of some historical figures who really existed. Of course, there is no doubt that a good portion of the narrative elements that most fascinated Assassin's Creed have been lost with the renunciation of the ~contemporary~ component, represented in the first episodes by Desmond Miles and his relationship with Abstergo Industries. Between old and new Being an expansion, Dead King does not introduce substantial innovations compared to the mechanics that we appreciated in Assassin's Creed Unity, and which in fact make the latest exponent of the Ubisoft franchise a solid and convincing episode, capable of remedying most of the limitations historians of the series thanks to the introduction of much more difficult fights, well-differentiated weapons, a different approach to missions (more devoted to stealth than to frontal clashes) and a greater variety of the same. There was and continues to be a lack of enhancement of the climbs, which have lost the puzzle element of their origins and which are therefore trivialized, in spite of the beauty of the Parisian architecture and that, not to be underestimated, of Saint-Denis. The new scenario is reduced in size compared to the French capital, but still hosts a good amount of secondary missions in its streets in addition to the main storyline. A couple of quests take up the welcome theme of investigations, with Arno having to study various clues of a murder before accusing the one he believes to be the culprit, while others are based on colorful characters who entrust us with certain tasks; or they are devoted to the elimination of commanders surrounded by dozens of soldiers, tasks that will require attention and a pinch of strategy to be completed without incurring game over. However, it is the Dead Kings campaign that constitutes the fulcrum of the experience and introduces the most interesting innovations, taking up the incursions into the catacombs that had been seen in some previous chapters and mixing them with the resolution of simple environmental puzzles, based on the use of the lantern (a brand new object, which once lit drives away mice, bats and cockroaches to allow us to reach otherwise inaccessible areas) or on the activation of particular switches. In the catacombs there is also a new type of enemy, the workers employed for excavations. These are relatively weak opponents if taken one at a time, but who rely on numbers to overwhelm us should they discover us. Their peculiarity, however, is that of running awayand when their ~supervisor~ is killed, thus giving us the opportunity to resolve the clashes with a little cunning and in advance. Dead Kings is undoubtedly a welcome tribute to the owners of Assassin's Creed Unity Royal blood If you have completed the Assassin's Creed Unity campaign, you will start Dead Kings with a special and particularly powerful weapon, to then acquire another highly effective tool, the Guillotine, a sort of rudimentary grenade launcher that can be used as a ax in hand-to-hand combat. Unfortunately, both of these solutions represent an obvious problem for balancing the difficulty, given that the clashes end up being resolved much faster than when using the arsenal normally available in the base game. Among the various things that the developers had thought of to make the Unity experience more complex, in fact, also stood out a certain difficulty in raising money and a gradual increase in the costs of ~consumables~, including medicines, which basically prevented access to objects too effective and therefore trivializing the new and more difficult system of parries and counterattacks (not to mention the simultaneous assaults of several enemies, also an important novelty compared to the polite waiting for one's turn seen up to Black Flag). In short, you can certainly choose to tackle the Dead Kings missions with powerful weapons, but doing so by limiting yourself to less advanced equipment certainly makes the experience more interesting and demanding, forcing us to infiltrate stealthily rather than throw ourselves into the fray head-on low. Of course, that we wanted to ~let our guard down~ in this expansion can also be seen from the disproportionate amount of money that can be found in the chests located in the catacombs, capable of transforming us into nabobs within a few explorations and then returning to Paris to spend the money as we see fit, restoring the various cafes still stranded and buying whatever the retailers have to offer. On the technical front There is a lot of talk about glitches for Assassin's Creed Unity, and after all the free of charge of Dead Kings is due precisely to the sometimes exaggerated controversies linked to this aspect of Ubisoft production. Increasing the interactions and possibilities, as was done for this episode, never so rich in NPCs and different situations, inevitably brings with it the risk of running into technical problems of various kinds, although the task of preventing its onset is always up to and in any case to the development team. Having said that, during our experience with the expansion, tested on PC, we have never encountered any particular bugs, apart from some ~anomalous~ drop in frame rate inside some buildings and an initial startup problem which, however, seems to be related to Uplay and which was solved by checking the installation files. Instead, we appreciated the atmosphere of Saint-Denis, the fog that often invades the streets and which marks the evening hours of the city, some of its architecture (in particular the Basilica) and clearly the whole underground area, less beautiful to see but rich of interesting facets in the final part of the story. The soundtrack once again highlighted a serious lack of personality, lacking epic themes such as those of the first episodes of the series or the peculiarities of Black Flag, while the Italian dubbing seemed to us to be up to the task. For the rest, it's back to square one: the expansion is free and owners of Assassin's Creed Unity will download it regardless. However, is it an addition of value to the Ubisoft title, capable of increasing its attractiveness? Certainly yes, given that it further enriches the offer, providing us with another five or six hours to spend in a new and fascinating location.", "date": "2015-01-16", "grade": null}
