So starting to talk about the video game itself, which arrived on PC a few months after the first release on XBOX, everything starts from Butcher Bay, a maximum security penitentiary in which our digital alter ego is locked up. But Riddick is not one who gives up and we will therefore have to help him escape and savor freedom again. There will be obstacles galore but this man really has thick skin The adventure opens in a very ~Halfaffian~ way (forgive me for the bad neologism) with a Richard. B. Riddick handcuffed that mesto mesto enters the prison, accompanied by the ~ritual presentations~ by the very disreputable prison director Hoaxie. While we look around and the titles scroll on the screen, as if a film were starting, it's time to get in touch with the hard life of the prison that even in such a distant future has not changed its distressing characteristics, including a very crude vocabulary , clans ready to kill us, corruption of the guards and the like. Definitely perfect characteristics for a structure that closely resembles an RPG, given that some obligatory passages will be accompanied by a good number of subquests that can be tackled by choice, as well as a very broad interaction with a series of characters with whom we will be able to establish relationships different, buy objects and useful information for our Riddick's dream of freedom. Riddick can only minimally be considered a role-playing game given that the features taken from FPS and Stealth are much more consistent But Riddick can only be considered a role-playing game to a small extent since the features alternately taken from FPS and Stealth turn out to be much more consistent. In a sense, players will be almost completely free to interpret a large part of the game (in some parts there is no choice) as a massive shooter (but we will also face fights without firearms) or a more subtle and ingenious stealth. The very gloomy atmosphere that distinguishes most of the locations lends itself perfectly to Riddick's special abilities, who has no problem seeing his ~preys~ in the dark and sprinting at the exact moment from behind, like and more violently did the dear old Sam Fisher. The mixture of genres can be said to be perfectly successful and satisfying, also thanks to the excellent sensory side dish. The contraindications are only for all those who define themselves as ~purists~ of the genres and do not want such contaminations that it is difficult to insert a videogame work in a specific belonging box. Vin, I can't believe it!!! Excuse me, but am I the only one to see a sensational resemblance between the muscular protagonist of the Riddick saga and the very likeable Aldo of the Aldo, Giovanni and Giacomo trio? Aside from that resemblance, Vin Diesel is perhaps the most popular new action hero in the world. His career began way back in 1990 but international success came 10 years later with the film adaptation of Pitch Black (born as a TV movie). The following year, luck continued to turn towards VD who smashed the box office with the ~tamarrissimo~ and noisy Fast & Furios, which also became a point of reference for video game productions in the automotive field. Also in 2001, he also had an important role in Dangerous Companies in which he played alongside actors such as John Malkovich and Dennis Hopper. But the Vin Diesel phenomenon explodes with force thanks to XXX, a more modern and American version of James Bond, in which our big man really combines all the colors. If this was the year of the ~Chronicles of Riddick~ (film + videogames), we should soon see him in the role of Hannibal, the legendary Carthaginian leader who scared the Romans with elephants. The New York actor is also a video game lover, so much so that he has founded his own software house, Tigon Studios which seems to be working on a project, with the provisional name of Secret Agent, in collaboration with Bryan Singer (the director of the Usual Suspects and of thetwo X-Men) and former CIA agent Mark Feigin. PC vs XBOX The most attentive readers will probably have noticed that in the PC version of Riddick, compared to the XBOX one, the wording ~Director's Cut~ has been added to the name. The reason is obvious: in the supplementary extras present on PC a ~commentary mode~ can be unlocked which closely resembles those audio tracks present in films on DVD format in which directors, actors and other subjects who took part in a certain production, comment on watching the film. Exactly the same thing happens in Riddick but, in this case, it is a video game, with all the peculiar characteristics that a different medium brings with it. The gimmick is really nice and maybe some XBOX user who went into ecstasy for the game, could make the ~madness~ to replay it for PC just for this reason. The other most relevant novelty of this porting, in addition to the use of the classic mouse + keyboard combination for commands, is the inclusion of a new, decidedly spectacular level, in which we will have at our disposal a complete armor full of power of truly devastating fire. and that in the course of the game they will be, ouch us, also used by our enemies. On PC then it will then be possible, as tradition dictates, to save the game at any time (on XBOX instead there was only the checkpoint system). Another detail of no small importance is the price at which the title was marketed, plus low by about 10  compared to the XBOX one. However, Microsoft console owners will be able to wave the instruction manual which in the PC version has been reduced to a miserable sheet with the main commands. That Half Life 2 begins to teach in this field too? A movie or a video game? Like and more (if you have a PC capable of running it with all graphic parameters set to maximum without frame rate problems) than the XBOX version, Riddick on PC truly enhances the Normal Mapping technique (the same one adopted in Doom 3 and which allows to obtain truly amazing final results for the textures with a not excessive computational effort) which, combined with an excellent use of light effects and satisfactory settings, make the Vivendi title one of the few FPS capable of being at least comparable to their lords Half Life 2 and Doom 3. In my very personal opinion (I emphasize this to avoid controversy of any kind since the topic of this game is already boiling in the forum), Riddick remains one step below the two titles just mentioned but, technologically speaking is nonetheless at very high levels. On his side, the Starbreeze Studios work also has an excellent sound, both in terms of the adequately atmospheric musical themes, and for a dubbing work performed by real professional actors, among which Vin Diesel clearly could not be missing in the part by Riddick. Unfortunately, however, as in the version for the Microsoft home console, no localization work has been done not even for the subtitles and so unfortunately the rather ~slang~ English used by the protagonists will not be immediately and completely understandable, not even for those who has an average knowledge of the Anglo-Saxon language. A real pity also because the contents of the dialogues have been created with truly cinematographic attention. Done Already done? The other Achilles heel of Vivendi's production lies in longevity: even the player less accustomed to such interactive experiences will hardly take us over 10-12 hours to complete it and there is no multiplayer component even on PC. Who knows if a rather high sales success pushes the developers to offer us some add-ons in the future to make us fragga in the company of Riddick. The prerequisites for a great gaming experience, even online, are definitely all there. Comment Fortunately, for the Pcista videogame people, the porting of Riddick took place a few months after the summer launch of the XBOX version and did not wait for years as in the case of Halo. The news can only be welcomed with joy by lovers of FPS and stealth games given that the work of Starbreeze Studios moves on the coordinates of the two genres just mentioned with some splashes of RPG and does it in an excellent way, also thanks to a , a truly cinematographic atmosphere and narration (the idea of the DVD-style commentary is splendid, which can be unlocked later), capable of captivating the player exactly as a cinematic film does in the hall. Not least, the excellent technical sector, in which the normal mapping already celebrated on XBOX gives its best, reaching sparkling peaks with adequate machines to run it with all the graphic parameters set to the maximum level. A pity to therefore have to spoil this idyllic picture because ofa duration decidedly below the standards (we are talking about 10-12 hours of play) and for a total lack of localization in a game characterized by many and frequent dialogues, moreover characterized by a ~slang~ and not very easy to understand English immediate. We should also note the lack of a manual (Half Life 2 is starting to teach?) but we don't want to give a wrong perspective to our considerations. And then it is appropriate to reiterate that The Chronicles of Riddick is a videogame, a must for lovers of Vin Diesel and science fiction and for those who appreciate the mixture of several videogame genres. Pros: Great blend of FPS, Stealth and RPG elements Truly cinematic story, extras and atmosphere Superb technical quality Cons: Quite short Total lack of localization and a printed manual The meltin' pot of genres may not appeal to everyone The prequel trend Remember many years ago, when George Lucas declared that he wanted to make a trilogy prior to the ~classic~ Star Wars? Well since then, and not only in cinema (in videogames themselves, in comics and even in literature) there has been a flourishing of prequels, a search for roots in the past (more or less dictated by commercial reasons) of characters and entire sagas. Judging by the results, this ~trend~ has no intention of ending. But there are those who have done even more since the present The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape From Butcher Bay, is placed chronologically, prior to the film released this year (and called in the same way, but without the subtitle) which was already the prequel to the excellent and surprising Pitch Black. A prequel of a prequel therefore, which sees a virtual Vin Diesel (but IDENTICAL to the ~real~ one) in the role of Riddick as the protagonist in this imaginative sci-fi universe taken from the original literary work by Alan Dean Foster, which has now become the subject of cult for many millions of fans.", "date": "2004-12-21", "grade": null}
