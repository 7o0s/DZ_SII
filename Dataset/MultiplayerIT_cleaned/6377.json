So many were coming out, often more than one a month, that it simply seemed impossible to see the genre waning. On the contrary, a slowdown in the production of clones was called from many quarters. Instead here we are today amazed every time a new RTS is released on the market that is not a remastered edition or the shabby sequel of some historical brand. The heirs of Dune II have been completely engulfed by economic models of escape from the traditional market such as the free-to-play one, which have in fact sanctioned their deep and apparently irreversible coma, at least among the triple A. The most recent attempts to reinvigorate the genre come from minor publishers or from initiatives parallel to the industry, such as some successful campaigns on Kickstarter. The times of Command & Conquer and Warcraft 2 are still far away, but it's nice every now and then to see that fans have not been forgotten. Developed by Tindalos Interactive, those of Stellar Impact, Etherium tries to fit in the wake of the new wave of the genre, which has titles such as Gray Goo and Planetary Annihilation among its leading exponents, even if with some too much uncertainty about its nature. Let's discover the Etherium RTS and its two game phases: surprise or forgettable title? Guidelines Let's start by clarifying a fundamental point: Etherium is a title designed for multiplayer, but also playable in single player. Unfortunately, a few weeks after the launch, the server situation is not rosy and there are few people to play with. So let's perfect the formula just expressed: Etherium would like to be a multiplayer title, but the lack of online players will allow you to try it only in single player. However, do not expect the presence of campaigns or similar. Once the faction has been chosen, the player's goal is to conquer more planets than the enemies within the rounds in which the games are divided. Whoever controls more territories at the end of the war, or exceeds the number required for early victory, holding them for an entire turn, wins. The conquest of planets serves to take control of the most important resource in space, Etherium, which can only be extracted from the eggs of cosmic creatures. No, it's not the plot of an apocryphal book from the Dune cycle, even if ideally there is some resemblance. It is only a pretext to give consistency to the action, the latter divided into two phases: a strategic one and a conquest one. The strategic phase Etherium doesn't start on the battlefield right away. Once you pass the tutorials, it will take a few minutes before you fight for real. Initially you have access to a map of the universe with planets from which to mine Etherium. Once our first fleet has been created, we must begin the colonization by carrying out some missions, which yield research points to be consumed to improve our arsenal and other bonuses. To act, classic action points are spent, useful for moving ships from one planet to another, spying on the technological progress of enemies, occupying a territory, fighting against an enemy fleet, extracting cards from which to obtain bonuses or disadvantages for us for enemies, or attempt to wrest an already occupied territory. Only in the latter case, or if the artificial intelligence decides on its turn to attack a territory in your hand, does the actual combat begin. The importance of the strategy phase is central to the game economy. It is here, rather than on the battlefield, that you get the resources you need to win. Without research or a good supply of Etherium, it's easy to succumb to opponents far more advanced than us. This is also the phase that clarifies the multiplayer nature of the title, with its dryness, both narrative and gameplay, which makes it look very much like a board game. It's time to fight However, sooner or later the time to fight will come. Having chosen the theater of battle, we are catapulted onto the disputed planet, where we found our first colony, as well as the mission's operational base. Etherium maps are divided into zones. Each zone has its own node which allows the construction of a command center using a specific unit. Conquered a territory, you have one to three slots to build improvements. For example, you can increase the technological level of the entire army, or you can build a troop maintenance center and so on. Regardless of the choices made, the ultimate goal is to conquer as many territories as possible to have more resources, then launch the attackor final at the opponent's base, which will be completely razed to the ground. In the meantime, we also need to be able to defend ourselves against aggression, perhaps by building some turrets in the border territories (maximum three per area) or by asking for troops from the fleet, which will gladly send them to us, however asking us for the cost of the Etherium accumulated during the match. The only resource on the map are Etherium eggs, which can be exploited by building refineries. It can be deduced that a greater number of owned territories corresponds to a greater number of eggs and, therefore, a greater amount of resources to spend on the army. There are also secondary factions on the maps, which can be approached in two different ways: annihilate them to take their territory, or make friends with them to exploit their troops. In the first case, the behavior to adopt is quite obvious, while in the second, buildings must be converted to please a specific faction. Like any resource, secondary factions can also be more or less good. For example guardian cubes are much more powerful than raider cars and so on.", "date": "2015-04-28", "grade": "7.7"}
