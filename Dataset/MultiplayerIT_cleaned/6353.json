IF Game and Vertigo Games worked on it, with the collaboration of an adventure veteran like Bill Tiller. This shared effort has paid off, but unfortunately only to the extent that it prevents the game from sinking hopelessly into oblivion. Problems of funds, and therefore of time, we are convinced. In fact, the base is good and it is clear that the developers started with the best intentions. It is no coincidence that the first act is the most successful. When The Perils of Man was released a year ago in partial version on iOS systems, some may have thought it was a case similar to that of The Journey Down, that is, an adventure published a little at a time, in small steps. The Journey Down began as a free project and then evolved into a commercial product, with excellent development management, so much so that fans are attached to the game despite the long waiting times that separate the release of the various chapters. Instead The Perils of Man now comes out all at once on compatible PCs and mobile phones, forced to put a patch where the flaws are most evident. If you have an iPad or iPhone, considering how few point-and-click adventures are available on those platforms, you might enjoy the game more than sitting at home with dozens of wonderful adventures to choose from. We say this reluctantly, because the beginning of the game, although it doesn't have fireworks, still promises very well. Indeed, we find ourselves in the role of Ana, a Swiss girl passionate about science and with a well-oiled brain, who suffers a lot from the isolation her mother forces her into, still traumatized after the mysterious disappearance of Ana's father. Reading the dialogues carefully, we understand that the mother has found only one way to deal with the pain: to avoid any kind of risk for herself and her daughter Ana. In this way, however, he runs the most terrible risk, that is, losing the opportunity to live. Luckily for us, the daughter is of a completely different cloth and, on the night of her sixteenth birthday, while a storm is raging outside the shabby house where she lives, the opportunity arrives for her to leave for a great adventure in search of her father. with the opportunity to also discover what mysterious invention the parent was working on before disappearing. In fact, under the house where Ana and her mother live there is a secret laboratory which houses the latest evolution of a project on which all of Ana's ancestors worked, before it was up to her father to carry on the tradition. Two are the key objects of this study, a book entitled The Perils of Man and a pair of glasses known to initiates as the Risk Atlas, capable of identifying dangerous objects in the surrounding environment and interacting with the book to open time passages . In the company of a funny automaton named Darwin, Ana puts on her glasses and makes her first time travel. Destination: London, Aladon Theater, 1800. Despite the somewhat forced puzzles and graphic limitations, at this point the game has sufficiently awakened our interest. Unfortunately, this is also where The Perils of Man begins its downward spiral. The Perils of Man makes us dream of a grandiose journey but instead offers us a short jaunt full of hitches Unfinished The first thing you notice are the controls, lacking in several respects. Extracting items from the inventory to use them is not the best of comfort, just as looking for the sensitive points with the mouse to interact with without a key that reveals them is anachronistic and boring. Is there anyone who doesn't find it boring? Excellent, but at least leave us free to choose whether or not to waste time scanning the screen. Since we don't have to interact with a lot of objects anyway, let's just shrug past and focus on the visual aspect of the game. There's something about Ana's frozen, embalmed expression that contrasts with the lively voice acting, and while the character models are well drawn, the animations leave a lot to be desired. The backgrounds of the first act are sparse but all in all intriguing, while starting from Ana's first time travel they deteriorate visibly to an almost unacceptable level. Graphics often don't count, we agree, as long as you don't confuse thrift with sloppiness. The puzzles, initially uninspired but still enjoyable, gradually become more monotonous. Ana seems to forget what her main objective is, instead focusing on a series of actions necessary to resolve situations that we care little or nothing about from time to time. The ARThe mystery that we breathed at the beginning becomes more and more rarefied after the second time leap, when we find ourselves on board a ship at the time of the Second World War. To make the solution of the puzzles tormenting, in themselves not at all complex, there is a leap of clues system. The suggestions are only relevant to the room we are in and do not take into account what has already been done, thus becoming more of a hindrance than a help. Not always focused dialogues and misleading indications made us doubt that we had found the solution even when we had it under our noses. The negative progression of the story and the puzzles, except for the puzzle of the donkeys in the hold, worthy of the days of the glorious LucasArts, made us lose interest in finding Ana very early. An intelligent idea like the Risk Atlas, which allows us to look around in first person, thus exploiting the three-dimensional environment of the game, is vastly underused. Whenever it is needed, it simply lets us detect dangerous objects with an effect similar to that of heat detectors. Still, here and there an inspired dialogue or an interesting character pops up, a sign that the developers had a lot of good ideas scattered around. Unfortunately they didn't have the time and the means to tie them together in the best possible way and they tried to come up with a complete game by making do as they could. The hasty ending, which leaves little or no control in the player's hands, delivers the coup de grace to a title that would otherwise have achieved full sufficiency. Indeed, despite the many reasons there are to puff, the five or six hours in the company of Ana and Darwin allow you to appreciate at least a little the talent of the people who have imagined their adventure, and this also leaves something in the player. Who knows, somewhere maybe there is a parallel world where The Perils of Man shines. Sadly, we don't have a Risk Atlas to travel that far.", "date": "2015-05-08", "grade": "5.9"}
