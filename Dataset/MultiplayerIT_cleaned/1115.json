{"name": "Sherwood Extreme", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sherwood-extreme-recensione.html", "text": "Starting tomorrow, Sherwood Extreme will arrive on Steam, a new free to play game created by CAGE Studios. In the role of a thief we will have to launch into magical worlds to recover gems and eliminate orcs with our trusty crossbow. We see all the details in our Sherwood Extreme review. Do it with style Sherwood Extreme: run, jump, aim, shoot Sherwood Extreme is a third person shooter built around slow motion and stunts. Each level offers a more or less linear path on which we will find a series of orcs to be eliminated with a precise crossbow shot. Our character is able to perform jumps and somersaults in mid-air: by aiming while our feet don't touch the ground, we'll activate a slow motion that allows us to strike more precisely. The aim of each level is to reach a treasure chest full of gems, but we'll have to do it quickly and above all with style. Sherwood Extreme is an arcade game with a score hunt: each level rewards us with a maximum of three stars, depending on the points obtained. The latter are awarded based on the time spent, the health remaining, the number of enemies killed and the type of elimination (headshots and explosions are always better than a normal arrow in the knee). Each level will therefore have to be studied to find the best path, using ropes and trampolines to save time and explosive barrels to eliminate groups of enemies in one fell swoop. At the moment there are six classic levels available, to which is added a horde mode that slightly changes the cards on the table. Given that the core of the gameplay remains the same (aim and shoot at the orcs), in horde mode we will have a large square map instead of a linear level, and between the various waves we will receive bonuses such as a magma goat that makes us run faster fast and a jetpack made of chickens that allows us to make short flights. The six regular levels are well made, above all they have a unique level design style: for example, one map is very small and full of bouncing mushrooms, the first ones are linear and closed, another one is larger and allows you to choose with great freedom how to explore it. To this we add the fact that Sherwood Extreme includes an online cooperative mode that allows you to play the levels in pairs: in this case there are a series of additional skills that make the game more dynamic, such as the possibility of standing on the shoulders of the ally to move together or use the second player to throw a rope and approach him quickly. Game as a service Sherwood Extreme: There are various cosmetic items to buy with gems or real money The problem, currently, is that the seven levels can be completed in an hour and that within another hour most players will have managed to get the three stars in all or almost all levels. Sherwood Extreme is a game in progress, in fact, with a game as a service structure. On a monthly basis, new content will arrive divided into seasons (the first is pirate-themed), which will have their own Battle Passes (called ~Kingdom Pass~) that reward players with new cosmetic items at each level increase, with some free prizes and others only for those who pay. You can also spend real money to get other cosmetic rewards, but there are some costumes, hats and cloaks that can be obtained with in-game currency, or gems. These are earned by completing levels and eliminating the strongest enemies (in which case you have to physically go to the enemy's death point, sacrificing seconds and thus ruining your score). The most important part, however, is that the gems will also be used to buy new weapons. The most powerful currently available is a crossbow with a telescopic sight that allows you to aim very far with great precision. We managed to get it in about forty minutes of play, but the developers report that the in-game prices will change after the game's release: it is not clear what prices and how they will change, so we cannot comment on the economic balances for the moment interior of Sherwood Extreme. Sherwood Extreme: the coop allows you to play differently Then there are a series of challenges designed to gain experience for the Kingdom Pass or other gems. The challenges, to be activated manually, introduce modifiers to the levels, such as enemies that jump instead of staying in place, explosive barrels transformed into explosive chickens, small enemies, enemies with precision or explosive arrows and so on. These are nice ways to change the tables a bit and push players to replay the few levels again and again with quawhat's new. This is a good idea, but still not enough to counteract the paucity of content. Finally, let's comment on the artistic side of Sherwood Extreme. As you can see from the images, the game focuses on low poly, perhaps not of great impact, but still pleasant with its bright colors. More important is the fact that the action is always legible, also thanks to the fact that nearby enemies hidden behind objects are highlighted when we aim, allowing us to predict their arrival and not make the clash unfair. At the sound level, the game does its duty, with music full of energy that binds well to the arcade style of the title. We point out that we have suffered some crashes, but always in the menus and never in the levels (that is, we have never lost game data).", "date": "2021-05-11", "grade": "7.0"}
