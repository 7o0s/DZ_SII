{"name": "Visage", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/visage-recensione.html", "text": "It is my great pleasure to share the Visage review with you. Since this is a secondary and very little publicized production, it is highly probable that you ended up here because you were intrigued by the cover image or because you have already guessed what it is. In this second case, you will already know very well that two letters are essential to explain the game in question, just two letters in fact: PT. Yes, that PT shown in 2014 by Hideo Kojima: nothing more than a small demo that should have led to an epochal horror, that is to the new episode of Silent Hill; then that project ended as it ended (badly). Visage was born as a quote and homage to PT, to then take its path with very specific ideas. And if you love horror it is also an essential purchase: let's see why. The plot: what happened in that house? Visage has a protagonist whose name we don't know, a house to explore whose spatial or temporal location we don't know, and above all of the events behind which little or nothing is known. What the player needs to know is shown in the very short (but intense) opening cinematic: a man holds his gun, executes three victims he has previously kidnapped in a small room, finally shoots himself. Probably (but it is not clear) by taking his own life. Thus begins the plot of Visage, and continues in the same way: that is, in small bites. Don't expect a clear and linear narrative, this was never the intention of the developers of SadSquare Studio: to understand something (and you won't understand everything, as it should be) you will have to explore the environments well. And of course you will have to collect all the collectibles: these are mainly videotapes that you can listen to with some instruments present in certain rooms. The narrative context is then reconstructed slowly, reaching the conclusion of the story. The entire gaming experience is around fifteen hours in total, but it is a figure that you must evaluate with due care. If you're particularly alert and like running rather than enjoying the atmosphere, you might as well spend less; if you are denied with similar titles and anxiety eats you alive, it could easily take longer. But the atmosphere is precisely one of the top marks characteristics of the production: don't ruin it for any reason, regardless of your type of use. Gameplay: How to play? How to play Visage? Let's start with the definitions, so as to explain it in detail: first of all, the video game in question is a first-person psychological horror. This means that you will not take up a rifle to open fire on enemies, and that you will rather find yourself grappling with environments aimed at arousing anxiety and growing tension in you. And they will succeed perfectly; too much, actually. The gameplay is really similar to what is seen in productions that fall into the aforementioned category. Apart from the already mentioned and essential PT (the initial moments are an almost ~1:1~ quotation of Kojima's never realized project) the first Outlast immediately comes back to mind; the memory of Layers of Fear is even more fitting. If these productions did not convince you at the time, Visage will hardly convince you; vice versa, Visage is clearly superior to both in most aspects of the game. Let's go into more detail, but without excessive anticipations. The player finds himself inside a decidedly vast mansion: from there on the paranormal phenomena will begin. The goal is to get to understand what the heck is going on, but without dying. And to do this you will have to explore every single ravine, but every ravine, otherwise you will not find the key objects necessary to continue. You can already expect closed doors, shadowed exits, footsteps from the attic, objects disappearing and reappearing in unexpected places. But also enemies: real enemies who will put you in difficulty, and of which we don't want to tell you anything. You won't be able to fight them, so be prepared to sneak around or hide. Sanity, please The main mechanic behind Visage is sanity. The protagonist suffers psychologically from staying too long in the dark; a bit like it will happen to you players, after you finish the title. To prevent it from losing its mind, it is advisable to find candles, lighters and light bulbs to replace those that have already burnt out. These objects can be placed ad hoc, in a strategic way, in some points of the rooms of the mansion. Keeping your sanity at optimal levels is very important: if you don't pay attention to this indicator (indicated by the symbol of a cervello) your alter ego, well... will start experiencing supernatural events. The latter occur randomly, and are not the same in every game: it depends on the status of the protagonist. If things start to go wrong, it is advisable to retrace one's steps and gather some material to physically shed light on the surrounding environment. Visage, it must be said, does not overuse (i.e. abuse) jumpscares. Obviously there are some jumps here and there, and the opposite would be strange; but that's not what arouses tension while playing. Rather it is the whole atmosphere, combined with an uncertain progression and increasingly disturbing settings, which are very rich in detail, to embellish the title of SadSquare Studio. The tension will never leave you, and will always be palpable: the effects of a good horror book, a horror film or a horror video game, moreover, must also show themselves after fruition. And after Visage you will happen to look over your shoulder, if you are alone in the house, sometimes too often. Technical compartment A few more words must also be spent on the technical sector of Visage, which seemed truly remarkable to the writer. Even at medium graphics settings the adventure offers a remarkable glance, but if you have the possibility to tweak the details to the maximum, then you will be honestly amazed. All right, we're still talking about a video game set within a single house, yet the attention to detail is superior to all the other similar productions we've had the opportunity to test in recent years. Objects on the screen, luminous surfaces, lights in the rooms, even the gradations of the shadows: everything in Visage shows the quality of the production at all times; an undeniable quality, which catches the eye, which you cannot fail to notice. Technically speaking, therefore, you will have a little gem in your hands; this obviously in the face of small smudging that is equally impossible to overlook. The inventory, for example, appeared as inconvenient as few in life; and for heaven's sake, one could have thought of a more intuitive way to select which objects to hold in one's hand at any given moment. Between candles, lighters and so on (and the absence, in this single case, of a specific tutorial) it's going to drive you crazy. And not just for the story told.", "date": "2020-11-09", "grade": "8.5"}
