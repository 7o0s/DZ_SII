{"name": "Madden NFL 07", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/madden-nfl-07.html", "text": "Every damn Sunday Very short handbook of the fundamentals of sport: two teams of 11 beefy men face each other on a rectangular field measuring 109x48 metres. Their goal is to bring the oval ball used in this sport to the end zone of the field; in this area, however, the ball must be physically brought there by a player, and not simply thrown. Furthermore, it is played with the hands and it is allowed to use the feet only on a few specific occasions; during an attacking action the ball can be passed forward only once. It goes without saying that the primary objective of the team playing defense is to block the ball from moving towards its goal with all legal means: you can intervene directly on the ball carrier with a tackle and in this case you start with a new action from where the tackle took place, or on the ball. By stealing or intercepting it, the game changes and the team that was on defense goes on offense; obstructing its course without however maintaining possession will instead cause the action to be repeated. All this in principle, because in reality this sport is much more complex, already at the level of regulation, than it might seem at first glance. If you are curious to know more, look around a bit because here it is time to start talking about Madden, which would then be the subject of the article Madden NFL 07 in its edition for Nintendo Wii adds a new dimension to the simulated game Every damn Sunday We are at the seventeenth edition of the historic EA Sports simulator, which has always been an obligatory choice for anyone who wants to grind a few virtual yards because it is only opposed from time to time by a few competitors. There is a reason: dear old John Madden Football has always been a good game, year after year more complete, rich, simulative and spectacular up to the latest editions and regularly, and it is understandable in light of both the passion of the Americans for this sport and what has been said about the quality of the franchise, they monopolize the top spots in the North American sales charts. This Wii edition, however, is a turning point and the reason is easy to understand: the Wiimote and its interface that involves the player's whole body allow the sensations of a sport so physical not a ~simple~ joypad. EA Sports probably understood this from the very first opportunity it had to experiment with the Wii, they didn't have to be asked and did practically everything that needed to be done! Power is nothing without control! Once on the field therefore, after having chosen a scheme to use among the many proposed - faithful reproductions of those actually adopted by the various NFL coaches - every game action will be managed with hand movements, a separate movement which is clearly deputy to the analog stick. A passage will therefore take place by mimicking the real movement with the wiimote, and the result in the game will be influenced by the direction and force impressed on the remote control; during the race, to abruptly change the direction of the path, just shake the nunchuck, to extend an arm and thus hinder the movements of the opposing defender, instead it will be necessary to move the wiimote, while shaking both of them will make a feint. A tackle, again, will result from the decisive forward movement of both arms, while when you are engaged in a ~melee~ by an opponent you will have to furiously drumming wiimote and nunchuck to get the better of it. A kick will require the movement of the wiimote upwards and the game will take into account strength and inclination, while if you want to intercept a ball thus replacing the CPU, which in the attack phase will automatically attempt the ~catch~, to anticipate the opponent all you have to do is push both arms upwards, as well as if you want to, in defense, deflect the ball with a ~swat~, the movement of the wiimote is exactly what you would do in a real situation. the new interface makes everything immediately clear Power is nothing without control! That's not all, because with wiimote and nunchuck you can also signal your unmarked and favorable position to the quarterback by waving your arms, or even cheer on the friendly audience before the start of a play These are all possibilities that even the traditional Madden had, but believe it when we tell you that the new interface makes everything immediately clear by literally eliminating the steep learning curve that all sports games so rich in possibilities present. And the result is a physical, exciting, engaging game: every action completed with successprocess gives tons of satisfaction because, as in real football, the result of careful tactical planning and of a gesture that would be exaggerated to define athletic, but which is still the closest you can imagine to doing indoors of your bedroom. In short, we say it bluntly: the exploitation that EA has made of the Wiimote for its Madden has fully convinced us, delighted us and not infrequently even exalted us. The genius of patterns The rest is the usual Madden. Don't be fooled by its pandering: the title does everything to be loved by the widest possible audience by enticing them with clean and elegant menus and with a licensed soundtrack that is the most MTV Generation you can think of, but its substance remains a simulation that becomes ~hard and pure~ without compromises at the highest difficulty levels and by suitably acting on the thousands of parameters available in the options. And football, we repeat, is a complicated sport We are helped by an excellent tutorial phase to get used to the new controls, and a new mode for this year, the NFL Network which explains in detail the different patterns of attack and defense, but in reality nothing is more formative than taking part in a couple of nice friendlies on the field by which to grasp the controls and regulations, this of course for newbies. Those who are already practical, on the other hand, can immediately take part in the classic Franchise mode, which includes various managerial elements while you lead a team by the hand for several seasons, can organize a tournament with its own rules or, another novelty this year, create a player and starting it from the beginning, from the ~draft~ through which NFL teams select rookies fresh from university tournaments; your alter ego will not only live from training sessions and matches, who will have to juggle between taking care of one's appearance and relations with the press, the fans, any cinematic proposals in a way that is certainly exciting and complete. The picture is completed by three multiplayer mini-games, exclusive to the Wii version, very fun and ~additive~ but which unfortunately can only be played by two. The totally positive judgment so far is invalidated by some elements, mainly technical. The genius of patterns The totally positive judgment so far is invalidated by some elements, mainly technical. The graphics engine does almost nothing to distinguish itself from the GameCube version, and in this sense the versions for the other nextgen consoles are definitely on another planet. It's a shame, because the Wii could do more; some defects must also be added such as interpenetration of polygons, in some cases sensational with the players who happily walk into each other, fortunately only in the cut scenes. It's certainly not bad to see what will present itself on our televisions as the disc enters, but it is clear that the programmers have done little more than bulk transfer the GCN code to the new machine; for the first year, and the understandable willingness to go out at launch, we can forgive them, just as we can also forgive the complete lack of any online option, which in this case would in any case be more attributable to Nintendo than to EA. From the point of view of the game on the pitch, however, there is a big difference between the offensive phase, where you will always seem to have everything under control, and the defensive phase which will often be more confusing and apparently random. But this is due to the simulative nature of Madden, which inherits the fundamental importance of schemes and teamwork from real sport: fortunately, artificial intelligence has come a long way in seventeen years... A great first. Madden NFL 07 for Wii first of all presents itself with the granitic, traditional simulation formula that excites fans and excites newbies, promising tons of options and hours and hours of gameplay, to then surprise with one of the most complete, intelligent and fun uses of the game interface that Nintendo hopes to establish as the standard of the new century. And that such a proposal comes from EA... The one you will live on the field is at times an exhilarating experience, capable of establishing the difference between this and the other versions of the game. EA Sports then makes a touchdown of those to remember: if next year there will be an engine designed for Wii and some online modes, the Superbowl is guaranteed! Pros Great use of the Wiimote Tons of modes for hours and hours of play Madden is always he Against Graphically is a Cube Nothing online As usual, difficult for the layman Idolized in America as and more than football here, this sport so innately a starstripes, male, violent yet unexpectedly, at least for those who approach it as a complete layman, deep and strategic, outside Yankee territory it is almost completely ignored, and if we had to guess, we would guess that there are very few of you who you are reading us right now, those who even once in their life have participated in a game with all the trappings. Oh God, an oval ball perhaps with the logo of the NFL, the US professional league, printed on it, perhaps it is still found in the closet, among the toys and junk of childhood, and it is not difficult that in the past, influenced by one of the few images that come so far of the deeds of the very muscular athletes or from some film, we have taken it in hand trying to awkwardly imitate runs, passes and scrums of which we understood very little anyway. But the time to make up for it always comes in life: Madden NFL 07 in its edition for Nintendo Wii adds a new dimension to the simulated game, the ~physics~ one, which makes everything engaging and exciting as never seen before.", "date": "2006-12-29", "grade": null}
