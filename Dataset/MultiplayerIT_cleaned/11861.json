{"name": "Folklore - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/folklore-recensione.html", "text": "The soul is everything Folklore can be defined as an action game with strong RPG influences. The story is lived alternately in the shoes of Ellen and Keats, who are used separately, chapter by chapter. Each of the two characters basically retraces the same path, but sees things from their own personal point of view, and only by combining the information obtained from the individual adventures does one become aware of the plot in all its completeness. Ellen and Keats have to move continuously from the world of the living, which in this case is limited to the village of Doolin and its surroundings, to the Underworld, i.e. the world of the dead, strongly dreamlike and evocative. While during your stay in Doolin the mechanics are more or less those of an RPG, where the only purpose is to investigate and gather new information by talking to the various non-player characters, the Otherworld is the scene of the action part of the title, and involves many fights. The enemies are the Folk, monstrous creatures that house the souls of the deceased, called Ids. By defeating a Folk, you can absorb its Id (or soul), assign it to one of the four assigned keys and use it to launch attacks. Attacks consume a portion of the classic ~mana~ bar, which recharges over time. Each creature has its own particular attack, and belongs to a different element. By absorbing the Ids of Folk already captured previously, you get, in pure RPG style, to increase their experience and, once you reach a certain level, unlock new skills or increase their power. Magic and technique The Folk are more than a hundred, and both from an artistic and a practical point of view they are very original and quite differentiated. Using the various abilities of each creature in combat is a lot of fun, and undoubtedly original, but the enemies are not equipped with great artificial intelligence, and in addition to following patterns that are rather easy to get around, they inflict little damage on average. The result is that a minimally shrewd player could find the level of challenge offered by Folklore really inconsistent: personally I died for the first time only after several hours of play. The combat system, then, is very much focused on the great variety of usable creatures, but with some adjustments it could be much more profound, captivating and dynamic. The rhythms of Folklore are closer to those of the RPG than to those of the action, and even during the fights we will never reach the adrenaline levels of a Devil May Cry or a God of War. Folklore must be experienced calmly, like a sort of interactive fairy tale: this is testified by the interlude scenes, which, apart from some sporadic computer graphics films, are static tables with captions and written dialogues, devoid of any form of dubbing. This gives back a feeling of having something ~old gen~ in your hands, but at the same time exerts a certain form of charm. The motion sensor of the Sixaxis pad is left with the task of capturing the souls of the Folk once shot down, through its vertical and horizontal rotation. Folklore guarantees about 15 hours of gameplay for the average player. The graphics of Folklore do their job well while not surprising with excessive technical arrogance or exaggerated effects. Of course we are not faced with a production of the highest level, but the emotions returned by the beautiful landscapes and the atmosphere that the artists have managed to instill in each screen are undoubtedly a huge plus. In fact, the artistic side is the most successful one, and I challenge anyone not to be amazed in front of certain environments, whether they are in the world of the living or in that of the dead. The sensations of sweet melancholy in the village of Doolin and dreamlike suspension in the Underworld are simply fabulous. Magnetic. Magic and technique The Italian dubbing, for what little appears in the computer graphics films, is of very fluctuating quality: while the main characters are all more or less acceptable, some ~extras~ (see the sailor in the opening film) are absolutely unpresentable. The same goes for the music, velvety and fascinating in some cases, repetitive and irritating in others (the music of the fights will bore you in a very short time). Average sound effects. The game is completely localized in Italian. Comment Folklore brings a fair amount of originality to a genre usually focused only on fights and characterized by a faster pace. Excellent from an artistic point of view, the Game Republic title keeps the interest high with an articulated and compelling plot, but it lacks from the point of view of the game difficulty, really too low, andfrom the mere technical aspect, not exceptional. With its aura of melancholic charm, Folklore is a very welcome surprise this autumn from Sony, and should be held in strong consideration by all PlayStation 3 owners who know how to enjoy an action game without necessarily having to screw the values of the adrenaline.Pros Original and charismatic Enthralling atmosphere Cons Potentially deeper combat system Low challenge level Folklore is available for PlayStation 3. There is a world where Northern European fairy tales are seen through the lenses of the Eastern tradition, and mix with dark and melancholy atmospheres, with vaguely horror hues. We are talking about the world of Folklore, a bizarre and controversial action game developed by Game Republic exclusively for PlayStation 3, born from the ideas of Yoshiki Okamoto (executive producer of Resident Evil, Devil May Cry and Oniumusha) and current interpreter of the role of the outsider, both from a sales and critical point of view. Folklore tells the story of Ellen and Keats, the two main characters, respectively a seventeen-year-old girl and a reporter from a magazine on the occult. Ellen is attracted to the Irish village of Doolin, a place full of mysteries that even hides the door to the afterlife, by a letter sent by her mother who died many years earlier, and likewise Keats rushes to the place because he is intrigued by a report that has come to him in editorial office. The plot will develop in a rather intricate way, and there will be twists and turns.", "date": "2007-11-06", "grade": null}
