So when the Polish developers of Techland, before then involved in many other videogame experiences, proposed this strange concept, the project immediately gained the attention of many, fueled, moreover, by a heated controversy over violent contents which arose even before the presentation of the actual game, starting only with a CG trailer. The result was disruptive for Deep Silver, who found a real sleeper hit in her hands, selling 5 million copies worldwide, thus putting the brand in a safe and preparing the way for an obvious second chapter from bring to market. The indestructible charm of zombies in such an atypical setting is not enough to explain the excellent result achieved by Dead Island. A success that probably arrived thanks to the unstable formula that characterizes its gameplay, based on a not easy hybridization between FPS, survival horror and multiplayer RPG that made it, albeit imperfect, still attractive to varied audiences despite not resulting in a properly mass product. Therefore the choices made by Techland for this sequel have aimed more at expanding the original experience, providing more spaces and more content, rather than modifying or transforming its structure, which has remained substantially unchanged. To tell the truth, Dead Island: Riptide at first was not even framed in a certain way: the re-proposition of the settings and the same characters of the first chapter initially made us think of a maxi-expansion, but the magnitude of the new explorable area dispelled any doubt about the essence of this title as a real sequel. And a more direct sequel to this is not easy to find, in fact, with the story starting exactly from the final minutes of the first chapter, showing an evolution of events that is decidedly more negative than the progenitor's ending could lead to hope. . Who do you Voodoo (bitches)? Dead Island: Riptide is therefore the direct continuation of the first chapter, to which it engages practically without interruption, showing at the beginning a summary of the previous events and starting from the escape by helicopter which, instead of being saving, turns out to be only the beginning of a second part of the nightmare, if possible even worse than the first. To confirm this setting, the game is set up for the recovery of the saves from the previous chapter, so much so that, if these are not present, it imposes the choice of a character with a ~flat-rate~ distribution of different skill points to be applied to the skill trees, so starting with an already advanced level fighter. The four protagonists of the original have been joined by a fifth, John Morgan, who specializes in hand-to-hand combat. The ~impersonal~ setting chosen by Techland for the development of the plot continues, so that also in this case, regardless of the character chosen, the story will always continue in the same way. Questionable choice but now inherent in the gaming experience and since it was a chapter closely connected with the events of the first, there weren't many other possibilities. On the other hand, a narrative of this type fits more consistently with the cooperative multiplayer setting, therefore the characterization of the characters is linked exclusively to their different fighting style and personal skill trees. Beyond the introduction narrated in first person by Purna therefore, regardless of who you choose to play the game, the aim is to save the whole group of five survivors mysteriously immune to the zombifying contagion by seeking salvation: first off a ship overrun by the infected, then off the island of Palanai and finally, possibly, out of the city of Henderson and its accursed archipelago. This with regard to the main quest, so to speak, because as in a classic open-world RPG, the sequence of events is decided in the first person by the player and by his willingness to follow the numerous quests offered by the huge explorable sandbox. Even in this case, however, there is a certain flatness in the narration and a scarce variety of situations in which it is possible to find oneself. Beyond the changes of setting, which offer much more diversified scenarios than in the previous chapter, with the possibility to move on boats through an archipelago, the secondary quests almost always resolve themselves in the search and delivery of objects, according to the classic ~express courier syndrome~ that often affects games with an open setting, necessarily untied from iron and deep narrative scaffolding. After all, this was not even the strong point of the first chapter and the characteristic is repeated in Riptide, despite a decidedly more complex main story than its predecessor. The horror in subjective As appears by now consolidated from the first Dead Island, the game is more a free-roaming RPG in first person than a real FPS, but its hybrid form is accentuated, in this chapter, by a greater presence of firearms, although their use is certainly secondary to ~melee~ combat, with impact, white and throwing weapons. The practically unchanged setting carries the strengths and weaknesses of the original, starting from the basic element that never ceases to be controversial: the application of the subjective to melee combat continues to be an imperfect solution. The first-person shot restricts the view excessively when colliding with opponents coming from different directions, with the difficulty of accurately judging the distances and the point of impact of the shots adding to the general chaos. It's a compromise that we have to accept right from the start and that can be overlooked simply by indulging in a little blind and undoubtedly exhilarating, almost cathartic violence. Accuracy must be renounced, in most cases, for a healthy dose of blows given blindly left and right, pace of the interesting system of selective dismemberment of the enemies' limbs which allows you to invalidate the zombies and reduce their offensive potential. ~Pro~ players can specialize in the analog combat mode, which allows you to deliver blows differentiated in terms of power and direction with the use of the analog sticks, but this is also a somewhat cumbersome solution when you find yourself surrounded by hordes of angry zombies. However, its introduction as an alternative option is good. Strategic planning then moves, above all, to the choice of weapons based on the different effects they cause and the differentiated range of action, with the use of the ~Fury~ mode as the final weapon to be dosed with care. The sense of imprecision and incompleteness of the combat system accompanies the gaming experience from the first chapter and those who have spent hours on that will still find themselves at home, in the indiscriminate slaughter of walking corpses, and there is no doubt that everything is still fun, and exponentially more enjoyable if faced in multiplayer, central mode in the play structure. It is also for this reason that, despite the evident repetition of situations, the far and wide exploration of the vast setting is never heavy, but rather continuously stimulated. The other thrust is given by the properly role-playing components, which lead to the continuous evolution of the character through the collection of experience points and the frantic search for the ~loot~, between the loot released by the enemies and the treasures hidden around the islands, fueled by the good weapon crafting and modification system. On the front of the character, the three tree diagrams relating to the evolution of the ~Fury~ combat mode, the basic ~Combat~ and ~Survival~ are re-proposed, for the placement of experience points in correspondence with the unlocking of different skills and characteristics. Even the crafting is substantially unchanged from the first chapter but more extensive in the different possibilities of managing the arsenal. There are impact, cutting, fire, throwing and melee weapons (each character specializes in a type), each characterized by a coefficient of rarity and by different statistics in terms of attack, handling and durability, all repairable , upgradeable and modifiable through the use of workbenches scattered throughout the game, with a large variety of obtainable results. The satisfaction given by the conquest of a rare weapon and its use with relative upgrades is something known to lovers of looting in RPGs and this too represents a significant boost to deepening the game. The problem, in this sense, derives rather from the continuous ~respawn~ of objects around the island, which partially invalidate the satisfaction of the discovery, making it possible to accumulate large amounts of money in a very short time and multiply the objects, partially nullifying the importance of businesses, a rather questionable choiceand from the developers. Winning team gets bigger More than on quality, in the sense of variety of situations and contents, Techland has therefore decided to push on quantity, proposing a much broader scenario than the previous one and increasing practically all the elements in play, from the settings to the usable characters, from the quantity of enemies to the variety of weapons. In short, the perfect representation of the ~more of the same~, a choice also made necessary by the precarious balance that characterizes the hybrid gameplay of Dead Island. The desire to propose something new in situational terms is limited to some rather timid additions, which however have the advantage of not unbalancing the particular atmosphere and structure of the game. Among these we note the presence of large sections within closed complexes, sporadic firefights against human enemies and some phases in which you find yourself, with teammates, to defend a perimeter from the progressive attack of hordes of infected, with the possibility of fortifying the area with various defensive systems. Interesting idea if it weren't for the fact that it is repeated, practically identical, several times throughout the game, which makes it a bit overused gimmick. Closely linked to the new vastness of the setting is the introduction of boats as a means of transport, which to tell the truth work more as a relaxing moment in which to enjoy the wonders of nature than as a new gameplay element, but are still pleasant and functional from a touristic point of view. The new introductions in terms of enemies and weapons are well integrated into the fabric of the game, in a natural expansion of the gameplay within the boundaries well defined by the first chapter. In this regard, there is a greater space given to firearms, present in greater quantities than their predecessor and with more frequent ammunition, but they are still objects to be used with particular parsimony and in general secondary to melee weapons, as per tradition. Better stability of the netcode should allow for less worrying use of cooperative online multiplayer, which also takes advantage of a new matchmaking balancing system that aims to allow more balanced assortments between players in the drop-in / drop-out system. Another absolute novelty is the variability of the weather conditions, thanks to which violent monsoons with wind and rain are generated from time to time, reducing general visibility, changing the lighting in an instant and darkening the atmosphere. Xbox 360 goals Dead Island contains 35 achievements that make up the total loot of 1000 unlockable points. This is a relatively low number of achievements, which in fact on average grant a higher score than usual. Aside from the objectives linked to particular events in the course of the story, most are progressive, i.e. they are based on the achievement of particular performances during the course of the game, in a similar way to Steam objectives, usually linked to the amount of times a certain action is repeated. Treacherous Paradise Dead Island: Riptide is based on an obviously updated version of Techland's Chrome Engine 5, which has already proven itself previously, especially with the first chapter of the series. The glance is truly remarkable, especially in the exteriors, with lush plants and splendid tropical panoramas to create the characteristic strident oxymoron with the hell of putrefied flesh that has invaded the setting. Therefore, the sense of wonder in front of the beauties of nature remains intact, which also acts as a further stimulus to explore the enormous map to the fullest. However, at a closer look, some of the graphical flaws of the first Dead Island are still visible. The fluidity is often unstable, passing from moments of extreme speed to drops in framerate, even important during the most agitated phases, as well as some contact problems between the polygons which can sometimes be costly, when you get stuck in obstacles that are not easily detectable or badly calculated. Combining this with the choice of the subjective point of view, which certainly increases the level of immersion in the game world but involves an obvious reduction of the field of view, these problems can appear quite evident. The modeling of the characters does not seem to have undergone the change hoped for from the first chapter to this part, even if the greater variety of enemies on the screen creates a good effect during clashes and exploration. Perhaps a greater interaction with the scenarios given by an implementation of the deeper and more realistic physics would have been desirable, but also from this point of view", "date": "2013-04-22", "grade": "7.5"}
