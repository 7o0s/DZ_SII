{"name": "La Tigre e il Dragone", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/la-tigre-e-il-dragone.html", "text": "Crouching Tiger Double Dragon The videogame transposition of La Tigre e il Drago follows the primitive videogame structure of the simplest scrolling fighting games: the entire mechanics at the base of the game are reduced to advancing in the levels beating all the enemies that stand between our alter-ego and the conclusion of the internship, using all the weapons that can be mastered and mastering the few special techniques available; the latter are obtained using weapons or bare hands as much as possible and represent a sort of ~finishing move~, which can be implemented after having stunned an enemy by performing a precise combination of buttons. To add a minimum of variety to a decidedly stale combat system, we think of a defense mechanism that is more choreographed than necessary: by pressing the L1 key at the precise moment in which an enemy attack is about to strike, a spectacular animation will automatically be performed which will allow our character to avoid the blow without taking the slight damage that a parry would imply. There isn't really much more to add, the simplicity and linearity of the Tiger and the Dragon game system is almost embarrassing, so much so that it seems impossible that a similar product has remained under development for so long. Even the structuring of the game itself leaves us rather displaced: in fact, it is possible to face the adventure in the role of three characters (Li Mu Bai, Jen and Yu Shu Lien) but the exclusive internships for each are really small and for the rest we finds himself retracing the same patterns without any variation; from time to time we find ourselves facing some sections with a vaguely platformy flavor, where the biggest obstacle, however, is the poor management of the camera. A real pity, because the ideas and foundations for pulling a great game out of the hat were all there. Blushing Tiger Hidden Dragon Technically we are dealing with a product without art or part: although the polygonal modeling and texturing of the main characters and opponents is all in all satisfactory, the animations are wooden and at times unpleasant and the variety in the case of enemies borders on absolute zero, forcing the player to continually face an infinite sequence of bad guys all the same, both in aesthetics and in combative strategies. Even the scenarios in which the game is set appear flat and not very detailed, presenting a depressing chromatic variety. On the other hand, between one internship and another, the insertion of computer graphic films or sequences taken from the original film is pleasant. Even the soundtrack is perplexing, as the few good quality songs are extrapolated from the film while the rest are immediately recognizable for their monotony and inadequacy. Let's drop a pitiful veil on the dubbing... Comment Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was a good film, probably not suitable for all audiences, aimed above all at fans of the genre (the wuxiapian) and lovers of martial arts and beautiful choreography (it is no coincidence that the genius behind the fights of The Tiger and the Dragon was the Watchowsky brothers' sidekick in the making of The Matrix clashes). The video game does not do justice to the existence of personal tastes regarding the appreciation of the film either: it is simply insufficient. It's incredible to think that after so many years of design and development the Genkis have managed to program a similar title, which makes linearity and monotony its main aspect, barely raised by an all in all interesting combat system but penalized by its excessive simplicity. Technically mediocre, Tiger and Dragon remains a title dedicated exclusively to fans of the film or to all those who feel the exaggerated lack of a scrolling fighting game in their personal toy library. Pros Interesting combat system Cons Technically mediocre No variety A few years ago the wuxiapian film Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (original title: Wo Hu Cang Long, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon in America), directed by the Taiwanese Ang Lee (director of Sense and Sensibility but also of the more recent Hulk) caused a lot of talk about if: winner of the Oscar for best foreign film, Tiger , Hidden Dragon is a dramatic film studded with action scenes where kung-fu is the master, mixing with the poetry of the splendid scenery and the sweet and melodic soundtrack. We are in Ching Dynasty China, at the center of the narrative is the unfortunate love storyand between sword master Li Mu Bai (played by the excellent Chow Yun Fat) and his wife Yu Shu Lien, hampered by the memory of Li Mu Bai's brother, loved by Shu Lien years before his death. Li Mu Bai's already difficult decision to abandon the sword to spend the rest of his life with Shu Lien is further tested by the return to the scene of an old adversary, Jade Fox, who is determined to steal the Green Destiny, the splendid sword of Li Mu Bai, exerting an evil influence on the young apprentice thief Jen, who in turn longs for freedom and is captivated by the charm of the criminal Black Cloud... The video game of Tiger, Hidden Dragon was announced a few months after the release of the film, but only now we have in our hands a definitive version of what could have been a great action-game but...", "date": "2004-01-07", "grade": null}
