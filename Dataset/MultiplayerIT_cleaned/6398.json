For general considerations on gameplay, we refer you to that article, still 100% valid. The free-to-play shooter by Vostok Games, considered the most accredited spiritual heir of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series, despite the decisive change of setting, has since made decisive steps forward from a technical point of view, with many problems that have been filed and others fixed. Although the final version is still a long way off (at the time of writing this article, the client indicates that we are at version 0.27b) and there is still a long way to go, it is the perfect time to draw some sums and be more decisive in determining the value, advising you or not to try it and, perhaps, to spend money on it. Obviously we have not approached it as if it were a finished game, but it is right that, given that your money is real, some stakes are set and we begin to clarify in a more decisive way which potentials have been expressed, which ones are still languishing in the developmental limbo and which will never reveal themselves. Matchmaking and stability Let's start immediately by talking about the two problems that most plagued the lives of users in the first months of the game's life. Matchmaking has infuriated a great many people. There was a time when Survarium was simply inaccessible, between inability to enter game servers and sudden crashes. Then the matchmaking system was changed, making seasoned players lose their temper because it was no longer based on the player's skill, but on arbitrary values that only created chaos. Now, fortunately, the many minor patches released at a constant rate and the return to the old match organization system have fixed most of the problems, and it is therefore possible to be able to play without having to stuff yourself with tranquilizers first. Only in particular situations can the waits get longer, for example if there are few players connected. Let's say that in general it is possible to access the game in less than a minute, but in some cases the waits can last longer than ten minutes (verified). Usually this happens in moments of less traffic on the servers, therefore with us during the morning. While in the afternoon or evening we never had any problems finding someone to play with. Also from the point of view of stability, the situation has improved enormously, so much so that in the last week we have not experienced blocks of any kind or unwanted returns to the desktop. Just think that in the version we used for the test we sent you to at the beginning of the article, it was difficult to be able to play for more than an hour in a row without some apocalyptic event destroying the game. In short, from a technical point of view the progress is evident, progress that is also reflected in the fluidity of the graphics. With the same configuration, since then, with the details set to ~Ultra~, we have gained at least six frames per second. Not bad. We're back fighting in the lands of Survarium to find out if there has been any progress What about the open world? One of Survarium's announcement features that most appealed to S.T.A.L.K.E.R. it was the promise that it would be open world with missions to fulfill and clans to create to hunt for artifacts for the post-apocalyptic Russia that sets the scene for the action. According to the development times dictated by Vostok Games itself, these features should have been implemented as early as 2013. Well, indeed, badly, we are in 2015 and there is still no trace of it. The maps present are however very beautiful and optimally designed, with a good balance despite the variety of environments and the realism of the scenarios, which well camouflage their being arenas of a video game. In hindsight they also give a good idea of what the open world could be, since they suggest that they are pieces of a larger and homogeneous area, rather than single levels developed individually. Unfortunately knowing if the open world will ever arrive is Survarium's biggest question mark, because development times have actually lengthened more than necessary, with many interventions made necessary by the launch in multiple regions that have slowed down the implementation of the promised features . For now, it's fair to consider it for what it is: a traditional team-based multiplayer shooter focused on PvP. Nothing that goes beyond what has been seen in many other similar titles, but with the big advantage of the uniqueness of the scenario. It's not cheap if you're tired of traditional settings, but it's not enough if you're looking for itand more. Free-to-play model and conclusions Obviously, being Survarium a free-to-play title, it is fair to ask how much the economic model affects the gameplay. Let's put it this way: taking it as a title to play from time to time, it's perfectly fine to keep the basic functions, being satisfied with the standard equipment that can be purchased with the game currency. Instead, if you become a dedicated player and start demanding more, it is inevitable to spend money on it to get the best equipment. Mind you that not all weapons and armor can be purchased with in-game currency, so the differences between paying and free players are there and felt, as indeed it is sadly natural that it is (the free-to-play model is by far the most classist in the history of video games). On the other hand, at least the first levels of the character can be accumulated without too much trouble, so you have many hours of gameplay available before having to decide whether or not to spend your money. However, spending is not recommended for all those who are waiting for the open world mode, which should arrive by 2015, but which, as we have pointed out, has already been postponed several times. In this case, it would be spent blindly, also because, even if it arrived on schedule, it would still have to be evaluated and, given the enormous stability problems the PvP modes had, we assume that it will have an adjustment period before working properly. In short, summing up the first sums, if you are interested in playing PvP Survarium is already a valid title right now, if instead you are waiting for more ... keep waiting.", "date": "2015-04-21", "grade": null}
