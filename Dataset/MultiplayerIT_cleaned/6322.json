The complete series consists of five English-language episodes. The text is reasonably lacking in anticipation. Life is Strange continues to make us suffer. From the outside, this series seems to work very well. For starters, it's a pleasure to watch. The artistic direction that favors warm and saturated colors is seductive, the faces of the characters are carefully studied; the environments, above all, are refined in detail like never before in a video game. Just take a look at Chloe's room to understand how much time has been spent choosing the objects, from the built-in wardrobe to the stickers on the old cell phone. From memory, only Gone Home has given equal importance to the traces of life left by the characters in the environments. Another point in favor of the series is the sense of spatial amplitude it conveys. We feel as if there is a small town to discover within walking distance of us. Despite the invisible barriers, we have the illusion that we can continue along the sidewalk into the center of Arcadia Bay. This is due to the fact that the game connects the non-interactive sequences to the open scenarios in which we are moving. Thus a sense of spatial continuity is created in the player's mind, who sees Max leaving school aboard a vehicle and through the girl's eyes discovers otherwise inaccessible scenarios. The idea then of a protagonist who awakens with the mysterious power to rewind time, although not very fresh, raises disturbing questions about the order of the world. It may be that the flutter of a butterfly's wings is not enough to unleash a natural disaster on the other side of the globe, but we all sense that our daily decisions can reverberate in the lives of other people even years later. On the other hand, this is precisely the theme of Chaos Theory, although it is necessary to get to the very last minutes of the game for it to be clear. Max can make extraordinary changes in the lives of the people he loves, but are we sure that one life saved won't lose another? The answer will probably come in the fourth episode. For now let's focus on everything that happens before the final twist, or on the reasons why, despite everything, this series still fails to take off. Life is Strange fixes some flaws but still tells its story with the handbrake on Little treasure hunt Life is Strange feels the need to remind us at all times that Max is just a little girl in a normal world. But this shows enough with the objects that can be examined in the environments. He could therefore leave it to them to tell the daily life of the protagonists and focus on the story. Take for example the mysterious link between Rachel's disappearance and Blackwell Academy where Max studies. There's enough to keep us on our toes and instead, after the first half of the series, what have we discovered? Nothing. Chaos Theory only reveals that Rachel was having an affair with a drug dealer. It took almost two hours of play to get to this discovery and the fact that Chloe's father supervises several students of the school, information which, among other things, had already been anticipated in the previous episode. When at the beginning of Chaos Theory, Max violates curfew to begin his personal investigation with a flashlight in hand, we thought that the mystery would finally begin to unravel, perhaps with new disturbing details. Instead it's just the beginning of a little treasure hunt that looks more like a little girl's game than a dangerous investigation. And above all it stops after every timid progress. As soon as the story takes a step forward, the game puts on the handbrake. We thus find ourselves engaged in long conversations with Chloe, always reiterating the same point. We already know what our friend's problems are and the complex relationship that binds her to us and Rachel. And we have already tasted Joyce's excellent pancakes too. The scene of the two girls in the swimming pool is very beautiful and natural to see, but it breaks the tension that had been created just before to make way for yet another heartfelt confidence. While on the one hand the dialogues now seem more spontaneous, the fact remains that intimacy without contrasts between the two friends is unlikely. It may be that the developers fell in love with certain scenes and instead of wondering if they could serve the story or not, they inserted them thinking that talking about emotions was the equivalent of making the player feel them. These are the moments in which Telltale's pen is regretted the most. Moreover, precisely because of these long digressionsni, the final twist looks like a patch placed at the last moment to rouse the slumbering audience. If nothing else Chaos Theory makes more intelligent and articulate use of Max's power. There are still the inevitable lists of items to collect (the bellhop syndrome that afflicts many video games) but the way we have to get Frank's keys for example he is very smart. In short, a step forward compared to the ephemeral puzzles of Telltale's adventures of the same genre. If only DontnoD Entertainment made the effort to focus on the narrative to keep it moving at an acceptable pace, Life is Strange would be a great narrative adventure. We still wait to see how the last two episodes will evolve. There's still a tornado coming over Arcadia Bay and then maybe the time for talking will end.", "date": "2015-05-21", "grade": "7.0"}
