{"name": "Forgotten Realms: Demon Stone", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/forgotten-realms-demon-stone_a.html", "text": "The triangle of heroes Zhai Agile as shrewd drow thief, with her we will be able to use the darkness in our favor to become almost invisible to the eyes of the enemies and attack them from behind. Furthermore, during the game we will acquire the ability to jump, which in addition to being used in combat will often be useful for reaching high locations. Rannek Awesome human warrior with which to slice enemies of all types. His particular ability is given by his brute strength, capable of destroying obstacles with a powerful punch on the ground. In frequent melee situations, its use will be almost vital. Illius Human wizard with innate mystical gifts. In addition to spells of various kinds, we will also be able to use tiny but powerful energy spheres not too dissimilar to bombs. Indispensable when the enemies are not within the reach of the blades, especially by virtue of the infinite possibility of throwing one's enchanted bolts. We can be heroes Written by the popular R.A.Salvatore and set in the 'forgotten realms' of Dungeons & Dragons, the plot of this Demon Stone will put us in the shoes of three adventurers with a not too heroic past who, no one knows how or why, find themselves fighting side by side shoulder in the midst of hordes of orcs. We will soon discover that the three, however unaware, are nothing but an integral part of a plan. In fact, they will be supporters of the awakening of two powerful and ancient demons who in the past were in cahoots with each other to have absolute power, later enclosed by a powerful magician inside a crystal. The three protagonists, to be exact a drow thief and two humans, one a warrior and the other a wizard, will thus have to chase and stem the thirst for power of the two demons, who logically will not fail to hurl entire battalions of fierce enemies against them . We will soon discover the complementarity of our heroes, and how much this will be the cornerstone of the entire game. The possibility of taking the place of any of the protagonists at any time says a lot about the goal of the US coders, who have gone far beyond expectations in order to give the game as much variety as possible. We will be able to attack the enemies from behind by hitting them with a single, lethal move from the thief; or throw ourselves into the fray with the warrior's blows; or, again, to strike enemies from a distance with the magician's spells. Each will have their own unique powers, and a wise use of these will be necessary to complete the ten challenging game levels. It will also be advisable to learn how to play as a team with combined shots, which for the occasion will also show off a sort of bullet time to enhance its spectacularity. Here an effective control system comes into play, which will allow, in a more than intuitive way, to carry out even the apparently most difficult things with maximum ease of execution. The level structure in this sense will mark the process of enhancing the characters, as at the conclusion of each mission the protagonists will be compensated with money and experience to spend on equipment and new moves. The player will therefore have to carefully select the equipment, divided into three categories (weapon, armor and objects), as well as the new combos and skills. We will soon discover the complementarity of our heroes, and how much this will be the cornerstone of the entire game. To the war As a good scrolling fighting game, this Demon Stone focuses almost all of the gameplay on the fights, which will cover a good 80% of the game. Basically Stormfront Studios developed the ideas presented in The Two Towers, however leaving the foundations on which the fortunes of the famous tie-in were built unchanged. The combos will play a fundamental role and will be almost universal for all the characters, just so as not to put the player in the position of having to learn different combinations for each hero used. Simply each of the three adventurers will react differently to the exact combination of keys, which will never exceed three pad presses in any case. During a fight, in relation to how we will be able to distinguish ourselves in battle, we will have the possibility of carrying out devastating moves, obviously only and exclusively when a special bar is filled. Difficult, but not impossible, it will be to bring all the characters to this stage, in order to perform an impressive symbiosis of powers, which generally will be able to clean up the screen at least for a while. Succeeding in this arduous move will also pay off in terms of experience at the end of each level. While we will try to give a hard time to the enemies with one of the characters, the remaining two will not stand by and show a good AI capable of creating reactions according to theto situation. The enemy one works a little less well, while still remaining on certainly acceptable levels. The care taken by the US softco in terms of graphic design is commendable, just as certain stylistic choices are very effective. The work done on the graphics engine was enormous, which in addition to being able to manage dozens of enemies simultaneously, shows a frame rate that in rare cases denounces some indecision. Polygonal models made with a certain abundance and, above all, various and always credible animations. Facial expressions of the protagonists rather accurate. Too bad for the fluctuating level of the textures, which also affects the articulated game environments. The camera, on the other hand, despite being managed independently by the CPU, manages to always, or almost always, give shots that are appropriate for the purposes of the game but also spectacular. And if the soundtrack is substantially normal, the Italian dubbing is considerably over the top, which showcases actors capable of both acting and following the lips. Most scrolling beat'em ups generally have a tendency to get monotonous, that's a given. On the other hand, it is surprising how much an exponent of the genre manages to keep the interest high for the entire duration of the game. Forgotten Realms: Demon Stone is one of them, for sure. Thanks to the diversions adopted by the developers, the game in question grows exponentially as the levels progress. Too bad for the overall duration of the experience, which amounts to about 6/7 hours of total play, and the remote possibility of replaying it. In these terms, some noteworthy unlockable elements or, even better, the possibility of tackling the adventure in multiplayer would have greatly helped. On balance, however, it remains a title whose purchase is definitely to be taken into consideration. Pros: Graphically well done. Great control system. Amazing variety of situations. Oscar dub. Cons: Low longevity. We would not have disdained a multiplayer mode. Forgotten Realms on Xbox There's not much to add to the review written for the PS2 version, essentially the Xbox game looks identical. We can do nothing but praise the work of the developers as regards the graphics sector, even if surely by making better use of the Microsoft hardware they would have reached a higher quality level, but, as we know, it is the price to pay for the titles developed on multiple platforms. We have encountered some sporadic slowdown of the engine which in any case does not ruin the gaming experience while a considerable improvement, in the transition to American hardware, has been found in the loading, now absolutely fast. It's also a real shame that the coders haven't implemented a multiplayer mode perhaps using Xbox Live, it would have benefited, and not a little, the longevity of the Atari title. Finally, the excellent dubbing by Pietro Ubaldi and Marco Pagani, well-known personalities who have been giving their voices to television programs for years, should be noted. Peter Quattrone The good memories of times gone by and the things that never fade. Let's take music for example, Gloria Gaynor's I will survive has been danced for over twenty years and will be danced for the next fifty, at least. There's nothing to do, the music starts and, after two seconds, the tapping of the foot on the ground joins in perfect synchrony, then the pelvis, the arms and so on, until he throws himself onto the track singing at the top of his lungs and wriggling like chimpanzee in Tony Manero version. The problem arises in realizing that the loudspeakers from which the music comes are from a supermarket and not from a discotheque, but that's it... The same goes for the scrolling beat'em ups, years full of blindfolds, but you don't never resists, you never say no to a game of blows. Especially if the game in question is developed by people who have already shown that they know how to do it specifically. Let's talk about Stormfront Studios, what they conceived in due time with The Lord of the Rings: the two Towers and, more importantly, what they are preparing to give us: Forgotten Realms: Demon Stone. After having heartened you several times on the actual goodness of this title, the time has finally come to fully judge it with an exhaustive review.", "date": "2005-02-16", "grade": null}
