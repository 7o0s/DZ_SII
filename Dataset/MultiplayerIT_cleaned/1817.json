{"name": "Il Pianeta del Tesoro", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/il-pianeta-del-tesoro-2.html", "text": "Easier than the average Treasure Planet is a 3D platformer with a decidedly ~old style~ structure: in the role of the protagonist Jim, the player has the task of crossing about twenty levels divided between five different settings taken from the film. The objective of each stage is to activate the five signals scattered within it, an operation possible by completing as many sub-missions. Two of these are fixed for each level, and consist respectively in collecting all the coins and energy spheres present, while the remaining three vary constantly, while remaining conceptually always similar to each other. There is obviously no shortage of enemies within the playing area, which can be eliminated using the kicks and punches that Jim can promptly execute. To meet an otherwise too bland gameplay, a factor intervenes that at least manages to give a little more character to a rather anonymous production so far. We are talking about Morph, a fluttering pink creature who accompanies Jim throughout his adventure, and who has the peculiarity of being able to transform himself into different objects using the pods suitably scattered along the levels. Morph can become a jetpack, or provide Jim with a pair of extremely powerful bionic arms, or even transform into a hand capable of operating various levers and mechanisms. Although conceptually interesting, the role of Morph within the game turns out to be too ~mechanical~, with the pods used for the various transformations positioned in the immediate vicinity of the area involved in their use: in short, everything turns out to be more of a obligatory and repetitive operation than a real strategic element. This fact, combined with a decidedly linear level design and in general with a decidedly low level of difficulty, makes Il Pianeta del Tesoro an extremely easy title to complete in all its parts for any user with a minimum of experience in the genre. The unbearable lightness of gameplay Evidently aware of the repetitiveness of the platform scheme of their title, the developers of Bizarre have well thought of dedicating a good part of the levels that make up the game to the use of the Solar Surfer, a sort of sailing hoverboard skilfully managed by our protagonist. The stages in question see the user intent on driving this unusual board within circuits equipped with various branches and teeming with obstacles, in which the sub-missions necessary to activate the signals appear conceptually similar to what was seen in the various Tony Hawks. It is necessary, for example, to perform grinds in certain points, or to destroy some objects, or to reach a certain number of points by performing tricks. The greater frenzy of the action makes these stages decidedly more interesting than the predominant platform sections of the game, although even the sections aboard the Solar Surfer suffer from a certain basic repetitiveness and the invariably low level of difficulty. On a technical level, however, Il Pianeta del Tesoro demonstrates substantially good qualities, albeit inferior to productions such as Jak & Daxter and Ratchet & Clank. Graphically, the Bizarre title sports a remarkable polygonal modeling of the game settings and a good use of light effects, while the animations of the main character and the angularity of the same raise some doubts. On the other hand, the sound sector is excellent, with high quality music and voices and sound effects that are decidedly up to par. Conclusions Il Pianeta del Tesoro is, as we wanted to demonstrate, a product reserved for young users, able to appreciate a simple and immediate gameplay that may instead appear to the eyes of the more experienced as trivial and all too easy. This obviously does not mean that the Bizarre title is a bad platform: technically good and enjoyable from a playful point of view, Il Pianeta del Tesoro is all in all a successful tie-in, deliberately aimed at a low-end user group. And then, the ~grown-ups~ can always amuse themselves with Ratchet & Clank ... Pros: Simple and immediate Excellent sound sector Cons: Too simple Design that can be improved It is a well-established tradition in the Disney house to accompany the release of their films in cinemas with videogame tie-ins probably reserved for the same young audience to whom the films of the Mickey Mouse house are mainly directed. The interest that the aforementioned titles can therefore arouse in the user is realistically inversely proportional to his age, as well as his experience in the field of video games. A trend, this one, that seemed to be able to be interrupted by the tie-inof the latest Disney film, ~Treasure Planet~, whose development was entrusted to the Anglo-Saxon team Bizarre Creation: the hope was in fact that the well-known software house could create a platform able to satisfy even the most savvy users. Unfortunately for the older ones, however, the result turned out to be once again a product forbidden to those over 14 years of age", "date": "2003-01-10", "grade": null}
