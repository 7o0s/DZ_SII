{"name": "Power Stone Collection", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/power-stone-collection.html", "text": "Everything is allowed 6 years after the publication of the second and last chapter for the Dreamcast, a collection has landed on PSP that incorporates the two games made by Capcom, accompanied by a series of extras, new weapons, new modes and above all absolute fidelity to the original versions . Speaking in general terms, the concept behind Power Stone is not so different from the Smash Bros series (born and raised on Nintendo consoles) or from the little-known Ergheiz, a rather bizarre and neglected fighting game published by the then Square. The Powerstone fights take place in large arenas organized on several floors, where players will be given the opportunity to break boxes or caskets containing objects that can be used in combat ranging from classic swords to the use of large hammers and guns bubble. Each weapon will have a different effect on your enemy and will obviously have a particular longevity closely linked to its use. The crates, in addition to attack weapons, may contain defense items such as shields or simply food to be used in case one's vital energy is tragically running out. Chests and caskets, being part of the environment itself, can also be kept intact and used as a throwing weapon or simply pushed towards your opponent in an attempt to hit him. The peculiarity of powerstone, however, does not stop at the frenzy of the search for the right object: each character - in addition to the classic moves based on punches, kicks and grips - by collecting three particular stones (the powerstones, in fact) will be able to transform for a few seconds into a his decidedly enhanced version capable of releasing decidedly painful attacks, Falcon -the pilot of the twin-engine dressed in red- will transform into a robot capable of striking with self-guided missiles, Wang Tang -Chinese with a passion for martial arts- will become a blond fighter capable of releasing powerful energy attacks. The characters in the cast of Powerstone are characterized by a strong comic imprint (from the videogame a very little successful cartoon was also based, broadcast for a while also by Italia1) which is halfway between the manga and the American comic , however, all remain quite stylized in their positions: there is the aforementioned red twin-engine pilot, the samurai with the sword, the red Indian who fights using physical strength, the beautiful Arab princess renowned for being fast and lethal and the expert oriental of martial arts. T is better than uan The first -substantial- difference between the first chapter of power stone and the second is the number of fighters in the game: in an atypical fighting game that looks more like a royal rumble the numbers make the difference and from this point of view it is Power stone 2 to score the lead point. If in the first the possible combat combinations were represented by a classic 1 against 1 (in some missions even 1 against 2, with the CPU always in the majority position), it is in the second appearance of the saga that the game gives its best, allowing challenges of up to 4 players and therefore with a more complex and complete 2 against 2. The pace of play, due to the way the gameplay is structured, is frenetic and fun especially when playing against human opponents and the first real broken tile of this collection for PSP comes right here: the game can only be played in ad hoc mode, i.e. with as many copies of the game (and of course consoles) as there are players, and as good as Power stone Collection is as a game it will never be easy bring together four happy UMD owners. The collection lacks multiplayer via sharing, allowing players to download and download only a demo of the single player to try locally on their console; obviously also missing is a multiplayer mode via the internet, an element that would have greatly increased the value of the game. perhaps the biggest flaw of the game is the one linked to the long loading times, tending to infinity and in stark contrast to what is the frenetic soul of the game. T is better than uan Graphically, the result achieved by the developers can only be defined as excellent: the models of the characters and the settings perfectly reproduce those already used and seen on the Dreamcast, with the added value of the panoramic view in 16:9 (for the purists of the series, it remains however the possibility of putting the game back in 4:3 while enjoying only a part of the screen). Last but not least, perhaps the biggest flaw of the game is the one linked to the long loading times, tending to infinity and in clear cin contrast with what is the frenetic soul of the game. Power Stone Collection, although representing the *perfect conversion*, loses points in the modes that most characterize the series: multiplayer with friends is difficult to implement, sharing is non-existent and long loading times bring a game to its knees that is anything but slow. However, it remains an excellent opportunity for all those who have not had the opportunity to try the two games on Dreamcast and an equally good one for those who want to spend a few hours having fun with what can be considered to all intents and purposes as the perfect portmanteau of a fighting game and an action game. Pros: Excellent technical realization Fighting out of the box Two games in one Cons: Loading too long Multiplayer inadequate for the type of gameplay offered To be cynical, it still remains stuff already seen and -probably- played In the past, most of the hits in the gaming world had a preferential way of birth and development: an arcade board. The bar (or arcade) video game was the perfect stage for many series while waiting for them to be transposed onto home consoles; illustrious participants in this mechanism (without bothering too old ghosts and remaining in 32bit terms and beyond) remember Tekken, Soul Edge, Crazy Taxi, Virtua Tennis and so on, one could really continue for tens of minutes intent on remembering. The arcade passage of all these titles has essentially allowed two things: to test the approval rating of a product by the publishers and above all - in the case of high approval - to dramatically increase the hype of gamers while waiting for the title in question in the home version. One of the last consoles to often take advantage of the arcade-console transition was the dreamcast, the last (glorious) SEGA console which, thanks to the NAOMI bar card, allowed the fast, easy and almost perfect transposition of a whole series of titles they still proudly stand out in the collection of many players today. One of these, the true protagonist of the multiplayer, was Power Stone, a strange fighting game published by capcom where for the first time (for the house of Osaka, of course) the execution of the different moves was no longer important, but rather the reactivity and wickedness agonistic of the players in looking for the right weapon to win.", "date": "2006-12-05", "grade": null}
