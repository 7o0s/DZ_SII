{"name": "Shadow Corridor", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/shadow-corridor-recensione.html", "text": "After a few years of diffusion in the indie field, where it has become a sort of cult above all for its direct derivation from the Japanese horror tradition, Kageroh - this is the original name of the work - arrives on consoles and we analyze it in this review of Shadow Corridor on Nintendo Switch. It is an adventure with survival horror elements that descends directly from the new tradition of the first person genre, with the typical characteristics of the defenseless (or almost) defenseless protagonist and hunted by powerful and evil creatures, from which we can only flee. Amnesia should be taken as a paradigm of this particular interpretation of the genre, which paved the way for experiences of pure terror, elevating video games to real first-person horror, further enhanced by the even greater involvement that this medium is able to guarantee. From this point of view, video game horror has undergone a real revolution in recent years, going from being a mere alternative setting for action in a B-movie style sense, to something more subtle and psychological , based on the sense of helplessness in the face of metaphysical threats and the need to flee to save oneself, rather than using up bullets on enemies to release tension. With Silent Hill acting as an intermediate point between the two different conceptions, the horror of Shadow Corridor undoubtedly derives from this modern interpretation and also presents itself as one of the most characterized in terms of atmosphere, thanks above all to the Japanese setting that he can freely recover the Japanese stylistic features at will. Shinden-zukuri domestic architecture, lanterns, votive statuettes and n theater masks therefore have the green light in the particular scenarios of this game, with all their terrifying power experienced in the first person. A Midsummer Nightmare Story Shadow Corridor, as shown in this image, starts from relatively ordinary and quiet environments The story of Shadow Corridor does not develop according to a standard dynamic, but partially exploits the environmental narration that we have also seen in other titles of this type, although it is even weaker and more fragmented in this case. Scattered documents and textual introductions to the levels are limited to some suggestions and general indications, in a story that is barely mentioned and yet works quite well in creating the particular rarefied and dreamlike atmosphere that characterizes the whole experience of the game. It all starts with a simple walk on a late summer afternoon, when the protagonist finds himself inexplicably attracted to a simple alley hidden among the houses of a Japanese town. Perhaps it is the smell, the atmosphere or the particular light that attracts us to the quiet houses, or the memory of summers spent in similar and seemingly carefree places. Soon, this little excursion turns into a real nightmare: from the normal passageways between the secondary entrances of the village houses, moreover portrayed in a rather convincing way, we move on to ever more obscure and bizarre settings, until realizes that we have slipped into something different from the normal and reassuring everyday reality. The Japanese settings of Shadow Corridor characterize it in a peculiar way Paths and corridors change at every turn and dead end, throwing us into a dimension where survival is no longer a given and our existence is constantly threatened by presences waiting in the darkness, ready to hunt us down and eliminate us at first contact. Newspaper excerpts, diaries and documents vaguely introduce a story of mysterious cults, mass disappearances and family dramas linked to brutal crimes, but much of the plot is left out of the text and paratext, interpretable by the player who still finds himself committed above all to surviving and the impossibility of making sense of the overwhelming horror takes a back seat. Between walking simulator and survival horror Theater masks and other items hark back to Japanese folklore and traditions The title summarizes well what we are dealing with: corridors and shadows are the cornerstones of the gaming experience, which in terms of gameplay can be classified as a first-person adventure with survival horror elements, developing mostly as a sort of walking simulator where, however, we are constantly hunted by unbeatable threats, against which we can only hide and flee, possibly finding hiding places and developing stealth strategies. In short, essentially something very similar to the aforementioned Amnesia and the other titles that are derived from this stile, but with the characterizing element, in this case, of having to do with Japanese mythology and folklore that determine the particular style of the setting and some game solutions such as the use of ritual objects that can help us along the way. While maintaining the characteristics of the different settings, the levels are composed in a procedural way, which makes each game unique, given that a large part of the game is about finding your way in the maze of corridors and rooms in which we find ourselves from level to level. The aim is simply to find the exit or to collect a certain amount of objects that allow access to the subsequent passages, but this imposes the fact of having to face a series of nightmare creatures, against which we are practically unarmed, as we cannot cause damage to ghosts and various presences. One of the eerie presences of Shadow Corridor However, we can exploit various strategies: the secret of Shadow Corridor is to understand well the patterns of the enemies and use it against them, since each one responds to precise logics that can be exploited to evade them. In general, they are attracted by light or sounds, so we have to move accordingly and possibly use lures or cause noise to distract them or attract them to other areas. It is a challenge of considerable intensity, also because the tension is constant, given the threat of game over at every match and the oppressive atmosphere. Shadow Corridor is definitely not a game suitable for those who can't handle tension well, because after the first reflective and apparently calm moments it always remains anchored to a continuous sense of unease, which leads to jump scare terror or subtle fear of always being hunted or chased. That's basically all it plays on, because the gameplay otherwise doesn't offer particularly original solutions or great variations on the theme, focusing mainly on exploring the labyrinthine maps, collecting key items and surviving. Aesthetics: charm and angst Labyrinthine corridors and rooms often seem to repeat themselves in the procedural combination of levels The theme of the corridor predominates throughout the game, making the environments necessarily narrow and claustrophobic: on the one hand this leads to the particular characterization of the entire game experience, on the other it represented an optimal solution for the construction of easily manageable and great impact even with minimal effort. We must think that Kageroh was developed practically alone by Kazuki Shiroma, founder of Space Onigiri Games. Started as an amateur project, the game then gradually expanded and enriched with an increasingly refined use of the Unreal Engine until it achieved remarkable results, at least on PC. However, the limits of a very small production continue to be seen in several aspects, from the evident repetition of assets to the lack of a complex construct between narration and gameplay, able to explain the progression and apply substantial variations to the game. In any case, the atmosphere is precisely the winning element of Shadow Corridor, obtained with a wise use of the few means available and by leveraging the universal charm of Japanese horror, linked to the folklore and traditions of the Rising Sun that distinguish it from the many other similar titles in structure, making it somewhat unique. The excellent mix with the audio is also remarkable, with the soundtrack appearing in the most excited moments to underline the sense of anguish and the disturbing noises associated with each individual creature. The Nintendo Switch version appears further limited from a technical point of view, with the application of a rather low resolution to a base that is already not particularly rich in terms of polygonal construction, giving the whole an all too simple appearance, even if in the narrowest interiors these problems are greatly reduced.", "date": "2021-10-22", "grade": "7.0"}
