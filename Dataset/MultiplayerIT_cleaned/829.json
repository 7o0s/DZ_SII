{"name": "Sonic Gems Collection", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sonic-gems-collection.html", "text": "16 bits plus 16 bits equals Despite Sega's misleading advertising, trade magazines in the 1990s clarified the concept that the Mega CD allowed the MegaDrive to have more memory for its games and little else. Well, Sonic CD made that its strong point: it was the ~biggest~ title in the series that had ever come out, in many ways a remake but with important additions, which made it attractive to anyone who owned the expensive peripheral. Apart from the graphic improvements, which are not very evident today but of great importance in those years, Sonic CD introduced the exploratory element in a series previously focused on fast action, which often and willingly set aside the search for objects in favor of a quick conclusion of the internship. Hopelessly slow and cumbersome by current standards, Sonic CD remains enjoyable by fans and nostalgics, offering at least a substance that many today's products dream of. Unfortunately, the episodes for Game Gear present in this Sonic Gems Collection are made of a completely different stuff: decidedly ugly to see due to the low resolution, they were born on a portable console and therefore have a decidedly different spirit compared to Sonic CD . You will probably deign the various Triple Trouble, Sonic Drift, Tails Adventures etc. just a glance, and then move on to something else. [C] Dear old Dr. Robotnik comes back to break the balls every now and then... Who remembers ~Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom~? Tails, the fantastic two-tailed fox. [/C] The spin-offs, these strangers Recently there has been talk of the abuse of Mario & friends with regards to the creation of titles that have nothing to do with platforms, and it is not surprising to note that Sega has also attempted a similar path for Sonic. In fact, in this collection we find a couple of titles that cannot be identified otherwise: Sonic R and Sonic The Fighters. The first is to all intents and purposes a racing game (R stands for racing, evidently), in which you choose one of the available characters and run (in the literal sense) along tracks of various kinds, circuits, to a predetermined number of rounds. Along the track it is necessary to take advantage of the ~wipEout~ ramps to get the better of opponents who make little mistakes but who tend to give up in the face of clean trajectories. Sonic The Fighters, for its part, is a fighting game that mimics Virtua Fighter, but which is downright disconcerting in substance: devoid of any original cue, spoiled by an inaccurate collision detection system, finally decidedly monotonous. The two video games were originally released for Saturn, and therefore represent the best in terms of graphics of this Gems Collection. If Sonic R leaves you pleasantly amazed from an aesthetic point of view, thanks to an engine that moves everything without uncertainties, The Fighters manages to disappoint even in this respect, due to decidedly ugly polygonal models to look at and poor animations. Sonic Gems Collection also sees the presence of two extra titles that have little to do with Sonic: these are the two episodes of Vectorman, a platform for MegaDrive that counted on the fluidity of the animations (also because it is easy to animate a character represented by a series of circles) and on a solid and convincing game mechanic. Well, as a bonus it could have been much worse [C] Sonic CD's polygonal sections were a miracle for the MegaDrive. Sonic R proves to be a spin-off with good qualities. Sonic The Fighters, however, is; horrible. [/C] As usual, products belonging to the retrogaming genre must be ~experienced~ in a different way than current video games, above all because an objective comparison would be merciless. Those that were absolute masterpieces ten or twenty years ago, in fact, today can be appreciated for their originality and for some elements of the gameplay, which have in any case been replaced by wider-ranging models. So the Sonic fan will be able to enjoy a complete collection (between Mega Collection and Gems Collection, of course) of video games starring the blue hedgehog and his friends, while the ~modern~ or ~casual~ user of video games will not even deign this product a look. As it should be, after all. The final vote is understood as a meeting point between the opposing interpretations on the matter. Pros A good number of titles Perfect reproductions Very appealing to the nostalgic Cons Game Gear titles are mediocre This is a niche product Sonic is part of the collective imagination as Mario's number one rival, although he bases his popularity on different aspects than the basic plumberfutu. If the Nintendo mascot had the merit of making everyone understand what playability is in a video game, Sonic clarified the difference between 8 and 16 bits, sweeping away any doubts at the speed of his sprints along brilliant and colorful paths. After having collected the most important titles of the blue hedgehog, Sega has decided to bring the famous Sonic CD, a couple of spin-offs released on Saturn and a large number of titles for Game Gear to the GameCube and PS2; all within the Sonic Gems Collection. [C] The first Sonic is never forgotten... The ~run~ sections in Sonic CD are no longer available. the core of the game. The Game Gear graphics weren't even revolutionary at the time...
