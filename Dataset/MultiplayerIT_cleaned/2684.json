{"name": "Populus Run", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/populus-run-recensione.html", "text": "There was a period in which the endless run genre was the most popular on the App Store, and looking at the approval ratings, it is still a strong and popular trend among users today. The formula is simple: you run trying to get as far as possible, while the scenario changes randomly introducing obstacles of various kinds. Well, the three Russian guys from the FIFTYTWO team have thought of giving a little jolt to this type of product, bringing a different, colorful and in many ways original interpretation to Apple Arcade. Will they be able to trigger real change? Let's try to figure it out in the Populus Run review. Gameplay Run, dodge and jump: the mechanics underlying the gameplay of Populus Run don't differ that much from most of the running games available on iOS, but the context changes. Firstly, it is not an endless run with random elements, but levels with a precise characterization, with a beginning and an end (as well as various checkpoints and even boss fights), placed within a long campaign. place, it is not a single character who runs, but a colorful group of people. It almost seems like watching ordinary guys who one day decide to train, put on improbable clothes and leave with great enthusiasm. Only in this case they don't fall to the ground after a few hundred meters, but keep running until they hit an obstacle. Like new protagonists of any episode of Katamari, along the way we will meet other people who we will be able to involve in the race, giving life to a rather large gathering of improvised athletes who whiz along a road suspended in the void, a dream place dotted with visions different depending on the case, often donuts or giant hamburgers. Slamming into these objects will not satisfy our appetites, but will imply the elimination of one or more members of the group, as well as the collision with roadsides or other obstacles. We will therefore have to avoid them to preserve the team and reach the finish line with a minimum number of characters, calculating the times as best as possible and dealing with an inertial-based control system that is not exactly very simple to govern. A different artistic vision The focus on movement and jumping, with the calculation of times and memorization of routes, as well as a traditional structure, with levels to be completed trying to complete the greatest number of objectives, place a clear distance between Populus Run and the more classic exponents of the endless run genre. However, the biggest difference is the artistic vision of the game, which undoubtedly takes its cue from the Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout phenomenon to offer us colorful and cartoony graphics, accompanied in each sequence by an absolutely spectacular, entirely sung, really nice and catchy. At the end of the day there are some catches: some rather complicated phases give life to long sequences in trial & error style, in which a section after the checkpoint is repeated several times in the hope of hitting the right path. Sometimes the fault of the touch controls at the old-fashioned way, with only two non-repositionable arrows to manage the direction. By connecting a Bluetooth controller, of course, the situation changes a lot, perhaps even too much.", "date": "2021-02-03", "grade": "7.8"}
