On the one hand we have the incredible success of the App Store, which has leveled down the perception of the value of a new videogame, on the other hand the wave of Free To Play titles, coming from the Asian market but not only. Microsoft had already tried it with Age of Empires and in recent weeks it has returned to the fray with another of its most important brands, namely Flight Simulator, renamed for the occasion Microsft Flight. It is no coincidence that the word Simulator has been lost, given that the new iteration of this long-lived series is not only offered free to its audience (with additional content to be purchased separately) but also chooses the path of immediacy to try to bring a new audience to the fascinating world of flying games. Anyone can fly Microsoft Flight can be downloaded freely from the official website, already complete with various playable contents without spending a euro. A complete tutorial introduces us to the dynamics of the title, which clearly distances itself from the previous exponents of the series. Starting from the Hawaii map, with only the largest island available in the initial package, it is possible to access the various tasks to be completed, divided between missions, challenges and ~air secrets~. There is also the free mode to wander around without too many thoughts on board your aircraft and thus explore the territory. The structure has therefore been heavily resized compared to the last Flight Simulator, compressing exhausting game phases dedicated exclusively to the fans of the most hardcore simulations who are not intimidated in the least in front of journeys lasting a few hours aboard huge 747s, in favor of an experience synthetic, limited to short missions to be completed by remaining in the air for only a few minutes. Longtime fans will already be turning up their noses, but Microsoft Flight is not meant for them and by removing the word Simulator from the title, Microsoft immediately clarifies its intention to make its title as user friendly as possible. A sort of context is also proposed, which puts the player in the role of a freelancer pilot who will be assigned various tasks, divided into the aforementioned sections and traceable on the bulletin boards of the airports. Unfortunately, a certain repetitiveness is felt all too soon, given that the types are really reduced to the bone, re-proposed in different formulas with increasing difficulty. Furthermore, without purchasing additional packages, the ~things to do~ will run out rather quickly and will lead you to perform landings in increasingly complex situations, to follow a path passing through hoops suspended in the air and recover treasures and very little else. That's all? Not even the fleet of aircraft, still limited to just two specimens, at least among the free ones, such as the Icon A5 and the Boeing PT-17, does not help to keep interest high. The small size of the planes and the simplified controls, adapted to the mouse and keyboard configuration, make the approach to the title immediate, allowing anyone to hold the controls and successfully perform the various maneuvers, including take-off and landing. The title provides some aids, mainly useful for making the aircraft more stable. With these deactivated, performing a delicate and precise landing will not be so simple, while in flight sudden maneuvers will easily lead to a stall. Surely the compromise between simulation and immediacy is the best quality of Microsoft Flight which, although it cannot aim to satisfy the most demanding virtual pilots, still manages to give credible sensations and present a good challenge rate. Completing the various tasks allows you to earn experience points, which are useful for leveling up and consequently unlocking new missions, but since these are present in small numbers, the feeling of growth is too diluted. The skins for the two aircraft do not help, which will only be possible to use when the highest levels are reached, which are very little incentives. Ultimately, having spent a few hours in the company of Microsoft Flight, one is left with the feeling of having an interesting and well-made product in one's hands, but which very soon begins to wink at our wallet, almost immediately proposing some exclusively dedicated missions to some aircraft to be purchased separately. Like the Maule M-7-260C Orion, the only one capable of carrying cargo and therefore suitable for this type you work and sold for 1200 MS Point. If, on the other hand, you want to broaden your horizons, it is already availablesince the release date the first full-bodied DLC that unlocks the entire archipelago of Hawaii, with new tasks and challenges to complete, sold for 1600 points. The prices, especially for the new aircraft, are certainly not competitive and after the first weeks have passed since the day of the release, they are not helping the diffusion of the title. If Microsoft does not rush to flesh out the offer with new elements both free and paid, this experiment is likely to fail prematurely. The ~air secrets~, hidden objects on the map to be found by searching for clues using the Bing search engine, help in part to prolong the interest in the game. Once located in a summary way, it will be possible to take off and, aided by an ineffective sensor, try to track them down and collect them by passing through them. Look at that beautiful landscape! The other aspect together with that exquisitely linked to the gameplay and the control system that has convinced us the most, is undoubtedly the technical one. Bearing in mind that we are talking about a free-to-play product, the aesthetic sector of Microsoft Flight is very good, graced first of all by an excellent realization of the models. These are in fact rich in detail, both seen from the outside and from the fully interactive cockpit. The scenarios are convincing, especially if you stay at a high altitude. Approaching the ground, however, you will notice a terrain covered by poorly defined textures, which stand out even more when combined with the various three-dimensional elements such as buildings, trees and so on. The effects are excellent, capable of credibly rendering the different atmospheric conditions. Microsoft Flight also offers some features that should encourage the formation of a community, for example allowing multiple users to connect simultaneously to the same session. But apart from this feature, the game map will remain deserted for most of the time, devoid of animated elements both in flight and on the ground.", "date": "2012-03-30", "grade": "7.0"}
