{"name": "Virtua Fighter 4", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/virtua-fighter-4_a.html", "text": "The evolution of the fighting game In the Spring of 1996, Sega introduced Model 3, the first arcade board with the power of 1,000,000 polygons per second, with a resolution and level of detail never seen before; whoever writes these lines will never forget the jaw-breaking impact of the movie (recently included in Virtua Fighter 3 Tb for Dreamcast) used by Am2 to present Virtua Fighter 3, the first game born on the third Model board by Lockeed Martin, capable of representing characters and backdrops almost indistinguishable from a high quality full motion video footage: the clothes that let themselves be transposed by the wind and by the movement of the fighters, the sand of the desert and the sea that moved as you passed, Dural (historical final boss of each episode) rendered in such a way as to recall the T1000 of James Cameron's film Terminator 2: Judgment Day, they were all absolutely unthinkable features even up to a few months later. Virtua Fighter 3, since its release in August '96, was an immediate blockbuster: the sweet Aoi and the sumo wrestler Taka are added to the roster of 11 wrestlers, a key is added for lateral movement, given that for the first once the game ring was not positioned entirely on the same level as in the prequels or in Tekken (the Namco beatem'up saga). Following the enormous success obtained, Am2 published a version dedicated to the team battle (beyond Snk's King Of Fighters, to be clear) of Virtua Fighter 3, with the suffix Team Battle, slightly modifying the color palette of the backdrops and, above all , the level of damage obtainable from certain characters' moves. The evolution of the fighting game As already happened in the past, after a few years and with the introduction of a new bar card (in this case the very powerful Naomi 2), Am2 brings the curtain down on what was previously known as Project X, presenting in Spring 2001 the fourth episode of the Virtua Fighter saga, characterized by a simply devastating cosmetic quality, by a couple of somewhat atypical extra characters (and the exclusion of Taka, a real character bin) and a game structure that winks at that of the second episode of the saga. With all the financial troubles that have occurred in recent years, however, Sega has changed its face and from a hardware house and supplier of games for its consoles, it is now a multiplatform software house, ready to regain all the fame it deserves and which has been denied for years . Virtua Fighter 4 is the first game designed directly for a conversion on Playstation 2, among other things exclusive, will Yu Suzuki have managed to perfectly convert the fourth episode of the saga that launched the fashion of three-dimensional fighting games? After all, as powerful as Playstation 2 is, Naomi 2 has decidedly more performing hardware and Yu Suzuki is at his first conversion job on Sony 128-bit black. Those who know the Virtua Fighter saga well know that the home conversions have all been quite good but not perfect: Virtua Fighter for Saturn (launched with the console) lost a lot of polygons while Toshinden for Playstation ridiculed any game ever seen in a home environment, with Am2 slightly guilty of rushed scheduling which then led to the creation of the Virtua Fighter remix, launched for free (in Japan only, in America it was bundled with the console). A year later it was the turn of the sequel but thanks to the new operating system, developed directly by Am2, Saturn users were able to enjoy a practically perfect conversion of the wonderful Virtua Fighter 2. Saturn set aside and Dreamcast launched, on the first day the conversion (by Genki and not, unfortunately, by Am2) of Virtua Fighter 3 Tb, very close to the original coin-op but not identical despite the 128 bit Sega was decidedly superior to a Model 3. It's time to analyse, after an introduction as long as necessary, Virtua Fighter 4, Playstation 2 exclusive, first Am2 game for 128 bit Sony. Virtua Fighter, fourth installment Virtua Fighter was born as a fighting game with 3d graphics, but with a 2d concept: the fighters were constantly facing each other, without being able to move on the other axis, bringing the new conception of the fighting game, seen as extremely realistic; no more skimpy little women flying upside down with legs used as helicopter blades, enough for the Yankee blonds who unleash columns of fire by hitting their fist on the ground, no more hadouken. Yu Suzuki gave birth to a game mechanic based on sn likelihood to reality, aiming at the faithful representation of really existing fighting styles such as Jeet Kune Do (Jacky and Sarah), Hakkioukoken (Akira), Wrestling (Wolf) and so on. Virtua Fighter 2, in addition to the aforementioned remarkable graphics due to the powerful Model 2, introduced the fighting style of the drunk (Shun Di) and the Praying Mantis (Lion Rafale), balancing the strength of the various fighters and diversifying characters such as Lau and Pai, Jacky and Sarah, a little mouse too similar to each other in the progenitor. Virtua Fighter, fourth installment With Virtua Fighter 3 we are witnessing a drastic change: in addition to the arenas delimited by a ring as in the previous episodes, the difference in height of some seabeds, the presence of snow, sand, stairs, etc., introduces a whole new series of variables to be duly taken into account in combat. Again, Nf3 (and the Team Battle update) adds a fourth function key (as well as block, punch and kick, all chainable to get hundreds of extra moves) for lateral movement, making Nf3 the first truly 3D fighting game in the coin industry. op. Virtua Fighter, fourth installment With the fourth episode of the series, Yu Suzuki fixes the shot, winks at the second episode of the saga, eliminates the ~evade~ button, makes all the articulations that invalidated the fight disappear, keeps the classic edges to the limit of the stages that cause the ring out (and consequent defeat of those who fall into it) and recover from Fighting Vipers walls and fences to knock down by repeatedly sending one's opponent up. The directional stick is now able to move your virtual alter ego far and wide through the game levels (minimally altering the way you jump), further increasing the three-dimensionality, introduced by the illustrious prequel. The 13 fighters available, unlike the various Tekken (permeated by absurd moves, unlikely characters such as Yoshimitsu, Ogre and Mokujin as well as various blows common to some characters), have very different fighting styles from each other, while the coupled Jacky / Sarah and Lau/Pai have benefited from new moves or modifications to the ones already known to differ them even more; to be clear, Pai is always very fast and with the possibility of counterattacking enemy blows, Lau is even more fearsome thanks to new devastating combos, despite being (again) fairly slower than his daughter. The newcomers Lei Fei and Vanessa have fighting styles unpublished in the saga that blend perfectly with those of the various Akira, Aoi, Lion, already extremely differentiated in themselves. The playability of Virtua Fighter has remained broadly the same: once you get used to the control system (and above all the not very user friendly parry via key), it is possible to carry out the hundreds of combos, holds and counters of each character , by chaining the attack keys or by pressing them simultaneously; as usual some characters (Akira, Lei) are extremely difficult to use, unlike others quite immediate (Sarah, Pai) but, in any case, Yu Suzuki's fighting game has an extremely steep learning curve: wanting to make a sensible comparison, try to imagine Virtua Fighter as Winning Eleven/Pro Evolution Soccer, extremely difficult at the beginning but little by little, after a lot of practice, a lot of defeats and a lot of humiliations, you can say that you have a real masterpiece in front of your eyes , which gives great satisfaction provided you spend several hours with it. Virtua Fighter, fourth installment For example, the undersigned to learn how to use at more than discrete levels Akira (always the most complex wrestler to use that exists in any beatem'up) has literally worn out his fingers to learn how to counterattack with absolute timing and use excellently, without being knocked to the ground, the most devastating holds and combinations of moves that at first lift the enemy in the air and then leave him vulnerable to a second and, even, third attack, since Akira Yuki is the only fighter not possessing punch-punch-kick combos (and the like) like almost all of his colleagues. With this we do not mean that a novice will not be at ease with this coin-op conversion: with a lower difficulty level than the default one, using characters that are relatively simple to use, it is possible to arrive after a couple of games at the in front of Dural, evergreen final boss of the saga, after familiarizing the bare minimum with the keys and weaknesses of each opponent. Graphics As said in the introduction of this review, Virtua Fighter 4 is perhaps the most graphically impressive coin-op ever thanks to the power of the new Naomi 2 arcade card. Yu Suzuki tried, did his best and , taking into account the few months available for the conversion and the addition of exclusive extras for the Sony console (and inexperience working on Playstation 2), I'd say we can't really complain about the final result. The number of polygons used for the characters is nothing short of enormous, the bodies are modeled beautifully, the faces have textures that scream photorealism (the muscles look real!), the eyes are beautifully made, the clothes fold, flutter in accordance with the movements, the blows are parried, dodged, avoided with a fluidity of the animations never seen before, punches and kicks are performed with a realism that almost leaves you dazed, the holds are underlined by very effective changes of shot, the leaves flutter while you fight in the level of the ninja Kagemaru, the luxuriant temple where you will fight against Lei Fei is flown over by a flock of birds while the tiles are subject to explosion in case some fighter ends up on them, the rings that delimit the playing area become immediately transparent in case the camera changes its angle and so on. Graphics Although the characters are not much inferior in terms of technical realization from the original coin-op, some compromises inevitably peep out in the backgrounds: the sand moved in Jeffry's level is less, some light effects have been attenuated or eliminated, the refractions in the level of Lau have been eliminated, the less snow that moves as you pass through Lion Rafale's level is also less, while the stage of the new entry Vanessa appears decidedly more ~punished~ than the one seen in the arcade, as well as that of the protagonist Akira, the dojo. The main defect of the graphics of Virtua Fighter 4 (home version), however, is linked to the abundant presence of aliasing which significantly deteriorates the look of the product in question. As if this were not enough, some flickerii sometimes peep out recalling the bad graphic impact had with Ridge Racer V, the first game for Playstation 2 and therefore not very optimized for the Emotion Engine developed by Ken Kutaragi. Graphically, therefore, the title would have been excellent despite the striking differences from the coin-op from which it is based, but due to the only six/seven months of time for the conversion and the subsequent addition of new game modes (despite the total inexperience on Sony's 128-bit hardware), Am2 has performed, in our opinion, a real miracle, packing a large number of polygons, covered with many textures, however obscured by a definition not up to the situation and the hardware used there. However, the fluidity is perfect, and anchored to the canonical 60 fps. Sound The Virtua Fighter saga has never included music worthy of being ascribed in the bible of the original soundtracks, nevertheless there are not a few bgms that resist injury over time (Aoi's level in Vf3, those of Akira and Wolf in Vf2, etc. ). Also in Virtua Fighter 4 we have fairly good compositions (Lau's stage), other exciting ones (Vanessa), new age (Akira, Lion), rock (Jacky) and so on; just as some of these are composed by people who really know their stuff, it is also true that some music is of negligible quality after all. Sound The sound effects are the exact same already heard in the prequels, only with a cleaning of the sound (obviously) greater than in the releases for Saturn and Dreamcast; as for the music, even here some sound effects are perfectly timed (Akira's grip that throws the opponent forward with his shoulder, for example), while others seem to come out of an action movie (Jacky's kicks obtained by pressing simultaneous pressing of the keys used for Kick and Guard). The voice actors are, again, the same as in the previous chapters, so perfectly fitting. We point out the wonderful voice of Pai, the cool voice of Akira (but also of Jacky) and the hilarious voice actor of the master Shun Di. Applause also for the voice actors of Vanessa and Lei Fei, the new characters. Extra In addition to the Arcade mode and the classic Versus Mode (inexplicably absent in the", "date": "2002-04-23", "grade": null}
