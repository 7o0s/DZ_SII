However, Bandai Namco did not give up, and after the imperfect I Love Katamari and Katamari Amore and the questionable Tap My Katamari, the prince of the cosmos is back in the limelight with Amazing Katamari Damacy, which tries to combine the classic mechanics of ~ rolling~ of the series with a formula close to that of the endless runners. The king of the messy cosmos Amazing Katamari Damacy starts off on the right foot, offering a simple and absurd narrative pretext in the best tradition: while busy painting rainbows in the sky, the king of the cosmos ends up overturning a bucket full of dark matter, generating a series of black holes that they soon suck up the entire universe. It will therefore be the prince's task again to roll his katamari sphere to accumulate as many objects as possible and thus reconstruct the various celestial bodies. For anyone who has played the very first chapters of the series, all this will have a pleasantly nostalgic flavor, a sensation that the technical sector of the title only increases: from a graphic point of view, in fact, Amazing Katamari Damacy faithfully reproduces the minimalist and naive style of the episodes main characters, while the musical accompaniment rests entirely on the unforgettable title track of the original PlayStation 2. However, things change in terms of gameplay, because if it is true that the focus is always to collect everything that comes within range (at provided that it has dimensions smaller than those of the sphere), the context in which this activity is carried out is radically different: therefore forget the open environments and the size objectives to be reached within a time limit that characterized the levels in the main chapters of the series, and welcome an endless runner setting based on a linear path to follow for as long as possible. Seen from behind, the prince moves forward automatically, while it is the player's job to move him to the side and make him jump, all while trying to increase the diameter of the katamari by engulfing the objects that meet along the way and avoid each other the obstacles: of these, only black holes cause the immediate game over, while colliding with elements larger than those of the sphere leads the king of the cosmos to become impatient, making it more difficult to continue the race. It must be said that the control system does not do its best to facilitate the player, proving to be significantly less reactive and precise than it would be necessary. Nonetheless, Amazing Katamari Damacy also works quite well, being pleasant even in a completely different way compared to the original gameplay: one undoubtedly misses the open scenarios that guaranteed greater variety and depth to the game action, but as a mobile pastime it is behaves in an absolutely dignified manner. However, it is difficult to ask the Namco Bandai product to be something more, since it ends up showing the side of all the typical limitations of the adopted genre. The basic repetitiveness and the substantial lack of a sense of progression that is not represented by the search for the best score are the two most critical aspects, but there are other slightly rough corners that could make some users turn up their noses: we refer in particular to the massive presence of advertisements, but also to in-app purchases which - although not too invasive - condition the pleasantness of the experience and are also characterized by really high prices compared to the average.", "date": "2017-12-13", "grade": "7.3"}
