The story of ~Indiana Jones and the Tomb of the Emperor~ (IJTI, henceforth) takes shape in 1935, around the discovery of an artifact that Indy recovers in one of his adventurous missions and which only later becomes he will discover to be an object of great interest also by the Black Dragon Triad. This organization is nothing more than a branch of the Chinese mafia which, having infiltrated the upper echelons of the Beijing government, will contact Indy to convince him to collaborate on an archaeological expedition of great importance . Our archaeologist will be asked to find the Heart of the Dragon, a black pearl which, according to an ancient legend, would allow its owner to dominate the minds of men; for Indy, the opportunity is to participate in a historical expedition, who in fact could even just demonstrate the existence of this jewel, would undoubtedly become the most famous archaeologist in history... ~fortune and glory~, just to mention Indy. However, the Heart of the Dragon is hidden in the tomb of a great Chinese Emperor and to find the entrance to this tomb it will be necessary to recover the three pieces of a seal which, only once united, will allow you to find the way to the precious jewel; but the quest will be joined by Indy's quintessential enemies, the Nazis. The latter, at Hitler's express wish, will aim for the pearl, convinced that once in their hands the conquest of the world will be easy. So once again Indy against his bitter enemies, but this time helped (read used) by the Chinese mafia who will support him, in some moments, the same attractive girl who with another shady individual of the triad, had previously met Indy in New York to persuade him to join the expedition. Mei Ying, this is the girl's name, will be controllable by the player in some moments and will be distinguished by her hand-to-hand combat skills which, given her obvious knowledge of martial arts, will also be superior to Indy's. ~The problem isn't the years... it's the kilometers!~ The game begins with a tutorial level that will lead us to find an artifact containing the first of the three pieces of the seal. In the early stages of the game we will be introduced to the movements that Indiana Jones will be able to make during the course of the adventure: running, jumping, hanging from ledges, interacting with the game environments. This happens by collecting bottles, chairs, sticks and iron bars that can be useful for facing enemies. There will certainly be no shortage of firearms, Indy will have his Colt with him and during the adventure he will also be able to use silenced pistols and machine guns of all kinds; but it is obvious that the weapon from which Jones jr never separates is his whip. Thanks to it you can hang from otherwise unreachable ledges, you can use it to disarm enemies and it will be very useful (and fun) to grab the bad guy by the neck and drag him to you, and then knock him out with a punch in the face . Speaking of hand-to-hand fights, we can say that those of IJTI are truly spectacular, sometimes the feeling is the same as watching the Indiana Jones movies, with Indy who, in an almost awkward way, tries to keep the thugs twice as strong as him, who, between spectacular fisticuffs and more or less fortunate situations, inevitably end up going down. Indiana Croft or Lara Jones? It must be said immediately that, from the point of view of the gameplay, this new episode of the Spielbergian archaeologist undoubtedly represents a step or two behind, compared to other exponents of the last generation genre; we are facing a game structure that closely resembles the old Tomb Raiders (excellent products at the time), lots of exploration, with trivial pitfalls mostly arranged with little criterion. Furthermore, as soon as we find ourselves in front of an object with which to interact, an icon will appear which will allow us to understand what to do and this, in our opinion, is a defect, as it deprives the player of the possibility of using his intuition to understand what to do and how to do it. In fact, in the game we will always be guided towards the right action to do and, in most cases, the puzzles will be solved by pulling the right lever or by placing object X in place Y. As regards the technical aspect, the title The Collective is very fluctuating. In the initial level overviews, the game environments appear quite spectacular, but in essence we are faced with a medium-low technical quality and also the level design is antiquated, placing itself in line with the aforementioned gameplay. InoFurthermore, not all game environments are created with the same care and, if some levels are splendid (see Istanbul), others show textures absolutely below the potential of Xbox. Things improve by observing the polygonal models of the enemies and, above all, of Indy, which is really well done and very similar to the cinematic counterpart; in this regard, the splendid realization of the face with lots of facial movements should be noted. However, when we start moving our hero, things fall drastically; apart from the combat phases, we are in fact faced with animations that are not very fluid and poorly made which overall give the feeling of a job done with enough. Ta ta ra taaa ta taraaa! From an audio point of view, however, we are faced with an excellent work, the ambient sounds are beautiful, the noises of the weapons and the thuds of the punches, which closely resemble those a bit Bud Spencer of the Indy films. The dubbing is also good and honorable mention for the soundtrack, which in addition to the extra famous aria (moreover faithfully reproduced in the title of this paragraph) composed by the great John Williams (Star Wars and all Spielberg's films), is always excellent workmanship and capable of recreating that magical atmosphere typical of feature films dedicated to the epic saga, sometimes making up for the ancient gameplay and the lack of bite that the game can give. Comment A missed opportunity, this comes to mind thinking of this Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb. LucasArts, taking advantage of such a charismatic character, had the opportunity to revive the archaeo-adventure genre and tried it with injections of polygons and stealth elements now typical of many current productions. Too bad, however, that the polygons are few and the gameplay exploits long-outdated mechanics. Technically, we're dealing with an up-and-down, still sufficient, realization that reaches its nadir in the animations of Indy. The levels are cared for but not exceptional, the music is splendid, so beautiful as to create a unique atmosphere, also making the gaming experience more pleasant. Pros: Great music. Good atmosphere thanks to the music. Indy is always Indy. Cons: Outdated gameplay Easy, linear sometimes boring A bit of history When we talk about Indiana Jones, we are probably talking about one of the most beautiful and charismatic characters in the history of cinema. Indy is undoubtedly a hero, just like many comic book characters are, only instead of being born in the pages of a comic he made his fortune thanks to a by now legendary film saga, finally destined (perhaps in 2005) to see its fourth chapter; the last film in the series, ~Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade~ dates back to 1989, while the other two, ~Raiders of the Lost Ark~ and ~Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom~ date back to 1981 and 1984 respectively. But on the history of Indy, and above all of the video games inspired by him, you will find exhaustive explanations in our adventurous special. As we said, Indy is an atypical hero, because his adventures are not based only on his strength and intelligence, but also on a good dose of luck that often lends him a hand in the most desperate situations. And it is perhaps this aspect that made Indy such a unique character; witnessing his adventures, in fact, one has the feeling that he finds himself in the midst of them almost by chance and, more often than not, getting out of them is just a matter of luck for him. In reality it is the great love for archeology, rare antiquities and, sometimes, beautiful women that lead him to embark on such dangerous adventures and also in this new videogame adventure these three components are certainly not lacking.", "date": "2003-03-29", "grade": null}
