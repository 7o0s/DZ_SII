Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. Very often the job of a bartender does not consist solely of pouring drinks for his customers. As in the best film tradition, the person behind the counter can turn into an impromptu confidant and find himself facing very different people, with the most disparate stories behind them. In the film ~A Romantic Kiss~, for example, the singer Norah Jones plays the role of a girl on the run from a relationship that ended badly, who decides to travel from one part of the United States to another and to support herself by working in various bars. During this time, she comes into contact with some people who, in one way or another, intentionally or unintentionally, teach her something and open her eyes to what she really wants. It's a bit like what also happens to the protagonist of Bar Oasis 1.5: Carla, a splendid girl of Brazilian origins, has just lost her job and her car has broken down, so she tries to reach a workshop but in her place she finds us a bar, to be precise the Bar Oasis. The manager of the restaurant, a rude but charming guy, suddenly found himself short of staff and so he offers her a job, relying more on intuition than on the real skills of his interlocutor. We will therefore experience the story from Carla's point of view, interacting with our ~Boss~ as well as with the various customers of the bar and trying to learn the trade as quickly as possible, also thanks to a catalog that has twenty different drinks and the how they are to be prepared. Words and drinks The setting of Bar Oasis 1.5 is typical of visual novels, highly successful products in the East but with a substantial following here too, which count titles such as Ace Attorney and Professor Layton among their ranks. All have in common an interesting story to tell, which is interspersed with variable gameplay sequences depending on the situation. In the case of the game developed by Corners Studio Ultramarine for iPhone, the story is undoubtedly central and is narrated in an absolutely convincing way, thanks to an impeccable direction and an atmosphere rarely seen in a product available on the App Store. As far as the playful part is concerned, then, business is combined with pleasure: our job is to take care of the customers who go to the bar and sit at the counter, asking us for a drink. Collecting the order, we pass to the ~lower~ screen by sliding a finger across the touch screen of the device and here we interact with a notepad which shows all the ~recipes~ for preparing the drinks. Having selected the one that interests us, we proceed towards another screen where there are, on various shelves, dozens of spirits, juices, beers and so on: we have to take what we need and then start preparing the drink, using the accelerometer of the 'iPhone to simulate the gesture of pouring whiskey from a bottle, squeezing a lemon wedge, shaking a shaker and so on. Depending on our precision and the time taken, the result may be more or less valid and the customer will not fail to point it out to us: if we have served him crap, he will not think twice before getting up and leaving without paying. The interesting thing about Bar Oasis 1.5 is that it can really teach us how to prepare drinks, and those who have a passion for this will be happy to have a free interactive guide available. Moreover, it is also possible to try your hand only with the minigames for creating cocktails from the main screen. The technical sector is excellent, with a good character design, a great variety of characters and a very pleasant soundtrack.", "date": "2012-05-12", "grade": "8.3"}
