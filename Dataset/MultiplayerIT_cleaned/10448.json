The conversion for PSP is inevitable, but it is unprepared for the inevitable comparison with Gran Turismo. On the Sony portable console, in fact, SHIFT does not cut ties with the past and offers us for better or worse the same feeling as always: distinctly arcade approach, classic ~rewards~ system for unlocking cars and well-made graphics but anything but shocking. The main game mode sees us face six ~territories~, each characterized by its own level of difficulty and composed of five separate events: sometimes these are single races, sometimes tournaments or challenges with the driver on duty. To move from one territory to another you have to complete all the events, while winning the challenges allows us to add a new car to our garage. The races available range from simple head-to-head to check point racing, from last man standing to skill-based racing. At a certain point we will have a shortlist of cars available for all occasions: from the more reliable but less agile ones to the very fast but difficult to tame monsters, passing through the models that are more suitable for drifting. The latter technique seems quite difficult to master, especially due to the small analog stick, which requires a greater dose of precision than a standard controller. Fast and furious As already mentioned, Need for Speed SHIFT for PSP does not differ much from the previous episodes, especially as regards the arcade driving model: it is possible to tackle the curves in great tranquility and with the accelerator and throttle, provided you memorize the trajectories, and there is no shortage of bonuses such as the nitro to get the necessary cue when the group has slightly detached us or when you need to overtake ~on the fly~ to cross the finish line first. Any accidents at high speed produce spectacular sequences, where the impact comes emphasized and the car suffers serious damage, but it only takes a few moments for you to get back on track without consequences. This clearly means that no damage system has been inserted, meaning that we will be able to rear-end our opponents as we please without compromising the behavior of our car. There are not many cars available, but from this point of view it is possible to appreciate a small novelty, namely the ~loyalty~ element with respect to a specific model. If we always use the same car, in fact, this is not only enhanced in the various sectors according to our behavior during the races, but it offers us a series of extras that are unlocked precisely with continued use: nitro, modified tires, tuned engines , etc. All things that have their weight on the track and constitute a concrete help. Another little surprise comes from the artificial intelligence of the opponents, who in the higher difficulty levels don't just keep the ideal trajectory, but ram unceremoniously and force us to approach very cautiously when we are about to overtake. No surprise, however, from the multiplayer mode, unfortunately only available locally. It's a shame, because the ability to challenge human opponents online would have added a new and very interesting element to this episode of NFS. The art of tuning Although in SHIFT it is not possible to edit your car in the usual way, when choosing the vehicle we can still customize it as regards the paintwork, choosing between a solid color or a series of liveries that can be modified both for the colors and for the arrangement of the drawings. You can even import your own images from the Memory Stick and apply them to the bodywork. Technical realization While not able to compete with Gran Turismo, the graphics of Need for Speed SHIFT boasts decently made cars, especially in the rear area (for obvious reasons), the classic different visuals and excellent tracks in terms of variety, number of objects on the screen and the design in general. The the scrolling of the tracks is fluid but often lends itself to drops in frame rate, furthermore the sensation of speed sometimes appears less than impressive. The accident sequences are spectacular, it's a pity that the cars then resume racing as if nothing had happened. But it is thoughMore of an arcade driving game, isn't it? The atmospheric effects, in this case the rain, are rendered very well: the effect of the drops on the ~windshield~ is convincing and the possibility of racing even at night represents an added value. The sound sector does its job without infamy or praise: the effects are quite realistic but of little impact, just as the music surrounds it without remaining in the lead. However, it is possible to replace them with a selection of our favorite songs in MP3 format to insert on the Memory Stick.", "date": "2009-10-22", "grade": "7.2"}
