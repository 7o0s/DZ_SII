{"name": "Motore", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/149663-chroma-squad-motore-azione.html", "text": "Successfully translated into the West through the famous Power Rangers saga (1993-2002), the genre of the so-called Japanese Super Sentai, i.e. films and television series based on teams of colorful superheroes and improbable monsters, has always had a good hold on kids, sinking its roots in the Kaiju (Godzilla) vein revived by the recent Pacific Rim by Guillermo del Toro. Starting from these assumptions, the independent Brazilian software house Behold Studios, known for the good Knights of Pen & Paper, had the brilliant idea of bringing the Sentai spirit into a tactical RPG seasoned with management elements, whose recipe, strong extreme and a lot of irony, it first broke through on Kickstarter (grossing double the requested amount) and then on Steam Greenlight. With a pinch of delay on the expected schedule, the definitive version of Chroma Squad, whose logo is accompanied by the subtitle in concession ~Inspired by Saban's Power Rangers~, has finally landed in its definitive form on the Valve platform, where it has been welcomed with great enthusiasm from users. We put it to the test and this is what we think. Action, tactics and a lot of irony in Chroma Squad, the RPG with Sentai superheroes Author's low cost To make a good RPG it is essential to have a convincing narrative plot, and that of Chroma Squad, for fans of multicolored heroes, is practically irresistible right from the incipit. Fed up with the unbearable director, five stuntmen from a Power Rangers-inspired show decide to give up their jobs with the aim of starting their own business, creating a Sentai show in a department store converted into a television studio. The plot, which unfolds over a few seasons, is full of twists and turns, and its strength lies in the fact that the funny dialogues continuously break the fourth wall, mixing situations related to the actors' daily lives with the show's script, in a whirlwind of hilarious and ingenious jokes. We remind you that at the moment the game is not subtitled in Italian, but the English used is scholastic and easily understandable. The aim of the player, who can customize any detail, from the name of the studio to the color of the costumes of the individual heroes, is to create a successful television series, not only taking care of the ~shooting~, conceptually the action scenes linked to the fights, but also of the entire management component, moving between marketing, advertising contracts, audience, actor engagements and new props to purchase. Everything revolves around the characters' abilities and the various objectives to be achieved, with a system that introduces new features episode after episode, until it finds its natural balance. The beating heart of the Brazilian production lies in the turn-based tactical clashes, similar to those seen in other similar titles such as Fire Emblem, although the grid where the battles take place is generally more contained. The five heroes, each characterized by their own colorful costume and specific skills, represent the classes of traditional role-playing games, in this case divided into Lead, Assault, Assist, Techie and Scout. At the start of the game, for each role it is possible to choose an actor from among the numerous eligible candidates, who are also equipped with unique bonuses and maluses, such as for example the cost of engagement, the initial health level, the attack capacity, the number of boxes on which to move in each turn and so on. The various actors are generally inspired by famous characters, whether they are real or taken from films and TV series, such as Michonne from The Walking Dead, Bruce Lee (called Dude Lee), Evan Tyson (Mike Tyson) and many others, but there is no shortage generous Kickstarter backers and wacky animals. Each class is equipped with special attacks with cooldowns over several rounds, and with the progress of the seasons it is not only possible to improve its equipment, perhaps by purchasing new suits and weapons in the shop, but also to further specialize it through a simplified skill tree. In Chroma Squad there is also a section dedicated to crafting, where it is possible to create new special objects using materials recovered in the field and those recycled from obsolete equipment. Multicolored bats As far as the actual combat is concerned, as mentioned we are faced with a turn-based tactical RPG that winks at the classics of the genre, however there are some peculiar characteristics related to the represented subject. At the start of most of the episodes, in fact, the characters appear in their civilian clothes, exactly comand it happens in every self-respecting Sentai, and only later can they transform into the colorful superheroes, in this case through the Chromatize function. This fully restores health and activates individual heroes' special attacks, effectively increasing the tactical depth of battle. Enemies, minions of various kinds and bizarre bosses, can also be hit with group moves after activating the ~Teamworks~ move, which is also useful for performing acrobatic leaps, which affects the appreciation of fans (audience is an important parameter in the management component) and allow for larger shifts in the grid. By surrounding an enemy with all the characters in Teamworks mode, the so-called final move can also be activated, preceded by an animated skit that mimics the classic sequence from Power Rangers. Unfortunately there is no way to cancel any unwanted actions, and due to the isometric framing it is possible to run into some wrong clicks; a minor problem that however can be overcome with practice. Each episode is characterized by secondary objectives in the form of director's instructions, such as killing all minions before attacking the enemy boss, performing a certain number of stunts and so on, a sort of guideline useful not only for replenishing the loot , but also to break the basic repetitiveness of the fights, although they are always fun. The so-called Mecha phase is slightly more monotonous, which, introduced at the end of the first season, puts us in the shoes of the inevitable gigantic robot to slap the overgrown monsters. These sequences, clearly inspired by the Kaiju films, are shot from the side, and it is necessary to alternate normal, special and parry attacks to defeat the boss of the moment. Unfortunately, the enemies have far too large energy bars, and the enthusiasm of the first clashes is followed by a certain ~intolerance~ for the subsequent ones. It should be emphasized that the robot can also be upgraded through the crafting of the components. Longevity stands at very good levels, and the multiple endings, as well as the specificities of the actors, offer a certain degree of replay value; pity that the competitive and cooperative multiplayer sections, announced during the Kickstarter campaign, have been removed from the final product. The pixel-art graphics are clearly a tribute to the 16-bit era, curated from the point of view of design and artistically inspired, although sometimes they are a bit stingy with details, even considering the not excessive variety of enemies. Animations and sound effects perform their task very well, while the soundtrack is particularly successful, which despite being repetitive is composed of really well-crafted songs that are consistent with the Sentai spirit.", "date": "2015-05-14", "grade": "8.5"}
