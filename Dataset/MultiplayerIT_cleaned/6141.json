{"name": "Rivivere la storia", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/154569-rare-replay-rivivere-la-storia.html", "text": "Once upon a time there was a software house called Ultimate Play the Game, or for friends simply Ultimate, a house born from the dreams of former arcade cabinet programmers, responsible for authentic masterpieces such as Knight Lore. Ultimate is in fact the ancestor of Rare, to which the collection under review is dedicated. 30 titles for as many years of honorable career, among which obviously the aforementioned Knight Lore cannot be missing, but above all the one from which it all more or less began, or the timeless Jetpack, faithfully replicated here in emulation in its typical ZX graphic design Spectrum. This is just the tip of the iceberg since, permission permitting, Rare Replay really includes all the major productions of the house, including the Microsoft era and therefore all the titles released on Xbox platforms. The arc is truly dizzying: from 1983 to 2008, and is entirely enclosed in approximately 50GB which allows the player to access the title he wishes to relive. The Show must go on What immediately strikes you about Rare Replay is the splendid work done during the presentation. Usually these are low-investment operations, but for Microsoft and the English house this collection has special importance and the care taken in the creation of the ~client~ is commendable, i.e. the interface that welcomes all the titles, beautifully animated and with a high-end presentation. Each game has its own special space, characterized by a new arrangement of the soundtrack, technical data and much more, without considering that by progressing in the exploration of the titles we win tickets that allow us to access secret documentaries. In short, lots of bonuses for what looks like a great occasion, before the usual collection of games. And we start immediately with a sinking heart, reviewing authentic milestones of the Spectrum era, or the platform where Ultimate has best expressed its qualities: Jetpac, Atic Atac, Gunfright and Knight Lore are present, perfectly emulated and enriched with some peculiar features, such as a graphic filter that tries to replicate the cathode ray tube effect of old televisions. In this way it really seems to be back in the past. It's still. All games are presented in their original offset format with a frame - to fill the missing space on the 16:9 format - made using various illustrations. Unfortunately there is no way to extend the area to full screen, an option that is always much debated by video format purists, but in any case rather useless for products that are graphically affected by the weight of the years. Yet, despite the essential realization, Knight Lore has lost very little of its charm, remaining one of the peaks of the English house. The isometric shot, the true trump card of Spectrum productions, is still decidedly fascinating today and can also be admired in Gunfright, a title that shifts the dynamics into a western setting. Not to mention Jetpac, a product already consigned to history and also present in the remake version, Jetpac Refueled, from 2006. Rare Replay is a great collection presented in the spirit of great occasions The Nintendo question Unfortunately, the line that divides a stratospheric collection from an excellent one passes in this case from Nintendo's rights, since it is precisely for the Kyoto house that Rare has signed some of its most important works. The results in Rare Replay are more than interesting, but they must necessarily give up the intellectual properties of which it does not own the rights, such as Donkey Kong and Goldeneye. We will therefore not find any Donkey Kong Country, and the collection is orphaned by the fantastic tie-in of agent 007 released on Nintendo 64. However, from this platform there are titles capable of making a difference, such as Conker's Bad Fur Day, Perfect Dark and Banjo-Kazooie, all revised to take advantage of the superiority of the Xbox consoles. The title that has benefited from the best graphic facelift is precisely the one dedicated to Joanna Dark, even if it must be considered that it is the same transposition released on Xbox 360 and proposed on Xbox One in upscaling. Grabbed by the Ghoulies, released on the first Xbox, could not be missing either, while the Nintendo 64 version of Killer Instinct 2, called Killer Instinct Gold, is curiously present. This is in our opinion one of the weakest points of Rare Replay, since Microsoft could have opted for the much more interesting arcade versions, owning the rights to the franchise today. The ~arcade perfect~ portings of Killer Instinct and Killer Instinct 2 therefore remain the exclusive preserve of Xbox One reboot season pass buyers, a mbones that makes sense from a commercial point of view, but remains a missed opportunity to give greater prominence to titles that would have brought undoubted added value to the collection. Also from the Nintendo era we find excellent titles such as R.C. Pro-Am (and sequel) and Digger T. Rock, while as expected the anthropomorphic and troublesome toads of Battletoads have ample space, also present in the 1994 arcade version, so far only available via emulation. Xbox One goals Rare Replay is a paradise for achievement fanatics, presenting 4000 player points, to which must be added the unchanged ones of Xbox 360 titles, which keep them unchanged, exceeding 10,000 player points. To bring home the first goals it is enough to start a title, this means winning the first thirty is enough to play, what more do you want? Rarity at 360 degrees Obviously, the entire team of titles made for Xbox 360 could not be missing, which closes the collection covering the period from 2005 to 2008. Kameo, Perfect Dark Zero, Viva Piata (with sequel) and Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts are all present in complete form and perfectly emulated on Xbox One. Considering that we are talking about productions that are not exactly old, their inclusion is to be considered more as a pleasant bonus of Rare Replay. This perspective suggests a certain leniency in judging the lack of coherence of this set, slightly disconnected from all the rest. The games must be downloaded separately and take up the largest space in the collection (about 38 GB), are recognized by the client but can be launched independently. It is obvious that these are the same titles originally released on Xbox 360 and emulated on Xbox One, complete with the splash screen and interface of the old Microsoft console. This is also a very interesting opportunity to try out the exceptional Xbox One emulator, a truly incredible job by the Redmond company, which can only arouse deep admiration for the result achieved. Having said that, it is equally difficult to hide a certain bitterness by ascertaining the congenital limits of this operation: all the games reflect the original, not exactly exciting resolutions, managed in upscaling by Xbox One with the inevitable consequences. Titles such as Perfect Dark Zero still defend themselves graphically well and, precisely in the case of the prequel to the adventures of Miss Dark, it is also a good opportunity to rediscover a title that was perhaps underestimated at the time of release, but valid, original and for sure verses forerunner - especially for online - of modern first-person shooter trends.", "date": "2015-08-09", "grade": "8.5"}
