{"name": "Buzz! The Mobile Quiz", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/buzz-the-mobile-quiz.html", "text": "The casual game genre boasts some very successful productions, and from a multiple-choice quiz standpoint there's no doubt that Buzz! is one of the best exponents. The first episode of this series was released in 2005 for the PlayStation 2: players had to use the particular controllers (~Buzzer~) bundled to answer questions concerning the world of music. With subsequent releases, the developers have diversified the topics covered, passing from general culture to sport, from television to school subjects; and the Buzzers have also evolved, abandoning the uncomfortable wires in favor of a bluetooth-based wireless version. Equipped with a respectable curriculum, therefore, Buzz! it also arrives on Java-compatible devices thanks to Typhoon Mobile, which for the occasion has put together something like a thousand different questions, divided among nine distinct minigames: respectable numbers, which in fact impose themselves on a competition that in the mobile field so far did not impress. From the start screen we will be able to access the ~quiz challenge~, the multiplayer mode (for up to four players, using a single mobile phone) or the so-called ~bargain~, or simply the selection of a single minigame from those available. Once the ~quiz-challenge~ has started, we will have to choose our character from a list of very particular individuals, then face the minigames in a pre-established sequence, since it is only possible to unlock them by obtaining good results. As mentioned, in all nine applications we will be asked multiple choice questions, but each time with a different outline and rules. In the first minigame (~Either it or nothing~), for example, we will be awarded points for each correct answer, points that we will be able to ~save~ or put into play in subsequent questions, hoping not to lose them all for the first wrong answer . In ~Guess the picture~ we will always have four possible answers to select, but the aim of the minigame will be to guess which shape is drawn on the screen (one stroke at a time) in the shortest possible time. Time will also be the center of attention in ~Pass the bomb~, where getting the answers right will allow us not to blow up, while in ~Time trial race~ our speed will make us last longer. The variety of situations is good and the questions are very often far from simple (especially those of general knowledge...), so there is an excellent level of challenge. The sound of the game is based on a single MIDI music that accompanies the action, music created in a discreet way but which adds nothing to the experience and is therefore largely deactivated. As far as graphics are concerned, a mix of polygonal and bitmap elements has been created: the drawing style is good, even if the scenario often moves with some uncertainty and it will be difficult to make everything work even on less powerful mobile phones. Furthermore, there are problems with some graphic elements, which for a few moments appear with a white background instead of cut out: very strange. The localization in Italian is excellent, and is independent of the text alone: the questions actually concern the reality of our country. PRO Great variety in questions Nine different minigames Great graphics... AGAINST ...even if there are some flaws It could have been made a little ~lighter~ for less powerful cell phones The sound leaves the time it finds", "date": "2008-11-19", "grade": "S.V."}
