It took a while for the Fatshark title to arrive on the Sony console as well, but after trying it we can say that it is appropriate to look at the proverbial glass half full: the time that has passed so far has allowed the developers to polish a whole series of uncertainties and more or less serious problems that afflicted the experience at the beginning, as well as to improve some technical aspects. One of the things that is most noticeable is the lack of ragdoll effects on enemy corpses, but also a clear improvement in the visual rendering of fire. The technical sector, in general, is good: the maps develop both horizontally and vertically, suggestive glimpses and fascinating solutions are noticed, in combination with a well-implemented lighting system and a more careful use of assets than in the past, which keeps the design convincing and avoids falling into the generic. Unfortunately, there is no specific optimization for PS4 Pro that allows you to choose between resolution and performance in order to aim for 60 frames per second: you have to be satisfied with a variable frame rate, but 1440p guarantees at least an excellent level of definition on Ultra HD screens. characters and classes The protagonists of Warhammer: Vermintide 2 are the same heroes we met in the first chapter: the mercenary Markus Kruber, the dwarf ranger Bardin Goreksson, the witch hunter Victor Saltzpyre, the fire mage Sienna Fuegonasus and the elf Kerillian. Freed in the tutorial from the imprisonment they had been forced into at the end of Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide, they find a new base and regroup to face the terrible black tide that threatens to expand after the assault on Ubersreik. Once again we will be able to go into battle within a group made up of four components, whether they are real players or bots (the system manages transitions in a very effective and transparent way), but there are several innovations that concern the characters. In fact, their progression allows you to unlock two extra classes for each, which involve a transformation not only aesthetic but which extends to skills, equipment and, in general, the approach to combat. Added to this is a much more immediate and understandable management of the interface, still nebulous in some situations (see the creation of resources and weapons) but much faster when we simply want to change the tools in our avatar's possession and see them increase the power. The difficulty levels of the missions are also linked to this last element, which become accessible only when the hero has a minimum level of skill. In short, we are talking about a very solid and multifaceted system, which draws the appropriate lessons from the experience gained with the first episode and introduces undoubted improvements. Playstation 4 trophies The Ultimate Edition of Warhammer: Vermintide 2 includes 71 Trophies. Many of them are unlocked by simply completing the campaign missions at various difficulty levels, others depend on the degree of experience achieved by the characters, as well as our familiarity with crafting and loot. Then there are several achievements linked to particular actions, such as killing a Life Drain before it inflicts damage on one of our companions, shooting an Alley Rat in mid-air or eliminating Warp Flamethrower before it opens fire. Missions and gameplay We were able to try the Ultimate Edition of Warhammer: Vermintide 2, which in addition to the base game also includes the two DLCs: the first offers two extra missions set in the new city of Bogenhafen, while the second takes us back to the streets of Ubersreik with three new tasks . The standard edition, on the other hand, is limited to the thirteen missions that we had already tried on PC and Xbox One, organized with a view to four acts that become progressively accessible. The particular attention paid by the developers to this aspect of the experience translates into a high degree of involvement, which accompanies us from expedition to expedition in search of loot, hidden objects, new equipment and experience points that allow us not only to unlock the classes extras for the characters, but also the higher difficulty levels, which present a substantially more substantial challenge reschest to the starting one, with much tougher opponents who give life to challenging and interesting duels. The combat system, solid but sometimes chaotic, provides for parries and lateral rejects to alternate with lunges that have a different effectiveness depending on the weapon equipped, as well as the abundant use of pistols, rifles, arrows (and spells, in the case of Sienna) for ranged attacks. The five characters are very well balanced, as are the random waves and powerful bosses, which change timing and points of appearance from time to time, making each game unique. An excellent job has been done on the enemies: although their artificial intelligence is limited, in a manner consistent with the nature of the opponents, they have a rich set of animations and react differently depending on the blow suffered.", "date": "2019-01-06", "grade": "8.2"}
