{"name": "Sega Mega Drive Mini", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sega-mega-drive-mini-recensione.html", "text": "Forget AT Games products, or those clones with hundreds of games in which, sometimes, even Super Dario and the Pokebots find space; the Mega Drive Mini is truly a product made with heart, the only non-Nintendo product to be comparable to the NES and SNES mini. A cure that is immediately evident through a simple but effective operating system, with background music composed for the occasion by none other than Yuzo Koshiro, the author of the soundtracks of ActRaiser, Street of Rage and the first two beloved Ys. And the surprises don't end here: by putting Japanese instead of Italian as the language, all the games included are transformed into their respective original versions, giving access to those contents that for one reason or another have never arrived in the West . Changing the language also changes the graphics of the main menu of the Sega mini console, as well as all the covers of the pre-installed games; note that the Mega Drive Mini will not only show you the front artwork of each title, but also the side ones, as they would appear if placed on the shelves of a library. They are small things, it is true, but they are also gestures of love that great enthusiasts will appreciate. Mini console, big fun The unit, as happened with the miniaturized consoles previously, looks very good: although the reproduction is to scale, the proportions have been respected to the millimeter. As far as the Mega Drive Mini is concerned, every key and lever is in its place, and only the headphone jack is missing, however its original position can be glimpsed. The reset key works and takes you back to the initial menu, as does the on/off naturally; Also present is the volume lever which, despite moving, is not linked to any function. Although we do not believe it is necessary, we remind you that it is not possible to insert the original cartridges of the Sega console into the Mega Drive Mini, like any other functional add-on. To some Youtubers, Sega has sent scaled reproductions of the Mega CD and the 32X, naturally non-functional, which can be attached to the central unit to recreate the accrocchio that only some brave people had the audacity to show off in their bedrooms in the 90's. An excellent job that also involves the two pads included in the package: these are the very first versions with only three buttons, and this will only create some problems for those who want to play mainly Street Fighter II. Big, much more than we remembered, as comfortable today as then, the two pads show off a really good directional pad, and key feedback rather similar to that of 1990. Miniature Blast Processing Even the heart of the operation, or rather the games, do not disappoint expectations. The credit goes to the excellent emulation managed by M2 (the same as Sega Ages and Sega titles for Virtual Console) and to the fantastic selection which, apart from a few flaws, offers more than 40 unforgettable classics. In addition to the inevitable Street Fighter II that we have already told you about, the Mega Drive Mini finds space for gems such as Mark Cerny's Kid Chamaleon, Phantasy Star Online IV, Toe Jam & Earl, Golden Axe, Space Harrier 2, Ecco The Dolphin. There are also two games of the inimitable Treasure, namely Gunstar Heroes and Dynamite Headdy. Follow Ghouls 'N Ghosts, Sonic Spinball, the first three Mega Man and many, many others, including Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle, Beyond Oasis, Strider. There are even super classics like the first two Sonic The Hedgehog and Street of Rage 2. Then there are games like Vectorman, but above all Comix Zone, which still surprise from a technical point of view, especially the latter which wouldn't look out of place even among more recent indies, as well as gems like Tetris for Mega Drive never came on Pal format. They are all games that have not lost their original polish in the slightest, except for Virtua Fighter 2 and Road Rash: the only ones we have struggled to replay today due to gameplay and controls that don't simply seem retro, but unbearably old. Of course, Virtua Fighter 2 is somewhat excused, given that just seeing it run on the Mega Drive, already at the time and despite the big differences with the coin-op, seemed like a sort of technical miracle. As always, here too it will be possible to save and start over where we left off in spite of the overwhelming difficulty of certain games without a save slot or password system.", "date": "2019-09-20", "grade": null}
