{"name": "Rise of Antares", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rise-of-antares.html", "text": "We need colony ships to populate distant worlds, scout vessels, laser-equipped frigates, star cruisers and space bases. Such prosperity could attract the malign envy of our neighboring confederations, which are also expanding, they could attack our homes and our families, but fear not, we have studied laser and missile shields, our fighters will orbit around our bases, well if they want war, they will have it! It will take time but in the pipeline there are huge spaceships armed to the teeth, and as our enemies evolve we can update them with more advanced components, I have a terminal here from which I receive a direct report of the scientific progress made by our researchers and I will share their results with you because it is right that you know how public taxes are spent, rosy times await us, support me and we will reach the ends of the Universe! Yours sincerely, Mega Pres. Intergal. Lup. Mann. Rag. Antares~ RoA is a strategic space in which from a small planet chosen at random in the firmament we must make the best use of the few starting means to fortify and expand to the adjacent celestial bodies before the conflict with the neighboring empires absorbs us in the role of state-mattress, everything takes place in turns, building complex objects, making interplanetary trips, lots of research, the more work there is, the more shifts are needed. The secret is to balance efforts for internal livelihood, civilian production and military research, always with an eye on the wallet, morale and moves of the adversary who will not be slow to knock on your doorstep with a considerable fleet armed up to teeth, you know Futurisiko? All the choices made have a precise fallout even after many turns and nothing is left to chance, there is no equivalent of rolling dice, no random factor other than the initial location of your planet, in a direct confrontation he will win the one that has more ships with higher values, assaulting a large convoy with a couple of raiders means losing 10 times out of 10. You have evil enemy empires to fight, may the Force be with you!
