{"name": "Great Little War Game", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/90128-great-little-war-game-questo-piccolo-grande-rts.html", "text": "~In war, truth is the first victim,~ said the Greek poet Aeschylus; but the tones used by the developers of Rubicon Development for their new RTS on the iOS platform, Great Little War Game, are decidedly different and tend to make fun of the war tradition. In this sense, the short dialogues (unfortunately only in English) that exist between the Generalissimo and his subordinates before each mission perfectly clarify the atmosphere that reigns within the maps, when in turn you have to move your troops towards the designated objective, produce new ones, wait for the enemies and try, in most cases, to overwhelm them. The twenty levels available in the single player campaign offer a certain variety from the point of view of the scenarios even if perhaps they sin in terms of the learning curve. In fact, most of the actions must be learned with practice, especially the mechanisms that regulate the firefights, and already from the third mission the map becomes so large and articulated as to force us to resort to the excellent system for saving the game, equipped with more slots to meet any need and capable of immediately throwing us back into the action as soon as we start the game again. The time factor for a mobile game is fundamental and it is clear that the RTS genre operates against the trend of what is often an impromptu use, which perhaps does not last more than a few minutes. Let's say that in this juncture Great Little War Game moves between ups and downs: on the one hand it manages to be sufficiently ~elastic~ and to guarantee the rapid resumption of the mission in case of interruption, on the other it quickly raises the bar and puts us in front to immediately challenging scenarios, the difficulty of which perhaps needed to be managed more gradually. It's like autumn... The control system of Rubicon Development's title is entirely based on the touch screen and interprets the dynamics of turn-based strategy in the most classic way: a touch to select a unit, whether it's a soldier or a vehicle; another to determine the ~box~ we want it to reach; one more tap to launch an attack if there is a target in range. At first it is a bit annoying that you need to re-select the unit to attack, given that the offensive maneuver is usually consequent to the movement. If in this respect the solutions adopted by Great Little War Game turn out to be a bit cumbersome, the global discourse regarding the management of the units is quite different, which do not necessarily have to remain stationary after having opened fire but can still move if they have not exploited fully that ability previously. In a nutshell, we can move a soldier just enough to allow him to hit an enemy, then maybe get him to cover. These are details which, however, put together paint the picture of a gameplay full of depth, all the more compelling the more you appreciate the RTS trend. Staying on the theme of playability, we liked least the excessive complexity of the maps. The alternation of raised areas (which apply a bonus to the range of our weapons) and lowered areas, complete with any watercourses, in fact ends up significantly limiting our freedom of movement, with the units often having to ~do the line~ to perhaps reach a distant location on the map and who find no comfort in a limited implementation of vehicles. Therefore, one can find oneself in unpleasant and frustrating situations, in which perhaps one has to rush in force towards the enemy base but several turns are needed only to reach it. A problem that, fortunately, does not overshadow the many strengths of the game, among which we also find a good technical realization, with discreet animations for the soldiers and well-designed and differentiated locations.
