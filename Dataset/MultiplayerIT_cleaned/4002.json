{"name": "Dark Souls: Remastered", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dark-souls-remastered-recensione-nintendo-switch.html", "text": "Denying the massive influence Dark Souls had on the previous generation (not to mention gaming at all) is such an illogical action that it is probably driven by an ulterior motive. Miyazaki's work has deliberately ignored years of game design devoted to accessibility and simplicity, and where almost anyone else would have failed has managed to impose an unstoppable force a very atypical approach to narrative, level design and gameplay. Its structure based on observation, freedom of exploration and learning has managed to naturally reprogram the behavioral patterns of myriads of now asleep players; its atmosphere halfway between Berserk and the nightmares of a madman has made school; and its spiral map is simply art, and should be studied in any game design class. Our problem with such a masterpiece is therefore only one: we now know that spiral map by heart. We remember every shortcut, every monster, every boss. We have sifted through the most significant chapter of the Souls series an infinite number of times, and despite this we see it constantly reappear before our eyes, either due to some event that leads us to face the four hundredth run, or due to the arrival of a its revival. The latest Remastered have arrived on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, predictably: an easy way to raise some money at limited cost, and introduce the new generations to an unforgettable classic. The version for Switch, however, has been postponed without too many explanations, only to reappear more than ready these days. It is therefore right to ask a couple of questions about the title, because a shifted launch usually corresponds to some serious problem, and it is undoubtedly the case to check if there are any left in the final version. With this mission firmly in mind we launched into a new stunt review, hoping to see our worries erased. Unfortunately, they have not completely disappeared. The worst boss is the tv At the base, the contents of this Dark Souls: Remastered are almost identical to those seen on other platforms: base adventure plus Artorias of the Abyss DLC, with marginal changes to the online and a handful of secondary elements. We would have liked to properly test the functioning of the game on the net, but it was not possible for us before the launch and therefore at the moment it is difficult to guess if all the elements present in the other versions have been maintained. In any case, there is no reason to think about eliminations of any kind (although the Switch version is apparently developed by another team, the bases used and the plans for change are identical). On the other hand, zero problems in terms of analysis of the graphic impact, where it is quite evident immediately that also in this case a lighter color palette was opted for, and for an increase in the brightness of certain surfaces which, despite the protests of the purists fond of the original darkness, it allows you to better appreciate the graphics and to distinguish each object or monstrosity much more clearly. All this would also be very welcome if the technical improvement were evident, but the Switch version of Dark Souls is slightly worse than those for Xbox One and PS4, which already differed very little from the PC game. The new effects related to fog or flames have in fact disappeared from this port - returning practically identical to those of the original game - and the general quality of the textures in turn seems lower, undoubtedly to better hold up on the less performing hardware of the Nintendo console. However, the result obtained is not impeccable: the game travels at 30 fps, not at 60 as elsewhere, with some marginal slowdown during the most agitated or effects-rich situations (Moon butterfly, large ~clouds~ of souls during a fight , Lost Izalith, etc.). So far everything is perfectly predictable, but there is a curious discrepancy between the game in portable and docked form: taken for a walk this version of Dark Souls is more than good, it rarely slows down, and it is even damned pleasant to see given the size smaller than the tablet screen; on the TV instead the resolution is 1080p, and the slowdowns are less frequent and more evident. Praise the sun, there is no mention of moments capable of heavily ruining the experience: the Infamous City, for example, does not bring the game to 10 fps with the inevitable (and highly motivated) curses attached. However, it is curious to note that at a higher resolution - despite the rather low graphic level and the sacrifice of certain elements improved on the other platforms - a more refined optimization job has not been done. We areor perfectly aware of how badly optimized the original title was, yet after all this time we would have liked a more adequate work and in line with the other ports. A nice Solaire Amiibo or the added value of portability is not enough to make us cheer for this product, regardless of how excellent the original title was.", "date": "2018-10-18", "grade": "7.5"}
