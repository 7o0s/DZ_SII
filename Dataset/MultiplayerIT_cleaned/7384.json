This is what Max: The Curse of Brotherhood proposes to be, evolving the original concept into a more complete product and more pertaining to what can be defined as ~video game form~, moreover presented with a respectable graphic sector, in particular on Xbox One. It is a platformer with a two-dimensional structure and puzzle elements, centered on the use of a magic marker which allows the protagonist to interact with the scenarios, drawing various elements necessary to advance through the levels. At first glance it looks like a rather classic platform game, also featuring a cartoonish characterization that recalls the tradition of the genre, but the puzzles soon take over the standard platform mechanics, characterizing this title as a particular hybrid whose puzzle elements represent in fact the core of the action, more so than the ability to jump between platforms and eliminate enemies. Max's magic marker is not an accessory element that enriches a consolidated structure based on platform canons, but profoundly characterizes the gaming experience and allows very original creative solutions, despite its use being strictly contextual and linked to certain points set along the path. As the levels progress and the Marker's powers increase, the freedom of action and the number of solutions to solve the puzzles increase and it is easy to find yourself thinking of bizarre ways out and being surprised at the actual success of seemingly out of the box strategies. As the first 2D platform game, Max: The Curse of Brotherhood fits ~sharply~ in the Xbox One offer A family matter The premise of Max's adventure is very simple, an almost moving reference to the typical atmospheres of 80s and 90s platformers, just as the hybrid structure of the game closely recalls classics such as Heart of Darkness (whose reference is inevitable even starting from general characterization) or the Oddworld series. The protagonist, during what appears to be a normal outburst of anger against his little brother, has the excellent idea of searching the internet for a way to ~get rid~ of him, finding a strange nursery rhyme to use if necessary. Unfortunately, he realizes to his dismay that the bizarre text is actually a magic formula that opens a dimensional portal and sucks Felix into another world, at which point Max has no choice but to jump in to save the little one. From there begins Max's journey towards his little brother, kidnapped by the terrible dark lord Moustacho, who has found in the little one an ideal candidate to ~reincarnate~ and continue to dominate in his particular dimension, a world characterized by stony deserts, forests, swamps , caves and various other environments. The story does not develop in a particularly complex way, remaining a sort of simple pretext to advance through the levels and conquer the various powers of the marker, but it is also true that in a 2D platform like this it is difficult to consider the narration as a fundamental element. The protagonist finds himself helpless in the face of dangers, but can count on the support of the magic marker, the cornerstone on which the entire gameplay is structured, a tool capable of modifying the elements of the scenario by creating new passages to continue and the possibility of defending enemies. The levels are not very many and the game can be concluded remaining well under ten hours of gameplay, but the collection of hidden objects still guarantees a certain potential in terms of replayability, with the search for Moustacho's ~eyes~ scattered throughout the levels and some amulet pieces, some of which are hidden in very difficult to reach places. On the other hand, it is still a title in the budget range (15 euros, a classic Live Arcade, even if this category no longer exists on Xbox One), therefore longevity is logically commensurate with the level of production and in any case it is well calibrated on the type of game. A sharpie for a friend The characteristics of the platform appear secondary to the use of the magic marker, therefore the puzzle elements are the real protagonists of the action, marking the moments of greatest commitment and depth in the gameplay and in several cases proposing rather difficult challenges. The marker allows you to raise pillars ofground, make branches, lianas, jets of water and flames sprout, with the use strictly linked to the context: there is no real freedom of use since the elements of the scenario, in this case some areas highlighted by luminous points, precisely establish where to use the marker and with what specific power. However, creativity emerges in the choice of times and doses with which to use the powers and above all in the possible correlation between the elements of the scenario drawn. A branch can be drawn freely in any shape, it can be cut and moved once it falls to the ground to be used as a raised platform, protection or raft on the water, you can tie a liana to it and cut it in turn, or create of the connections between a pillar of earth, a liana and a branch and so on, exploit the transformation of the terrain that is obtained with a pillar to pull a liana or move a fallen branch, all with reactions always linked to a convincing physical simulation and generating a large number of possible game solutions, which progressively increase, gradually discovering further magical powers. Thanks to these correlations between the various elements created by the felt-tip pen, it is possible to implement different strategies to solve various critical points and the game constantly pushes to exploit lateral thinking to get to the bottom of the different situations, also including diversified solutions, without forcing necessarily to adopt a single point of view. There is a lot of ~trial and error~, particularly in the sections where the pace undergoes a sudden acceleration with situations of imminent danger, as is logical to expect from a game that features a basically defenseless protagonist. As happens for example in Limbo, some stages force you to make several attempts due to a very small margin of error granted to the player, which combined with some uncertainties of the control system, in particular as regards the marker, can generate frustration, but it is unlikely that they lead to a real breaking point in the player's advance towards the conclusion of the levels, supported by a not excessively high level of difficulty and by the frequent arrangement of checkpoints. Xbox One goals With the abolition of the Live Arcade section on Xbox One, unlockable achievements are also equalized to those of retail titles and Max: The Curse of Brotherhood has adapted. Inside we find about 36 achievements that allow you to collect 1000 points, all well distributed during the adventure. Many are conquered simply by continuing through the levels, in correspondence with particular events that are reached by advancing in the game, while for others it is necessary to dedicate oneself to the discovery of the various hidden objects for the levels, including ~eyes~ and pieces of amulet. Nostalgic look The game is built entirely on the Unity engine and is a great example of using this engine. Again considering that it is a project developed under a budget regime, the graphic sector of Max: The Curse of Brotherhood is very pleasant, even if it does not make you perceive too much the gap between current and next gen that a game on Xbox One always hopes can show. The characterization is very apt, with a cartoonish and facetious style that refers to the classic tradition of 2D platform games and manages well to revive a set of scenarios and characters which, drawing on a rather standardized imaginary, could easily be derivative. There is nothing that makes the next gen cry out for a miracle, mind you, but everything is still packaged with great care and performs its function perfectly. Some notes instead should be made with regard to the control system, in particular in the use of the magic marker. Max himself tends to suffer a bit from the classic problem of inconsistency during jumps, which lead to wide and rather bizarre trajectories in the platform phases, but considering that millimeter precision in these sections is not an indispensable requirement, the question can be overlooked . On the other hand, the problem caused by the management of the marker via the analog stick is far more serious: coming from a concept born also to exploit the possibilities of the touch screen, the assignment of the marker to the classic stick represents a significant change and in fact in some moments the contrast between the need for fast and completely free movement and the limitations inherent in the use of analog become evident, particularly in the fast sections. The developers have managed quite well to limit the lack of precision by finding the right balance in terms of sensitivity of the controls, but in a game that should focus oncreativity and the immediacy of more or less freehand drawing, the use of the stick to move the felt-tip pen is actually a limitation.", "date": "2013-12-26", "grade": "8.0"}
