However, who would have ever thought that a series with the premises so little video games, at least if considered from the point of view of the mainstream market, would it have lasted more than ten years and would it have produced sequels and followers in spades? We are talking about hundreds of thousands of copies sold for each chapter and an interest from the public that shows no sign of diminishing despite the years. As you know, the Farming Simulators, 19 included, put the player in the role of an agricultural entrepreneur who, using very modern means, must work the land and sell the products of the land to earn money so as to expand his business by buying new land and vehicles. At the beginning of the game, you can choose whether to dedicate yourself to an already started business or whether to start from scratch, with more or less money, on one of the available maps. First, however, it is advisable to practice with the tutorials (especially if you are a beginner) which give you a smattering of the various game systems. In particular, they are useful for understanding how vehicles work and for clarifying the dynamics of working the land. Novelty What's new in Farming Simulator 19? Apparently a lot, but in essence little. For example, a new physics engine has been introduced that improves the interaction between vehicles, tools and terrain. It doesn't take long to notice, as this is a much-hyped feature. In game, this translates into more realistic jolts as you work, but that's about it. The influence on the gameplay is minimal and the driving mechanics remain exactly the same as Farming Simulator 17, as well as those of working the land, which are not affected by the novelty except in a very superficial way. Most of the time is still spent in vehicles tilling, plowing and sowing the land. In Edition 19, new tasks have been added, such as removing weeds that threaten crops in the early stages, and spraying silt to improve its yield. Both can be deactivated, in case you do not want to aggravate the processing times of the fields too much. As in past episodes it is possible to automate some tasks, hiring specialized personnel who can work in complete autonomy. As the game progresses, i.e. when the farm has expanded, having a good workforce becomes a necessity, since it is impossible to take care of everything directly. As in previous Farming Simulators, great flexibility has been maintained in the development of the farm, giving the player a wide freedom of choice in how to expand it. The underlying problem specifically is that, apart from a couple of new crops, the rest is exactly as we remembered it. The only other novelty worthy of mention is the possibility of raising horses and, if desired, riding them. As can be understood, breeding horses works exactly like all other types of breeding, so it is a purely quantitative addition. Not even the possibility of riding a horse adds too much substance, even if it must be said that the two new maps, Felsbrunn and Ravensport, are designed specifically to be enjoyed on the back of the new animal friends. Graphics and vehicles Along with the physics engine, the graphics engine has also been revamped. Now everything looks much more detailed than in previous Farming Simulators and, in general, the environment is rendered much better. In particular, the sky has been completely redone and now appears much more alive and natural than in past chapters, but the lighting system has also been revised. Too bad for some elements that continue to seem tacky. The improvement of the vehicles, which has always been the flagship of the Farming Simulators, is less clear. With this we don't mean that they are ugly, but only that, since they were already well-kept in the previous chapters, their step forward is less noticeable than the rest. In any case, the Farming Simulator 19 fleet has exceeded three hundred, to the delight of fans. Note the new maintenance system, which forces you to keep an eye on the state of the vehicles and to spend money (fortunately not a lot) to fix those in worse condition. In addition to an on-screen indicator, the status of a vehicle can also be guessed from some graphic details, such as the deterioration of the paint or the lower yield during work. Unfortunately, the graphic innovations are paid for in terms of performance, which at present are not exactly optimal. Nothing that makes such a slow title unplayable, but it's fair I knowttolinearize the problem. The developers are updating the title with some regularity to improve them, but at the time of writing this review they were still mixed. Especially stuttering can be annoying. Countryside life Despite the news, the gameplay of Farming Simulator 19 remains very similar to that of the previous chapters. After all, the rhythms of the game and the simulated activity do not allow revolutions, but something more could have been done to give strength to the campaign, which remains the weakest part of the entire production. That is, the simulation itself is always excellent and growing the company is still the tastiest part, but the objectives to be followed from time to time seem to be more of a handrail for insecure players than a feature designed to add something to the title. After all, we imagine that the hard core of Farming Simulator fans are not very interested in the narrative side, but prefer to have new vehicles reproduced with painstaking care and new activities to be carried out in the fields. Basically we are talking about a genre that thrives on this, certainly not on profound characters or twists and turns from TV series.", "date": "2018-11-21", "grade": "7.5"}
