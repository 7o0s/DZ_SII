This is the case with Charadium, a truly amazing multiplayer-only experience. Art, this unknown The aim of the game created by On5 is truly one of the simplest that exists: each player has to take turns drawing a secret word, hoping that their artistic efforts will be happily and quickly translated by the other participants who will then have to write the correct word. That's all. Faced with a concept of this kind, it is immediately clear how much Charadium can quickly open up in the face of truly epic situations of hilarity, especially in the case of less simple words to represent visually and perhaps when these happen in the hands of players who are decidedly not very gifted in terms of artistic. The structure of the product, while streamlined enough not to hinder the development of such an immediate concept, certainly cannot be said to be poor; the available modes allow you to start a game or join one already in progress, or finally to play with your friends. In fact, Charadium relies on the plus+ service which allows you to organize a fairly structured friend list, through which you can invite other players who will be notified via push notification. The real games, on the other hand, take place in a room similar to a chat: the keyboard is positioned in the lower part of the screen, while in the upper part the messages of the users appear together with the drawing created. The challenge takes place over 15 ~rounds~, during which each player in turn is asked to draw a word; The ~work of art~ will obviously be composed with the fingers as if they were the tip of a pencil, possibly perfecting everything with the help of the 9 colors available. In any case, you can't take it so easy, given the presence of a 30-second timer which also determines the points that both the designer and the quickest to guess the word will earn; the sooner this will happen the more points will be obtained, in order to then accrue the final classification. At the same time, in the event that the drawer is unable to make himself understood within the time limit, there will be a deduction from his scorecard. A balanced, intriguing and excellently paced gameplay, which does not forget to protect the games in the face of incorrect users; in fact, whoever writes to suggest the solution can receive warnings capable of finally excluding him from the challenge. Faced with the great qualities of Charadium and the excellent price set at 0.79 euros, the only defects attributable to the On5 product are fundamentally youthful, and possibly correctable with future updates; we are referring above all to the lag problems during matches in 3G coverage (absent in the case of wi-fi), to the repetition of words in the broad vocabulary available - 7 languages, obviously including Italian - and to some annoying translation errors, which become simply ridiculous instead in the tutorial evidently made with google translate or something. The tested version is 1.2 App Store links Charadium is an excellent multiplayer title, which for 79 cents offers a quantity and quality of immediate and simple fun that few other products can match. Barring a few youthful mistakes that hopefully will be corrected in future revisions, Charadium is therefore a game that any iPhone user should seriously consider buying. Fun right away Excellent price Great longevity Very annoying lag on 3g Some translation errors (and horrors).", "date": "2010-02-09", "grade": null}
