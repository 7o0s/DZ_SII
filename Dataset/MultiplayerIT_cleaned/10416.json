Not that they were purely adolescent gestures, but over time what was one of the many ways to fill empty afternoons has become an exception for special occasions. On Nintendo DS you will be able to rediscover some of those pleasures or try them for the first time... apart from the smell of paper. Obviously you won't find Risk, Monopoly or complex games, but everything that can be played on a grid is there. Checkers, Chess, Chinese Checkers, Backgammon, Tic Tac Toe, Connect 4 and so on, there is practically everything up to card games, puzzles and some arcade games. What there aren't though are 100 games. In reality the bill stops at 50, half of those indicated in the title, among other things the concept is also reiterated on the back of the package, evidently the various levels of difficulty have been included in the bill, a bit like the mustache did nationwide with its consoles for sale in private networks! Apart from this all-Italian anomaly since the game in English is called ~Master All Classic~, the rest of the offer is quite robust. Each game is accompanied by a valid tutorial and some game strategies that teach us to be more competitive, and although the game is suitable for everyone, the artificial intelligence of the opponents is anything but forgiving. In chess we had problems even at easy level. The games in the pack are distributed in three categories: ~classics~, ~arcade~ and ~bonus~. In the first, fifteen in all, we find names such as ~Bridge~, ~Backgammon~, ~Go~, ~Rummy~, ~Chess~, ~Checkers~ and ~Hearts~ In the Games Room, we find 15 other games, such as ~Sudoku~ (???), ~Bowling~, ~Billiards~, ~Roulette~, ~Connect 4~ and ~Classic Mine~ or the former minefield of Windows. In the bonus games there are another 20 games, 10 available immediately, the rest purchasable in the virtual shop, with fictitious credits won in our games. Better alone than in bad company As anticipated, the work done on the collection is truly valuable, the games are explained in detail and the game interface is also very clear and immediate. It is true that games that would have required a more faithful reproduction of physics such as bowling and billiards suffer a bit from this lack, but overall we cannot complain. What some may lack is a small story mode that would have given order to the games, many others will be pleased to have them all there, available and ready to be played at any time. What everyone will miss though is a solid multiplayer mode. Unfortunately such a rich package would have benefited from online game support (playing Texas Hold'em with humans is much more fun than doing it with the CPU), but not only does the software not use the internet connection, but it also makes it difficult to play together to nearby friends, as it requires as many game cartridges as players. Anyone who has the option, however, can reach up to a maximum of 6 players, a certainly generous number. In conclusion, 100 table games for Nintendo DS lives on lights and shadows. The collection and care of the games is more than satisfactory, the instructions exhaustive, and it offers the possibility for many people to easily learn the rules of each game. On the other hand, the developers have overlooked the game modes, allowing us to tackle each pastime individually only, and, what weighs the most, without giving us the opportunity to involve friends, betraying its nature as a board game. That said, have fun", "date": "2009-11-02", "grade": null}
