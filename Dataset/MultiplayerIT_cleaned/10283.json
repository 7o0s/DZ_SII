Then there are only two possibilities. The first, relatively simple, is to create a clone of some classic: take a Tetris or a Puzzle Bobble, come up with a new design for bricks or balloons and maybe add some original modes to the package. Fans of the genre will only appreciate the usual gameplay, especially if ~filed~ in order to approach today's standards. The second possibility is clearly more difficult: to invent something new. Succeeding in this enterprise, in a sector such as that of video games, may not be impossible, but almost: in recent decades we have seen practically everything, and the fact that the current offer is made up of sequels in 90% of cases only confirm this thesis. All is not lost, however, and sometimes the answer to our questions lies in the intrinsic characteristics of the platform on which we want to run the software. The Nintendo Wii and the Nintendo DS are excellent examples: although afflicted by heavy technical limitations compared to competing products, they have been able to carve out their own space due to the particular input devices they are equipped with. And with iPhone and iPod Touch it is similar: control via touch screen, especially if equipped with multitouch functions, can give life to completely new and original situations. Tap here Cross Fingers, developed by Mobigame, seeks precisely the path of originality based on multitouch. For only 79 cents, the game offers us three difficulty levels each made up of thirty different stages, to be solved in the shortest possible time. The goal in each stage is to compose the figure shown at the beginning by moving the wooden blocks and fitting them together. We therefore have to touch the blocks and drag them on the screen, then bring them close to activate a slight but useful ~magnet effect~ and put together the desired shape. The difficulty at first lies precisely in the composition operation: the blocks appear with increasingly irregular outlines and at first glance it seems almost impossible to be able to combine them in the right way. Luckily everything becomes very simple and immediate after just a few minutes. In a second moment, obstacles are introduced in the form of mobile blocks, to be moved and kept moved with the fingers to make the blocks of interest to us ~pass~. It is in these situations that we end up playing with two or more fingers simultaneously on the touch screen. Finally, the highest level of difficulty is characterized by puzzles that combine the two solutions, i.e. where you need as much effort to compose a figure as you need to use many fingers to do it. Problem blocks There are basically two limits to Cross Fingers. Firstly, the almost completely original nature of the Mobigame product reveals some ~youthful~ flaws that manifest themselves in an ultimately simplistic gameplay, which at one point is mainly based on the problems related to the use of multiple fingers and forget about the complexity of the composition with the blocks. This translates into an experience that, from a certain point on, slips away almost without difficulty, and while remaining pleasant, it lasts too little. Secondly, the use of multitouch is generally excellent, sometimes even surprising, but in certain cases shows the side to some annoying inaccuracy. Graphics and sound are deliberately essential, and we never expected a different solution. The blocks move in a very fluid and convincing way, in a context that is all in all nice to look at, while the audio effects are extremely subtle and play a marginal role, almost as if they do not want to disturb the player in any way. The music is completely absent. The tested version is 1.0.1 App Store links", "date": "2009-12-29", "grade": "8.0"}
