{"name": "Diavolo di un bambino", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/111272-lucius-diavolo-di-un-bambino.html", "text": "Sigmund Freud called the child a ~polymorphic pervert~. This definition, stripped of all the positive values attributed to him by the father of psychoanalysis, fits perfectly to describe little Lucius. Perverse, because his game of choice is to kill human beings, even better if together. Polymorphic, because Lucifer himself granted him esoteric powers to help him carry out his misdeeds. Obviously you immediately caught the assonance between the names Lucius and Lucifer, so it goes without saying that this horror adventure puts us in the shoes of a child manipulated by the lord of the underworld. How such an abomination happened can be understood in the opening sequence of the game, during which we see a hooded man performing a bloody ritual, the number 6 appearing with suspicious frequency and even a residence called Dante's Manor. In short, all very authentic, just like Padre Pio's merchandising. But don't underestimate the theme: we're talking about a brave and sometimes disturbing video game. Without censorship or false modesty, we will have in our hands a child who measures every move to carry out atrocious crimes against people completely without guilt. Sure, they may have some vices, but there's no reason why they have to die and we enjoy it in the warmth, under the covers, wearing our striped pajamas. Therefore, beyond its defects, Lucius by Shiver Games deserves attention: it could open new chinks in the narrow field of themes allowed in a video game. Jovita, you have been eliminated Lucius was born on June 6, 1966 and, at the age of six, receives a visit from Satan, who will immediately begin to claim souls to satisfy his insatiable appetite. Son of a very wealthy American family involved in politics, Lucius lives in an immense estate crowded with people. Therefore, he does not lack valid targets for the sacrifices requested by his master, which will be eighteen in all, one for each chapter of the game. Usually the person to be killed is not indicated to us with precision and we are therefore the ones who have to find out. We can therefore take the time we want to explore the mansion, until, at the sight of someone in particular, the game stops for a moment and the screen turns red. At that point we just have to find the right objects and combine them to stage a domestic accident, which promptly ends with a person killed in a bloody way. Unfortunately we cannot speak of a diabolical fantasy because there is only one possible solution for each case, which is easy to guess. A little spice is added by the powers of Lucius, which the devil unlocks for us during the adventure. Among all the most interesting is telekinesis, which is also the first available, while the others add little to the gaming experience. During the missions there is no rush, the important thing is that no one sees us doing something strange, otherwise the game is over. Unfortunately it cannot be saved and this affects the gameplay experience. In fact, Lucius, despite his greatness as a possessed child, does not have the power to know who is behind him. It therefore happens that a door opens suddenly and you have to start over. This is especially true for murders that take place at night, when many doors are closed and on the only available path there is always an adult ready to take us back to bed. The result is that the game lasts longer but the frustration increases in proportion to the number of failed attempts. In the infinite time available to us, we can still take the opportunity to explore all the rooms, which are always open during the day, and collect as many objects as possible. Better to move forward immediately, so as not to waste half an hour later looking for something inside that damned villa, an activity that triggers possessed facial contractions followed by the launch of the mouse. If we then want to make these peregrinations more fruitful, we can complete simple tasks like a good child, such as brushing our teeth or tidying up the dirty laundry, sub-missions so boring and uninteresting that they could make a saint impatient. However, if they are successfully completed, they will give us access to three useful rewards for our misdeeds. For example, the Ouija board gives us a hint on how to carry out the next crime, while the music box has a limited set of charges that allow us to identify a selectable object within a room. The tricycle instead makes travel faster and gives Lucius an even more sinister aura. That's all there is to do in the game for our little Agent 47. We now have to figure out why, by dint of playing with fire, the Shiver Games team ended up getting burned. The monotony of evil The first crime is never forgotten. In fact, when we take on the role of Lucius for the first time, the tension is great. Never before have we sided with evil in such a foul and unwarranted way. But then the repetition of the situations and the simplicity of the interactions with the few objects available take away all the pleasure of completing the missions. In addition, imprecise controls force us to repeat certain steps too many times. One is that of the hairdryer in the tub, while another awaits us for example in the final mission, of which we don't tell you anything, also because there is nothing to say. Therefore, only the morbid curiosity remains to know how gruesome the next victim will die. But beyond the gameplay and the occasional glitches, something just isn't right about Lucius (aside from being possessed). In fact, this child does not say a single word throughout the adventure. Is it possible that twenty people didn't notice? Lucius doesn't speak, he doesn't cry, he doesn't laugh: he just has that porcelain doll expression. With such premises it is very difficult to feel empathy towards him. Besides, he has no motive. The devil wants souls, done. And when we've finished the massacre, he doesn't even show up. The thin plot speaks only of why Lucius fell into the clutches of the evil one, but the predictable twist soon arrives, and after that there is nothing left to discover. On the other hand, the idea of narrating what is happening between one chapter and another from the point of view of a detective called to investigate the case is good. In fact, thanks to him we manage to recover a little humanity. Also the detective tells in the past tense, so it's natural to wonder what happened, since at least he remained alive. Unfortunately, the ending disappoints all expectations and makes use of the right not to answer. Even the rest of the cast is presented with superficiality, only revealing the conflict between Lucius' father and grandfather. We are sorry to say but for a game like this you need budgets higher than those invested, especially if you want to make a show of violence. However, the set of parts is sufficient to keep the game going, which if nothing else makes us see the world from an unusual perspective. However, there is one aspect to keep in mind: Lucius is not scary. On the other hand, when we are the evil and the worst that can happen to us is a lecture, there is very little to fear.", "date": "2012-11-28", "grade": "6.0"}
