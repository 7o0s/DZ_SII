{"name": "WoW TCG - Onyxia's Lair Raid Deck - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wow-tcg-onyxias-lair-raid-deck-recensione.html", "text": "Hard times for Deathwing's offspring On paper, the Onyxia deck is really powerful and we had no difficulty tearing apart a good number of parties of ~occasional~ players with more or less botched or incomplete decks. The issue was different against a group of opponents with experience and in possession of decks that weren't incredible, but at least competitive: in this case we had the impression that knocking out the dragon turned out to be a bit too simple, especially considering that our opponents had not set up any particular strategy, nor had they selected and customized their character decks based on specific synergies. In fact, Onyxia's biggest problem is its reliance on Skill cards to cause destructive effects on other players, which means that countering decks full of counters that destroy Skills in play is extremely difficult. Conversely, our lizard is rather lacking on this front and the prolonged effects tend to remain in play for several turns, resulting in much more danger than normal. The presence of two or more well-equipped healers then tends to prevent most of the damage inflicted by the dragon, which therefore finds itself backed to the wall, semi-unarmed, overwhelmed by DOTs and forced to rely on the Whelps, to all intents and purposes too much weak: 1 in Attack and 1 in Defense means that not only is it possible to get rid of them on the fly with a single hit of Frost Nova, but a few Demoralizing Shouts are enough to keep them at bay Genuine fun In the face of an understandable discomfort for the Onyxia player dealing with a group of ~experienced~ players loaded with epic cards, it must be said that the game itself proved to be absolutely fun and rewarding. Considering that a game can easily exceed two hours, whoever plays the dragon can still enjoy the experience of selling dearly and putting his opponents in difficulty, a bit like the Master/Narrator of a paper role-playing game, who he already knows in advance that the other players will probably emerge victorious from the battle. To make everything even more attractive, we then think of the ~treasure~ to be distributed to the winners, or the two epic cards, three rare and five uncommon contained in the special sachets to be purchased on the occasion of each ~dragon hunt~ (and unobtainable somewhere else). In truth, it escapes us how a common player should resist the temptation to buy treasure bags directly, in addition to the normal ones, but let's not get into the question ... Finally, there is also the prospect of ~boosting~ one's dragon deck, according to as required by the rules, combining the cards of a second set and increasing the number of the most effective ones. But considering the not insignificant price and the need to buy a second box set, this solution could prove to be a bit uneconomical, unless you share the expense with your group of players. Onyxia's Lair is a big novelty and makes our mouth water at the thought of the deck dedicated to Molten Core that should see the light during the year and prove - we assume - not only fun but also more varied in terms of situations and creatures to deal with. The only defect that we feel we can attribute is perhaps an excessive ease for players with a minimum of experience, because the much anticipated need to build one's decks in relation to those of the others has turned out to be of little significance for the purposes of victory, while the points weaknesses of Onyxia's deck are quite obvious and easy to take advantage of. It is also difficult to consider the fact that it is possible to enhance the deck with cards from a second raid deck a virtue. However, it remains an obligatory purchase for TCG enthusiasts. Some healthy PvE Highly anticipated since the release of the first Heroes of Azeroth edition, the ~raid deck~ dedicated to Onyxia, the infamous female dragon of the WarCraft galaxy, introduces an element that has so far been rather rare in trading card games: cooperative gameplay. Inside the usual amaray package (for the occasion housed in a luxurious satin-finish cardboard box) we find a pre-packaged deck consisting of 60 Ability cards  for the exclusive use of the player who plays Onyxia, distinguished by their golden border  30 Event cards and 20 Token Cards depicting the hated Whelps, the baby dragons who infest their mother's lair. The content ends with three oversized character cards portraying the dragon herself (one for each of the three phases that make up the battle, exactly like in the game) and a copy of the treasure envelopes that can also be purchased separately, to be discarded at random.or player victory. Using no equipment or Allies of any kind (apart from the Whelps), the bulk of Onyxia's deck is made up of Skill cards, making the style with which it is played quite unique and undoubtedly dependent on the goodness of the starting hand. Some skills are in fact visibly more powerful than others, but in general they cover all offensive and damage prevention needs quite well, as well as offering some tactically useful moves, such as the possibility of tapping opposing Heroes and Allies and destroying their Equipment. The Events essentially make up a separate deck, from which a card is drawn each turn, the effect of which - before becoming a simple Resource - takes place immediately and can vary from conferring various bonuses to the Mother of Dragons, causing damage to the players, field Allied Whelps or be the source of some rare benefit to the players. It should be emphasized that not only does the Onyxia player invariably get one resource per turn (and is therefore not required to sacrifice other cards for this), but his hand has ten instead of seven.", "date": "2006-12-21", "grade": null}
