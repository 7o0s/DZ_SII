It is easy for the eye to focus on the engravings of the master from Mogliano Veneto, which seem to draw a mental space that is more than real, despite the fact that the taste was inevitably that of the eighteenth-century Grand Tours and the nascent love of many intellectuals of the time for the ruins of civilizations death, especially those of ancient Rome. It is not for nothing that M. C. Escher, the master of impossible perspectives and labyrinthine staircases, loved his works very much, which he got to know by visiting Italy. The idea of the labyrinth has always fascinated human beings, so much so that the first representations of it are even found among rock paintings. After all, if one of the most enduring and told myths of antiquity is that of the labyrinth of Crete, created by Daedalus for King Minos, there must be a reason. Catholicism itself assumed the unicursal labyrinth (you can find it represented in several churches) as a symbol of the tortuous spiritual path that man must travel to get to God. multifaceted, but nevertheless the few hints made should make you understand where the real strength of Labyrinth City Pierre the Maze Detective lies, the object of our review, one of the few video games that has managed to make labyrinths interesting on a videogame level, i.e. to use them as the main mechanic without being forced to betray its nature. Mazes Video games are full of mazes. The problem is that labyrinths aren't necessarily fun, because they lead to getting lost, creating a sense of profound disorientation in those who cross them, often forced to retrace paths already taken to find the direction to follow. For this reason, many labyrinthine games are equipped with tools that dampen the very function of their structure, that is, they prevent the player from getting lost, always giving him an idea of where he is and where he should go. Compasses that indicate the direction to follow to achieve the objectives of the moment, ultra-detailed maps with dozens of foolproof indicators and more or less intrusive visual cues placed directly into the game world are just some of the tricks adopted by game designers to make the player lose, keeping him on the straight and narrow. Think about the complaints of those who got lost for a few minutes in Control, the latest Remedy title, to understand what the underlying problem is. The substance is that videogame labyrinths are often such only at a folklore level, but not in spirit. Labyrinth City Pierre the Maze Detective, video game of the book In search of the stone of the labyrinth. Detective Pierre. by Hiro Kamigaki, instead bases all its strength on the possibility of getting lost, both in the various mazes and in its visual style made up of an incredible accumulation of elements on the screen, many of which are animated. To get lost It's easy to get lost in the rich detail of the game The work of Kamigaki and Darjeeling, the developer of the visionary Californium, tells the story of Pierre, a young detective specializing in mazes. When the swindler Mr. X steals the Stone of the Labyrinth from a museum, an artifact with magical powers that transforms everything it touches into a maze, and starts using it for his shady plans, the police rely on Pierre to lead the investigation . The detective immediately sets out on the criminal's trail, but to reach him he has to pass ten areas of Paris, transformed into immense labyrinths by Mr. X (he obviously loves to cause havoc). In terms of gameplay, everything translates into an exploration game in which the player essentially has to find the way to reach the various objectives that are assigned to him from time to time, while looking for the various objects hidden in the scenario (treasures, stars and pages from Mr.X's diary) and talking to some of the wacky characters that populate the maps. Each level also offers a puzzle to solve, usually very simple, which yields a trophy to be displayed in Pierre's very messy study. Some architecture is great What makes Labyrinth City Pierre the Maze Detective particularly successful is the beauty of its scenarios, all strictly hand-drawn, whose vitality is truly incredible, almost sublime. Hundreds of people and objects crowd the screen, offering details to discover in every direction. The gaze struggles to embraceThere are these capricious inventions of clear Escherian derivation made up of eccentric architectures, immoderate crowds and surreal scenes that strongly refer to the world of comic cartoons, in particular to those of the French school (but also Italian... think of Jacovitti). It's as if there were a huge carnival on the screen (indeed, one of the levels is actually a carnival); a continuous visual orgy that captivates from beginning to end, in an atmosphere that does not betray any graphic tension. Wandering through the impossible paths of Labyrinth City Pierre the Maze Detective is beautiful simply because everything that composes them is, giving a taste for discovery that is missing in decidedly richer titles from a production point of view. Finding your way back is often not easy It lasts about six hours, but it's six hours really well spent, of which you don't regret a minute, because everything you do seems to make sense precisely in the desire to see what's next. Sure, the game itself is limited, but it's still a meaningful experience that you willingly indulge in, even if it's just to find out if you've missed something along the way... even if it's the road.", "date": "2021-07-02", "grade": "8.5"}
