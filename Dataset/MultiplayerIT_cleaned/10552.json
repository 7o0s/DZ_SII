We are in 1904 and we will once again have to play the role of Professor Samuel Hunt, a researcher at the British Museum who is traveling the world trying to discover the secret of Agon by finding twelve very rare board games. This time his mission took him to Toledo, a historic town that hosted, among others, the painter El Greco, whose paintings will be an active part of the plot based on a difficult love affair, crimes and a secret society whose goals will be revealed throughout the game. The decision to create a longer single adventure, therefore no longer divided into chapters, allowed the developers (Private Moon Studios) to create a more complex and articulated title than the previous one. Those who in recent years had become accustomed to simple titles with phoned puzzles and almost immediate resolution will find something new here, or rather the pressing need to think more deeply about the clues scattered throughout the different environments. The decision to create a longer single adventure, therefore no longer divided into chapters, allowed the developers (Private Moon Studios) to create a more complex and articulated title than the previous one Professor Hunt, in fact, although endowed with superfine intelligence, is decidedly sparing of advice and suggestions towards the player, as well as the other characters. For example, to find the combinations that serve to completely open a music box bequeathed by a painter who died to his daughter, you have to think a lot about the various clues that can be found here and there, while the resolution of an enigma present in one of the advanced stages requires take into account the indications provided at various points in the game and whose function is never fully clarified. Sadism? Perhaps, but it is also true that Agon, thanks to its brains, is one of the few titles in which one really feels like an investigator who is trying to decipher a real and difficult to solve mystery. Too difficult? If you are worried about the excessive difficulty of The Lost Sword of Toledo, know that you have good reason, given that we are faced with what is to be considered in all respects a real programmatic choice that leaves no room for compromise. However, know that the puzzles are always very logical and that you often get stuck more for your own superficiality than for how the clues are presented, which are all accessible without effort and never too hidden except for the sake of the plot. Of course, this is not a title accessible to everyone and we do not recommend it to newcomers to the genre, but there is no doubt that we are dealing with a fascinating product, with an unusual hero who is very reminiscent of the detectives of yellow literature of the early twentieth century and who it would stand out next to a Sherlock Holmes or as the protagonist of an Agatha Christie thriller. Curiosity Agon: The Lost Sword of Toledo is a game full of cultural references from all the arts. Among these, the pictorial work of El Greco is fundamental, a painter who lived in the sixteenth century and died at the beginning of the seventeenth (1614), famous for his portraits with a religious background characterized by disproportionate figures compared to the Renaissance canons and by a use of original color and still much discussed today. Among his deepest admirers, Picasso must be counted, who has repeatedly taken up his works to re-read them with his own style. It looks like a turnip with eyes As clearly visible from the images accompanying the article, the graphic representation of the Toledo of Agon does not make you tear your hair out. Indeed, we can say that the setting has been underexploited and that much more could have been done in terms of attention to detail and composition of the settings, trying to give the whole a less anonymous and less aseptic style. After all, graphic adventures allow a lot of freedom in this sense and it is a pity to see such a lack of creativity where much more could have been done. Even the characters are not beautiful to look at and sometimes are completely inadequate to their description. Let's take Carmen for example, defined as beautiful by all the other sentient beings with whom we will be able to speak during the course of the adventure, but equipped with an ugly, poorly defined three-dimensional model (look at her hands). Other characters are better done, like the policeman or the butler, but it's hard to get too excited about generally poor work. It is also true that graphic adventures no longer attract enthusiastshonored for technical virtues, but here we are well below the standard of the genre. Shut up, please! The biggest flaw, however, is represented by an unfortunate design choice, or by the impossibility of skipping dialogues. Now, never mind if we were talking about a handful of lines of text essential to solve some puzzle; sadly Agon: The Lost Sword of Toledo suffers from uncontrollable talkativeness which results in several hours of talk time. Each character with which you necessarily have to talk takes up many minutes, often getting lost in unnecessary speeches for solving the game. We're not saying that the dialogues are bad or uninteresting, just that it would have been better to give the player the option to skip unnecessary ones. Forced to hear every single word, many will end up bored by it, despite the good quality of the English dubbing (only the subtitles have been translated into Italian) and of the text in general. What did it cost to add a key to skip them? Solution adopted by the majority of graphic adventures, therefore not justifiable by appealing to the characteristics of the genre or tradition.", "date": "2009-09-04", "grade": "7.7"}
