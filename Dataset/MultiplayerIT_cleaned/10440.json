It is the first animated film made completely in computer graphics, which has delivered the Pixar studios to history and has given life to a partnership with Disney which has garnered more and more support over the years. It's been nearly fifteen years since its theatrical release, but characters like Woody the cowboy and Buzz Lightyear the astronaut still enjoy great popularity and have rightly become part of the collective imagination. The developers of the Papaya Studio team, under the aegis of the usual Disney, have seen fit to create a nice party game for the Wii that brings together all the protagonists of ~Toy Story~, engaged in more than twenty minigames divided by category, to which add five special reinterpretations, to be played using the 3D glasses included in the package! Free play, story, rewards Once started, Toy Story Mania! it asks us how many players are participating in the game (from one to four, using as many Wii-motes), then offers an overview of the available modes: ~free play~, ~story~ and ~rewards~. To access the first mode you need to complete the story first and unlock at least one of the minigames by achieving all the required objectives. Later, you can replay the story from other characters' point of view and tackle different challenges. In the ~rewards~ mode it is possible to spend the points earned to buy the minigames to be placed in the ~free game~ mode, compose your own personalized album with the stickers unlocked up to that moment and customize the order of the challenges for the quick game. The minigames, therefore, are really numerous and the presence of different objectives to achieve raises the level of the challenge, urging us to try again if nothing is achieved on the first attempt. Minigames The story mode offers us a selection of twelve minigames to be tackled in sequence, minigames that generally see us use the Wii-mote's pointing system to fire projectiles of various types at targets that move around the screen. In ~Cake Throwing~, for example, there are Woody and Buzz who continuously move a target and we have to be able to hit it by throwing cakes at it at the right time. Everything is fine center results in a certain number of points. The ~Launch into space~ instead focuses on the motion detection of the controller, i.e. we have to shake it as fast as possible to dose the force of the launch, then release the A button to hit the classic amusement park ~weight~ with the hammer which then squirts up. ~Bo Peep's Balloons~ is a classic target practice, with a series of moving objects in the background and we have to hit them by calculating the speed of the balloons we shoot. ~Crazy cups~ represents the alternative type, in this case a ~game of three cards~ played by placing a coin in a cup which then moves among other identical ones, faster and faster. Computer graphics ~Toy Story~ has been talked about for years, also and above all from a technical point of view: an animated film with such graphics had never been seen before and it took a long time to get something better. It is therefore clear that a game based on the Pixar feature film could only boast graphics of first rate, very well made and colorful. For Toy Story Mania! the developers have done a great job, mixing cutscenes and polygons to get the best possible rendering. From an audio point of view, then, literally miracles were done, as the cast of Italian dubbers who lent their voices for the film was brought together! We will therefore find Fabrizio Frizzi in the role of Woody, Cinzia De Carolis in the role of Bo Peep, etc. Comment Lots of minigames Vibrant and colorful graphics Quality voice acting Controls not always accurate", "date": "2009-10-25", "grade": null}
