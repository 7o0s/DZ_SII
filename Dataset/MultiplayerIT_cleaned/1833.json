The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past was released on SNES in 1991 as the third chapter of a saga born on the Nintendo 8 bit, on which the first two episodes had seen the birth. The story tells of a powerful sorcerer, such Agahnim, who one day gets the fregola to subvert the order of the kingdom of Hyrule. With a coup he overthrows and kills the King of the country, and imprisons seven maidens, descendants of the sages who in a remote time had sealed an evil thief, Ganondorf Dragmire (commonly called Ganon), who longed to take possession of the magical Triforce. In fact, legends say that anyone who places their hand on the Triforce (residing in the parallel world that bears the name of Golden Land) would be guaranteed a wish, whatever it is. Ganondorf managed to reach this very powerful object and made a wish; however, the sages managed to seal it in the Golden Land after a long war. Agahnim is somehow connected to the evil Ganon, and just to awaken him he decides to send six girls to the Golden Land (which has now become the Dark World, Mondo Oscuro, due to Ganon's perverse soul), thus preventing them from interfering with the his plans. The seventh girl is, coincidentally, Princess Zelda, who manages to send a telepathic message to a boy named Link, who from now on is called to protect her. This is where the player comes in: his first assignment will be to rescue Zelda who is being held captive in the castle dungeons - nothing more classic. Later you will face three dungeons in order to earn the legendary Master Sword, the only sword capable of definitively bringing down Evil, and the next mission will be to save the girls imprisoned in the Dark World, up to the final battle with Ganon (Link's sworn enemy in virtually every episode) in person; all in what is probably the best Action RPG (as the Japanese like to call this genre of games) ever released on the SNES and one of the best games of all time ever. The GBA version does not differ much from the original one: the text has been slightly modified, perhaps to make it more in line with the more recently released Zelda titles, some features of the game have changed, Link's voice taken from Ocarina of Time every time you slash or get hit, and in a dungeon in particular, two rooms have been redesigned, even if the reason for this last change is unknown. The playability and control over the character remain perfect, although there is a note to be made regarding the use of the L and R back keys, respectively, for opening the map and for lifting and pulling certain objects. The first leads to being activated inadvertently if you want to change direction quickly and adopt a wrong hand position, the second instead, given the frequency with which you have to interact with the environment in this game, causes the syndrome of carpal tunnel if you are not extra careful; although it could not be done otherwise given the lack of other buttons to which to entrust the commands, everything is slightly more uncomfortable than on the SNES. This slight deterioration of the control system, however, does not lead to a lowering of the quality of the game, a quality that always remains very high, and above all it does not undermine the fun and pleasure that one derives from The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. which still remains a masterpiece of its kind. The Legend of the Four Swords The real, complete novelty contained in this cartridge is another: the multiplayer game Zelda: The Four Swords. A plot was even inserted, to justify the presence of as many as four Links on the screen at the same time. Suffice it to know of the existence of a sword that has the power to quadruple the strength of its wielder, effectively producing three more copies of the hero, who in this way can fight with the help of his companions. All this translates into a short adventure (made up of three dungeons plus the final one) in which two or more players will have to collaborate, fighting together, activating buttons that require pressing by several people at the same time to be activated, and above all grabbing as many Rupees as possible to save Princess Zelda who, strange but true, has been kidnapped, this time by a sorcerer named Vati. It really is a little gem, very pleasant to play: each area, in the purest style of the Zelda series, is made up of a certain number of rooms that hide one or more riddles and pitfalls, but this time to face together with friends. The genius of the puzzles, perhaps, does not reach the sublime levels of Oracle of Ages, but it still ensures a good dose of satisfaction, especially if we take into account the fact that coordination and harmony between the players are necessary. When you complete a dungeon, you also get a key. By collecting them all, using them to open the final dungeon and solving the latter, it will also be possible to unlock a brand new dungeon in A Link to the Past, specially designed for this version and extremely difficult, which allows you to win, at its end, a unedited feature. Comment Although the policy of reproducing as many SNES games as possible on the GBA is starting to tire, it is difficult to remain indifferent when a game of this caliber arrives on the GBA. We are talking about a timeless milestone, which is still able to fascinate and amuse anyone who puts their hand to it, despite having more than ten years of experience behind it. The only real flaw of A Link to the Past lies in the technical aspect, quite dated both from the point of view of graphics and from that of sound, which in any case does not undermine the high value of the product. Furthermore, the inclusion of The Four Swords is an incentive to purchase even for those who already owned the SNES cartridge at the time, while bearing in mind that it is still necessary for each player to own a copy of the game in order to enjoy the delights of the game. new chapter. Highly recommended for all types of gamers, it is a must buy for newcomers who have never owned an SNES, but it is also an excellent purchase for lovers of the Zelda series who have already played and dreamed of this title. Pros: A timeless masterpiece brought back in pocket version Exciting storyline Great gameplay Excellent level design Many secrets to discover Insertion of the new multiplayer chapter The Four Swords Cons: Enough graphics but no more (in A Link to the Past) Those who already have it played many times on the SNES may find it unnecessary to buy a game he knows in detail The Four Swords does not support One-Cart Play, even in limited mode Nintendo tries again. After converting Super Mario Bros. 2 and the best Mario titles for SNES to GBA, it's up to the fans of Hyrule's most famous Hylian: those who expected a totally new game were unfortunately not satisfied, at least not entirely. The game included in the cartridge is in fact the glorious A Link to the Past, probably the best chapter in the Zelda series after Ocarina of Time (and perhaps after the already legendary The Wind Waker). But there is still a little gift. Multiplayer lovers will probably rejoice when they discover that the developers Nintendo, in collaboration with Capcom, have created a completely new Zelda that, for the first time in the history of this saga, can only be played by two or more players.", "date": "2003-01-04", "grade": null}
