{"name": "Pac-Pix", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pac-pix.html", "text": "The quill hurts more than the sword Pac Pix for ds is essentially a puzzle game which, thanks to the interaction with the stylus and touch screen, adds a further dimension to a genre that has lately been too stale. The story behind the game is rather simple and specious, as if to be a not too invasive plus of the gaming experience, it is briefly explained that an evil scientist invented ghost ink, with this every drawn ghost comes to life for haunt the books, only pac-man and his magic stylus can defeat them and lock them up in a single book; having reached the end of his mission our hero is, with a surprise move, counterattacked by the ghosts and locked up with them in the book, the owner of the magic nib is now the gamer and will have to help pac-man defeat the ghosts and escape from the enchanted book. After the prelude you are instructed on the moves that you can use to defeat your enemies, the tutorial is one of the most useful sections of the game because it explains in a few very well-finished phases what the idea behind the game is. Pac-pix is based entirely on the use of the stylus, the player will have to literally draw an anatomically correct (or at least sketchy in its main features) pac-man who will come alive to chase the ghosts in the stage. Pac-man can be guided by drawing barriers (simple lines) on the lower screen that he can crash into to change direction and chase enemies. The graphic realization of the main character, although limited by some precise rules (for example the drawing is recognized only if created in a certain way, in the tutorial it is explained that the typical model is created by drawing a line starting from the upper belly) can be customized in different ways and in some amusing cases, it will be possible to draw a pac-man in the shape of a fish, in a hurry you will end up having drawn a pac-man with a much bigger jaw than the other or another one where the lines of the mouth intersect . The speed of the same will depend on the size of pac-man, for a big one that occupies half the screen the speed will be very low with the possibility that the fastest ghosts will escape from under our noses, for the small ones the difficulty will be in being reactive enough in designing barriers to change direction and thus not risk death. Pac-pix offers a wide variety of situations to be faced with ingenuity and sense of timing, before starting each stage you will find yourself in front of a screen containing the maximum number of pac-man that can be drawn (they can very well be considered as the lives available to the player to complete the mission), the number of enemies present and the time available to complete your job as a garbage collector. Armed and combative As the adventure progresses, pac-man will have new powers that can be used with the stylus, from the first weapon, the arrow, the game will be enriched with a new level of playability, it will in fact be possible to draw arrows capable of hitting floating enemies in the upper screen of the ds so that they fall into the lower one and can be eaten, the arrows will also be used to momentarily freeze the too fast ghosts and hit switches useful for the resolution of the stage. The second power that can be acquired is the bomb, this will be used to break the barriers around the switches and to defeat particular enemies who wear special protective masks. In order to use the bombs it will be necessary to draw a circle and connect the fuse (making sure it does not interfere with the enemies on stage) with fire. As you progress through the stages and obtain the new powers, the situations proposed by the game will tend to become difficult and intricate, with puzzles that will require a good deal of timing and dexterity in the creation of the figures. For example, you will find yourself having to light a fire by hitting a switch with the arrow through a game of reflecting mirrors on the upper screen, and then blow up some barriers with bombs that enclose other switches that unlock a passage containing some ghosts. Reading it is much more difficult than doing it, the difficulty of the game is well calibrated and leads to the development of the dexterity necessary to get out of intricate situations such as the one described above in a short time. Graphically, pac pix is very simple, which is a great thing for a game like this, the characters are made in a cartoony way, the nib actually creates a pastel stroke that gives the game a spot-on colorful cosmetics. The game stage is represented by the pages of thebook haunted by ghosts, you notice the grain of the paper, the whole is structured like a big story in chapters. Musically speaking, it is impossible not to recognize the famous original pac-man jingle that 'opens' each new stage, for each level there is a different music that increases the value of the final result without ever tiring or running into boring loops. Ultimately, one certainly cannot be disappointed by a game like pac-pix, finally even third parties are beginning to understand the infinite possibilities offered by the presence of the DS touch screen. Namco with this new incarnation of pac-man decides to return to an old and more functional style of game, that of the puzzle in its simplest sense, the path taken is certainly the right one, taking one of its most important brands and smoothing it around the characteristics of the Nintendo portable, the result is a certainly original product with perhaps the only flaw of being too short. But you know, good things are those that don't last long... Pros: Original, original, original solving stages is fulfilling and fun Cons: too too too short Twenty-five years ago a gentleman called Toru Iwatani, an employee of Namco, created a game as simple as fun called Puck-man, the name derived from the Japanese expression 'pakupaku' which represented the gesture of opening and closing the mouth. Puck-man was a yellow ball that had no other job than to chase and be chased by four ghosts through ever-changing mazes. The cabinet was so successful that it was exported to America, bought by midway, and the yellow ball took the name of Pac-man to avoid obvious dangerous puns. Twenty-five years have passed and the myth of pac-man hasn't faded yet, the creator of an entire generation of video games has gone through different systems and revisions, has explored different genres but always remaining faithful to the stylistic features of the series: yellow ball, colored ghosts, obstacles. And for a new system that is born, a new pac-man comes to light, it's time to go back to ghost hunting aided by a very special new weapon, the stylus.", "date": "2005-06-03", "grade": null}
