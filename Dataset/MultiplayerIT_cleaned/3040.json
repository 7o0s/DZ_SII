{"name": "Persona 4 Golden", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/persona-4-golden-recensione-pc.html", "text": "Persona no longer needs an introduction even in Europe, thanks above all to the extraordinary success of Persona 5, but for many PC players it remains a lesser known and perhaps never tried franchise. Perhaps this is why Atlus has decided to bring one of its most awarded episodes to Steam: in the review of Persona 4 Golden below we will explain why you should absolutely play it if you have skipped the previous releases for PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Vita. The Atlus-branded JRPG was released for the first time on the Sony console in 2008, and then was converted for the handheld a few years later in a revised and corrected edition which today becomes definitive on Steam with a series of additional improvements such as the resolution, widescreen format support, unlocked frame rate, or English and Japanese audio. A bizarre adventure The plot of Persona 4 Golden skilfully intertwines various narrative styles to form a surprisingly effective overall picture. The protagonist - who you can call whatever you like, but whom we will baptize Yu Narukami as in the animated series and in the sequel fighting game Persona 4 Arena - moves for a school year to Inaba, a quiet Japanese village where his uncle lives, a widower who he divides his time between detective work and fatherhood for your adorable little cousin. Yu enrolls in the local high school and discovers the infamous Midnight Channel, a television network that borders on urban legend. Yu and his new friends will discover that TV is a portal to a parallel world inhabited by nightmarish creatures spawned by viewers' doubts, fears and guilt. The protagonists will also discover that they can manifest a kind of protective spirit called Persona with which they can fight in this nightmarish dimension. If it all seems absurd to you, you haven't seen anything, because the real story begins when a mysterious serial killer begins to claim victims using the Midnight Channel, forcing Yu and his friends to hunt him down throughout the school year. We will follow the misadventures of this band of improvised detectives who will have to go to school and investigate crimes between a class assignment, an appointment and a part-time job. As the days and weeks go by, increasingly extravagant characters will enter the scene and complicate the story, leading us to a breathtaking ending complete with an extra appendix for those who have been good enough to follow the story and improve the characters as appropriate. Social Links and free time From the third chapter onwards, the Persona series has also become famous for its unusual structure. The game follows the protagonist's life day after day, leaving ample room for our decisions. After school, do we want to work a part-time job to earn some yen, or do we prefer to hang out with our new friend Yosuke? And next Tuesday will it be better to train with the sports club or go shopping downtown? We could go out with the beautiful Yukiko on Sunday, but then what would Chie say? What if we stayed at home and studied instead? What if instead of going straight to sleep, we read a good book? Each day offers a myriad of options that intertwine and are based on the player's choices, relationships with the rest of the cast and his social statistics; each activity increases values such as diligence or courage in some way, further expanding the possibilities offered by the calendar. Indeed, once the game is completed, it is possible to start over in New Game Plus mode to make different choices and watch skits that we may have missed. The interaction with the many supporting actors plays a fundamental role: each of them corresponds to a Social Link, a level of confidence that determines the power of a certain arcana of the tarot and of all the Personas that belong to it. Developing Social Links serves to enhance Personas, unlock new spells, skills and interaction possibilities, but they are also real subplots, often very elaborate, which delve into the stories of numerous supporting characters. It is important to underline that this type of approach translates into a considerable amount of skits in which we will have to read many dialogues (strictly in English, since this version has not been translated into Italian either) but which fortunately we can also speed up. Fight the Shadows Instead of behaving like a common sixteen year old, Yu could decide to pass the time in the various dungeons that are unlocked by continuing in the story. Most of them must be completed by a certain date, but the dungeons remain accessible even on days when you prefer to wander through these labirprocedural inti rather than doing anything else. We must therefore study the calendar to plan the development of our heroes, balancing exploration, combat and recreational activities. Once you enter a dungeon, you can stay as long as you want, or as long as you can restore health and magic points, while opening the various chests that contain items and defeating enemies to level up and upgrade your Personas. . Yu is a kind of chosen one: unlike his allies, he can ~equip~ different Personas and fuse them in the mysterious Velvet Room to obtain new and customized ones. The fights begin when our character comes into contact with the Shadows wandering around in the dungeons: at that point the screen changes, moving the player's group and that of enemies on a battlefield. Persona 4 Golden is a challenging JRPG that requires some strategy, although it is possible to change the difficulty level at the start of the game. Each enemy is vulnerable to one or more elements: the character who manages to exploit a vulnerability stuns the target and gains an extra turn, but if all opponents are KOed at the same time, a sort of super team attack can also be launched. It is very important to exploit the weak points because the enemies are really tough and have no qualms about giving you back tit for tat, not to mention that it is enough for them to kill Yu to send you to the Game Over screen. Don't be intimidated, though: the combat system assimilates quickly and you learn very quickly to take advantage of elemental magic, physical attacks, upgrades and so on. Within a few hours you will begin to understand which characters should be brought into a certain dungeon, which Personas are best in all circumstances and how to balance exploration and social activities, in a loop that is fun, rewarding and full of possibilities. From PlayStation Vita to PC Although the art direction is over the top in every menu, illustration or screenshot, we must remind you that we are talking about a title originally released for PlayStation 2 almost twelve years ago and then ported to PlayStation Vita, so don't expect the visual quality of the most recent Persona 5. That said, the amount of detail, the complexity of some polygonal models and the cleanliness of the image, enhanced by the renewed high resolution and greater fluidity, make the Atlus title very pleasant to see even today. The new options allow, among other things, to act on the definition of shadows and V-Sync, as well as on the image format (full screen, windowed and borderless windowed). You will probably feel a vintage aftertaste, there is little to do, and perhaps it would have been better if Atlus had completely remastered one of its most loved titles: as we said above, many players have learned to love Persona with the fifth episode, recently re-released in revised, corrected and localized. Persona 4 dates back to 2008 and the comparison, merciless but inevitable, highlights all the improvements that Atlus has devised over the years: this means that Persona 4 in some respects may seem a little more naive and cumbersome than Persona 5 Royal, and maybe some modern features such as quick save could have modernized it a hair, without distorting it. Fortunately there is something that hasn't aged at all, and it is Shji Meguro's sparkling soundtrack: there is little to say, except that some songs, such as the fantastic ~Reach out to the truth~ during the fights, have become very popular among fans of the genre for obvious reasons.", "date": "2020-06-15", "grade": "8.5"}
