The video game born from the collaboration between Charles University and the Czech Academy of Sciences is a particular educational adventure that retraces some events of the Second World War through the memories of eight now elderly survivors. The characters we find ourselves talking to are fictitious and are played by actors, but what we are told is the result of careful historical research and is part of an educational project called Czechoslovakia 38-89. The result is an atypical video game, halfway between documentary and adventure, with crossroads dialogues and tests to be overcome in the best possible way to increase the chances of reaching the truth. Heydrich's shadow Made in Czech and subtitled in English, Attentat 1942 takes us back to the time of the assassination of SS general Reinhard Heydrich, killed by Czechoslovakian partisans in June 1942. Actually, the death of what was for many the most danger of Germany occurred due to a badly treated infection, but this did not diminish the seriousness of an attack that unleashed a harsh Nazi retaliation. And it is with the story of the reaction of the SS that our investigation into the past comes alive, following the stories of a grandmother who has been through a lot and a grandfather who may have played an important role in the story. From here other voices appear, other memories, historical stories and details packed into a couple of rather intense hours, undoubtedly made with educational intent but packaged much better than what the genre has accustomed us to. Effective high-definition footage, raw details, original documents, objects and comic flashbacks effectively tell us about rebels, innocents and survivors, all interspersed with interactive sessions that suddenly transform us from passive spectators into an active part. Connected to the flashbacks, the mini-games are designed to involve us directly in the events of the past, where by retracing what happened to the characters we find ourselves deciphering a document, having to hide something in a few seconds, reconstructing an article and answering the Nazis' questions in the best way possible. The mechanics are simple to say the least and we are talking about very short game sessions, but they increase the involvement, add details to the narrative and are essential for progress, allowing us to earn coins that allow us to repeat an interview in order to explore all the crossroads of the dialogues, discover the interpretations of the characters, and get as much information as possible. The number of coins made available by the mini-games is limited, which must be kept in mind, but in case of failure we can replay them later to get all the available ones. The power of history Attentat 1942 is a historical tale that becomes a video game, it avoids the clichs of sad educational applications and mixes languages, using simple but effective comics to tell us about past events. The filming is excellent and the acting is almost always of a good standard, allowing the historical power of the story to reach us and involve us in a decidedly intense journey down memory lane. Intense but unfortunately far from perfect. Despite the simplicity of the code we were puzzled by some crashes and hiccups during transitions from one scene to another. Furthermore, the quality of the drawings fluctuates while the mini-games are really simple, in some cases so much as to be almost negligible. The audio, on the other hand, is of excellent quality and enhances an emotional dimension that acts as the backbone for the title. Between massacred civilians, painful memories and entire villages razed to the ground, we find all the madness and oppression that made the massive and compact Nazi occupation a symbol of abuse. An absolutist abuse, capable of transforming people who until recently lived in a society considered civilized into monsters or victims. The flashbacks, the documents and the small encyclopaedia that is gradually fleshing out do not forget all of this, confronting us with the weaknesses, cowardices and sufferings of survivors who, faced with the wrong question, often slam the door in our faces, unable to face a maze of memories made up of memories, secrets and dramatic events that are not always talked about willingly. All bearing elements of a narrative that never exceeds in crudeness, and this does not surprise us given the educational meaning, but does not make too many discounts, challenging a frankness that is absolutely necessary to tell certain events in a credible way and give the right weight at the twists and turns. And it's thanksto this that Attentat 1942 is decidedly superior to the vast majority of educational games, actually making us want to investigate what happened, to lay bare the cowardice of human beings and even to excite us when a witness's lips pursed at the memory of a painful past. Too bad for the simplicity of the dialogue options, probably necessary to guarantee full accessibility to everyone, and too bad for the very short duration, not dissimilar to that of a documentary unless you want to examine each document in detail and explore every possibility of dialogue, but on the other hand we are talking about a product of an explicitly modest nature, even in terms of price.", "date": "2017-11-12", "grade": "7.5"}
