{"name": "Daje er gasse!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fuel-daje-er-gasse.html", "text": "Tested version: PCFuel, off road racing game developed by Asobo Studios for Codemasters, was certainly a highly anticipated title; more than the graphics, the dozens of cars available and a solid online component, the game has attracted a lot of attention for an interesting mix between a sand box system, similar in many ways to the one seen in Test Drive Unlimited, with classic game mechanics of this type. In practice, players can freely travel around 14,000 square kilometers of land, including roads, sand, lakes, mountains and snowy views, engaging in several dozen races and challenges with the help of a precious GPS that shows us the way forward. It would therefore seem that the dish prepared by Asobo is rich and succulent, in other words excellent and plentiful, unfortunately the road test is not as positive as everyone expected it to be. Shortcut or extension? If the map is huge and very varied, the same can be said for the fleet of vehicles: as MotorStorm teaches us, any vehicle that can be fitted with studded wheels can be used. So here are motorcycles, quads, dune buggies, slippery muscle cars, trucks and SUVs. The customization is purely aesthetic, but as the game progresses, many other means will become available both as rewards for your successes and by using Fuel, the current currency of the game. Arcade to all intents and purposes, the driving model is simply basic, the vehicles differ from each other only in the basic characteristics such as speed, grip, acceleration and their greater or lesser aptitude for driving on dirt and paved roads. The impression is that there is little difference once you take hold of the steering wheel or the handlebars, not so much for an unrefined driving system, but for some rather serious problems in terms of gameplay, to which we will return later, however. The huge map is structured in different fields, a sort of hub from which you can start to wander around in search of races, challenges and a whole series of bonus items scattered around by the dozens. The competitions are the heart of the Asobo proposal, with three levels of difficulty they allow us once won (and only won since second place is not contemplated) to unlock new fields, and conversely new challenges and new secret contents to customize your own alter ego and one's means. If the races are organized in rather standard events, such as circuits and checkpoint races, the challenges instead put us to the test with different variations on the theme, such as the timed race, a variation of the classic Chase H.Q. in which you have to reach one or more opponents and hit them (but don't throw them off the road) and a challenge towards the base camp against the helicopter. Straight or right? While playing, however, rather important basic problems come to light, first of all the one concerning the map, which undermines the foundations of the game's first raison d'tre. If in fact it is possible to roam around looking for lookout points for a romantic date, or to find new cars and liveries to apply, the preferred method for starting a race is to select it from the menu of your base camp. Luckily this decision avoids us long and boring wanderings around, but one wonders why focus everything on the sand box aspect when exploration is actually discouraged since only a few will drive for long minutes just to get a color different and a few more cars. There is very little to do other than the races, the gargantuan extent of the map is really badly exploited, the races even several minutes long don't even invite too much to look for shortcuts and ways other than the one shown by the gps, given that trying some detours it means losing your position ninety-nine times out of a hundred, either due to sudden obstacles, or because getting lost, perhaps ending up in the valley while you are on the top of the mountain in full tussle, equivalent to a direct ~restart the race~ and after five minutes in the middle of the anything desert or trying to avoid ditches and charred trees definitely blows the nose. Obstacles and getting lost are not the only reasons to stay on the ~straight path~ of the gps: artificial intelligence does not reward a particularly aggressive driving style, nor a perfect driving brushing the curves by shaving the tenths. In fact, thanks to a poorly designed artificial intelligence, you spend all your time behind the train of the other competitors waiting to overcome them, which happens almost immediately by playing at an easy level or sooner or later, at medium and difficult. In short, it is enough to always try to keep up with him by looking for as few deviations as possible, and if unfortunately one pTo lose first position (for the reasons listed above) in the vicinity of the finish you will necessarily have to do it all over again, given that you will have little time to queue up and try to overtake them. The tension therefore does not arise from the thrill of overtaking or braking at the limit (something that only happens in the initial tussle phases) but only from trying not to take the wrong road, given that in the end if you are not prey to dirt extreme you always win. Ultimately, free roaming or not, Fuel lacks bite in its basic component, that of an adrenaline-pumping and ~caciarone~ racing game, unfortunately limiting itself to a race up and down mountains and long prairies, beautiful to look at, but in the long run rather boring and sometimes frustrating. Obviously the online component makes up for these shortcomings, hoping that human opponents are less prey to the ~railway~ mania than those of the CPU, but even here exploration is certainly not the best, it is preferable to concentrate on the many races available and on those that can be created ad hoc. Flashes, thunderbolts and micro shots Graphically, the work done by Asobo Studios is far from perfect but remains very pleasant, while compared to the console versions on PC we can appreciate a few less pop in/up problems, always present with some element that suddenly appears (especially the shadows) but justifiable given the vastness of the map, as well as a much better frame rate thanks to the hardware available on this platform. The general look is very pleasant and most of the time one is amazed in front of the panoramas that suddenly open up when climbing a mountain. The level design is certainly well-kept, and thanks to the vastness of the very varied map, you pass in a few minutes from mountainous to desert landscapes, passing through endless countryside and large sand dunes that end on the seashore. Atmospheric effects such as tornadoes and lightning are presented with a sort of ~speckled~ dirtying of the camera, on the type of what is found on old films to underline mud and dust that weigh on our point of view and an excellent use of photography ~on stage~, with the night illuminated by the lights of the fires, or wonderful sunset races with a blinding sun in your eyes and so on. More generally, it is possible to say that the game does not skimp on HDR and other graphic merits, even if to be honest, the quality of the textures passes with ease from valuable (cars) to flat, as in the case of many elements of the environment. On the other hand, the destructibility of the scenario is good, many of the objects on the ~track~ go to pieces, and everything that is in the way to hinder us can be overwhelmed and shot several meters further on, even if in some cases not everything reacts as it would be reasonable to expect. The best control system is obviously the joypad, with the Xbox 360 one automatically recognized and configured by the game: whoever, on the other hand, were to play with the keyboard, as well as wanting to immediately remap the settings, will probably find excessive sensitivity of the keys associated with the steering, so it is the presence of a pad is recommended.", "date": "2009-06-26", "grade": "6.6"}
