{"name": "Mike Tyson Boxing", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mike-tyson-boxing-2.html", "text": "Don't be afraid, come on Sugar! Times change, but the tune of that legendary cartoon dedicated to the world of boxing comes back to my mind evoking beautiful memories. But let's go back to MTB. For those who haven't figured it out yet, the cartridge in question belongs to the sports genre; more precisely to that discipline called ~boxing~, in fact. The aim of the game is to knock out the opponent in front of you or win the match on points (which are proportional to the quantity and quality of the blows inflicted). This product has a fairly simple game setting, with the shot always following the action from the shoulders of your character. Unfortunately the graphics appear much below average, also considering the excellent capabilities of the GBA. In fact, the sprites are treated very little not so much in the animations (however mediocre) as in the quality of the design. Even the ring suffers from a certain lack of contour elements, which would certainly have benefited from the variety of settings. Furthermore, it must be added that the definition of the image does not reach high levels. Another problem that heavily affects the cosmetics of the product is undoubtedly the absence of the public at ringside. I say, is it possible that no one follows an Iron Mike fight? But not even one person? In this game all of this is possible. Forget about the public The only elements you will see on the small screen of the GBA will be two thugs who beat each other out in a rather sloppy ring. The only nice effects are seen when landing hits that are successful, but nothing special. The isometric view that ranges to give the feeling of a fake 3D is well studied, just as the colors used have interesting nuances, a pity about the other details. And if it is true that graphics are not everything, it must be said that the eye also wants its part. I'll split you in two. Ivan Drago knows very well what I'm talking about... The game structure of this ~MTB~ is anything but complicated. In fact, after a few training sessions necessary to learn the various attack and defense techniques, the title is quite simple to play. A small flaw found in the gameplay is the response of the commands, which appears a little ~delayed~. This is not a big flaw, mind you. But we would have preferred a slightly more timely interface to keystrokes. The rhythm of the matches is very pressing and forces the player not to get distracted in any situation in order to avoid unpleasant surprises (see BEATS). The important thing is to try to avoid the opponent's blows and attack on the counterattack, or catch the bad guy on the counter. Unfortunately, all this becomes repetitive after just a few games, quickly making the player feel bad in the mouth. In fact, the game suffers from the absence of those basic elements that can involve the user, encouraging him to replay. From this point of view, the defects that are most noticeable are to be found in the boringness of the meetings, which are excessively repetitive and somewhat monotonous. This is also due to an insufficiently high repertoire of strokes, despite full use of the keys of the small laptop. ADRIAANAAAA!!!!!! The longevity of the stock is at good levels. This is mainly due to the large number of modes available. Here we find the classic ~Exhibition~, a kind of ~Arcade~ in which different opponents face each other up to the coveted belt, ~Challenge~ where it is possible to fight against one of the countless opponents available, and the main mode of the game , or the ~Career~. This represents the heart of the product distributed by Ubi Soft. In it, a novice boxer (with zero active matches) is initially selected with the aim of training him and making him climb to the top of the world rankings, thus becoming the undisputed king of boxing internationally. Needless to say, this is much easier said than done, as it requires dedication to training and a lot of familiarity with the use of boxing gloves. This mode deepens the longevity of the cartridge exponentially. Too bad only for the aforementioned technical and gameplay defects that hinder its overall quality. The sound settles on mediocre levels, featuring only some nice tunes and routine sound effects during fights. In conclusion, this ~MTB~ turns out to be a productor from the low technical and structural quality. The ~Career~ mode, fortunately, pushes the depth of the product beyond its real qualitative capabilities. But by itself it is not enough to raise the fortunes of a game that should have been treated more in the development phases. A missed opportunity for a good boxing game. Pro: A boxing game with Mike Tyson testimonial! Beautiful ~Career~ mode Cons: Technically poor Repetitive after a short time Iron Mike, the legend. And he! The myth of the ring, the multiple world champion, the iron man, is Mike Tyson friends! A tough guy who can be admired as well as hated. The fact is that no boxer, like him, manages to attract the attention of entire populations both for better and for worse. So who to call as a testimonial for a boxing game? Who, better than Uncle Mike, could appear on the cover of a boxing video game? I don't see hands raised. The answer is ~none~. In fact, here it is in all its glory on the packaging of ~Mike Tyson Boxing~ for Gameboy Advance. But let's gut the little cartridge and see what it hides.", "date": "2002-04-17", "grade": null}
