This is an important debut, as always happens when a project created exclusively for Sony consoles crosses these borders to land on other platforms. The reasons why Windows users should get excited about this launch are not limited, however, to the mere implications commercial of the operation. Final Fantasy 7 meant a lot to many fans, at the time of the first PlayStation, and the remake directed by Tetsuya Nomura had a long and complex development, however proving at the end of this long journey that it really had something to say. For some, the reinterpretation of the Cloud Strife adventure and the inevitable differences with the original did not go down well, others welcomed even the most courageous choices with great enthusiasm. Which side will you be on? And what expectations do you have towards conversion? In a few hours you will be able to find out, but in the meantime here is our review of Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade for PC. Premise Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade, the protagonist Cloud Strife If you have read our review of Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade, you will know that the PS5 re-release of the game not only introduces two graphics modes (dynamic 4K at 30 fps or dynamic resolution at 60 fps) and improves various assets, but also includes a Unpublished DLC starring Yuffie Kisaragi: you can find out everything there is to know about the package in the review of Episode INTERmission. The PC version offers all these contents and something more, specifically a technical sector on paper capable of making the most of the most powerful video cards to deliver an even more visually impactful and spectacular experience. At the same time, we know that there has been controversy about the price announced for the game, which however does not currently appear on the Epic Games Store. This is also an important element for evaluation purposes and we are sure that you will be able to draw your own conclusions when it is made official. History Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade, Jessie Final Fantasy 7 Remake is only the first part of a particularly ambitious project, which enriches the original with numerous details and facets, giving more space to various secondary characters and thus offering a better general characterization. In any case, we are talking about a very long-lasting experience, which will keep you busy for over thirty hours net of the duration of Episode INTERmission, which must be played after completing the campaign. The protagonist of the story, Cloud Strife, is a former soldier of the elite of Shinra, an unscrupulous corporation that controls and exploits the life energy of the planet. Having become a mercenary, he decides to put his enormous sword and his superhuman abilities at the service of AVALANCHE, a group of eco-terrorists determined to hit the company by planting bombs at the main reactors in the city of Midgar. A plan that will have inevitable consequences for Cloud and his new friends. Gameplay Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade, a fight sequence The core of the gameplay of Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade lies in a combat system that mixes real-time action and strategic elements, giving us the opportunity to face increasingly stronger opponents by making the most of not only Cloud's abilities but also those of his comrades, whom we will be able to control via a simple switch or coordinate by issuing rapid orders. As already mentioned on several occasions, the artificial intelligence of the enemies certainly does not represent the strong point of this production and the motion sequences leave much to be desired, but overall the variety of situations, the excellent boss fights and the many facets related to enhancement, objects, summons and special maneuvers paint a picture that we have also found on PC to be very solid and exciting. PC version Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade, Aerith So let's come to the central question: how does Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade behave on PC? The new edition of the game is based on the assets and performance of the PS5 version, but in terms of scalability and above all optimization it unfortunately leaves us disappointed, relying on a handful of presets and dynamic scalers that often and willingly do not perform their task well. with the result of running into frequent stutters and drops in frame rate. Listing the graphic options of the game is simple, since there are very few: general resolution (up toor at 2160p), texture and shadow resolution (high or low), target frame rate (30, 60, 90 or 120 fps), number of characters displayed (from zero to ten), and some items related to whether the HDR, specifically brightness, luminance, black level, etc. With an RTX 3070 we were able to max everything out and play at 60fps, but not without some hitches. There is practically no leeway to make fine adjustments, the only thing you can do is activate the few presets available and figure out which one performs better. As you can imagine, the frame rate option activates a dynamic scaler so that the game maintains those frames in any situation, instantly changing the resolution to respond to any computational load. This is why there is not even an option for v-sync, and in fact we have not noticed any tearing episodes. The problem is that in very busy situations the scaler does its job poorly, it is not aggressive enough and therefore experience declines. Not to mention the annoying stutters that accompany in fact very calm exploratory sequences, perhaps linked to a difficulty in the transmission of assets during the movement of the view. However, the most serious episodes are others, when an evident lack of optimization puts the graphics engine in clear difficulty, for example during the appearance of the ghosts in the Midgar slums. Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade, Cloud, Barret, his daughter and Tifa On the test configuration we did not perceive differences in terms of resolution going from the 30 fps preset to the 60 fps one, even when zoomed in on the images. However, artifacts on the hair are noted which in any case indicate the use of some image reconstruction technique. Instead, the scenario changes by switching to the 90 fps preset, and at that point the drop in definition becomes evident, with distant details becoming blurry. Frankly, having to play without the possibility of adjusting any graphic aspect in detail, lacking fundamental technologies such as DLSS o Super Resolution, since there are several optimization problems and no improved effects, which make sense of using the most powerful GPUs, we find it hard to understand the sense of opting for the PC version of Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade over PS5, beyond clearly of the well-known limitations in terms of availability of the new Sony console. +15 Now, let's be clear: the game is visually very beautiful and spectacular, with polygonal models of the characters that are excellent in terms of design, details and animations, and in the same way a general artistic direction that often leaves you speechless, stopped to admire certain landscapes. There are still naiveties compared to the original for PS4, but we tend to quietly turn a blind eye given the beauty of everything else, and it is therefore a pity that such an interesting technical sector cannot take a further step on PC. which also applies to the audio, enhanced by an absolutely wonderful soundtrack and dialogues in English or Japanese interpreted with conviction and intensity, net of some less brilliant choices.", "date": "2021-12-16", "grade": "8.8"}
