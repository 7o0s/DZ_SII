{"name": "Una trama per Sam", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/125043-secret-files-sam-peters-una-trama-per-sam.html", "text": "The Secret Files series reached its peak of glory with the second installment, Secret Files 2: Puritas Cordis. Then came Secret Files 3, the disappointment of the fans and the oblivion of the series. But more than anything else in the last two years, development studios have asserted themselves that have reinvigorated and innovated the structure of the traditional point and click adventure (think of games like The Walking Dead or Memoria) while those who have remained faithful to the basics of the genre has created pearls of narrative and atmosphere such as Primordia or Resonance. Compared to these titles, Secret Files' approach, even in its best moments, has the flavor of a sweet but outdated past. So everything we would have expected from a publisher as valiant as Deep Silver except that he tries to catch up with a game like Secret Files: Sam Peters, a spin-off made with professionalism, but afflicted by a profound lack of ideas and meaningful moments. Moreover, it is a brief interlude between the plot of Secret Files 2 and 3 which adds nothing to the wider story of Nina and Max, protagonists of the series. Secret Files: Sam Peters, as the name implies, only serves to tell us how the life of Sam Peters has unfolded in that period of time. Sam Peters, for the uninitiated, is one of the secondary characters known in Secret Files 2. So is it worth taking care of the young blonde all action and little modesty? Let's find out right away. But first we have to find a way to start a boat and escape from the island where we were held captive. Honest craftsmanship worth two hours of jungle leisure. We expected more from Sam Peters... A short hike The first puzzle of the game is unsettling. In addition to being the most challenging, it is also the least likely. Indeed, we have to open a briefcase protected by a complicated mechanism that would have looked good on the wall of an ancient tomb. Once the puzzle is solved, what do we find inside the case: a sacrificial dagger, a gem with esoteric powers, a monkey? Not at all: everyday objects including a pair of rubber boots. However, once this bizarre moment has been overcome, the game immediately takes the path of common sense and, in a few screens, teases us with a mystery that seems to lead to a great adventure. And this is precisely the problem of Secret Files: Sam Peters: the long-awaited great adventure is reduced to a handful of hours of gameplay that compress the story as much as possible. The main episodes of Secret Files are to novel length as Sam Peters is to short story length; seen in this way, the idea would be appreciable, except that the plot is revealed in one go during a final dialogue that ends the adventure. After the dialogue we can only make a moral choice that will change the final screen and nothing more. This makes us suspect that Sam Peters was supposed to be a longer adventure that instead had to adjust to the lack of funds. And it's a shame because there are some interesting puzzles, especially in the abandoned camp section, and the story itself could contain exciting twists. Instead, the sense of loneliness of an adventure forced to economize on everything prevails. In the first part of the game the only character other than us is a voice that comes from the intercom, while in the jungle a nun appears who is limited to a minute of presence on the scene. Only at the end of the adventure will we have the pleasure of meaningful human contact. At that point we will have solved very simple but intelligent puzzles and above all we will be ready to plunge headlong into the mystery. Too bad that the journey ends right there. Yet we like it It would be easy to dismiss Secret Files: Sam Peters as a failure and give him an insufficiency, and indeed the temptation has come to us, but all in all something works. The flaws are there and they show from afar: it's too short, it ends with a long final explanation, there is not a single memorable moment and Sam Peters has a personality the thickness of a hair, yet the lure of the exotic adventure of the twentieth century is perceived, and is strong, compelling. Furthermore, in its small way, everything has been taken care of as much as possible. The close-up screens of some puzzles try to give a dynamic cut to the puzzles and are a pleasant diversion from the classic combination of objects contained in the inventory. Furthermore, the screens are always pleasant to see, however static. The developers have given it their all and, with the experience they have behind them, they have managed to do the impossible to keep every moment of the game on the threshold of dignity.", "date": "2013-11-14", "grade": "6.0"}
