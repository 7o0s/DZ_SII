To go back to that era, we have to go back in time, even surpassing the year 2000: in fact, the last 90s were the golden years of the PC Calcio series, the name by which the game developed by the Spanish team was known in our parts Dynamic Multimedia. A title that offered a valid alternative to the sacred monster of the genre, with respect to which there was always a certain gap, but which was seen as a strong point for those who wanted to have a more ~casual~ managerial experience, with some great side ideas. The new millennium has sanctioned the affirmation of the supremacy of Football Manager, accompanied by the end of oblivion of the PC Calcio series. Until today, however, because FX Calcio happens to be the spiritual sequel to the old title developed in Spain, which for the occasion passed into the hands of the internal studios of FX Interactive, the publisher who became famous for the Runaway series of graphic adventures. There is naturally a lot of curiosity to see what FX Studios have managed to do, so let's not waste any more time in preambles and let's jump straight into leading a team. Licenses licensed Once the game has been launched, FX Calcio puts us in front of the choice of mode, to be made between the so-called Challenge and the one called Manager: they are actually two quite similar modes, the difference between which consists in the fact that in the first the player is forced to choose a smaller team, thus living a much less simple experience to bring their team to the top of the world than those who, with the freedom offered by Managers, choose to lead a stronger club. Although the game can boast the presence of 162 teams and over 4,000 footballers within its database, as they say, there is a but: there is no license for either leagues or existing players, thus bringing us back to the old times in which development teams resorted to using fictitious or mangled names compared to reality. The trick, in this case, consists in the game editor, perfectly integrated with the two main modes: if you have chosen Piedmont, for example, changing the team's name to Juventus is simply a matter of a click. The changes made to the official database of the game can then be exported and imported, thus making it possible to find online any files useful for inserting the names of the reality into FX Calcio. A new download has already been promised for the month of September, to update the squads for the 2013/2014 season, even if a question mark remains on the presence of real players from the Italian Serie A and B championships. The coach in the ball Once you have chosen which team to try your hand at, the time comes to take a look at the various management areas present in FX Calcio. Naturally, the sections where you make your formation and change your tactics are inevitable, giving the players a series of team indications on how to behave on the pitch in this phase. For example, you can indicate that you prefer long balls to short passes, what type of tackles to make, where to direct the corners and so on. Each submenu is associated with an assistant, with a dual purpose: to explain to the gamer the functions of the various elements on the screen, also allowing him to delegate the tasks relating to the managerial sector on duty. Don't want to deal with the assignment of training programs? With a simple click, your deputy will do it for you, thus leaving you free to think of other things. As in the past, both players and staff members are evaluated through a system of stars, along with a few other numerical parameters that make up each player's profile. So forget about the amount of data in Football Manager, because here we are talking about elements that can be counted on the fingers of one hand. Particularly interesting is the introduction of Pro-Cards, assigned to each player: it is a card linked to the athlete's experience and his recent performances, thanks to which you can immediately take a look at his conditions. In general, compared to the historic PC Calcio, there is a further reduction in the game elements: in the finance section, for example, only the possibility remains to expand the stadium and change the ticket price, without therefore having the opportunity to select sponsors and set the sale of various material as it happened in the past. The market, also thanks to the slowness of the scouts, never really manages to take off, also suffering from a bit ofi lack of appeal due to the absence of real player names. Incredible friend Of its progenitor, FX Calcio retains above all some graphic elements, such as the icon that indicates the preferred positions of each player and the style of the menus. If those of Football Manager are sometimes a little cold, those of the game developed by FX Studios manage to involve the player a little better, probably also thanks to the smaller size of this title compared to that of Sports Interactive. Also noteworthy is the presence of a 3D engine for watching matches, which however is limited to this narrow field of competence: due to an inexplicably suicidal choice, during a match one can in fact only provide general indications on tackling and passing without having the possibility to change tactics and make substitutions. To do this, you have to wait until the end of the first half, but the greatest damage is obviously at the end of the game: your team loses 1-0 in the 85th minute and you desperately want to find an equaliser, going from a 4-4-2 to a 3 -2-5? Forget it. The alternative to watching the match is to skip directly to half-time or at the end of the match, thus also missing out on the commentary in Italian, entrusted to Massimo Tecca and Jos Altafini, who we must say are not particularly brilliant. Overall, the 3D engine proves to be acceptable, except for some surreal animation and phases in which a player thrown at the net inexplicably decides to open to his partner on the wing. Good idea to show shots in slow motion, to create pathos. Even with some good ideas, FX Calcio looks like PC Calcio, but it's not. Postponed to September.", "date": "2013-05-24", "grade": "5.2"}
