The fascination of being able to create a city from scratch and follow its development over the decades is undoubtedly strong, and engages us on several fronts: beyond the implications regarding the planning phase of the neighborhoods, there are numerous problems that arise create and which require our intervention from time to time. We can say without fear of contradiction that Virtual City bases its gameplay solely on these latter dynamics, i.e. it does not ask us to improvise architects or engineers or to determine the position of the various buildings in search of the perfect setting, but only to solve problems in a predetermined situation. The G5 Entertainment title also differs structurally from the classic Maxis, as it does not confront us with a virtually infinite game session, which we limit ourselves to observing to intervene only when necessary, but with a series of increasingly complex missions that involve the resolution of practical issues. Are city dwellers having trouble getting to the mall? Then it will be necessary to set up a bus network, complete with stops, and to plan the journeys so that they can cover the widest possible area. Do factories need certain raw materials? A suitable delivery tour is organized. Virtual administrators Virtual City doesn't throw us into the fray without a shred of explanation, indeed it even tries to narratively justify our foray into the world of city government. The initial phase is very long, follows the classic rules of tutorials and gradually gives us more powers and responsibilities. The game teaches us how to buy vehicles or buildings, how to upgrade businesses, how to organize deliveries, and so on. It will then depend on us to make the best use of these teachings, keeping in mind only the list of objectives to be achieved from time to time. The developers have designed the interface to meet the specific characteristics of the iPhone, so we have the zoom via multitouch and the various options that are activated with a touch of the fingers. It is not possible to rotate the camera like in SimCity, but in the end it is a useless feature for what we are asked to do. During the game we will move through various locations and in all cases we will have to solve problems, producing wealth in the meantime even if this is generally not the main objective: while in the Maxis series the balance between liquidity and debts is always at the center of attention and determines whether or not to continue the game, in Virtual City this factor is almost secondary and in any case functional to the action. We need the money to buy new objects or to improve the performance of production plants, it is regularly produced by the city's activities but its lack is not a problem unless it falls within the objectives of the ~mission~. On the one hand, this type of interpretation allows us to have relatively quick game sessions, on the other it lacks comfortable options such as time acceleration: once a problem has been solved, in fact, we must necessarily stay there and observe our vehicles that they solve step by step, even if our role is exhausted with the assignment of tasks. The technical implementation of the game is decent, there is a good number of moving objects on the screen and both zoom and scroll work quite well, always maintaining a certain fluidity. Finally, the sound is practically absent. The tested version is 1.0 Price: 2.39 App Store links", "date": "2010-11-04", "grade": "7.0"}
