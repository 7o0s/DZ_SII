Let's leave the burden of delving into the (alleged) stratification of such a message to others, and let's focus on the real purpose of this review, which is to find out if It's Full of Sparks is not only a display of bizarre ideas, but also a worthy mobile game to be downloaded. Firework walk with me It's Full of Sparks looks very good, and not only for the singular themes we mentioned at the beginning: from the point of view of the design and the graphics sector, the work done by the developers of Dabadu Games is really excellent and has a positive impact right from the very first lines. The game takes care of a minimal aesthetic style that can recall products such as Monument Valley for the cleanliness of the image and the attention to small details, although in this case we note the use of more lively colors. Also because three colors in particular are also the protagonists of the gameplay, as we will see shortly. Basically, It's Full of Sparks behaves like a platform similar to many others on the App Store: during the more than 80 levels made available, the user's aim is to reach the goal as quickly as possible (i.e. the water essential to put out the flame) simply by moving the firecracker to the right or left and avoiding obstacles. The player's speed is rewarded with the proverbial three stars obtainable as the maximum recognition, and which also constitute the only replayability factor of the title. The peculiarity of It's Full of Sparks comes out when, after the first interlocutory stages, you come into possession of three pairs of red, green and yellow magic glasses capable of making objects of the same shade disappear or appear by pressing the relative key on the right side of the touchscreen. For example, if your path is blocked by a wall of green spikes, simply tap the similar button to clear the way, taking care to repeat the action immediately afterwards to generate the bridge of the same color needed to continue. As it is easy to imagine, things soon tend to get much more complicated than the situation just described: the variety of elements sensitive to the power of the glasses progressively increases, reaching the point of including barriers, trampolines, mobile platforms and so on, and the juxtaposition of the three colors it forces the user to think fast and act even faster. Without detracting from a commendable level design for how it manages to maintain high standards throughout the course of the adventure, it is undeniable that It's Full of Sparks falls into that category of platformers strongly focused on trial and error dynamics, which are more ruthless until you reach the apex in the final stages: if therefore proceeding with attempts to memorize a pattern of actions to be performed perfectly does not fall within your conception of entertainment, know that It's Full of Sparks is absolutely not for you, and on the contrary, it risks proving to be a very frustrating product also due to a control system that is not very precise. However, we are always talking about a free title, which moreover exploits the much reviled free to play formula in an honest and non-stringent way: once the 15 attempts made available at the beginning have been used up, it is possible to get more by waiting for it to be recharged, by watching an advertising video or by agreeing to the activation of the automatic spots, while by paying a one-off fee the modest sum of  2.99, infinite lives are unlocked.", "date": "2018-01-25", "grade": "8.0"}
