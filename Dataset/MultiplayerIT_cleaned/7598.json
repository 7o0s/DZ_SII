When a brand goes to Christmas in the distant past, feelings of nostalgia, expectation and affection are irreparably mixed. We feel like saying that Namco could not have chosen a better mechanism to reinvigorate and make the shape of its primary mascot dazzling; Pac-Man Championship Edition was, at the end of 2007, a true filter of youth for the excellent ball-eater. Fun, fresh, immediate, seasoned with an arcade aftertaste that made the joy of today's fathers of families who grew up in arcades and were finally able to touch an updated and ideally perfect transposition with their hands. The game was then evolved into the Championship Edition DX in 2010 under the Namco Generations label (a sort of organ to promote the most famous franchises of the Tokyo publisher in high definition) with the very recent Steam version made unique by the word DX +. Pac-Man then arrives on PC in a revised version, enriched with all those elements that are now essential for an arcade title and full of content to provide hours of gameplay without frills. It is from this kind of product that the crystalline influence of the old Namco is clearly seen before it merged with Bandai, and it is no coincidence that Toru Iwatani, the historic director of the franchise, was at the forefront of rejuvenating Pac-Man of its well-known formula and modernize it in the best way. After touching PSN and X-Box Live, the goal is still perfectly centered on PC too. Pac-Man arrives on PC with an arcade rush of frenzy and speed that will keep you hooked for a long time arcade marathon The structure of the new Pac-Man pulls its 80s roots out of the ground and adds a great deal of dynamism and excitement to the package. By expanding the array of objectives beyond the usual canons of the past, the title offers varied methods and timings to keep you glued to the screen. On a purely playful level, nothing has changed: the innovations introduced at the time by Namco have been transposed en bloc into the PC version, with a single criticism, always subjective, aimed at the ability to control the keyboard, in our view unfit for purpose . By basing Pac-Man's movement on a mixture of timing, accelerations and precise calculation of the angle frames (the almost manic frame-centric setting, clearly inherited from competitive Tekken, has also infected Iwatani) the analog is rediscovered to be the best system to approach the title. The most immediate value of the Championship Edition is precisely linked to the genuine euphoria that is unleashed by picking up a pad and darting in the new collision system created by Namco. The skill grows in proportion to the player's ability to know how to study and make his own the distances of action, awakening the dormant ghosts and restarting in the corners capable of distancing himself from the crowds of pursuers that will inevitably be created. The novice steps in the new dimension of Pac-Man are structured to be painless, with a difficulty curve set to stabilize after getting used to the tricks and the paths of the proposed maps. In reality, a lot is based on memorizing the generation system of the balls or fruit to collect, all combined with knowing how to use communications properly between the sides of the screen which seamlessly make the map a decisive element for the strategy . But it is in the management of the extra-playful that the Championship Edition DX+ shines. ball throw Not everyone loves the arrogance with which online has entered the backbone of many of those brands that made single player gaming their dogma. It is the sign of the passing times and inevitably bring the competition to a wider level than one's own living room. Pac-Man Championship Edition DX+ without shyness throws the player into the world circuit, showing the ranking for the specific level and challenge at each end of the session. In this edition Namco has included new levels, maps and conditions to be met for the completion of the game frameworks, each with its own ranking with which to compare and the possibility of sharing the result on Facebook, showing the objectives and medals won to potential challenger friends. The competitive system is winning and adds bite to the apparatus, allowing anyone to jump into the challenge and be taken by the unique dynamic vortex of DX+. Given the amount of unlockables, variants, proposed and discriminating audio / video customizations available, the Championship Edition DX + is undoubtedly the richest version among those released so far. Lto account of the price at which the complete package of all the old DLCs is sold ( 9.90) Namco has humbly placed itself towards the PC market, managing to offer the best way to bring the mind back to the most populous cabinet of the world. Considering Pac-Man's record of nearly 300,000 arcade machines installed in arcades worldwide, Namco couldn't have picked a better business card.", "date": "2013-09-27", "grade": "8.0"}
