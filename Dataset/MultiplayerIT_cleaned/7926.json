In fact, there are four campaigns that make up the single player offer of the new Capcom title, which arrives on PC with an inevitable technical boost and a new exclusive mode (Mercenaries: No Mercy), which is unlocked after completing all the stories mode and which in April will be enriched by the presence of the characters of Left 4 Dead 2, to inaugurate an unprecedented collaboration between the house of Osaka and Valve. Zombies unite rather than divide, it seems. The plot of the game is quite intricate and the four campaigns take place in practice ~in parallel~, each contributing to add pieces to the puzzle and finally providing us, with the part dedicated to Ada Wong, a series of useful details to put everything together. The developers have taken advantage of this solution to offer us, in fact, four different interpretations of the gameplay, examining the possibilities and focusing now on the ~horror~ atmospheres, now on the shooter action, now on a more ~physical~ vision of the experience thanks to Jake's superhuman abilities. However, there are some limits, represented in the first place by the fact of replaying certain sections as they are between one campaign and another. Survival horror or third person shooter? There has been a lot of talk about the ~action breakthrough~ made by Capcom for Resident Evil 6, but in the end the differences between this last chapter of the series and the one immediately preceding it appear anything but marked. We therefore have a very (too) close third-person view, a rather precise aiming system for all weapons, thanks to the laser pointers, and the possibility of carrying out decisive melee attacks on individual zombies, perhaps to save a few bullets. A bar regulates the frequency with which we can resort to roundhouse kicks and the like, thus avoiding excessive use of this solution, and the same indicator can be used to perform a ~quick shot~ with the pistol towards the closest enemy. The philosophy of the house in Osaka regarding the management of zombies is not perfectly clear, in the sense that by logic it would be enough to hit them on the head once to eliminate them, yet they remain there, standing, until we make them literally explode by dint of bullets skull. It goes without saying that in situations of severe numerical inferiority (practically always) you end up shooting in bulk rather than placing precision shots, which is a pity. Also because, when the ammunition is exhausted, the alternative is to shoot down the enemies with a knife and the thing is really sad for how it has been implemented, i.e. identical to the previous episodes, with the character who remains anchored to the ground while waving the blade in front of him. The endowment in terms of arsenal is still quite rich: ranging from the service pistol to the shotgun, from the sniper rifle to the machine gun, from the magnum to the rocket launcher, passing through the traditional incendiary grenades, radio-controlled explosives and the lethal crossbow Ada Wong. But where is the horror? Also for the above speeches, a return to the horror atmospheres that had characterized the franchise during its first years of life was expected from Resident Evil 6, but also in this case we were disappointed. Leon and Helena's campaign would in theory be the most ~gothic~ of the four, but beyond some spectacular cutscenes, the horror element is completely missing. It is evidently a problem of direction, certainly not of controls: the gameplay of Dead Space is anything but woody, yet the ~scares~ are not lacking thanks to a series of precise choices involving the design of the scenarios. All of this is hidden in the new Capcom title, which from this point of view can only represent yet another wasted opportunity to make up for lost ground. On the other hand, as we said, the developers' belief that reduced mobility for the characters can help increase tension leads to frankly absurd situations, forcing us to press a button even just to go up or down a step. On PC, the situation is particularly significant where you opt for the use of the mouse and keyboard: in this case, on the one hand, you gain precision (therefore you can place the four or five headshots necessary to eliminate a zombie without problems) , on the other it adds more ~wood~ to the commands. However, the Xbox 360 controller is perfectly supported and is in our opinion the better choiceto enjoy the experience. Cross and delight of the PC version There has been a lot of talk about the Mercenaries: No Mercy mode, exclusive to the PC version of Resident Evil 6, which will be updated next month with the introduction of the four survivors of Left 4 Dead 2. A very interesting initiative, which further lengthens the duration of the game but which, it is clear, does not constitute a valid reason to push owners of the console version to purchase this new edition. Much more important is instead the discourse relating to the technical realization, which also in this case is divided between ups and downs. Where in fact it is possible to enjoy a higher resolution than what was seen on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, as well as a substantially more fluid frame rate (80-90 frames per second on the test configuration, with all details at maximum) and a better rendering as regards characters and effects, the graphics of the game suffer from a major flaw: the textures of the scenarios. Just look at one of the images we captured to realize how the textures used by Capcom are of the lowest quality, and this represents a blow compared to the globality of an all in all honest conversion work, which offers few customization possibilities (see image opposite) but can at the same time count on a very solid framework, with well-differentiated locations full of elements.", "date": "2013-03-31", "grade": "7.8"}
