If three is the perfect number, this third release should therefore definitively consecrate the series with the long-awaited qualitative leap. Or not? Running in the desert 2XL Trophylite Rally is a game inspired by the General Tire Trophylite competition, a rather famous championship that takes place mainly in the desert areas of the western United States. A different specialty therefore from the European rally, starting with the cars used which in this case are off-road trucks decidedly rich in horsepower under the bonnet. The game can count on as many as 31 means available to the player, even if in reality the differences are almost purely aesthetic; once you get on the track, practically one is as good as the other given that there are no significant and substantial variations in behavior between them. An ingenuity of game design, actually not the only one as we will see later, which however is soon overshadowed by the quality of the graphics engine created by 2XL Games. In fact, the aesthetic component is undoubtedly the highest quality of 2XL Trophylite Rally, with an overall impact among the best ever on the platform. In fact, the scenarios, despite the general monotony of the desert setting, appear decidedly well reproduced with a level of detail and a quality of the polygonal modeling of very valuable value. All then well supported both by a more than sufficient and quite solid frame rate, and above all by several special effects such as particle and lens flare. Very good, even if a little fluctuating, the quality of the textures. A graphic aspect that enhances the track design, undoubtedly pleasant but above all spectacular in the face of the vertical development composed of ups and downs, jumps, climbing hills and subsequent descents that continue to appear on the screen, supported by the great depth of the horizon and the considerable length of the tracks. It is a pity therefore that in the face of a game that is so beautiful to look at, it does not correspond to an equivalent value in the gameplay component; quite simply, 2XL Trophylite Rally is unfortunately quite boring and lacking in bite throughout its development. There's nothing wrong if the developers, probably also to ensure the graphic goodness mentioned above, have chosen to opt for a structure that is not based on branches and direct challenges against opponents, but rather on the time with which they are routes completed. So it happens that you come across an opposing car every now and then, but these are sporadic encounters that have little or no effect on the result of your session. However, if you opt for this gameplay solution, in which you practically always find yourself driving alone, you need to study an exciting and stimulating driving model. On the contrary, 2XL Trophylite Rally is a rose water racing, in which the effort necessary to stay on the track and face the curves is really minimal. You almost find yourself running on rails, almost never needing to take your finger off the accelerator except on the occasion of the tightest bends where, however, you just need to tap the brakes, just to be happy. A little too little therefore, even in the face of the very basic structuring of the main mode in which all you have to do is win a race to move on to the next. In this case, local multiplayer is also of little use with which to challenge friends via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. The tested version is 1.01 App Store links", "date": "2010-07-01", "grade": "6.9"}
