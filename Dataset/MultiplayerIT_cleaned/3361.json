{"name": "Superliminal", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/superliminal-recensione.html", "text": "The history of the development of Superliminal comes from afar, more precisely at the beginning of 2014, when a small team of students from Carnegie Mellon Univesity created the concept of a puzzle game focused on the use of perspective and optical illusions. The first films highlighted clear points of contact with popular titles such as Portal and Antichamber, built on a single game mechanic. In the short demonstration, any object with which it was possible to interact could be reduced or enlarged at will on the basis of the different angles of the shot. This demo then evolved into an interactive experience called the Museum of Simulation Technology. The work was finalized by Pillow Castle Games, a new independent reality based in Seattle, which concluded the project by converting it into its current guise. Before proceeding with the review, we remind you that Superliminal has been available since last November 12 exclusively on the Epic Games Store. All a question of perspectives The playful formula of Superliminal focuses entirely on solving puzzles that must be interpreted through the management of perspective. Rotating the camera helps alter the shape and size of objects the player can interact with. It is mainly a matter of perception, considering that the material at one's disposal can be exponentially enlarged or reduced and then used in solving the puzzles that the game puts us in front of. Unlike what happens in other experiences of the same nature, in this case the support of the pad has not been foreseen and it is essential to use the mouse and keyboard. Using the left mouse button you can grab and move objects, while holding down the right mouse you can rotate them at will. The peculiarity of the context in which you are placed is perceived from the very first interactions, when in a small aseptic room you have to try your hand at altering objects such as cubes and chess pieces. It doesn't take long before one can realize that one is immersed in all respects in a controlled dreamlike dimension, in which the subject has been subjected to a mysterious and singular therapeutic path. Through the Standard Orientation Protocol, a female voice with detached tones, it provides us with indications on the objectives that must be achieved during the game. Clearly inspired by GLaDOS of Portal, the guide immediately makes a concept clear: it has not been programmed to offer assistance in solving the puzzles, therefore it will be necessary to act without having any concrete support. The user is stimulated to think about those few elements that are placed before him from time to time, without receiving suggestions except for those simple indications that allow him to contextualize, as far as possible, what is happening before his eyes. For example the fact that during the so-called I-LIDS one cannot wake up from the dream, even after realizing that one is inside a fictitious dimension. In Superliminal a multitude of paradoxes are established that play on the sensory perception of the user. Thus it happens that one has to place oneself in a certain position in the room to be able to reconstruct a cube starting from a drawing on a wall, one has to interpret how to position oneself in relation to a certain object in order to be able to move it elsewhere using the perspective, or even to enlarge or restrict connecting portal passages between different points of the same room to reach the exit point. The interaction remains very essential: you can grab cubes and dice, but also improbable slices of cheese, apples, doors, luminous signs and other assorted objects, apparently devoid of any construct yet essential to guarantee entry to the following area of the path . Then there are the indications given by Dr. Glenn Pierce, entrusted to a series of recorders that can be activated at various times during the walkthrough. The message underlying the gaming experience is essentially a metaphor for the adversity that any individual is called to face during their existence. At first sight, certain problems would appear to be unsolvable, however, by looking from a different perspective, alternative solutions can be identified that perhaps until a moment before had not even remotely been taken into consideration. The longevity of Superliminal is rather short - in the order of 3-4 hours of gameplay, depending on how quickly you can find the correct solution to the singlesoil puzzles - but it seemed to us commensurate with the characteristics and bland rhythms that characterize the work. A longer duration would in fact have risked excessively diluting the experience to the point of making it cloying.", "date": "2019-11-20", "grade": "7.0"}
