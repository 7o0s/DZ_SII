In recent months I had welcomed the news of the transposition of Thunderhawk on PlayStation 2, now in its third chapter after an almost ten-year militancy on PC. The hope of finally being able to play a different title on consoles led me to place my trust in the hands of Core Design. Believe it or not, the creators of the game are in fact the same ones who gave life to the character of Lara Croft, an unforgettable video game (and film) heroine who for once is set aside, although I would not have minded if the Thunderhawk was piloted precisely from her :). Unfortunately Thunderhawk disappoints most of the expectations by failing in any way to achieve the goal, that of being considered a helicopter simulator. Since the introduction in computer graphics, a lack of care is perceived for the realization of the product, a sensation made even more alive by the poverty of the main menu of the game which qualitatively recalls what was seen in titles from a few years ago. As already pointed out, there are 4 campaigns available to us, divided into numerous other missions which, at least theoretically, will keep you busy for a long time. In each mission, your objective will be to destroy enemy installations, radars, vehicles and anything else that crosses your path. Where's the autopilot? The briefing phase is accompanied by a voice, fortunately in Italian, which will explain the primary objectives of the mission. Once they have been identified on the map, you will move on to the much more rewarding section of choosing weapons. The arsenal available is respectable and includes missiles of all kinds, bombs and machine guns that you can mount on the Thunderhawk by choosing them as you like. Once the actual mission begins, the first problems arise. In fact, the control of the helicopter proves to be so difficult as to be completely inadequate for the type of game. With the left analog stick you can move forward and decide the inclination of the helicopter, while with the right stick you can go up or down and choose the direction of the route. Everything would seem easy, but the opposite happens. The cumbersomeness of the control heavily conditions the carrying out of the missions, which are already difficult on their own. The Thunderhawk responds very slowly and imprecisely to commands and this will make you an easy target for enemy artillery more often than not. The latter often proves to be irrepressible, which only increases the already high degree of difficulty of the game. Let's save what can be saved Graphically things are a little better even if Thunderhawk certainly doesn't make people cry for a miracle. Despite a certain poverty of details and textures that are not always up to par, the robustness of the graphics engine is to be appreciated, which moves with remarkable ease and fluidity. The polygonal models of helicopters and ground vehicles are also discreet. Ace Combat 4 promises to reach much higher levels but waiting for its release we just have to be satisfied. The sound, on the other hand, is rather anonymous, above all due to the somewhat dull music and sound effects that are not always very spot on. Emergency landing Thunderhawk: Operation Phoenix is to be considered overall a disappointing title. It was reasonable to expect much more from Core Design and above all from a game that in the past had never disfigured as it has today. Its high difficulty can make it accessible only to lovers of the genre or to those with a massive dose of patience. The poor quality level of almost every element of the game is unjustifiable especially if we take into account the fact that in this period the PlayStation 2 is expressing its best. To be able to stand out among GTAIII, Pro Evolution Soccer, Silent Hill 2 and all the other titles released in recent weeks, it would have taken more... Pros: Best helicopter simulation for PS2.... Cons: . ..it's also the only one Inadequate control Excessive difficulty Understated technical realization War again... It's not exactly a good time for our planet. While the bombings by American forces on the last Taliban strongholds are still raging, rumors of an extension of the attacks on other countries linked in some way to Bin Laden's terrorist organization are multiplying. In such an unreassuring scenario, video production goes wildoludic of titles inspired by real or purely invented conflicts. Punctually inserts Thunderhawk: Operation Phoenix, combat helicopter simulator, which offers a vast series of missions set in some of the hottest areas of the globe: the Middle East, Africa, Eastern Europe and Alaska. The protagonists of the game are therefore not the very modern fighters that we usually admire in Ace Combat, but a helicopter, the Thunderhawk, capable of reaching targets located in inaccessible or difficult to reach places except from the lowest altitudes.", "date": "2001-11-27", "grade": null}
