The spirit of the franchise appears intact right away: the authors have practically not touched the original formula, made up of crazy accelerations, opponents always ready to give us a hard time and opposing curves that require a minimum of practice to be able to be covered at the maximum possible speed, but this time without needing to collect petrol along the way: one less thought. Gameplay: few new features Horizon Chase 2, a racing sequence in the city Let's start with the gameplay, which as mentioned is basically unchanged from the beginning of the series. We are dealing with a pure arcade racer, without any simulation ambitions, and this translates into sequences with a high rate of adrenaline, in which straight urban sections are covered very quickly but also series of curves that can be difficult, given that a possible impact with the barriers implies a forced restart and the loss of positions. Speaking of positions, in each race we will start from the back and we will have to pass nineteen opponents within three laps, trying to make the most of the trajectories and boosts available to get on the podium and thus archive the race. We will also be able to collect coins useful for unlocking the many cosmetic items in the in-game shop, from paints to bodywork to rims, so as to customize our car. In this sense, at the beginning we are asked to choose between three cars, each with different characteristics in terms of speed, acceleration, maneuverability and nitro. We will be able to obtain others by proceeding in the long campaign, even if we will hardly find ourselves in a position to change vehicles, given that in the meantime we will have used the experience points earned to purchase a series of upgrades. The touch controls are very simple, but surprisingly not customizable: there is the accelerator on the right side of the screen, while on the left two arrows allow you to steer one way or the other, and above them the boost icon. The buttons are a bit small and it happens, for example, to activate the nitro instead of acting on the steering wheel, with all that can ensue, and in general it is difficult to brush the curves or even just avoid impacts with other cars in a precise manner. By connecting a Bluetooth controller, the situation changes substantially, so as to affect the balance of difficulty: the game actually becomes easier. Structure: so much stuff! Horizon Chase 2, a night race If it is true that in terms of mechanics, the experience of Horizon Chase 2 does not revolutionize the original formula in any way, a great deal of enrichment has been done on the structure front, with a main campaign made up of over fifty races and set in the within five different scenarios: United States, Brazil, Morocco, Italy and Thailand. Then there are the Tournaments, which are unlocked by completing the various locations, and a multiplayer mode (Games Area) which allows you to challenge three other players via matchmaking. To compete with friends there is a system of private rooms with code, so practically nothing is missing. We experienced the occasional hiccups during our tests, but overall the infrastructure holds up well. Technical realization: graphics and sound to scream Horizon Chase 2, high speed in a dream scenario We then come to the technical sector of Horizon Chase 2, which obviously has changed a lot. The game moves using the powerful Unreal Engine and the differences from the first episode are very clear, but the team's ability to remain faithful to the cartoonish style of the series is surprising. Virtually every visual aspect has been supercharged, detailed and fired at 60 frames per second to deliver a sensation of blistering speed and visual variety. The downside, at least at the moment, is a general tendency to overheat the terminal after a few races, a phenomenon that we have encountered both on the iPhone 12 Pro and on the second generation iPad Pro. Playing with the controller improves the situation, given that our hands are not there to transmit heat and the device is freer to cool down, but we are talking about a defect that has an important impact on the enjoyment of the experience, given that it produces noticeable drops of fluidity. Horizon Chase 2,a run on the sand Aquiris Game Studio is aware of the situation and has reported that they will soon release an update that may address the issue. In our opinion it would be desirable to introduce graphics options to lighten the load on the GPU of older devices, rather than allowing the system to regulate everything automatically as it happens now. Finally, a few words on the soundtrack, entrusted to Barry Leicht, which we really found lively and fun. Among the many songs that accompany us during the competitions there aren't perhaps any compositions capable of getting into your head and staying there, this is true, but here too an excellent job has been done and there is a lot of personality.", "date": "2022-09-19", "grade": "8.0"}
