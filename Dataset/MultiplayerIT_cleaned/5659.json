Indeed, for the occasion it would be better to say that Agent 47 will return again and again during this 2016. With the new chapter of Hitman, the developers of IO Interactive have made a courageous choice: the typical criterion of triple A products has been abandoned , i.e. the publication in a single solution at full price, and instead a path much closer to episodic works has been traced which enhances the narrative language to the detriment of more limited interaction. The references are obviously the works of Telltale, but Life is Strange or the recent King's Quest could also be mentioned. However, we will return to these topics in more detail in our future coverage articles, also to try to understand if those who maintain that the choice of IO Interactive is the result of marketing are right, or if, on the contrary, there are sufficient motivations of an authorial nature to justify this type of approach. Within this first article we prefer instead to focus on the analysis of the cardinal principles that have always founded the foundations of this series and which, inevitably, must pass from the gameplay. Since we cannot yet unbalance ourselves on the narrative depth, we have therefore had an eye for the infiltration mechanics, consequently you will already have the opportunity to understand whether the spirit that has pervaded the series in the past is still present or not. The first episode, available at the price of 14.99 euros, brings only a prologue that serves as a tutorial, a campaign mission set in Paris and a taste of the Contracts mode. It will be a long ride, considering that the next six episodes will be released on a monthly basis and will lead our glacial protagonist to the most diverse territories, touching destinations such as Italy, Morocco, Thailand, the USA and Japan. Make yourself comfortable, let's go. Creativity and style are two essential cornerstones for Agent 47 Worldwide interventions The prologue of Hitman begins twenty years earlier than the facts narrated during the game. The incipit is sudden and without too many preambles we go straight to the point. A rookie Agent 47 has been dropped off on a landing pad in an anomalous high mountain location. Welcoming him is Diana Burnwood, who introduces him to the ICA's Support Agent program. Our favorite killer has talent to spare and, thanks to the support of his future mentor, manages to capture the attention of the top management of the agency, although the foggy past that surrounds him and a disturbing lack of morality make him a potential threat to the eyes of Director Soders. Burnwood, for her part, is confident that the man can become an asset to the services, also because there is no one else with such a crystalline talent for high-risk murders. During the extensive tutorial, two different training missions are experienced, in the course of which Diana tests the skills of her protg. The first of these assignments takes place inside a pose studio and simulates the infiltration of a yacht moored in the port of Sydney. In fact it is a demonstration level, in which it is possible to become familiar with the typical game system that outlines the Hitman stealth experience. Infiltration, disguises and the use of unconventional weapons to your advantage are just some of the key aspects that are shown during this preliminary phase. The final test of the tutorial brings back the mission that consecrated director Soders as a guru in intelligence circles, foreseeing the killing of a Soviet officer during the years of the Cold War. After successfully passing both assignments, the actual campaign begins, which takes place in the present and leads Agent 47 in the middle of one of the main social events in a luxurious historic building in Paris. This time the targets to be knocked out are the owners of a well-known high fashion firm, who however are credited as leaders of a dangerous terrorist organization identified by the acronym IAGO. Creativity and style As we had already said during our test, it doesn't take long to understand that IO Interactive wanted to keep faith with the consolidated game structure of this series, without sweetening its essence. In the wake of tradition, each assignment can have many different evolutions, going to markedly modify the implicit narrative created by the player with his own choices. The entry and exit points from the map may vary according to the decisions that are taken, while the imperative remains that of not arousing suspicions, concealing the mostpossible movements, resort to weapons only in cases of extreme necessity. Once again it is advisable to try to go completely unnoticed, for the entire duration of the operation. Judging from what we have seen so far, the work done in the first map of the campaign is undoubtedly remarkable, both for the overall level of detail and for the stature of the level design. The spaces are highly stratified and the player is given the opportunity to decide where to go and which solutions to prefer. The dynamics of the challenges provides for the completion of specific actions during the assignment and is a good way to entice the player to take up the same map several times, starting from completely different assumptions than those examined in the previous step. The alternatives are really a myriad and go to further expand the amount of variables to which we were accustomed in the past. The Glacier, IO Interactive's proprietary graphics engine, once again does an excellent job as regards the density of public environments and the number of subjects available on the screen at the same time. Moreover, many of these individuals are perfectly capable of interacting, at various levels, with what is happening around them, to the point of continuously influencing even the strategic and environmental aspects. Compared to the past, in fact, there are much more complex mechanisms both in the interaction of the non-playing characters with each other, and in the investigation activities that begin when the latter perceive anomalies. The technique of disguises has remained substantially unchanged compared to Absolution, what has changed is instead the criterion of identification, which has become even more jagged. A disguise not only allows free access to differently inhibited areas, but makes it necessary to walk at a safe distance from other members of the same category. If, for example, one decides to steal the clothes of a security officer, suspicions will not be aroused among the waiters or attendants, and this solution appears wholly consistent with the density of subjects placed within the maps and the presence of contexts of a certain vastness. Also interesting are the Opportunity Dialogues which, through the conversations of others, make it possible to recover an object capable of facilitating the task or making it even more interesting. Once the exchange has been picked up, the player has a short period of time to decide whether to seize the opportunity he has just detected, or to let it go and concentrate on another solution. Ultimately you have the freedom to shape the assignment, decide where to enter, what equipment to use, what opportunities to seize and how to kick off the job when the job is done. Hitman has remained faithful to its fundamental principles and the fact that the Instinct mode can be used without time limits - as was the case in Absolution - does not seem to have affected the game economy. At the same time, although there is no longer a broad subdivision between difficulty levels, there is a special menu in which you can decide to customize the challenge level of your game at will. It is allowed to deactivate the instinct, eliminate the most important notifications, the indication of the objectives to pursue, cancel the radar and even the warning indicators of enemies or potential threats located nearby. In essence, you have the opportunity to face the maps with a degree of difficulty similar to the Purist mode of the previous chapter. Playstation 4 trophies The first episode of Hitman offers 24 Trophies. Seven are related to the Paris mission, while the rest are related to the tutorial and Contracts mode. Licence to kill In this first episode, the Contracts mode offers the assignment Do Me I Dare You, set in the same Parisian map but focused on the elimination of two staff members present in the building. To make the assignment more complex there is also an optional killing mode which, if performed, allows you to forfeit a higher score. Then we have the so-called Escalation contracts, which are divided into five levels of increasing difficulty. In the first one we were able to try, it was necessary to eliminate a target with a pistol shot, taking care to disguise ourselves as a Soviet soldier in the second tutorial map. In the following steps, the assignment remains the same but additional activities are also added, for example you have to break into a safe and steal its contents without being identified by a living soul. To support the already set levels, there is also the possibility of creating your own cCustom contracts, thanks to which you can select a map and designate certain characters as targets at will. In this context anyone can become a target and, given the amount of subjects available within a single level, the solutions leave ample room for imagination. There are also two criteria for approaching an assignment: the first is the Skill Contract, which requires the execution of impeccable kills, without any collateral damage and without ever causing suspicion from the people present on the spot. The second is instead the so-called Creativity Contract, thanks to which it is possible to kill by exploiting accidents which, although at first glance they seem fortuitous, were actually devilishly planned. Encouraging aspects also come from the technical side. Compared to what was highlighted during the beta test, we did not find the presence of bugs or heavy slowdowns in the frame rate, although the test took place on consoles. In this case it was also possible to decide to lock the frequency at 30 frames per second, or to leave it unlocked to reach up to 60 variable frames per second. Moreover, with the unlocked frame rate, there were slight fluctuations in fluidity, which however did not compromise fruition in any way. Obviously we reserve the right to evaluate these details more carefully in our future articles.", "date": "2016-03-10", "grade": "8.0"}
