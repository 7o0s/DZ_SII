Attack on Titan, Evangelion and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure are just some of the franchises that have landed on smartphones and tablets, but with a few exceptions, the vast majority of these games remain confined to Japanese territory and are not localized in a comprehensible language. One Piece: Treasure Cruise, on the other hand, represents a lucky white fly, because in addition to being entirely translated into English, it honors the popular manga by Eiichiro Oda with a simple but fun RPG, designed exclusively for mobile platforms. The adventures of Luffy and his companions have landed on iOS and Android with One Piece: Treasure Cruise crew! Just one touch! Although it will especially interest the most ardent fans of the adventures of Luffy and his crew, Treasure Cruise is easily accessible even to those who have not even read the first page of Oda's manga. In fact, the story follows the first part of the work, with a short tutorial that tells of the birth of the Straw Hat, of the elastic powers obtained thanks to the Gom Gom fruit and of the promise made to Captain Shanks: to become the king of the pirates. During this full-bodied introduction starring a seven-year-old Luffy, the few and simple rules underlying the fights between pirates, the real fulcrum of the game, are explained step by step. One Piece: Treasure Cruise is in fact a succession of clashes along the lines of Brave Frontier, in which you can launch an attack by simply touching the icon corresponding to your character. Starting from this very basic idea, however, the developers have made everything more interesting thanks to a series of variables. In fact, combos can be chained by tapping the icons of other characters with the right timing, a special technique can be performed after a certain number of rounds, while a rock-paper-scissors weakness system adds a pinch of strategy. At each turn, the type of attack linked to each of the characters changes, and so you have to use the most effective one against the opponent in front of you. In some cases, you find yourself choosing whether to perform a devastating blow or use the turn to use healing items and power-ups, but it's essential to decide quickly if you don't want to waste a turn. However, the role-playing component of Treasure Cruise is not limited to just collecting experience points and simply leveling up. As in Terra Battle, characters can be unlocked and collected, added to the party or sacrificed for bonuses. In this way you can improve the pirates in your possession or evolve them into more powerful variants (and often characterized by a ~cooler~ artwork). Once you have practiced all the menus and mechanics, the player stops simply following the story and focuses on building his team, growing his members and upgrading his galleon. However, many of these activities are linked to the inevitable stamina system typical of free-to-play games. This means that after a handful of fights you have to wait a certain period of time or put your credit card in hand, but it has very rarely happened to us to run out of money or have to wait for long periods. More annoying were the numerous and intrusive uploads due to the need to stay connected online while playing, a compromise that is acceptable while on WiFi, but becomes almost exhausting if you play on the go. In closing, one cannot fail to mention the excellent aesthetic work: from the interface to the character sprites, passing through the backdrops, the intermission dialogues and the sound effects, Bandai Namco's game is absolutely capable of delighting fans of One piece.", "date": "2015-02-18", "grade": "8.0"}
