We will soon become responsible for everything, having to juggle training, the transfer market and game tactics, without however neglecting the media and the entire information department. One of the additions compared to the previous episode is related to the press conferences, in which we will be tormented by journalists and we will have the task of giving the correct answers, in order not to weaken the morale of the players and fans. What struck us from the beginning is the depth of the title developed by Dinamo Games, but at the same time its simplicity. Footballers now distinguish themselves through eight individual skills including heading, shooting, stamina, technique and passing the ball. There are also customized levels of training, personality and morale, so we will have to be careful observers of every single aspect of our roster of champions. The transfer market is also the master in this episode, obviously we will be able to put our players up for sale and choose others to buy, whether they are young promises or established stars. Draft research can be refined by position, age, skill and cost, in order to make us ~buy~ the best without wasting too much time. Not only players from the English league are present but also the best exponents of world football, Eto, Raul and Fernando Torres are just some examples. From a tactical point of view, we will have many strategies to choose from, including the ~historic~ ones that made Manchester City win in 1999 or Arsenal in 2004. The matches are text only and the accurate descriptions (unfortunately the whole game is only in English) allow us to make the right choices both in terms of substitutions and team attitude. In addition to the Premier League we will face the Champions League, the League Cup and the FA Cup. What the developers have certainly managed perfectly is the interface, so accurate and immediate as to make the game very simple to manage. Technically there is little to say, the almost exclusively textual screens are clear and offer a lot of information. PRO Simple interface Very deep AGAINST Only the Premier League In English", "date": "2007-09-13", "grade": "S.V."}
