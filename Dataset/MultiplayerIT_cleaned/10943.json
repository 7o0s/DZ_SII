{"name": "Everquest II: The Shadow Odyssey - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/everquest-ii-the-shadow-odyssey-recensione.html", "text": "With just over four years of history behind it, Everquest II still represents one of the best online experiences available on the market today, a mixture of elements capable of making it a good commercial success - World of Warcraft cannot be taken as a comparison - and capable of laying the foundations for five expansions and three add-ons dedicated exclusively to the introduction of new adventures. This immense amount of content has been packaged and then inserted into The Shadow Odyssey, which not only revises and re-proposes the old but also adds many new features representing in turn an impressive container of dozens of hours of entertainment. Whether it's the swan song, a gift or an attempt to round up some new users, what has been possible to play is one of the most succulent packages of recent times. The Shadow Odyssey The titanic enterprise of summarizing years of development and releases is not the objective of this article which instead prefers to focus on the contents introduced exclusively by the latest expansion, the one that drives this latest arrival in stores. Putting aside the idea of further increasing the maximum reachable level, the developers focused on the creation of Ether, a new region with very generous dimensions and in turn divided into about twenty main areas, enough to put all the explorers back on the road and consistently lengthen the end-game, being practically all the areas introduced designed for players who have reached a level between 50 and 80 and full of decidedly tough enemies. The big difference compared to some of the previous releases was a greater attention paid to the creation of missions, dungeons and adventures for groups and not for the single player, so as to lighten the solo-game drift now a bit too marked and allowing to the level designers to let their imagination run wild: the new instances are well designed and thanks to a light but ingenious more exploratory component, complete with small puzzles, they are exciting and stand out from the too often experimented process with only hordes of opponents to be killed by mind almost turned off or without any kind of boost other than the loot left on the ground. The most solitary will still be able to count on a hundred unpublished quests and for the most part that can be tackled without help or with adventurers met for the occasion, without too many whims or excessive preparation. Then there are a whole series of minor improvements but equally worthy of attention and care for detail: the balance has been revised to make a class like the Shadowknight attractive again and to restore luster, in general, to all those based on magic, while they are Some tools have been added to improve the management of guilds and groups. Also curated the story that asks you to retrace the deeds of the Ethernauts, legendary adventurers capable of building a flying ship with which to reach mysterious and mythical areas; a long and articulated plot, not innovative or a starting point for possible literary masterpieces but still enough to be credible and at times involve. Flying ships and change of style The medieval fantasy that has always been the trademark of Everquest II has been partially set aside in favor of a greater variety, a set of architectural elements already seen elsewhere but here elaborated in a rather interesting way: the introduction of flying ships is accompanied from steampunk-style structures, which, however, are flanked by very different areas, from the mountainous ones with lots of yeti-like up to castles and dungeons infested with werewolves and vampires. Many ideas and suggestions, all treated with the usual care and attention to include huge structures as well as tiny details. From a purely technical point of view, the years pass for everyone and in the presence of a genre traditionally not the bearer of graphic innovations, they seem to flow even more rapidly: the polygonal mass and the animations are always decent but almost never stand out, as well as still equal to itself enlightenment appears, not stratospheric; instead, the effects and some details such as the interaction with water have been improved. The work on the sound is good, combining a fair sampling of the effects, varied and always credible, with an excellent set of music capable of involving and adapting both to the environments and to the situations. The offer of this sumptuous package concludes with a special bear that can be used as a pet for one's alter ego and the client, including deck, of Legends of Norrath, the online collectible card game based on the world of Everquest. An addition that is not essential and for many superfluous, but still deworth a look and maybe a quick test, just to get an idea. Comment Everquest II: The Shadow Odyssey is a valid and content-rich expansion, which does not impose endless hours of grinding to reach the new maximum level but focuses on putting on the plate a series of beautiful adventures for the closest and best organized groups. plus a host of improvements and additions for everyone to enjoy. Having included the base game and all the previous additions at a price of around thirty euros, then, makes it the best opportunity to begin to approach this fascinating MMORPG which after so many years is still one of the best available on the market.
