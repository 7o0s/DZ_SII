{"name": "Cyber Shadow", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/cyber-shadow-recensione.html", "text": "That of the ninja is a timeless charm: whether we are talking about the video game of the same name dated 1986 and published on the Amiga (but not only), or the subsequent Shinobi developed by Sega (1987), or even the Ninja Gaiden series, by Shinobido and many others, many others, this figure has always had a rather prominent role in the gaming world. In some cases it has been inserted into a more dystopian panorama, tending towards the futuristic, towards cyberpunk, as Ghostrunner and Cyber Shadow himself have shown, which we are going to review in this article. The first work of the Finnish independent studio Mechanical Head Studios it is only partially retro, in that eternal 8-bit aesthetic that still today transmits the charm of its time, while on the other side of the scale it places a gameplay in continuous evolution and distinguished by a dynamism difficult to find in classic experiences. However, he succeeds up to the last few bars, then stumbling in a final sprint devoted to unmotivated difficulty where, instead of best amalgamating the skills obtained step by step, the developers throw an artificial challenge level into the cauldron in its sudden surge; almost as if to confirm, for the worse, the myth according to which the games and in particular the platformers of the 80s and 90s were of a frustrating complexity. The same, so to speak, which would lead you to leaf through a calendar or two, when in reality it is not: complex and unreasonably difficult are two concepts at the antipodes and this last one in particular, in the last decade or so (you want for the influence of Dark Souls), has also weighed on some productions that try to speak in the past tense. The Cyber Shadow review talks about a title that slips along this slope just when you are convinced that you have in your hands an excellent reference to the ninjas that were, nullifying the construction of the experience put into play up to a second earlier. Story of a renegade hero Cyber Shadow stages a common plot in its key points but quite cryptic in explaining itself to the player, through occasional flashbacks, notes and even thoughts of the characters before dying, also adding a pinch of righteous ignorance - the one for which in a completely technological world there is a mystical dragon capable of granting us extraordinary powers. That's perfectly fine for a game that, through the usual struggle of the mysterious and renegade protagonist against the despot of the moment, blends together technology, spiritualism, animism, love, honor and so on and so forth. An interweaving of the narrative pillars of stories about ninjas and cyberpunk that forms the backdrop to the real purpose of the developers: action. Pad in hand and eyes on the screen, the sensations offered by Cyber Shadow are contrasting right from the start: to accompany the appreciable crescendo of our cybernetic hero, who at the beginning only has the possibility of jumping and slashing with his katana but in the end deflecting bullets and doing somersaults in the air like the best self-respecting ninja, is joined by a not always inspired level design and, indeed, often enslaved to that frustration we have mentioned. As a platformer in itself it is never really challenging but chooses to hinder us through somewhat cost-saving solutions, made of deadly spikes into which it is easy to fall even after being hit by insignificant enemies: nothing is really enough for Shadow to be thrown all over the place. 'back, balancing the little damage received (from one to two, if you don't count the occasional increased damage from the bosses) with the promise of a fall and consequent recovery from the last checkpoint. However, the latter, as the adventure progresses, are distributed in an increasingly questionable way due to the artificial difficulty of the game, thus leading to moments in which any deity should pretend to be deaf. It doesn't help the frequency with which enemies off the screen, and therefore unpredictable, suddenly rush at us, lengthening the list of elements that could lead us to too premature a demise. The problem lies above all when this artificiality is considered the norm from just over mid-game to the end, increasing the situations in which it is possible to get killed in one shot and, at the same time, inserting the aforementioned checkpoints in a questionable way. Despite everything, however, at the cost of throwing the pad around the room, the situation remains within manageable limits thanks to an excellently managed pace, precise command response and constant learning of new skills without too many excesses - which in clashes with the bosses give their maximum. This up to the seventh level, when Shadow becomes the epitome of the ninja par excellence, the chosen one if you want: from the eighth chapter onwards the rthe game's rhythm breaks under the pressure of an incredibly confusing level design, aimed at a useless search for complexity when it should have been the maximum peak of its expressiveness, now that the protagonist is at the full power of his powers and beyond. Instead it even seems to lose the compass of its genre to which it belongs and it is sad to see a qualitatively excellent product slip right on the finish, at the moment in which it should have given its best. We can turn a blind eye to a somewhat diluted distribution of skills, some poorly explained in their execution nor too useful outside of boss fights, but the artificial difficulty is precisely the aspect that pushes Cyber Shadow back and prevents him from shining as much as he could have. Even in the face of a very detailed aesthetic and a more than worthy soundtrack. A stumbling block that doesn't ruin it as a production in itself but makes it dirty.", "date": "2021-02-02", "grade": "7.2"}
