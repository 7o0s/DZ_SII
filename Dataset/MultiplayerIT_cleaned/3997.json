In general, these are small reductions that tend to greatly simplify the complex layered mechanics of this genre of games, but sometimes there are exceptions in products that manage to reproduce the depth and facet typical of these titles on PC while remaining deeply related to the mobile world, in terms of pace of play and control system. Rise of Civilizations, beyond the title that plays a lot as an invasive advertising banner, fortunately falls into these cases, presenting itself as an excellent exponent of the Meierian-derived strategy reduced to a small size. It is a question of choosing one of the eight civilizations present (including Rome, Japan, Germany, France, China and others) and bringing it to glory within a shared and persistent online map. The basic mechanics provide the usual mix of city builder-style elements, managerial and strategic with the need to build, expand and strengthen your own fortified city but with intense activity even outside the walls. The map around the capital is huge, of a truly impressive scale and leads to a series of constant interactions with the outside world, populated by other online players among others. It is difficult to carry out a totally solitary game experience because relations with the other fortified cities soon become an important part of the occupations to be followed within the various management mechanics: remaining only to the actions outside the walls it is possible to send explorers , collect resources, fight against barbarians and other potential invaders living in outer spaces and get in touch with other cities and other players, taking part in skirmishes or forming alliances of various sizes that can lead to considerable advantages and commitments, in an intense activity diplomatic. Inside and outside the walls Inside the walls, Rise of Civilizations takes place in a more traditional way: there is the need to build the various structures that allow the production and processing of resources, in addition to the inevitable barracks for the formation of the army, which always proves to be a fundamental tool for the affirmation in the world, with all due respect to potential diplomatic intentions. From this point of view, the game follows the typical mechanics of Civilization and other similar titles, with a constant progression in the complexity of the city-state in terms of both the amount of buildings that can be built inside it, with the advancement of resources and of wealth, both in terms of their complexity and effectiveness, with the possibility of increasing their level to increase their income. Being a free-to-play game, it is above all in the construction and upgrading of buildings that the classic mechanics of this form of business emerge: each action requires a certain waiting time which can be compressed using special tickets, which they can be conquered by playing but can above all be purchased by spending the in-game currency represented by gems, which can obviously also be purchased with real money. The balance of this aspect is a fundamental element for judging the value of the entire title, and it must be said that Rise of Civilizations is doing very well on this front. This is not so much due to the ease with which the gems or tickets are conquered but rather due to the fact that the stratified structure of the game allows you to deceive expectations by applying yourself to a large amount of collateral activities, therefore it is difficult to run into real dead times. More suspicious, from this point of view, is instead the management of the prize boxes, these too well present in the mechanics of the game, which evidently do not want to miss anything with regard to the new monetization methods. Progressing in the game we have the possibility of opening various chests containing new heroes or upgrades and the keys for opening the chests can largely rely on micro-transactions, moreover with the usual random element (of chance?) that this system involves . The army management system is also particularly deep, which is based on the use of heroes (inspired by real historical figures) as captains for the various squadrons. In addition to the classic evolutions of the individual types of combat units, the heroes are the protagonists of a rather complex specific evolution, each with its own skill tree and abilities to activate, making deep aalso the military aspect, with the need to entrust different captains to the various teams.", "date": "2018-10-22", "grade": "7.8"}
