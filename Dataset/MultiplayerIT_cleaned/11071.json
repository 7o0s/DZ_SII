{"name": "Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/command-amp-conquer-red-alert-3-recensione.html", "text": "Same old soup Despite the B-Movie storyline that is typical of the series, Red Alert 3 is a classic strategy game, having its roots in EA's previous title, Command & Conquer 3. Rooted in we don't mean that the game is limited to resume the same, identical gameplay, but also the user interface and, more generally, you will always have the feeling of being in front of a well-packaged total conversion. The game follows the most classic canons of the genre, born twelve years ago: you will start with a small military base, you will have to accumulate as many resources as possible, expand the base, build an army bigger than the enemy (don't fool yourself, at least here size matters) and crush him, possibly before he does the same to you. Bluntly, Red Alert 3 is all about it, nothing more, nothing less. A strategy game therefore, absolutely old school, with a series of missions that you will have to face, with the usual series of films shot in a discreet combination of computer graphics and real-life actors who will entertain you between one rush and another. with boredom that is only driven away by the curiosity to unlock, in each mission, ever more powerful means to exterminate your opponent in an ever more spectacular way, up to the last missions at the end of the campaign with the whole arsenal complete. bluntly, Red Alert 3 is all about it, nothing more, nothing less Same old soup Don't expect any variation on the theme: the objectives of the missions can be of two types, namely either destroy something, or protect it until the time runs out from the continuous assaults of the enemy: the recipe, it must be admitted, works for the initial missions of the first campaign, but any player will find it very difficult to finish all three proposed campaigns (Russians, Allies and Empire of the Rising Sun) without ever pulling a yawn of boredom, despite the presence of as interesting as unglued young ladies. Never again alone The first impact you'll have with the game won't be bad at all: an exhaustive tutorial that will refresh your memory if you've never touched a real-time strategy game, a sometimes spectacular graphics engine, especially as regards the rendering of water and explosions, good design of the different units and lots and lots of action. Regardless of the campaign you choose, the game will develop in an absolutely linear way: complete objectives, get rewards, finish the mission and move on to the next one, so for about 25 missions for all three available factions. As tradition dictates, and we all know how heavily EA is tied to traditions, each mission start will be presented to you by a movie made with real actors (some even well-known, such as Jenny McCarthy, Tim Curry and Randy Couture) and a lot of sound computer graphics: the quality of the acting, however, seemed to us decidedly lower than the aforementioned Command & Conquer 3, perhaps even due to a not particularly convincing Italian dubbing. After the short film, you will be presented with a summary briefing of the mission and here Red Alert shows its first little novelty: any game of the campaign must be played in tandem with another commander, be it virtual (guided by artificial intelligence) or human, via the Internet. In case you decide to opt for the single-player mode, in each mission you will be joined by a co-commander in the field who, essentially, will carry out the same, identical actions as you: he will collect resources, build his base and develop armies. If you can interact with a human player via chat or VoIP, with your faithful virtual ally you will have four essential orders available: the movement order (reach this position), the attack order (attack everything you find in this area), the aggressive movement order (reach this area and mangle everything you find), and finally the self-management order (just do whatever you want). The intention of the developers, probably, was to allow the user to make use of a second independent army in order to plan coordinated attacks and thus enrich the game mechanics: although the AI is able to manage the orders given fairly well, well you will soon realize the futility of this system and you will use your ally's resources as simple cannon fodder, waiting for you to finish amassing troops for the decisive attack. The positives However Red Alert 3 saves itself from rejection, perhaps because of the excellent graphics, which will give you real chivisual cues, maybe you want for that irony that has always permeated the series and that you will also find in this third chapter or maybe it will simply be the recourse to the law that now dominates Italian television, that is to say showing a few rather compliant young ladies, but well-necked, tight-fitting clothes. You will also find the alternative attacks, one for each unit in the game, which occasionally offer you the possibility of inflicting more damage or increasing the resistance of the vehicle itself: it is an interesting trick that enriches the gameplay, but penalized by the bad intelligence artificial of your units. We need to make a small clarification: we are not referring to the artificial intelligence of your enemies, whose only strong point consists in starting with a greater number of credits, units and buildings built, but rather to the lack of acumen that your own men show : more than once you will see a group of units under attack while the units in the immediate vicinity do not intervene or, even worse, see them as paralyzed after destroying the single target you indicated, while they are slowly being slaughtered one by one. Since your resources are limited (yes, the mines run out), perhaps it could annoy you to lose a rather expensive unit due to a programming error ...

The answer, in this case, is not exactly simple: Red Alert 3 is an extremely classic and linear strategy game, with some flaws that penalize its playability and total repetitiveness; elements that will lead many players to boredom and the consequent abandonment of the title at the beginning of the second campaign, when you will have to start all over again a second time. On the other hand you will find beautiful graphics, interesting and ironic films even if very self-serving and lots and lots of action, in the form of explosions, massing of troops and massacres with rather improbable weapons. especially of the actresses) Finally an entirely cooperative strategy Against artificial intelligence to the minimum terms Only two types of missions The gameplay remained anchored to the past Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3 is available for PC and will be available for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
