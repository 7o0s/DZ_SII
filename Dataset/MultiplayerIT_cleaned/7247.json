{"name": "Missione impossibile", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/129553-metal-gear-solid-v-ground-zeroes-missione-impossibile.html", "text": "Metal Gear Solid V is probably one of the most ambitious projects Hideo Kojima has ever worked on. And this not only for the convergence in the project of all those ideas that the brilliant Japanese artist has given birth to and refined over the years, for the innovative gameplay for the series and for the enormity of the adventure that will make up the work, but also for the structure itself of the latter, which is divided into two portions entitled respectively Ground Zeroes and The Phantom Pain. This choice seems to have been determined by the desire to get fans used to the new mechanics of the game, but also by the need, we add, to collect money with a clever commercial maneuver. In any case, the decision of Kojima Productions and Konami ended up splitting the public in two, divided between those who immediately showed themselves willing to accept the formula in order to have a taste of the new episode of the series, and those who would have preferred to wait longer to be able to get your hands on the title in its entirety. This at least until there was talk of prices, but we will talk about this topic in due course. For now let's focus on what is the prologue of Metal Gear Solid V, namely Ground Zeroes. The title puts players in the shoes of Big Boss and takes them to the distant 1975. The mercenary group Militaires Sans Frontires got the ability to handle atomic weapons, which threw the world into panic. In conjunction with an International Atomic Energy Agency nuclear inspection of Mother Base, Snake learns that Paz, the spy we saw in Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker is alive, and is being held captive by Cipher in a US naval base near Cuba. Inside the area there is in fact a prison facility, Camp Omega, which according to information in the possession of MSF intelligence would operate outside the controls of international law. Even Chico who had tried to save the girl he is in love with was also captured. Fearing that the two could reveal valuable information about his organization, and at the same time determined to appropriate Paz's knowledge on Cipher, Big Boss decides to embark on a solo mission to try to recover both young people. From this incipit starts a story that deals with more mature topics than in the past, addressing controversial issues such as that of child soldiers, racism and physical and psychological torture of prisoners of war. Topics that together with the final events of this prologue will end up marking the personality of the protagonist, and that will probably be better explored in The Phantom Pain. Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes is a technically flawless adventure, but unfortunately short Playstation 3 trophies Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes offers fifteen trophies including 13 bronze, 1 silver and 1 gold. To get them you have to fulfill some requests of the game, such as recovering all the boxes or collecting the patches of the XOF unit, freeing and rescuing the prisoners, etc., until you reach the gold trophy that you get only after completing all main and side missions with the highest score possible. The night as an ally The story develops in a direct way, told with that typically cinematic cut to which the series has always accustomed us, without however going beyond those excesses that had characterized Metal Gear Solid 4 in terms of films. Here, in short, when we are, the sequences are short and well integrated with the context, in such a way as to keep the game element preponderant over everything else. The main adventure consists of a short campaign set inside the prison camp, at night and in pouring rain, with a series of optional objectives to be achieved (for example, in the base there are various prisoners who can be brought to safety in addition to Chico and Paz) and other side elements related to the achievement of trophies or the collection of particular objects. Then there are five secondary missions with dissimilar mechanics, placed at different times of the day to give a taste, in a different form, of what will be one of the announced features of The Phantom Pain, namely the day and night cycle. These extra missions are only available after completing the game once, and among them, in addition to the one called Dj Vu, for example, for details of which we refer you to the appropriate box below, there is one that is particularly crazy with a decidedly surprise ending, in line with Hideo Kojima's sometimes crazy and fun style. However, the total duration of the main quest is dabout two hours at the normal difficulty level, counting a handful of premature deaths resulting from being discovered and restarts from the related checkpoints, plus the collection of some collectibles. A little more by setting the game options in hard mode and finishing some secondary objectives. Adding up the other missions present after the credits, you can get to just over double the hours. Three or five total hours are certainly few for a video game, but according to the developers, the nature of the product must be taken into account, which is to all intents and purposes the prologue of a project which in its entirety should then be enormous, and which serves as a tutorial for get users used to its gameplay and new open world structure. In this sense it is necessary to highlight how more options in the exploration phases, new skills for the protagonist and ~open world~ do not mean the abandonment of the old mechanics of the series, nor be an incentive to carry out carnage, but simply make available of the player a greater number of possibilities to evade the surveillance of the enemies or to get to the bottom of any situation. Extra content Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes is accompanied by an exclusive downloadable double pack, the contents of which vary according to the consoles. On those of Sony, in fact, a DLC is available with an extra mission called Dj Vu, which allows users to relive the emotions of the famous session in Shadow Moses of the first Metal Gear Solid in the role of Solid Snake. The polygonal models are the same as in 1998, but the lighting system and some music change. On the two Microsoft Xboxes as additional content there is instead Jamais Vu, a mission that instead sees Raiden as the protagonist in a scenario with sci-fi themes. The task of the cyborg ninja, in fact, is to locate and eliminate entities called Body-Snatcher who have taken possession, replicating them, of the bodies of dozens and dozens of soldiers inside the field. The general approach is therefore free, but gameplay tends to reward strategy, the ability to act in the shadows rather than the assault with a white weapon which would more easily lead to premature death, encouraging the user to make the most of better the skills of Big Boss. Ground Zeroes is a different Snake than the one seen in the past, and we're not just talking about personality: seeing him at work, one has the clear sensation of controlling a reactive soldier, super trained for any type of battle, as never before. He is able to run low, crawl on the ground quickly, hang on to ledges and hide behind cover, disarm and kill a sentry in seconds, leave no trace behind him, and drive vehicles. He can also count on a respectable armory: generally the hero can carry up to two primary weapons, one secondary and four support weapons. Once these numbers are exceeded, to take new ones he must leave one on the ground. Initially, his equipment includes an assault rifle, a tranquilizer pistol, grenades and a night vision device, all quickly selectable using the d-pad, but he can pick up more and more powerful ones as he explores Camp Omega. Which can be extremely useful when things get so complicated that a shooting becomes inevitable. In these situations, the action takes place according to the trappings of the main third-person shooters, with the enemies performing particularly effective and intelligent guerrilla warfare, with a certain tendency to move from cover and lean out of it to help their companions in movement. If hit by bullets Big Boss can regenerate his health automatically, a bit like in Call of Duty, except when he is seriously injured: in which case he must resort to a special miracle spray. However, the prison camp is large enough and full of useful elements for camouflage to allow you to avoid most of the guards, taking advantage of the aids that come from the headset and the binoculars, which serve to visually mark the soldiers on guard posts and on patrol simply by framing them for a few seconds. Furthermore, while observing targets it is sometimes possible to request support information via radio, but only when a special icon appears on the screen to make a call to the base. By pressing a button on the pad you can also access the software which allows you to view, among other things, the mission objectives (and any photos of people to recover) and the map, as well as the option to call the helicopter to bring away the released prisoners. Here isThe iDroid comes into play, a new technological gadget that is very useful for always having everything at hand, including the radar, and which even allows you to listen to the cassettes that can be found around Camp Omega, useful for finding out more details about story and missions. Through a companion app it is also possible to use tablets, smartphones or iPhones as a second screen, to have the sensation of physically owning the iDroid and to have access to various functions related to the console on which you play, such as for example that of capturing screenshots of game, check and share your records or develop and manage the Mother Base, according to a system similar to the one used in Peace Walker. Born to fight Returning to the gameplay topic, acting stealthily Snake can eliminate the sentries through extremely dynamic Close Quarter Combats, which depending on a series of variations, such as for example the position of the enemy or the protagonist at the time of the encounter, can determine different situations, thanks to the single or combined use of back buttons and analog stick. By surprising a soldier from the front, he can then be disarmed by stealing his weapon, which can then be used to threaten him, strike with a barrage of punches and kicks until he falls to the ground or throw him upside down with a karate move. By sneaking him up behind him, however, it is possible to immobilize him and, using the right stick to select the interrogation commands, discover the exact location of an object to be recovered or an alternative passage in which to sneak. Otherwise it can be strangled, stunned or stabbed. If a guard notices the presence of Big Boss instead, the player can try to stop him before he reacts in some way by exploiting another new feature introduced in this chapter, namely the Reflex function. This, which can however be deactivated from the options, generates for a certain amount of time and after pressing the L2 key on the controller a sort of slow motion which gives Snake a few seconds of advantage to carry out an immediate execution, thus preventing the victim from giving the alarm. Otherwise the enemy will alert his comrades, shooting at the opponent, shouting or calling for help by radio. And even if the sentry were to be eliminated and his body concealed, his fellow soldiers will still arrive on the spot and scour the area in search of the missing colleague. And it is precisely in these phases that Ground Zeroes perhaps gives its best in terms of identification: hidden in the shadows, holding your breath, with the increasingly intense rain that seems to penetrate straight into your bones, even annoying the soldiers who patrol the area while trying to illuminate the perimeter in search of that intruder who killed their fellow soldier, the feeling of being in a real war zone is returned to the user in a very believable way. Thanks to the good behavioral routines of the enemies, who perhaps sin only in the lack of reaction to certain noises, but also to a respectable technical and artistic system. On PlayStation 3, the title is in fact absolutely impactful thanks to top-level character models and animations, and an obsessive attention to detail. Big Boss is drawn in a superlative way and in general the FOX Engine does its duty, positively, on all the polygonal models of the characters. However, the quality of the game reaches its peak in the rendering of the environments, thanks to painstaking work on the composition of the map, on the lights of the headlights and on the sophisticated generation of shadows, on the particle elements and more generally on the visual horizon, which often leaves open-mouthed in some glimpses. From the explosions to the resulting smoke, from the debris that invades the surrounding air to the grass that moves following the shock wave, every single element of the contour mixes with the physics to restore great credibility to the war zone where we find ourselves carrying out our actions. The frame rate is excellent, which is particularly stable at 720p and 30 frames per second (for information relating to the next gen editions, we refer you to the relative box), and the movies and cutscenes, which as previously mentioned are never invasive , and are well shot as well as masterfully integrated into each part played. Ground Zeroes is fully dubbed in English with good acting, enhanced by the presence of Kiefer Sutherland as the voice of Snake. In terms of audio effects, typically surrounding sounds can be appreciated, such as the noise of pouring rain, that of helicopters and vehicles patrolling the base, the movements of the guards and more", "date": "2014-03-18", "grade": "8.0"}
