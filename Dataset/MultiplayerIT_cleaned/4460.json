Trapping him inside a cosmic level prison, a kind of dimensional path between tiny planets, guarded by ten powerful guardians. In Furi we will take on the role of this mysterious creature with features similar to those of a galactic samurai, with long white curly hair: freed from the chains that blocked us, we will follow the voice of a strange guy dressed as a rabbit, who will accompany us to the inside the levels talking about escape, revenge and other anything but abstract concepts. The game structure consists of a sequence of boss fights, interspersed with ~narrative~ sections full of atmosphere, in which the protagonist walks through the scenarios at a slow pace (if desired, automatically: just press the B button on the controller) and listen in strict silence what his curious sidekick has to say. Once we arrive in the presence of a guardian, however, we will have to roll up our sleeves and try to defeat him by completing various stages and alternating twin stick shooter-style gameplay with a hack'n'slash made of precision and timeliness, in both cases following the canons of a hardcore approach. A new champion Furi's aesthetic is certainly very peculiar, it is no coincidence that the character design of the game is signed by Takashi Okazaki, author of Afro Samurai. The protagonist himself looks like a cross between a space samurai and a Nordic thunder god, ready at any moment to unleash a very powerful electrified katana or to hold a ray gun that also allows you to emit devastating charged shots. Even the world created by the developers is suggestive and varied: each of the small planets that we will have to cross to regain freedom boasts its own personality, as well as the guardians who guard them. Not all appear equally successful from an aesthetic point of view, but there are undoubtedly some prominent figures; as the first boss we're going to face, which will be a test bed for learning the gameplay mechanics. We are talking about The Chain, a monstrous armored warrior with three different faces inspired by the Oni, the Japanese demons: each mask has its own personality and changes the modus operandi of the boss, thus dividing the fight into three distinct phases. The same setting applies to all opponents: first we will have to fight them in a shooter context, opening fire with our gun and avoiding their varied attacks by moving or using the quick shot (activated via the back button L), the latter however equipped of a particular timing, which must be assimilated in order to be exploited properly. As soon as we have emptied one of the enemy's energy bars, we will be able to approach and start a duel at short distance, in which not only the aforementioned shot will count, but also and above all the precision parry: if we manage to score it , we will be able to sink a series of blows and inflict serious damage on the guardian on duty. Bulwark of civilization In its being so essential, the narrative element of Furi is all too effective. We find ourselves controlling this mysterious cosmic warrior, nourishing the legitimate desire to free ourselves from captivity, but the enemies we face gradually reveal a human nature, feelings, concrete reasons to fight us. This is the case of The Hand, the knight who led the army that subjugated us, who knows how long ago, and who fights to defend his son and all of humanity; or of The Strap, an uncontrollable fighter, who has been locked up just like the Stranger, whose violent aggression acts as an obstacle in our path; or even The Edge, a samurai exactly like us, but who doesn't seem to despise what we represent. The plot is obviously revealed as we proceed towards the last gate, and at that point we will be able to decide what to do, opting for different conclusions. In the meantime, we will be accompanied not only by the words of the man in the rabbit mask, but also by a prestigious soundtrack signed by Carpenter Brut, who brings out the best in the electronic genre and remains in the lead with some songs even after the campaign is completed . By the way: the selection of the difficulty level allows the less experienced to be able to reach the end without excessive effort, but in that case it will not be possible to unlock a couple of interesting extra modes, which enrich the global offer of this production. In fact, lowering the challenge would make little sense and would end up diminishing the value of an experience which in itself cannot boast who knows how long, and which finds depth andsubstance in the need to confront the various bosses, learn their attack patterns, study the right countermeasures, try and try again to defeat them and finally succeed in the enterprise, advancing towards the next duel. The Nintendo Switch version of Furi adopts a control system very similar to that seen on other platforms, with reactive and precise commands as needed, both in portable and docked mode. The game includes the gameplay improvements that the developers have released over the months, but no features that actually take advantage of the peculiarities of the console and its Joy-Con. For example, it is not possible to swing by simply waving the controllers. Unfortunately there are cases in which there are quite evident slowdowns, both on the move and connected to the TV, especially during the ~shooting~ phases of the boss fights, when the view is therefore more distant and there are large portions of interactive scenarios to show on the screen. screen: hopefully this will be fixed quickly with an update.", "date": "2018-01-19", "grade": "8.0"}
