{"name": "Siege Survival: Gloria Victis", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/siege-survival-gloria-victis-recensione.html", "text": "From a rib of Gloria Victis, the 2016 MMORPG developed by Black Eye Games and set in a low-fantasy medieval open world, the same authors, supported this time by Fish Tank Studio, offer us another insight into that war: the one fought by civilians , in their support of the armed forces as they try to push back the enemy. Siege Survival: Gloria Victis is a management game that puts the spotlight on those protagonists that conflicts often leave behind. Precisely, ordinary people. An idea already touched upon by the beautiful This War of Mine, which in its reconstruction of the siege of Sarajevo has been able to touch the player in depth, putting him in a situation where the right choices in the end do not really exist. Because something will inevitably go wrong sooner or later. The narrative universe of Gloria Victis is therefore enriched with this immersive experience, a little less impactful than the 11 bit studios game but absolutely punishing if you face it without the necessary conviction. We therefore tell you what it was like to resist the very long days of siege in the review of Siege Survival: Gloria Victis. Under siege After the enemy forces, attributable to Viking raiders and therefore contextualizing the game in a hypothetical period between the eighth and tenth centuries, stormed the city, raiding and killing anyone they found in their path, the remaining defenders retreated beyond the ramparts of the castle and from there they will have to put up resistance until reinforcements arrive - if they ever arrive. We won't tell you how many days the campaign lasts, so as not to spoil the surprise and leave you in our own anguish, but know that each one has proved incredibly suffered: this highlights the difficulty of Siege Survival: Gloria Victis, which does not prove the choice best for those who have never approached the genre. Characterized by the isometric view and the point and click controls typical of a strategic game, the game, as we anticipated, almost completely puts aside the military component in favor of the efforts of those civilians without whom the remains of the army would not have lasted one day. Because war is not fought on a single front, especially in the case of a siege. This does not mean that the garrison, or what is left of it, should be relegated to a corner of our minds, on the contrary: it is precisely those soldiers who prevent our heads from ending up on a pike, which is why we must allow them to fight at their best and in the right number. In addition, of course, to taking care of ourselves and our characters: in the main campaign two are assigned to us by default, we will have to find the others during the game - we have come to have four all together, the maximum number, but those to unlock are many more. Siege Survival: Gloria Victis is divided into two main segments both very important for survival, day and night; we'll talk about the latter later, let's focus on what can happen during daylight hours. We could define the day until sunset as the moment of tasks and strengthening of defenses: every morning we will be provided with a brief summary of the situation via icons at the bottom center of the screen, once these have been resolved we will have to dedicate ourselves to the construction of structures that can support the basic needs but, at the same time, support the night phases. We are not talking ~only~ of hunger and thirst, we also need to count the need for medicines, bandages, weapons and armor, materials to strengthen the walls, everything and more. Siege Survival's graphics are minimalistic, yet effective. When it is said that forty-eight hour days would be needed, this is the case with Siege Survival: Gloria Victis. The feeling is that you never have enough time to do everything, especially considering that the enemy launches attacks at close range and we must always be as well prepared as possible; should time progress, very simply there are no resources or our characters are too tired to be able to work effectively. On the one hand we appreciated this constant urgency, because you really feel the pressure given by the need to have everything under control even though you know that it will never be like this, on the other there are some aspects that deserved a better balance: in fact there are essential objects to create that require a significant investment of resources before being unlocked and, it must be said, we were puzzled by the requirement of having to unlock a level two tool bench to make a cobbled shovel when, for example, in the level one workshop we are already capable of repairing armor and weapons. Given the enormous importance of ogjets such as shovels and torches, essential during the night phases, lightening them in the economy of resources would have made everything smoother. This doesn't make the game infeasible, sweating a bit we managed to get to the end without losing any characters and containing a lot of the fallen in the armed forces; rather let's say that we found it a bit excessive obstacle, if not really inconsistent given the example shown. Each resource is closely linked to the presence and synergy of different structures, just as the upgrades of the latter would not be possible without having first built certain buildings: it is necessary to plan priorities well in advance and from there maximize efforts to make them concrete, in order to be able to dedicate oneself (never too calmly) to the rest. As already mentioned, time is short and after each attack we will find ourselves having to patch up before picking up where we left off. Difficult to be perfectly ready for each siege but you can undoubtedly contain the damage so as not to waste precious days afterwards. The need for resources, and above all the awareness of what we need in the right order, leads us directly towards the night phases. Loot and flee The hours that separate us from dawn, or when we will have to return to the castle to avoid being easily spotted by the enemies who basically patrol the streets, are much less than those available during the day; moreover, again unlike the latter, we cannot slow down (or speed up) the action to take a breather and take a better look at the surroundings. Everything takes place in the moment and before leaving we have to keep in mind two very important factors: the choice of the character to send out on an exploration, whose status and abilities will influence the progress of the raid in the looted city, and any objects to assign in order to overcome certain obstacles. Having established this, the starting point is chosen - it is important to try to unlock as many as possible to facilitate the task - and the silent looting of the few remaining resources begins: it is important to check the map and the subdivision of the areas in order to make them match with priorities, because if, for example, we are urgently needed for food, we certainly won't be wasting time in an area where it will be difficult to find it. The same goes for any other resource we may need, everything must be calculated with great precision and wasting time will come back to haunt us; unless the guards find us and kill us first.As mentioned, each character has its own characteristics that make it more effective in certain tasks than others: Flint, for example, has a very large backpack and is quick in collecting, sinning in the haggling and in fighting; qualities that instead belong to Rena, excellent if we wanted to do business or in case we find ourselves in danger, but not very reliable when it comes to hoarding resources, given the smaller capacity of the backpack. With only one character outing per night, it's once again essential to know what you want to do and act accordingly. Sometimes, given the critical conditions of the characters, it will happen that we have to compromise and send someone that we actually would have liked to keep for a later time: in that case we will use our ability to adapt and carefully choose where to go, what to do, even if it's worth exposing yourself or if it's not better, instead, to let the night go by without doing anything. A risky choice but it all depends on how the map is laid out, in terms of secret passages unlocked, and how many resources we think we are likely to bring home. The room for maneuver is reduced, in Siege Survival: Gloria Victis, and the balance is not so immediate to find at the beginning, however the sense of satisfaction in having survived one more day largely repays the efforts made up to then. Mors tua vita mea Then come the fateful moments when the enemies will launch their attacks. As already anticipated, you have no control over the combat itself, but once again you have to work, before and during, so that the garrison is able to repel the enemies effectively: first you feed them, quench their thirst and equip them of the best possible equipment; during, on the other hand, we take care of collecting rubble if the enemies used the catapults, extinguishing any fires started by flaming arrows or burning corpses that they will throw into the courtyard to try to spread some disease, as well as obviously keeping the soldiers monitored to see if they need to to repair the equipment or to be healed. No rest for the wicked, in short, even more so during clashes on whichwe really don't have power - in the sense that we can't handle them ourselves. The efficiency of the soldiers is directly proportional to ours in supplying them, so all efforts must be concentrated there. It is feasible, although not very simple, to conclude the battle without casualties and with very few wounded to take care of, and containing losses is by far the most important thing: soldiers do not grow on trees, preserving those available is vital to be able to oppose more and more pressing sieges until we see the right dawn - one where the threat of the invaders will finally be wiped out. Occasionally it is possible to recruit soldiers during the night phases, thus increasing the total number, but it is a rare event that in our case occurred only once, above all because it is linked to that narrative nuance of which Siege Survival: Gloria Victas is composed . Choices on the razor's edge Although the narrative is not as engaging or deep as that of This War of Mine, from which it takes its inspiration, the decisions we will be faced with still have consequences of a certain level. Some are more direct and less heavy, such as choosing whether or not to rob one of the poor unfortunate survivors of the massacre (you're not so bad, are you?), others are subtle and set down in such a way that the most logical choice may seem the best when often this is not the case. The game invites you to dare, however doing it with a certain criterion, and its way of narrating which mixes written text with drawings where the tragedy of the moment is staged is pleasant; certainly, it does not shine too much on this front, or perhaps it simply cannot have the same heavy impact of the historical veracity of the siege of Sarajevo - much closer to us than in times now too distant - but it does its job discreetly and invites us to search the map for events to understand where they can lead. Again, the balance is thin and the consequences could prove unpleasant: the price to pay if you want to be daring, making the adventure even more engaging.Although the campaign lasts about five or six hours, upon completion you unlock different alternatives from which to start over, a mode only for experts and therefore even more punitive, or the possibility of both creating your own scenario and playing those created by other users: the game is therefore richer than it appears, above all because the balances can also vary thanks to the New Game+ in which we will be given the possibility to independently manage the aspects of the game, dictating the rules before starting. The main story is therefore just the beginning, the real survival begins after.", "date": "2021-05-18", "grade": "7.7"}
