{"name": "Medal of Honor", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/medal-of-honor.html", "text": "Honor to (de)merit This mobile version of Medal of Honor puts the player in the role of a soldier tasked with infiltrating a German depot and sabotaging a V2 rocket before it can be launched at the Allies. The presentation of the EA product fluctuates dangerously on the border between the simple and the banal, a condition which - as we will see - finally invests the entire product. In fact, it only takes a few minutes of play to discover that the Medal of Honor play structure itself represents a big step backwards compared to the sophistication of many of the currently available mobile video games. Configuring itself as a two-dimensional stealth-tinged action game, Medal of Honor is not very different from the first Splinter Cell mobile released a few years ago, and this already says a lot about how the gameplay is rather patchy. The user must achieve his goal while avoiding direct confrontation with the enemies as much as possible, both due to the shortage of available ammunition and the fragility of the protagonist, who only needs one shot to end up killed. The solution therefore lies in outflanking the opponents or in taking them out with a melee attack, taking advantage of the elements of the scenario (barrels, tall grass, crates, etc.) to get as close as possible without being identified. Aside from some clumsy platforming elements, Medal of Honor is basically all here: there are two weapons that occasionally replace the default weapon (machine gun and sniper rifle), a few turrets to use here and there and several buttons to press in order to continue, but nothing that goes beyond these basic gameplay logics. This does not mean that Medal of Honor is a bad or unfunny game, it is simply a title that tastes old and for this reason it loses comparison with current products. Nonetheless, the adventure is also quite short (only six stages available) and substantially devoid of elements that invite you to start over. Honor to (de)merit However, it must be said that the EA product compensates for its playful deficiencies with a decidedly good level of graphic design, made up of bright colors, well-animated sprites and detailed scenarios: the quality of the really excellent light effects should be underlined. This only and only if you have a sufficiently advanced mobile phone: Medal of Honor is in fact one of the few titles that changes radically depending on the system on which it runs. In our test based on a Nokia 6630 and a Nokia N73, the EA title not only showed a frightening graphical gap (as visible in the images above), with the 6630 version infinitely poorer, but also a totally different level design, very more elaborate, varied and complex in the second case. In short, already not exactly exciting in its best incarnation, Medal of Honor is a really mediocre game if run on an older mobile phone. The only common element recorded in the two versions was the sound, reduced to the bone in both cases: apart from a few jingles here and there, the only effects that accompany the adventure are those produced by the keys on your telephone... Game tested on Nokia 6630 and Nokia N73. Comment Medal of Honor is basically an old game, based on game mechanics that are largely outdated in the mobile sector and which therefore fail to capture the user. The EA title is absolutely not bad, mind you, simply its charm is limited a lot precisely by the constant sensation of already seen that permeates the entire production. Graphically Medal of Honor is instead up to the situation, but only on the most advanced mobile phones: otherwise, the EA work falls into total mediocrity. Pros Fairly fun Good graphics... Cons ...But only on more advanced phones Patchy gameplay Short and poor replay value In the console field, that of Medal of Honor was one of the first series focused on the scenario of the Second World War, capable of enjoying considerable success in the first period and then being outclassed by rival brands such as Call of Duty and Brothers in Arms. Now let's see if the EA brand will be able to ~take revenge~ at least on mobile territory ...", "date": "2006-12-19", "grade": null}
