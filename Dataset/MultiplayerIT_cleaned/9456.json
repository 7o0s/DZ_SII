{"name": "White Shadows", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/white-shadows-recensione.html", "text": "2021 seems to be the year of crows. After the excellent Death's Door, which has also found its well-deserved space on consoles, we take off the role of the courageous crow armed with a sword (or umbrella, or whatever suits you best) to wear the more tragic ones of a young protagonist fleeing for his own life, within a society that ostracizes and exploits crows - in this case represented more as anthropomorphic animals. White Shadows is the first work of the German studio Monokel in which, right from the start, it is possible to see traces of Limbo and/or Inside. From an artistic point of view it is much more refined, enriched by films and in general with a profound search for detail. Where it sins most is in the rather limited action and in the excessive hermeticism of the narration: up to a certain point it makes itself understandable, with the pieces that slowly fit together in their place, but in the final bars it takes a drift that has us left a little perplexed. Let's find out more about the adventures of Ravengirl in our review of White Shadows. Storytelling The atmosphere of White Shadows As always, let's start with the story. It's not easy to tell White Shadows, both because we don't want to end up in spoilers and because, in fact, it's complicated to understand where it's going with this or what it means. What we are certain of is that we find ourselves completely immersed in a dystopia, a Metropolis mixed with Bioshock where exploitation and social control are the basis of the city in which Ravengirl's escape takes place. start playing. White Shadows presents scenes of racism, xenophobia, violence even against women and children, in short, nothing is missing: we can confirm that these warnings are not far-fetched, the step-by-step game becomes increasingly raw and dirty, above all when we are the first to be called to perform certain and despicable actions. In this context of degradation, we sense that crows in particular are ostracized as ~disease carriers~: the whole city is built to convey this message by exploiting the environmental narrative, with neon signs that constantly refer to the fact that it is right drive away the crows and use violence on them. Or, with obvious scenes of exploitation against the aforementioned, through references that in some cases made us think of the deportations and concentration camps during the Nazi period. The developers don't send it much to say, with strong contents. But the point is: what do they mean? Because despite having appreciated the environmental narration, the care in reconstructing scenarios and characters who, despite their silence, manage to explain the context, some steps are missing to really understand what happened and above all who Ravengirl is. As anticipated, the final bars are a bit hasty and do not help in closing the circle. Gameplay A bridge of White Shadows In terms of gameplay, White Shadows is super simple. The player is only required to move the character, crouch where necessary, jump and occasionally interact with some objects: nothing else. A banality that would not clash (again, let's think of Limbo and Inside) if it were made more present. As we progressed in the game we realized how the most common action is to move the character, almost as if we were in a walking simulator, while the puzzles or more platform sections are contained: not reduced to the bone but not as present as we would have expected . On the one hand, the short duration of the game and the fact that it takes advantage of that period of time above all to tell and show undoubtedly valuable scenarios is due to it. Mind you, there are sections that we really appreciated, even a boss fight if we want to define it that way, but overall there is a bit of a balance between the concrete, demanding action and the simple transition from one point to another. The path is also very linear, devoid of secret passages, shortcuts or even just secrets, detours that end with a wink, as usually happens in these games. Putting together hermetic narration and gameplay at times too much linear, devoid of a real challenge, White Shadow emerges as an experience finely crafted from an artistic point of view, on which it is really worth spending the right praise, but more sparse as regards the marriage narrative / gameplay. If you've had experience with games where airtightness is king, then you know that the contextualization delay is (or should be) balanced by a progression that pushes the player to take that extra step. Put simply, if we're not satisfied story-wise, we canor always find the drive in an intriguing gameplay, capable of teasing our sense of challenge: unfortunately White Shadows does not dare, in this sense, keeping it safe with sections that, although at times very interesting especially as a staging, never commit Enough. Then comes the curiosity to understand where it's going with this, urged once again by the setting, but when you get to the end you only get a general perplexity. Technical and artistic sector A scene from White Shadows As written several times in the previous paragraphs, White Shadows stands out particularly for its aesthetics, for the incredible care put into the setting and the search for detail (the only ones that have no differences between them are the animals, i.e. all crows are the same, the pigs as well and so on). This is accompanied by a soundtrack consisting of classical music that accompanies the different moments, most of the times dark and tragic, of the game. From a technical point of view we have not noticed any distortions of any kind. No bugs, just sporadic glitches that have been confirmed to be fixed in a pre-launch update.", "date": "2021-12-09", "grade": "6.8"}
