We could have started hunting even later, but since we are newbies we decided to get up early. We set off from a base camp with a PDA in our left hand showing us our position in the reserve. The first thing we notice is the walk, very slow. Luckily there's a run button, but something tells us that making too much noise isn't the secret move of the good hunter. By pressing a few keys, binoculars and a camera also emerge, as well as a nice rifle with a scope, the kind that after each shot you have to clack-clack to reload. Everything seems to be there, so we set off. We pass splendid meadows in flower, grassy hills, felled trees, but not even the shadow of game. Every now and then the handheld signals something. There is life nearby. We head in that direction but nothing, everything is silent except for the buzzing of insects. After twenty-seven minutes of blessed waiting, it seems to us that something is moving on the horizon. Maybe it's a mirage. We take out the binoculars and our hearts begin to beat, a happy deer grazes! Well, it's time to get busy. For the moment it is still very far away, so we walk calmly in its direction. There he is over there pulling his nose up, seeing us... and running away. Yes, escape the cursed. Our attempts to shoot the volley only get us an embarrassing figure. Fortunately we are in a solitary game. From this event we learned an important lesson: never start playing if you haven't tried the tutorial. We leave the game and humbly let the game teach us its rules. Long waits but also great rewards, as long as you keep paying: The Hunter is for the few Patience is my weapon The tutorial keeps it simple, and in fact it doesn't take long to assimilate the theory, but the practice is another matter entirely. When we are in the hunting reserve, it seems trivial to say, but first we have to track down an animal. Luckily there is a fingerprint tracking system that comes in handy. Orange symbols indicate that an animal has passed by. It is enough to discover three consecutive fingerprints of the same type to see a circle appear on our palm. That is the area where the prey is found. By discovering new footprints, the area narrows and the direction in which we must proceed appears. It then becomes relatively simple to delimit the field, but after that it is necessary to visually locate the target. Only when we have framed it for a few seconds with binoculars does it appear on the GPS, and then we are free to move on to the third phase hoping to get the maximum score for having followed the procedure correctly. The last step, as you can imagine, is the killing, a delicate matter, because if we don't hit the beast in a vital point, it will run away wounded. In addition to being unethical, he will force us into a chase facilitated by the trail of blood in the hope of putting an end to his suffering as soon as possible. It goes without saying that in this case you get much less points. Once the animal has been killed, a screen shows us the point of the body where the fatal blow has penetrated and if we want we can also take a souvenir photo next to our trophy. Claiming the body is essential, because the law-abiding hunter doesn't abandon animal carcasses along the way. As an alternative to the procedure listed up to here, we can rely on the noises emitted by the animals to find out their position thanks to the PDA, even if a lot depends on the type of prey. In fact, to hunt birds we must use the appropriate call, then making a sudden noise when we are near the hidden flock, so as to scare them and force them to take off. In fact, let's remember that shooting down a bird while it has its legs on the ground does not guarantee us any points in the standings. Then there are baits, traps and many other useful items, which, however, are paid, but we will return to this point later. What we want to explain now is that all hunting techniques require a lot of patience. This is not an action game, but an accurate simulation, so you'll have to arm yourself with all your willpower and keep your attention span high every second of the game, agreeing to spend even an hour behind an elusive animal. On the other hand, when the prey finally collapses to the ground dejected, the satisfaction one feels is immense. Despite all the equipment we have at our disposal, the challenge against animals is therefore on equal terms. Of the two, we are the ones who have to give all our energy, and this fact alone repays the efforts made. Unfortunately, however, skill alone is not enough. If we are to have any chance of success in The Hunter we have tospend money, lots of money. Even just to hunt something other than deer and rabbits. You will have understood that the time has come to reveal all the pitfalls of the free to play formula according to The Hunter. It is not a sport for temporary workers If you want to get some pleasure from The Hunter, put yourself in the perspective of spending fifty euros immediately and continuing to pay over time. The mere fact that you can't hunt more than two species without paying the monthly subscription should be enough to warn the curious but undecided player. With nine euros for three months you get all the necessary licenses, but then there is the problem of weapons and equipment. Various types of rifles, pistols, even bows are available on the market, each with its own additions, such as different types of optics, but they cost, and a lot. You don't think you can take down a bear with the same tools you use to kill a hawk, do you? Furthermore, for each weapon it is necessary to buy ammunition, unless you choose a premium subscription that guarantees unlimited shots for the different weapons. We therefore start from a minimum of fourteen euros per quarter to have two extra weapons with infinite shots. Better already. With the subscription we will also be able to create private matches and invite friends. This is an important point. Participating in group matches is best. There are tons of players from all over the world ready to welcome us, but nothing beats a hunting trip with a friend and a pair of headphones to talk. Considering the long waiting times and the extreme slowness of the game, the company proves essential. In any case you can count on an active and present community. The Hunter is in fact the same game released a few years ago and now present on Steam after the handover from the old development team to the new one. But let's stay focused on expenses. If you want a lot of weapons, and sooner or later you'll want them to play at their best, then get ready to go over fifty euros. Then you need the baits and all the tools necessary to hunt the different species. Consider that at the beginning you don't even have the call for birds. There are somewhat treacherous mechanisms, such as the possibility of leaving a barrel full of bait for a few days on the game map. As time goes by, baits are consumed, i.e. money is spent. If we have enough, we can significantly shorten the waiting time for the hunt for the most difficult prey. And in case of rain or snow? Or to camouflage ourselves properly and hide our smell, or even just to know which way the wind is blowing? Other money. Not counting the observation tents. These are essential, also because they allow us to cram our equipment and change it if necessary. Don't think of taking them apart every time: much better to distribute them in strategic points of the different hunting areas. And here another tens of euros come out of the wallet. By participating in missions and challenges you can earn virtual money without bloodletting, but there are two problems. First of all this kind of currency only allows the purchase of decoys, ammunition, and single time licenses sold at a high price, furthermore all these events require something more than the basic equipment after a while. In short, we certainly don't want to say that The Hunter should be free, but here you can't even touch the substance of the game without a huge expense that must be maintained over time. Furthermore, the developers devise every means to extract euros from the enthusiasts. Resetting missions also costs money, just to make sure you can't make too much money in the sweat of your brow. The only way to earn virtual currency valid for each purchase is to participate in shady initiatives from sites recommended by the game. It's not exactly the clearest way to present yourself to the public. Natural show Keep in mind that The Hunter is a very serious hunting simulation. Hunting animals ethically, that is, to begin with, using an appropriate weapon and avoiding that they drag around wounded waiting to die is essential. If you don't embrace this philosophy and the resulting competition between players, it's impossible to fully enjoy the game, even if you spend a lot of money. On the other hand, if you are among the few enthusiasts able to devote time and money to this game, even better with a friend, you will get great pleasure out of it. Also because there are no valid alternatives on the market. The natural environments are spectacular, varied and subject to impressive atmospheric changes. You will even see the clouds glide in front of the sun casting a sudden shadow. There are about twenty species to hunt, all very curate in visual rendering and behavior, so that each session becomes a personal challenge to be carefully prepared. The Hunter is launched in the browser window and accessing its contents is simple and intuitive. There are tons of things to do and incentives to continue, not to mention that the developers come up with new items at a constant pace. As long as the revenues exceed the costs it is to be believed that the species present in the game and the maps will also increase. Unfortunately, the fact that without spending money you can only access a demo, and the lack of grace with which the game invites us to purchase new items make us turn up our noses. It's not the right way to relate to a slice of the market which, albeit a niche one, has been supporting the game for years and with passion. If one day a competitor arrives who is able to question the model of The Hunter, perhaps something will change. For now, if you want a simulation worthy of the name, you have to accept the business model of this game and be prepared to invest some hard-earned cash.", "date": "2014-06-23", "grade": "6.0"}
