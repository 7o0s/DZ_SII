{"name": "Warhammer: Chaosbane", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/warhammer-chaosbane-la-recensione.html", "text": "Warhammer: Chaosbane is finally out of beta and ready to download from Steam. It is a classic hack 'n' slash set in the Warhammer universe and signed by EKO (the same as How To Survive). We had tried the beta a few weeks ago, and the work of the French guys had half convinced us: there was the fascination of the Games Workshop universe, the combat system had some interesting ideas, but several contents were missing and even the balancing seemed need some finishing. Now that the title is in its final form we can give a more concrete judgment which unfortunately confirms the first sensations. Not that we don't see some steps forward, but they weren't entirely sufficient, and the impression is that what is being proposed today is nothing but the skeleton with excellent potential on which, however, there is still a whole story to be built. Perhaps a little less sloppy than the one created by Mike Lee (famous author of the Black Library): General Magnus manages to defeat the invaders led by Asvar Kul guaranteeing victory for the populations of the north, but when everything seems over a last resurgence of forces of evil, led by Harbiger, seriously wounds the hero in the stronghold of Nuln, leaving the empire without a guide. The soldier Konrad Vollen, the wizard Elontir, the slayer Bragi Axebiter and the explorer Elessa are candidates for saviors of the homeland, each of whom is motivated by specific motivations that are explained during the ~personalized~ introduction. Other than that though, the story unfolds the same way for all four of them. Let's get ready... Once the character and difficulty level have been selected (we tested it in the fourth of the ten), there is very little time for ceremonies: just a couple of jokes exchanged with the great wizard Teclis to understand that the origin of the evil comes from from the slums and in no time at all we are in the sewers of Nuln. The structure of Chaosbane is modeled on that of Diablo, with particular reference to the first episode. There is a compact camp/hub from where you collect the only quest available and then set off to clear the dungeon. After completing the assignment, you return to the starting point and so on until the end. The only side business is the merchants' guild to which you donate superfluous equipment in exchange for experience and magical shards. The inventory screen has remained the raw one of the beta: the icons of the objects are a bit too large and cannot be repositioned, while some tabs could have been merged with the two main ones: equipment and spells. The level increase does not involve the assignment of points, but a simple increase of those knowledge and the unlocking of more powerful spells. The skill tree, conceptually similar for all heroes, divides them into passive and active, and the latter into normal (which allow you to accumulate mana) and advanced (which instead consume it). Regardless of nature, they can only be equipped if their total is less than the available point pool. This should make the balance more refined: for example, a certain type of powerful but expensive attack could be renounced, to keep an experience modifier and one on fire resistance active. Attack! The combat system is immediate and pleasant, apart from some sporadic jamming of the cursor which forces the mouse to be repositioned. The pattern is classic hack 'n' slash, with enemies pounced on the hero like bees on honey. With all the bestiary made available by the Warhammer universe, variety is certainly not lacking in the EKO title; there would perhaps be something to say about the behavior of monsters that adopt similar techniques, differing mainly in their resistance to certain types of attacks. We will therefore find the mages who flee after summoning support monsters; the toughest warriors who are stubborn in hand-to-hand combat; the archers who position themselves at a safe distance to take advantage of the long range. The biggest bosses are the best designed because they also require a minimum of skill in positioning, while the piles on which to hurl divine wrath are often preferable. The vial for health automatically regenerates over time and there is no other way to restore it (except with red orbs occasionally dropped by monsters that also feed the berserk mode bar), while, as above, the only way to fill the bottle of mana is to use basic attacks. The problem arises at the end of the first game, when you realize that the tactics used continue to be valid even for higher difficulty levels and thatand strategic planning is reduced. To be honest, the title is already challenging at the fifth of the ten difficulty levels, but having the better of the larger groups of opponents requires more coordination with the mouse than tactical finesse. Let them throw away the loot In an action-RPG loot is one of the main pillars of the gameplay: from this side Chaosbane shows the side, because the monsters always drop slightly better (or worse) items than the equipped ones. The items intervene on basic values such as attack, reload time, defense, health, and rarely have modifiers that can make potentially less effective sets, but lethal if combined with each other, prefer. Rarer ones only appear after finishing the campaign; it would have been wise to include some earlier to ignite curiosity. Furthermore, the loot is specific to each class, so when using the dwarf you will only find items that are useful to that character and his experience level. This logic is penalized by the impossibility of changing equipment: for example the magician can only hold a sword in his right hand and a staff in his left. In addition to items, enemies and chests drop gold and crystal fragments of different colors, which can be used in two ways: either to expand the tree of divine skills, which branches along the lines of that of Path of Exile, or to resuscitate. When you die, you can put your wallet in order to start again from the same point (with the enemies who in most cases remain with the remaining energy), or start the instance over again. The temptation not to ~waste time~, combined with the generosity of resources and above all with the fact that there are no other ways to use them means that the risk of ~playing dirty~ is always high. In about fifteen hours the end credits arrive; the endgame is currently penalized by the absence of activities such as trade and crafting, whose characters (with relative locations) have clearly been foreseen by the French software house (we had seen a sketch of it in the beta phase) but which for the moment latitano: perhaps there has not yet been time to implement them properly. Technique Graphically Chaosbane gets along very well, but also in this case with some distinctions. The locations, well characterized and respectful of the stylistic features of Warhammer, have some gems such as the stairways through the narrow streets of the city of Nuln and the ruined houses of Praag; evocative glimpses embellished by passages in which the camera remains fixed to give greater dynamism to the scene. On the other hand, the morphology is unsatisfactory: these are long corridors interspersed, from time to time, with some larger open space where the most stinking monsters reside and some dead end where the chests are hidden, among the few interactive elements. We liked the work on the effects of the spells, the progress of which makes them more and more spectacular (it almost seems to play a shoot 'em up from the nineties). On the contrary, the animations of the monsters are limited and this could also explain the repetitiveness of the offense patterns. Thumbs up for the soundtrack that knows when to intervene leaving the word, most of the time, to the environmental effects; the dubbing in English is also good (there are Italian subtitles). The multiplayer sector is immature. There are four modes, but when choosing to join a game there is no way to choose one in advance, so it could very well happen that you decide to go on an expedition when other users are engaged in the story which, at least at this stage starting point of the game, is the most popular one. Wanting to help another player isn't always a brilliant idea, because the system doesn't check the level of the heroes: we happened to support newcomers, partly ruining their experience, too, the fire range of our Elontir was so devastating. Unfortunately, there is no shortage of bugs that prevent you from exiting a lobby in an ~orthodox~ way or that block the screen while the system is looking for a game.", "date": "2019-06-12", "grade": "6.0"}
