The ~+~ which completes the name defines the fact that this is a re-edition of the product created over three years ago for Nintendo 3DS, and which is now on the market again in a version specifically designed to take advantage of the features of the latest restyling of the Nintendo portable . So let's talk about the reissue of a remake which, however, borrows the title from another chapter of the saga which has little or nothing to do with it. Is it all confusing enough? Well, then we can go and explain why the operation implemented by Bandai Namco cannot be defined properly brilliant ... Missed target As usual, we refer you to our review of the original title to get all the necessary information on the actual game, while here we will focus on the features of this new version. Unfortunately, as we will see, there are not many aspects that differentiate the present Ace Combat: Assault Horizon Legacy + from the 2011 source product, however headed by a control system that contemplates the use of the additional commands offered by the New Nintendo 3DS. The first element to attract attention is the small C-Stick placed on the right side of the console, which the Bandai Namco developers have dedicated to the 360-degree management of the camera: a function that is certainly not fundamental but still welcome, which serves above all to be able to freely admire the new liveries of the videogame-themed aircraft which we will discuss later. In order to also take advantage of the ZR and ZL keys, it is instead necessary to select the ~classic~ command set in the settings menu, a mode that brings the control of the aircraft very close to that typical of the titles of the series released on home consoles: the main analog stick it is therefore deputed to manage the roll, while it is possible to yaw to the right or to the left using the two additional backbones instead of the (awkward) directional cross. Choosing these settings is preferable not only to have greater control over the plane, but also to give a boost to a level of challenge decidedly calibrated downwards: unfortunately in this sense nothing has changed compared to the 2011 game, and it is possible to complete campaign at normal level in just over two hours without breaking a sweat. The minimum wage of replay value is provided by a couple of forks in the course of the story that lead to different missions and by the presence in some scenarios of the typical yellow blocks with the Super Mario question mark, by shooting which you can get special planes with liveries inspired by various Nintendo icons. Ace Combat: Assault Horizon Legacy + is a somewhat lazy reissue of an unforgettable title The 3D effect Like many other aspects of the game, the 3D effect of Ace Combat: Assault Horizon Legacy + has not undergone significant changes compared to the original title: therefore, the same argument made on the occasion of the previous review applies, with a stereoscopic vision that adds nothing in particular to the playful experience given above all the lack of reference points in the immaculate skies that make up the vast majority of the scenarios. My amiibo for an airplane Ace Combat: Assault Horizon Legacy + allows you to unlock further extra aircraft thanks to amiibo: a special option in the main menu allows you to bring the statuettes close to the touch screen to make Mario, Luigi, Donkey Kong, Link, Samus themed models immediately available and company. However, the clear superiority of these aircraft compared to those that can be purchased in the game with the credits earned on a mission ends up further debasing a playful component (that of buying and selling models and upgrades) which already in the original had a truly impalpable specific weight in the economy of game. It would have been nice to be able to use these colorful aircraft in some multiplayer matches, but Ace Combat: Assault Horizon Legacy + remains firm on the positions of its predecessor, categorically refusing any innovation in this respect: even the scores achieved in the various levels and in - far from it that exhilarating - challenge missions remain confined to one's device, denoting an ostracizing attitude of Bandai Namco towards thesharing on the net which is truly incredible when one considers that any game nowadays allows at least the viewing of online rankings. An aspect that immediately gives the measure of the very little effort made by the Japanese publisher to give value to a reissue that arrives on the market three years after the original (and decidedly not at a budget price) offering only extra liveries and a vaguely modernized control system: all while the gaps widely visible already in 2011, i.e. a technical implementation without treble, a gameplay devoid of bite and a single player campaign short and badly accompanied by rather meager extra modes, recur again without being been minimally retouched.", "date": "2015-02-13", "grade": "6.0"}
