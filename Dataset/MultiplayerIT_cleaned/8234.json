Let's talk about the one of the origins, which is still the most popular in the collective imagination. One wonders how much an imaginary world still manages to describe and predict the world which by now seems to be more and more the present and less the future and which for this very reason seems to have exhausted its ability to reveal the complexity of reality beyond what has already been done, despite remaining sublime from the point of view of aesthetics, paradoxically more and more vintage. After all, this paradox is the heart of the review of ANNO: Mutationem, as you can read in the following lines. Cyberpunk calls... Ann is the protagonist of ANNO: Mutationem The title of the Chinese team ThinkingStars is an action role-playing game, in which the role-playing part is very nuanced in the other, built entirely around a very personal graphic style, in which 2D sprites move in a 3D world framed as if was a 2.5D game, but with the ability to move in depth, as well as horizontally. The protagonist is Ann, a fighter with incredible skills afflicted by a strange disease, for which there is still no cure. Ayane is always with her, a girl particularly versed in the art of hacking, who accompanies her in the form of a hologram and who participates very much in Ann's life, with whom she seems to be in love. Soon what at first seems just her personal research becomes a family affair, forcing her to wander around a vast urban agglomeration, divided into different areas, where neon lights and decay try to coexist as best they can, in search of the missing brother. To hinder it we think several organizations, whose purposes will be revealed at the end of the game, as well as some creatures that populate the most inaccessible areas of the city. So in the course of the adventure gang members, mercenaries in the pay of the classic corrupt multinationals, mutant humans and animals and all that desperate fauna that one would expect to find in a similar title will face each other. In terms of interactions with the game world it's quite interesting. You can practically hear jokes and dialogues from all the characters that populate the streets and the various environments. A colorful scenario of ANNO: Mutationem Just get close to find out what they have to say. Be that as it may, apart from some key characters and the shopkeepers, Ann will never engage in too long and deep dialogues. Let's say that listening to others is a good way to enter the life of the city, made up of voices, noise and huge buildings full of signs and billboards. Sometimes you also get side missions, but these are quite rare cases, which in any case justify the fact that in the end you have to chat a little with everyone. For the rest, the environmental interactions are linked to: containers to be opened to find objects to resell or to disassemble, in order to have raw materials for crafting, with which to build consumables, weapons or weapon upgrades; and levers to pull or buttons to press, to open doors, call elevators and so on. The graphic style is really nice More rarely there are electronic systems to hack, through a mini-game that basically requires you to stack circles, repeatable practically infinitely, and there are computers full of emails to read, from which to obtain information on the scenario in which you are and to times on the story of Ann herself. Let's say that, in general, the exploratory part works and is the best of the whole experience, because it allows you to come into direct contact with the setting and its various conceptual branches, all derived from cyberpunk classics or much loved works such as Evangelion. Going around Noctis City, Skopp City, Margaritia and all the other places you visit during the adventure often reserves surprises, especially in terms of scenery, which alone would be worth the price of the ticket, if there weren't also a story to follow and enemies to fight. It's not for nothing that the best part of the game is the first, i.e. the one in which you fight less and explore more. The combat system In a minigame, Ann has to be a bartender The combat system is one of the many ambiguous features of ANNO: Mutationem. On the one hand, there is no doubt that it works, in its simplicity, despite being based on three weapons. Initially Ann has a pair of fast and deadly blades and a pistol, but she soon acquires a third weapon: a greatsword with which she can carry out heavy attacks, which do great damage. The three weapons can be used with each othercertainly to make combos against enemies who have the bad habit of wanting to kill her in the most brutal ways. If desired, weapons also have a strategic function, because they are more or less effective against certain opponents. The bosses in particular must be studied a little before understanding how it is best to behave and which attacks produce the best effects, even if we must not expect who knows what reasoning to do. Going forward in the adventure it becomes possible to acquire or buy more powerful weapons, which however are always part of the indicated trio. If desired, it is also possible to mount chips on it that improve its characteristics. The bosses are well done graphically, but they are all fought in the same way In short, the system seems quite complex. Unfortunately, it works very well in theory, but much less in practice, because in fact fighting boils down to a continuous combination of dodging and attacking, a tactic that applies to almost all common enemies and even bosses, to the point that sometimes also forget about the possibility of parrying blows or being able to use charged shots, the latter penalized by very long preparation animations, which make them counterproductive against most enemies. The sensation is that of being faced with a flower that has blossomed at half, which fails to truly express its full potential, except on very rare occasions. Particularly in the second part of the game certain elements are brought to exasperation: the bosses become real sponges, above all because of the shields that are recharged and which are far too resistant. The fights therefore become very long, gaining nothing in variety, since the safest tactic to win always remains the same. Even common enemies become much more resistant, for the sake of liking. The result is that you arrive at the end with a strong sense of tiredness. A strange story The story of ANNO: Mutationem is not all that exciting The major problem of ANNO: Mutationem, however, is another. If the construction of the setting is pure gold for fans of classic cyberpunk, with scenarios that seem to come straight from Gibson's Sprawl Trilogy (probably the most looted cyberpunk author in the videogame field) and with constant references to the classics of the genre, including the anime touch of the characters, justified by the various Ghosts in the Shell, Akira and Appleseed, the story never really takes off and the continuous use of small gimmicks, which find a questionable explanation in the ending, kills a lot of the involvement created by the surrounding elements. Unfortunately ANNO: Mutationem seems to have been written by enthusiasts of the genre who, however, failed to look beyond the object of their love and ended up getting bogged down in highly telephoned situations, which end up breaking a good part of the tension. Their characters have good premises, but they soon end up channeling themselves onto the tracks of the obvious, both in characterization and in their relationships, while the mystery that acts as the leitmotif of the entire story can be guessed practically right from the opening bars, thanks to a couple of revealing details that anyone who knows anything about cyberpunk literature and cinema will notice right away. From a narrative point of view, more could have been done The screenplay is also on the same level and makes use of all the clichs of the genre, so much so that some dialogues appear too didactic with respect to the themes addressed. The same relationship between Ann and Ayane is developed in a predictable way, with the holographic girl in constant adoration of the protagonist, to the point of paroxysm. This does not mean that ANNO: Mutationem is completely to be despised. Indeed, we confess that we were not sorry to get to the end and it is still an experience that we feel like recommending, above all thanks to its style, which is reflected in the graphics and soundtrack. I'm just sorry to see so much potential half-expressed. In any case, it is a good starting point, which we hope to see better developed perhaps in a sequel.", "date": "2022-03-24", "grade": "6.5"}
