{"name": "Agent Intercept", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/agent-intercept-la-recensione.html", "text": "The Agent Intercept review can only start by recalling Spy Hunter, a historic arcade from 1983 that gave birth to a series of titles released on various platforms over time. Similarly, the protagonist here is a James Bond-style super-equipped car capable not only of shooting, but also of transforming into a motorboat to tackle the waters of seas and rivers. The atmosphere and the setting recall the themes of the secret agents of the 70s films, with a rather pleasant and spot on style: the missions aim to solve crises or thwart global threats in the classic ~one hero against all~ mode , perhaps even trying to get the best score possible. Technique and style Agent Intercept, available since the launch of Apple Arcade and enriched over the months with various updates, is the debut on the platform of PikPok, those of Into the Dead and Flick Kick Football. The formula is, as anticipated, rather simple and immediate: you find yourself controlling a car along predefined routes that represent real missions complete with scripted events, enemies and bosses. The control system is extremely immediate and simple, specifically designed for use via touch screen: therefore, if acceleration is automatic and steering assistance is more than present, the player can act by moving the vehicle left and right on the roadway or press one of the two virtual buttons delegated to drifting and the use of weapons, such as homing missiles or a machine gun placed on the hood. Agent Intercept is therefore certainly not a complex game to understand, and during the first few games you can easily be fascinated by the spectacular nature of the action and the pleasant graphic component. Above all the style of the latter, colorful and winking at the 70s, denotes a particular work by the development team, which has nailed a rather original and pleasant characterization. The strong action component then confronts a succession of breakneck situations that give the impression of being inside a 007 film, without however the beautiful girls and the shaken Martinis. Unfortunately, however, some game design choices struggle to fully convince, soon reducing the enthusiasm and placing more than a few doubts on the final result. Heavy defects The problems of Agent Intercept start from the structure chosen by PikPok: probably to look for a more original way or rather in an attempt to study a formula suitable for short game sessions on mobile platforms, it was decided not to provide Agent Intercept with a classic progression of the storyline and missions. On the contrary, each mission (here called ~crisis~) has a fixed duration of a full day, during which the same can be repeated at different difficulty levels to get a better score to compare in online leaderboards with other players around for the world. However, the stimulus is not much, even less considering that doing the individual crises all over again is not always so pleasant and fun. In fact, once the novelty element is lost, the subsequent games bring to the surface the limits of a fairly superficial and not very refined mechanic. Therefore, the poor artificial intelligence of the enemies, the modest thickness of the driving model, the inconstant difficulty are felt closely, ultimately making the offer of Agent Intercept uninteresting. In addition to the main mode, there is also the area dedicated to challenges, which develops in a more banal way by presenting a series of tasks divided into pairs, with an exercise and a time trial. Also in this case, however, the structure is really too repetitive, making the action ultimately always the same and, therefore, boring.", "date": "2020-02-10", "grade": "6.0"}
