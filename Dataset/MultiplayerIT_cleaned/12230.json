{"name": "Tropix", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tropix_a.html", "text": "Developed by the British Creative North (former authors of Underground 3D Pool and 6 Nations Rugby), Tropix presents itself with an interesting playful formula on paper, which attempts to combine two of the most suitable types of game for the mobile context, i.e. the pet-simulator in Tamagotchi style and minigame collection. The mechanics are quite simple, with the user accumulating money as he collects victories in the various stages: the money obtained must be duly spent in the purchase of food and essential objects to make the little monkey protagonist of the title happy, who will move to a new island once complete satisfaction is achieved. Easy to explain, Tropix is equally immediate to play: you start on the tiny Outset Island, a small strip of sand with a palm tree completely surrounded by the sea. From here you have access to the first minigame, a kind of Puzzle Bubble clone in which you have to shoot colored balls at those of the same shade to make them explode. It then continues with Jungle Jump, an action segment starring the aforementioned monkey who has to jump from vine to vine while avoiding obstacles and enemies; to follow, there are the tropical sauce versions of Sudoku and Solitaire and finally the inevitable stage a la Bejeweled in which it is necessary to align series of equal pieces. Unfortunately, playing the Creative North product, several problems emerge that make the gaming experience extremely flat and limiting. First of all, the minigames are too few and completely devoid of originality, presenting themselves as mere carbon copies of already existing titles. The level of challenge is also incredibly low, making walking through the countless stages a boring and toothless process: you are therefore forced to repeat the same mini-game over and over again to accumulate money, but without a real increase in difficulty. Furthermore, it is certainly annoying that each island is associated with only one minigame, an element that forces you to move from one atoll to another just to be able to change the playful register. As if all this were not enough, Tropix also fails miserably as regards the pet-simulator aspect, so basic and cumbersome as to constitute nothing but a boring impediment: buying objects and passively observing the little monkey who interacts with them while the three state fill up is not exactly an exciting sight. The icing on the cake (in an ironic sense, of course) is the technical realization of Tropix, extremely rough and cheesy: the graphics are a jumble of careless pixels glued onto static backgrounds, while the sound consists entirely of a very annoying and repetitive melody that it's impossible not to delete after a few seconds... PRO The monkey is cute. AGAINST Minigames trivial and not very exciting Lowest technical achievement Cheap pet simulator", "date": "2007-06-03", "grade": "S.V."}
