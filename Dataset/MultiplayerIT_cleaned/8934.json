Which, clearly, on the one hand can please, on the other hand it means that to bring the franchise to Wii the developers have thought about how to exploit the peculiar capabilities of the console; on the other hand it gives the idea of the chronic immobility of a product which, despite presenting the word ~evolution~ in its title, has been reproposed to us always the same for years, until the inevitable overtaking by FIFA occurred. Overtaking that, it must be recognized, has never happened on the Nintendo flagship and which now has little probability of happening, given that EA Sports has not been equally skilled in offering a mix of potential such as to satisfy the expectations of fans. To overcome the difficulties of the Playmaker style, which offers an original approach to football but requires a little practice to be fully appreciated, Konami has also added a traditional control system for some years now, effectively bringing the PES of the ~golden years~, the one that gave us so many emotions during the years of PlayStation 2 and which is still current in its dynamics, despite the much criticized ~binaries~. It is possible to use the Playmaker style or the ~classic~ one, holding a Classic Controller, in any of the modes that Pro Evolution Soccer 2012 makes available to us: from the quick game to the Champions League, from the Copa Libertadores to the ~style versus style~ mode ( in which a player who prefers the traditional PES gameplay can compete with one who instead adopts the Playmaker style), from online multiplayer via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection to the Master League, ending with the cup/league and with the Path of Champions. The latter perhaps appears to be the most interesting mode of the package, given that we start with the Master League squad but it is possible to select the path to take in terms of competitions, with achievements to be unlocked during matches, new players that can be ~fished ~ from a deck of cards and the whole team that grows and becomes more competitive as we gain experience points. Too little? The list of modes clarifies, as already mentioned in the introduction, that unfortunately this new edition of PES for Wii doesn't add anything new to what we saw last year. There are marginal changes to the Playmaker style, but the experience is unchanged and this can only disappoint those who have opted for a purchase ~on trust~. On the other hand, those approaching the game for the first time on the Nintendo console will immediately understand the goodness of the product in absolute terms, thanks to the many facets and possibilities made available by the developers. There are even amusements, such as being able to play a game using your Miis and choose whether players should have normal or ~deformed~ physical proportions. The Champions League and the Copa Libertadores remain the flagship licenses of the franchise and wink at football fans, who will be able to relive the most important phases of these competitions, while the cup/league mode completes the traditional offer and lends itself to more obvious uses, or the choice of the favorite team to make them gloriously climb each ranking and conquer the most renowned trophies. Lastly, the Master League and the Cammino dei Campioni represent the largest part of the product; the second, in particular, offers a relative freshness in terms of content since it was introduced for a relatively short time. The presence of achievements to unlock, managerial implications and even a pinch of luck when you need to ~fish~ a bonus player are all very welcome elements, which invite you to play ~one more game~, supported by a gameplay that is always up to the situation . Dear old PES And let's talk about this gameplay with two souls. The Playmaker style works using the Wii-mote / Nunchuk combination, with the latter being used to move the player manually, activate the tackle (Z button) and shoot (shake the controller), while the reticle is controlled on the screen by the Wii pointer -mote regulates the movement of the players (button A) and the passes (trigger B), with the possibility of organizing choral actions and making deep throws in an absolutely precise way. Remittances and icorner kicks, since we can clearly indicate who our target is before shooting. The feeling, already after a few games, is that the opponents' AI somehow adapts to the control system, allowing us otherwise improbable maneuvers (the through ball is a lot that has been made more difficult to achieve, in the Konami series ) and also producing sometimes inexplicable behaviors, such as the slow gait of an attacker in front of our defense, almost waiting for us to take action to steal the ball from him. Certainly the potential of the Playmaker style is many, it is an original approach to the genre and in its maximum expressions it can give us so much. However, if you really can't make yourself like it, or you bought Pro Evolution Soccer 2012 in the Wii version solely for the presence of the traditional gameplay, then the Classic style will win you over immediately, and if you are a longtime fan it will be a bit like ~going back to home~. The only limitation is the poor quality of the Classic Controller, to be replaced absolutely with the Pro version.", "date": "2011-11-17", "grade": "7.6"}
