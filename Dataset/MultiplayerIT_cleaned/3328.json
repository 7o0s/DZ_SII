The leitmotif of the entire update, therefore, was certainly the search for stability in the gameplay, able to lay the foundations for what will be next year of Siege. In this way, probably, Ubisoft wants to ensure the possibility of being able to dare more, just as the developers themselves have pointed out several times over the last few months. The intent is clear even if you stop and look at just the two new operators: Kali and Wamai can be considered fundamental pieces of that puzzle of 52 operators which is now able to provide valid alternatives to each of the main roles, both in attack than in defense. Thanks to their introduction, in fact, the elderly Thatcher and the beloved Jger - both essential in most of the formations of every organized team - can easily give way, when necessary, to make room for the two members of Nighthaven. The search for stability also passes through the rework of the Amusement Park and the adjustments to the unique skills of certain operators. Kali & Wamai: are the villains coming? With a CGI trailer released simultaneously with the release of the two new recruits of the Rainbow team, Ubisoft has managed to intrigue us further: the two operators are presented as if they were mercenaries engaged in something shady. According to the statements made by Alexander Karpazis - Artistic Director of the Montreal development team - the fifth year of Siege should, in fact, have a narrative vein in which Kali and Wamai could be the protagonists. Waiting to find out more about it, we tested the two newcomers for a long time, to identify their peculiarities and weaknesses. It is no coincidence that the code name of Kalimohan ~Kali~ Shah also refers to the Hindu female deity, often described as terrifying and violent: the new assailant seems to have no scruples and be extremely lethal if placed in the right hands. Its Bolt Action sniper rifle, the CSRX 300, is the first of its kind to appear on Rainbow Six and, thanks to the large caliber of the shots used and the multiple magnification (5x - 12x) available, makes it a valid alternative to Glaz, the heavily mistreated sniper over the last few years. So only long-distance clashes for the Indian operator? Not necessarily. The power of her only primary weapon allows her to handle even more agitated situations, in confined spaces, since a single hit, in any part of the body, is always enough to get rid of any opponent. Whether you clash with heavy, medium or light defenders, no armor is able to resist the CSRX 300, capable of instantly putting its victims into wounded (DBNO), from any distance. Furthermore, with the inclusion of this weapon, the developers have decided to review the entire bullet penetration system and, more specifically, to introduce the collateral mechanics: with Kali's bolt action it is possible to score four knockdowns with a single shot or, even, a full team of headshots (but to do this you need the 5 opponents to be aligned... and maybe even all the planets). So are we talking about an OP weapon? Fortunately, it seems that Ubisoft has managed to balance it simply by keeping the rate of fire low and the recoil quite important. Furthermore, being able to place shots in no-scope seems almost impossible due to the exaggerated dispersion. To make the most of the attacker, therefore, excellent aim is certainly needed: in the games played there were very few occasions in which we had the opportunity to hit with the second bullet after having misfired with the first, because the time between one and the other is enough to allow a quick counterattack by the defenders. Although among the secondary weapons available to Kali, there is also an automatic pistol, the C75-Auto of the 707th SMB, we found the P226 MK25 of the SAS much more useful, due to the high damage. Furthermore, being a sniper-support, preferring the Claymore to the Breaking Charges seems almost obvious. At the beginning we defined the new attacker as an alternative to Thatcher and the reason is to be found in her unique ability: the CSRX 300 is not only one of the strongest guns in the entire game, but also one of the most technological. The riflefeatures an LV Explosive Lance engaged below the main barrel and activated with the simple push of a button. The 3 explosive bolts supplied roughly resemble the projectiles of Ash's grenade launcher but, once in contact with any type of surface, they detonate creating a shock wave capable of destroying any electronic gadget in a 3 meter radius. Everything becomes even more interesting if we add that, although they are not pierceable by these shots, the reinforced walls are not able to block the explosion. Bandit's CED scooters, Mute's Jammer, Kaid's Rtila, Jger's ADS and even Castle's Deployable Shields and Armored Panels can only succumb to the destructive power of the Explosive Lance. On the contrary, the Black Mirrors of Mira and little else are not affected by the detonation and remain standing even in the face of these explosions. However, using Kali's unique ability in combos with companions is not easy at all! If on the one hand, in fact, the operator can prevent or annoy the typical Bandit trick, on the other she can also risk destroying the gadgets of the hard breachers resting on the walls (Charges of Thermite and Hibana Pellets). For this reason, therefore, we are firmly convinced that the new operator with 2 Armor points and 2 Speed is balanced in every aspect: not at all easy to manage, it requires coordination and precision to be used to the best of its possibilities. Operation Shifting Tides also introduces a Kenyan defender with enormous physical and spiritual potential: we are talking about Ngg Muchoki ~Wamai~ Furaha, also a member of Nighthaven. As for its equipment, Wamai does not bring great news, we have all known the resources at its disposal for some time: they range from the MP5K of Mute to the AUG A2 of IQ, from the Keratos of the GIS to the P12 of the GSG 9. Unlike Kali, in her case we don't have new mouths of fire and it's a bit sad. The operator is already very interesting, but even a single rifle or an innovative secondary would have been enough to make it even more attractive. The only kind of intoxication that can be experienced while examining the card of its equipment, therefore, lies in the choice of the pair of weapons to bring into battle: in our opinion the AUG A2 wins hands down over the alternative - even being able to accessorize the ACOG - while the challenge between Keratos and P12 is almost on par, but opting for the latter almost seems to play using IQ. Unlike the German operator, however, you will be slightly slower, but also more resistant: Wamai has 2 Armor and 2 Speed points. We have said, however, that the new defender offers himself as an alternative to Jger and does so thanks to his unique ability which consists of 5 Mag-NET Systems. Wamai refines an idea already seen a few times in Siege - with Dokkaebi, first, and with Mozzie, then - even improving it: instead of destroying or canceling the effect of the opponents' gadgets, the Kenyan reuses them in his own favor. Starting with only one magnetic disc at the beginning of the round, the defender begins to generate more over time (one every 40 seconds) and, in the meantime, can place the ones in his possession anywhere, as they are completely adhesive. The Mag-NET, once active, is capable of attracting one and only one object fired/thrown by the assailants. All sorts of gadgets are affected by these ~hi-tech frisbees~: flashbangs, grenades, smoke bombs, missiles and darts... no one is safe! Once one of these projectiles has been captured, the Mag-NET resets the detonation timer, making it start from scratch (useful mechanic to know, especially in the case of grenades), but does not cancel the effect, transforming it into a real trap for the previous owner and his companions. During our games, for example, we happened to throw a grenade to free the site, but to see it deviate towards the point where the defuser was placed, causing a teamkill and a defeat (yes... it wasn't at all pleasant). To make the most of Wamai, therefore, it is necessary to be familiar with the maps, the most common access points and, perhaps, those of the plant. By hiding the magnets well, it is possible to catch the opponents off guard and cause daring situations, useful for subverting the fate of a round. What is difficult, however, is to define the role of this operator: he was presented to us as an anchor, but his nature also allows him to create havoc among the enemy ranks in the first defense external to the site with the risk, however, of not be able to place all of its Mag-NETs. The decision, therefore, is placed in the hands of the players. Solid foundations for the meta, we start from here! The most important news notthey concern only new operators, but also those who for one reason or another have found themselves going out of line, going to unbalance the goal of the game in previous seasons. The change with the highest priority was certainly the one for Jackal: the Spanish operator, due to his skill, had become a thorn in the side and canceled any type of tactics on the part of the defenders. The tracking ability of his Eyenox helmet was far too invasive and frustrating and led the development team to rework it to make it less powerful over time: the older a defender's footprints (identifiable by different colors and traits), the less is the number of pings following a scan. Although the nerf seems to have succeeded in its intent, however, the problem does not seem to have been completely solved and an indication of this is certainly the high number of bans, during the appropriate phase at the beginning of the matches, which continue to involve the 'striker. The one who deserved some love from Ubisoft, however, was Glaz. With the arrival of Kali, the Russian sniper was in real danger of disappearing from the meta and so two aspects of his OTs-03 have been revised. The rate of fire of the rifle has been increased by as much as 33%, allowing the operator to fire almost in bursts, until the magazine is depleted, and its thermal sight has been enhanced: even when completely depleted, it is now able to slightly highlight the opponents. The game community does not seem to be completely convinced of this buff, considered perhaps a bit exaggerated, but we are confident and think more time is needed to appreciate its long-term effects. The other important upgrade concerns Kaid and, more specifically, his Rtila. The Moroccan defender, prior to Operation Shifting Tides, was able to electrify a maximum of two side-by-side reinforced walls with each of his gadgets, due to the reduced range. Probably also to balance the gadget of the new Indian attacker, the developers have decided to increase the area of competence of each Rtila and therefore allow the electrical coverage of three reinforcements close to each other. Other notable changes concern the increased dispersion of the shots of some shotguns (FO-12 of Ela and SASG-12 of the Russians), the introduction of the ACOG for the BOSG 12.2 of Vigil and Dokkaebi and the modification to the functioning of the grappling hook (now a button press is required to leave it). Amusement Park, now we think! The real masterpiece of this DLC is definitely the rework of Parco Amusement. Exactly as promised at the beginning of the year, during the specific panel of the Six Invitational, one of the least appreciated maps by Siege players has been completely transformed, while keeping some main areas intact. Overall, two issues were identified as causing players to feel bad and both have been resolved. First of all, the lighting of the entire structure has been revised: while maintaining the ~abandoned building~ style, even the most abandoned areas do not allow you to take advantage of the darkness to take your opponents off guard. Every corner is clearly visible and it is much easier to use drones and cameras to scan the corridors. Secondly, all those unnecessarily labyrinthine and complex areas (such as the Gargoyle Room and the neighboring rooms) have been completely removed to make room for more spacious environments and stylistically in line with the origins of the map. As the two wings of the building move closer together, through the complete reworking of what was previously the monorail area, the bomb sites all become more manageable for both attackers and defenders. At this point, therefore, we are looking forward to discovering the new tactics that will be developed by the players and, in particular, if the work put in place has been convincing enough to bring this map to the competitive scene.", "date": "2019-12-10", "grade": "8.3"}
