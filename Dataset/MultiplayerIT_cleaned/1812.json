{"name": "NBA Live 2003", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nba-live-2011.html", "text": "Let the game start The presentation is not the most exciting we have seen and, above all, as a first impact, it does not at all convey the goodness of the graphics present in this title. Jerky animations, confusing actions and lackluster colors raise the bitter prospect of a sequel not living up to expectations in the player. And yet none of this. The gameplay is excellent, the fluidity and completeness of the animations excellent and the colors strong and lively. I wonder if EA programmers have ever wondered what is offered in stores and on television for advertising: the presentation or phases taken from the game? No need to comment. In any case, returning to the presentation, once the sequence of baskets and tricks has been completed, we arrive at the selection screen of the various modes, where the real novelty present in this game stands out, which raises it to one of the best basketball titles ever, namely the Freestyle mode. Freestyle is an innovative control system that allows us, by moving the right analog stick, to perform an impressive series of feints, passes and crossed dribbles, removals, immediate lateral movements, spins and the legendary triple threat from the post position, aspects that make the game action much more varied and frenetic, even if not too immediate. Depending on the game situation and the movement made with the stick, the player we control will react differently, allowing us with a little practice to come across complex attack and defense strategies. The possibility of stopping and holding the ball with one hand and then groped for the breakthrough is remarkable. All these techniques are fully explained in a tutorial divided into beginner and advanced sections at the beginning of the game. Going forward in the title and with the relative practice, it will thus be possible to create real styles of play, managing to combine various previously learned moves. The final result: exciting and profoundly unrealistic, given that once all the techniques have been learned perfectly, the score percentage will be too high for a real simulation. All this is perfect when compared to an arcade, and it is precisely in this that NBA Live gives its best, managing not to annoy the purist too much and winking at the geek player. Excuse me can I have a franchise team? Well yes, there is also football... err basketmarket. Or rather: how to bring together Football Manager with basketball. All much more simplified of course, but in the role of the general manager of your team, you have to make fantasy market exchanges and assist or, if you want to play, games with the new signings, all over the course of a season. It will obviously be necessary to take into account both the actual qualities of the various players and obviously the salary they receive. Among the various game modes, however, we must remember the classic ~season~ as well as the inevitable ~playoffs~ and ~1Vs1~. This only increases, and not a little, the longevity of a game which, however, makes the videogame basketball summa of the challenge with a human counterpart. But do you have a subscription to the NBA on TV? From a purely aesthetic point of view, nothing to complain about the animations and models of the players, never so real and with an incredible level of reproduction of the player's expressions. Between one action and the next, depending on whether a basket is scored or immediately, interlude scenes will start automatically with the reactions of the benches, a real blast. Furthermore, those who follow the NBA will not fail to recognize the faces of Tracy McGrady or Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan or Shaquille O'Neal as well as Ben Wallace, Aaron McKie or Vince Carter, all perfectly reproduced. Small, but not too much, a note of demerit goes to the management of the cameras, which often makes viewing the playing field difficult or incomplete. By trying all the various options and settings we were not able to get the same feeling of domination on the field given for example by Winning Eleven with the Far option. Too bad, better management of this aspect would have given more depth to the action. Turn off MTV! As always, EA spares no expense on the audio front, and spares no expense in hiring the best musical artists. This time it's the turn of some of the most acclaimed hip-hop singers on the US scene. It is enough to mention Snoop Dogg, Fabolous, Busta Rhymes and Angie Martinez, to give an idea of the effort made for the success of this title. Very well done the commentary, all in English, as well as the classic American arena chants. Comment EA really amazed me this time. I expected to find the usual updated game with new stats and values and just a fewhe improvements here and there, and instead NBA Live 2003 is a title full of energy and with the ingenious innovation of Freestyle control. If you think NBA 2K3 is the best of the best, now there is a more than worthy rival in the square. In my opinion the best basketball title out there, highly recommended to all fans. Pro Freestyle Mode Animations Longevity Cons Cameras Presentation If there was online play... ...2001,2002,2003... Punctual to the call, EA Games offers the update of its flagship titles, i.e. sports simulations, as every year. Madden, NHL and of course NBA Live too. Perhaps, however, the word ~update~ clashes a little too much with the true spirit that animates this new incarnation of the most famous basketball title in the world. The thing that is immediately noticeable is the perfect coexistence between arcade and simulation, but first things first.", "date": "2003-01-13", "grade": null}
