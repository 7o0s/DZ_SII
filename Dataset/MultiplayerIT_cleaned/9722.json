{"name": "Exo One", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/exo-one-recensione.html", "text": "That Exo One is inspired by 2001 A Space Odyssey is immediately understood: as soon as you enter the first dimensional tunnel, the space splits in two, producing psychedelic multicolored trails that closely recall one of the final moments of the film. Then, looking closer, you understand that it's not just that: a good part of the atmospheres of the game seem to be taken from Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, starting from the monolithic and purposeless buildings, belonging to who knows which civilization, which you meet while traveling on the planets, for arrive at the very goal of the journey we are on. A cosmic fetus is missing, but we can be satisfied with the egg on which we travel at breakneck speed, which in theory has no place to even house the pilot. How do we check it? It matters little to know. Exo One is a metaphysical experience, as well as a really difficult review to write because the risk of trivializing it is really very high. Sensations The planets of Exo One are beautiful One of the planets that we will have to cross is made up only of water: an immense expanse of ocean to be overcome at full speed while gigantic waves threaten our race. Impossible not to immediately grasp the reference to one of the most spectacular and successful sequences of Christoper Nolan's Interstellar. Yet the suggestion created by the video game is very different from that of the film, in a certain sense stronger, because we are somehow facing that sea directly. We can admire its immense power by entering it. The predominant feeling that the entire level transmits is an overwhelming form of anguish, a kind of feeling of the sublime that accompanies us all along the way, between the astonishment in front of the movement of all that virtual water and the discomfort given by the lack of precise reference points, apart from the inevitable and very distant light of yet another portal that we have to reach. When our spherical ship sinks into the water, everything becomes dark and the sense of loss becomes overwhelming: will we be able to re-emerge? The most obvious answer is yes, since we know perfectly well what to do to get us out of trouble (technically you can't even die, so why worry?), but in certain moments Exo One touches such deep strings that rationality ends almost atrophied, to give way to ancestral fears. Gameplay Some worlds convey a strong sense of anguish The Exo One player is like Friedrich's Wanderer over the Sea of Fog, only in constant motion. Nature dominates it manifesting itself in the forms of remote and silent planets, where the colossal and the ruin coexist and where life seems to be almost a misunderstanding. This rarefied beauty is probably the only real reason to play it, the core of the gameplay itself, on which the whole experience is based. Basically we are talking about a game in which you drive a sphere and roll it on the surfaces of huge planets full of spectacular landscapes, but otherwise completely empty. As already mentioned, the goal is always the same: to reach a portal that leads to the next planet. In addition to accelerating and braking, the sphere can also use a gravitational pull to gain speed, using the unevenness of the planets as ramps, or it can glide gracefully by flattening into a disc shape. On the way to the galactic portals, large brutalist-style tracks that stand out towards the sky, you can collect energy globes that increase the power of the sphere and you can go through micro portals that give a strong boost, helping us to reach our destination. Worlds Exo One has surreal worlds As you may have understood, each world has its own characteristics, which make the journey truly unique. For example, in one particular level you have to jump between asteroids that orbit around a giant Sun, juggling to free yourself from the larger asteroid's gravity. In another one travels in a world made of clouds, without ever touching the ground, but using the clouds themselves to recharge with energy. There is also a world covered in ice, another with islands floating above a vast ocean, and yet another filled with lush vegetation. In all of this, the developers also try to tell us a story, as simple as it is suggestive, above all by virtue of the visionary ending, which gives meaning to the whole journey. All he needs are short interlude sequences, mostly made up of dialogues, to do this. Having said that, Exo One never gets lost in explanations, creating exquisite narrative voids in which the right sense of the indefinite finds space. The stylistic choice to leave most of the hinterlandthe game on the vague works really well, because after all it is more fascinating to drive an alien sphere belonging to a civilization of which we know nothing, than to get lost in the thousand details of a false mythology, which would still be unsatisfactory. On the other hand, why should there be an explanation?", "date": "2021-11-24", "grade": "9.0"}
