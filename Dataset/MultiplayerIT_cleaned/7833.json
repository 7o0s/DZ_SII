{"name": "Maximus 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/maximus-2-recensione.html", "text": "The Maximus 2 review takes us back to the funny cartoonish atmospheres of the scrolling fighting game developed by Four Fats, which returns to iOS and Android almost ten years after the series' debut with an even richer chapter in quotes from the great SEGA classics, but not alone. In fact, if the starting material used by the small development team is undoubtedly the famous Golden Ax, there is no shortage of references to other iconic titles of the late 80s, including the equally famous Final Fight. Among the selectable characters, however, we find a sort of Prince Adam of the poor, the Natural Disasters couple that wrestling fans will certainly remember, a sorceress and an archer. Structure Maximus 2, there is no shortage of rideable beasts The Maximus 2 experience is mainly expressed within a campaign that includes several chapters and a large number of enemies and bosses, but which can be completed within an hour... just like the aforementioned Golden Axe. Of course, to succeed in the enterprise you have to resort to the five free ~continues~ and unlock someone else by watching advertising trailers. In general, the approach to the freemium model of the game appears decidedly permissive, with no particular waiting times or energy limit our progression, and it is probably also for this reason that it is possible to get to the end without too many problems. Clearly those who want to reward the authors for this conduct can do so by opting for one of the microtransactions available in-game, with the 4.99 one that removes the ads and lets you get various extra content. Speaking of content, the Maximus 2 campaign should be completed twice, at the normal and high difficulty level, in order to access the true ending. This alternation gives meaning to the character enhancement system, which in the first game you will only scratch, but at the same time highlights some major limitations of the game, which we will discuss shortly. Then there is the online cooperative mode for four participants: an essential feature for such a production, which works fairly well and allows you to select the room we want to join, and then face the pitfalls that await the protagonists of the adventure together along the way. Gameplay Maximus 2, Otis is inspired by Earthquake and how he hits hard Beyond the numbers of the campaign, the focus of Maximus 2 is clearly on the gameplay, and it can certainly be said that the developers have done a great job in rendering the impacts and enriching the characters' repertoire with extra maneuvers that are unlocked gradually and add a pinch of variety to the action, but which nevertheless fit within the framework of a control system that is not exactly perfect. In fact, our fighter moves too quickly and lightly, does not express the right weight and is ~slippery~ in moments when more precision would be needed, such as when you have to jump or avoid traps: phases that prove to be particularly frustrating, as well as when the screen is crowded with enemies and you no longer understand where you are or can defend yourself from attacks. Graphics and sound Maximus 2, the characters riding a huge falcon: what does it remind you of? Stylistically, Maximus 2 carries on the cartoony approach of the first episode, with graphics halfway between Scribblenauts and Castle Crashers, but with clear animation influences from series such as Family Guy. There are some inevitable simplifications, but they seem almost intentional and the final result is therefore very nice and colorful. In addition to the protagonists and their repertoire of actions, there are really many different enemies and bosses, as well as very peculiar scenarios that we will find ourselves crossing between one fight and another. The sound accompanies these transitions in a discreet way, without standing out.", "date": "2022-04-23", "grade": "7.3"}
