In the case of Don't Starve, available on Steam since last April, the core of the gameplay is - as the title suggests - avoiding starvation; however it is only one aspect of the experience, which sees us suddenly projected into the middle of an inhospitable forest, with the task of providing for three basic needs (feeding, preserving one's physical and mental safety) that can be satisfied in many more ways the longer our stay in the world of the living is. The character we initially control, Wilson, is not a man of action, but a meek scientist who decides to exploit his knowledge to survive this ordeal, and does so first by collecting plants, grass and stones, so as to build a rudimentary accept; then by cutting down some trees to obtain logs of wood with which to feed torches or campfires, indispensable for facing the night and possibly cooking the prey that we manage to capture by preparing traps. All within a day that obviously passes at an accelerated pace and which alternates daytime hours in which to obtain materials and hunt, evening hours in which to fine-tune the last preparations and night hours in which to rest in front of the fire, paying attention to never venture into the dark without a light source. In fact, terrible and mysterious creatures lurk in the dark, which only take a few seconds to wound us to death. And, speaking of death, this concept in Don't Starve appears more definitive than ever. Don't Starve offers an interesting, rich and particular survival experience, even if repetitive P-p-p-p-p-p-permadeath! Well yes, we are dealing with a pure and hard survival, which tests our tenacity and our inventiveness as much as our patience, given that the regime of permadeath, definitive death, is in force, and this means that at game over we will lose all the progress made and all the objects obtained, with the obligation to start over the next game. The only element of progression in Don't Starve is represented by experience points, which accumulate reaching an ever-increasing duration and allow you to unlock eight other characters, each with unique skills. There is, for example, the pyromaniac girl, who is not injured when she comes into contact with fire, or the circus strongman, lethal with a bat in his hand but at the same time extremely fearful of the dark, and so on. Testing these variables is certainly interesting, but the underlying problem of losing progress every time you die remains. There are titles in which the harshness of such a choice is softened by the possibility of searching for and recovering the objects lost by our ~predecessor~, objects which also jump away when we are killed, but in Don't Starve unfortunately this is not possible and you really have to resign yourself to doing it all over again. With greater awareness, of course, and with a clearer idea of the advanced objects that we can build once certain elements have been collected; but still with the obligation to repeat the tedious phase of departure over and over again, which makes the experience frustrating on the one hand and inevitably repetitive on the other. Playstation 4 trophies Don't Starve includes only ten Trophies, most of which can be obtained simply by spending some time playing the game. In fact, eight trophies are awarded simply by unlocking the various characters, while the other two, secret ones, are obtained by building and using one of the most complex structures available. Okay, but... In short, permadeath, at least in its toughest and most ruthless sense, represents a decisive factor with respect to the usability of this interesting indie game, which you could absolutely hate or love madly, depending on what you will be able to see in its offer. Because let's face it, Don't Starve has a lot, a lot to give to those who decide to accept its terms. It starts from a stylistically peculiar and very pleasant graphic sector, a sort of cardboard representation of a storybook created by Tim Burton, with extremely bizarre characters and creatures, which move in a world generated by a procedural system that makes each game different on the other and which can be customized from the options screen to have more or fewer monsters, more or fewer trees, a different season, and so on. In support we have a sound accompaniment up to the situation, devoid of real voices (the ~dialogues~ are vaguely similar soundsthem to those of The Legend of Zelda) but with well done music and great atmosphere. And then of course there is the gameplay, at first made a little difficult by the configuration of the controls, with the backbones that open a ~cross~ menu which in the left column shows the various categories of objects that can be built, in the row below the resources collected, accumulated by type. The menus are navigated using the analog sticks and present various options for each object, which can be activated by pressing the directional cross, so it goes without saying that at the beginning you feel a little awkward and it takes some time to familiarize yourself with this setting. Once this obstacle has been overcome, however, things mesh quickly and you immediately enter the crafting mechanism that makes the Don't Starve experience so pleasant, given that there are so many things that can be built and they become more complex as the Our survival stretches as the virtual days go by. Too bad for the lack of a translation of the texts into Italian, finally.", "date": "2014-01-16", "grade": "8.0"}
