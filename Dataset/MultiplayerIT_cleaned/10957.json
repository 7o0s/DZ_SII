{"name": "Hotel Giant 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hotel-giant-2-recensione.html", "text": "Let's say we find ourselves at the reception and see a shady, bewildered figure of our acquaintance arrive, accompanied by a perturbing blonde wearing a mini-mini dress, so mini that it would be better to cover it with the business cards you have on the counter; it would be appropriate to greet him with a: ~Hi, Rubbini?~ Or would it be better to pretend not to know him and simulate the usual divine indifference? Maybe drinking lemonade (this is subtle)? Hotel Giant 2 will allow us to answer this and many other fundamental questions for our daily existence (or not). The latest effort by Enlight Software is a management system that has its roots in the classics of the past (such as Theme Park, for example) and which tries to wink at modern life simulators by adding a pinch of voyeurism that does not never bad. As soon as the game is started, it will be possible to choose whether to face one of the tutorials, useful if you have not played the previous chapter, whether to take part in the campaign, divided into 15 scenarios of increasing complexity, whether to face a random game, whose lines can be set guide, or whether to play a free game, in which three fully furnished and fully operational hotels are made available (good for having an example of what to do... in an operational sense, they are more useful than tutorials). Obviously the main mode, the one that gives the most satisfaction, is the campaign, even if in principle the purpose of each one can be summed up in having to manage a hotel and making it as profitable as possible, maximizing the number and customer satisfaction. Easy to say but definitely more difficult to do, due to the many variables that must be considered. Your satisfaction is our best reward The first choice to make is to decide the architecture of your hotel: there are some more or less modern buildings divided into various floors. So, with one eye on the budget and one on quality, we need to start giving shape to the dreams of the guests, who are actually quite demanding and always ready to criticize the slightest flaw in the construction. Obviously a good part of the gameplay is centered around the editor that allows you to create, modify or tear down the different rooms. At the beginning it will be necessary to face the typical cumbersomeness of the genre but, having understood the functioning of the commands, it will not be difficult to bring up one's masterpieces. Is there a need to create small economic rooms to attract wallet-conscious users? No problem: select the floor, create a new room which automatically becomes a model, which can always be recalled in the editor and which can be given a name indicative of its characteristics, furnish it, build the internal rooms (for example a restaurant it also needs space for the kitchen and toilets, while any guest room must contain at least a small bathroom with shower, if you don't want to receive protests and complaints all the time) and that's it. If the model is good and you want to exploit it so as not to have to recreate each room from scratch, just select it from the appropriate menu to be able to replicate it with a couple of clicks. The furniture is made up of numerous objects, which vary according to the type of room; for example, in a billiard room it will not be possible to place a bed with a canopy, while it will be the case to place a snack machine and a juke box to entertain the players. Each environment has its own peculiarities and must be placed carefully, if you want to make it functional to the hotel's economy of space... and don't forget to build the access doors to the bathrooms, as a certain editor did let's name. Satisfy everyone A well-established hotel takes some time to create (much depends on practice with the editor and the validity of the models created), but once set up it starts to give satisfaction while, from a management point of view, it makes it even more the situation is complex, since customer complaints tend to multiply and following everything becomes frenetic (fortunately there is a pause button). Obviously, with the growth of the activity, the personnel, the controls and consequently the management costs increase. Finally, the need to invest in advertising to attract customers should not be forgotten; without marketing you go nowhere. In short, you may be wondering: we have built a successful five-story hotel, we have customers who come from all over the world, the curtains in the rooms are of the best quality, the gym, the swimming pool, the shopping area and all the other built structures attract rivers of people who bring rivers of money; but what does all this produce that is beautiful to see?A bit of everything, one would have to answer. The graphics engine is slightly sparing of details and the visual style is flat, limiting itself to doing its job and that's it, probably in honor of the serious imprint that we wanted to give to the entire production. The activities of guests and hotel staff are varied and largely depend on what you have built. Let's say that in the first games it's fun to watch, even if you have created a perfectly functional hotel that needs very few tweaks, while in the following games you tend to let time flow quickly, also because the three-dimensional models are not very varied and get tired quickly . Comment Hotel Giant 2 is a solid management game that has its structural roots in the many titles of the same genre that preceded it. It doesn't disappoint, but it doesn't add anything really new. Considering the different modes and the high replayability, we believe it will captivate you for many weeks, if not months, if you like the idea of having to manage a hotel.
