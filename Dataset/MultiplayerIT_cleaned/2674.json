{"name": "DEEP FIGHTER", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/deep-fighter.html", "text": "In the blue painted blue!!! In the first missions, you will pass with ease from escort tasks to those of disinfestation, from hunting pirates to that of fish restocking manager, bringing female fish to the Fish Farm, but above all convincing the reluctant male fish with strong manners, to copulate with the heated females previously escorted into the alcove. All this to the advantage of the player who remains displaced in expectations and is pleasantly surprised to discover tasks to be carried out that are always varied and never predictable. Fighting under water has always scared me a little... In support of this, the graphics sector does its job very well. The introductory movies are decently made. Sporadically they report shelling, but the actors are in part and incredible to say they also play with dignity. The 3D models are very well done: the different types of submarines are easily recognizable, in addition the coating textures are well defined, as well as the use of the sub's equipment. whether they are weapons or simple work tools. Particular mention should be given to the creation of a credible submerged fauna: there are many species of fish that live around the city, and all well done and full of details, which highlight the goodness of the textures used. The city structures are also of excellent workmanship and truly imposing and massive. The inevitable sore point concerns the not excellent speed of the game; everything is very fluid, there are no signs of noticeable slowdowns, but those who expect to hurtle through the abyss as if they were piloting an F-16 may be disappointed. The title also offers the possibility of switching to 60htz, but at the same speed, the Pal mode is much more defined and appreciable. The sound sector also stands on the levels of excellence of the graphics: the samplings are excellent, the noises of underwater life perfectly recreated and consequently contribute a lot to the general impression of atmosphere typical of films like The Abyss. But playability is the strong point of the entire Criterion operation. The control system is a masterpiece: far from perfect, the Dreamcast pad seems designed especially for this title. Despite the many keys to learn, you are immediately at ease in maneuvering your submarine. Fighting under water has always scared me a little... The only difficulty, if it actually is, concerns the management of the digital pad, which hides all the functions that would normally be relegated to the co-pilot, and which, when you are a beginner, can sometimes be complicated and fairly confusing especially for as far as the use of the map is concerned, ten minutes and everything passes anyway. The aforementioned non-linearity of the missions is the flagship of Deep Fighter. In short, there is not a single way to finish the missions, it is how they are completed that influences the development of the game's storyline, a bit like it happens in modern flight simulators on PCs. So completing the game doesn't mean you've seen it all, and playing it again is the only way you can say you've completed it 100%. In addition, the game is extremely fun, and in the situations in which the dogfighting becomes more intense, the frenzy and compulsiveness of the action are the masters, and the fact of being underwater, and not in the air, darting at Mach2 he is not regretted, on the contrary the total freedom of movement allows numbers worthy of the best X-Wing pilot. In the blue painted blue!!! In Deep Fighter you will take on the role of Moray 2, a cadet fresh from the academy who, starting from the bottom, will have to rise in rank in the submarine forces of the Colony, fighting the Shadowkin pirates, but also carrying out numerous missions, original and with extremely varied modalities. Much more prosaically, the Criterion title puts us at the wheel of different types of submarines, using a cockpit view, to tackle the most diverse tasks, with a non-linear game structure that is very reminiscent of titles such as X-Wing Alliance.", "date": "2000-11-16", "grade": null}
