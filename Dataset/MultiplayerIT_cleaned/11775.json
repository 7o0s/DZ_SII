{"name": "Uncharted: Drake's Fortune - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/uncharted-drakes-fortune-recensione.html", "text": "Less talk, more lead During our test we completed the game in about ten hours at the highest difficulty level, an average longevity for a title of this kind but satisfactory in light of how the story and gameplay develop, and which is enriched by the numerous extras present, represented above all by an additional level of difficulty and by a system very similar to the objectives for 360, although not linked to any gamertag. Points are obtained for each pre-established action (up to a maximum of 1000) which unlock bonuses and rewards of different types, such as the possibility of restarting the game with some weapons available, infinite ammunition, the inverted game scenario, some filters for black and white and sepia, not counting the various bonus films that illustrate the development of the game, the creation of the audio, the characters and so on. During the course of the adventure, a further incentive to explore is given by the search for small treasures scattered in the most hidden corners, for a total of 60, which also contribute to unlocking the aforementioned rewards. In any case, the nature of the game lends itself well to a possible second game, precisely because of the clashes that are always fun, to exploration that is never frustrating, and to the beautiful technical sector, to which we refer. Less talk, more lead Indiana Drake The game scheme is structured in two large sections, which include a platform part and a combat part, alternating between them and seasoned with cut scenes that deepen the plot and act as a glue for the advancement during the adventure, divided overall into twenty-two chapters. In the first sections, the stupendous setting that forms the background to the title takes center stage, with lush forests, waterfalls, sunsets, submerged cities and so on, which often require Drake's athletic skills to be reached, who can jump, grab onto spikes and lianas and unlock passages through some puzzles that are actually present in small numbers and rather simple. Thanks to the excellent control system and the camera, which despite being manual always follows the player offering the best view near any protrusions, these sections are quite pleasant and well thought out, keeping frustration or problems due to wrong choices well away of programmers. In fact, with the X key you jump, with the triangle you collect the ammunition scattered on the playing field, with L1 you activate the viewfinder and with R1 you shoot, while the circle is delegated to the use of cover through one of the numerous elements of the scenario used for this purpose. To make the idea clear, Uncharted's combat borrows and reworks mechanics from Gears of War, as regards the ~shoot and cover~, and from Resident Evil 4, when leaving the L1 key pressed, the camera approaches and sees Nathan slightly moved to the right or left (just press L3 to choose one of the two configurations) with the crosshair to aim at opponents. The result is extremely positive, also thanks to the good artificial intelligence that characterizes the enemies. Indiana Drake During the firefights, the opponents work together to try as much as possible to track down Drake, some in fact take cover and start shooting, others use sniper rifles complete with a laser sight, others still try to get around him or throw grenades to make him change position . This sense of cooperation is further enhanced by their voices, which they use to indicate Nathan's location and whereabouts. In this case, therefore, the solution, especially at higher difficulty levels (there are three initially available) is to move often between the various shelters, and first of all eliminate the most dangerous enemies, those who hurl themselves against us or who shoot from great distances. There is no shortage of diversions, such as a beautiful section on the jeep (unfortunately unique) and a couple on the jet ski above a submerged city, ending with pure open-face clashes with one of the many weapons available, the variety of which can just complain. Uncharted: Drake's Fortune is available for PlayStation 3. News has recently arrived in the newsroom that Lara Croft is looking for a new partner, with the previous one she did not share any passion and therefore the story ended after a short time and in a bad way. We could suggest Nathan Drake, handsome and enterprising treasure hunter who wants to follow in the footsteps of his ancestor Sir Francis Drake, English captain who in the sixteenth century set sail with his fleet towards the Panamanian coast to plunder the city of Nombre d Dios, repository of a treasure tas precious as it is mysterious. Accompanying Drake in his research are Elena Fisher, television reporter, and Victor Sullivan, mentor and map expert. Imagine then if the presence of someone else interested in this phantom treasure could have been missing, followed by a large group of mercenaries who will represent one of the major obstacles for Drake during the course of the adventure. The points of contact with Tomb Raider end here, Uncharted is an action/adventure that draws liberally from other productions, offering a fortunately little inflated setting and represented in the smallest details. Remember the movie ~Romancing the Stone~? Well, you will have an idea of what sensations playing the title developed by Naughty Dog will give you back. Comment It doesn't claim to be a masterpiece, it doesn't offer ideas or mechanics that cry out for originality, but Uncharted: Drake's Fortune is an extremely enjoyable and fun title, which offers solid combat mechanics and platform sections supported by an excellent control system and from a camera that always does its job. It mimics b-movies and some adventure films and it succeeds perfectly, if we add to this an audio and video sector of the highest level, we can only define the latest effort by Naughty Dog as an obligatory choice for all owners of PlayStation 3. Nathan, keep a part of the treasure for us too! Pros Technically excellent Great controls and camera Good combat system Replayable and with many extras Cons Too simplistic puzzle sections Underdeveloped secondary characters Few original ideas", "date": "2007-11-30", "grade": null}
