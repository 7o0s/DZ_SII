{"name": "Giganti giardinieri", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/119005-reus-giganti-giardinieri.html", "text": "If you seek omnipotence, the whim of the despotic divinity, who descends among men to be worshiped or feared, this is the wrong game. Each game begins without frills, with an uninhabited and barren planet on which four giants awaken, manifestations of its vital power. The aim of the game is to create a natural environment that attracts the presence of man and then provide him with an ecosystem capable of supporting his development projects. To do this we have to get lost in the micromanagement of a complex and laborious system, full of data to evaluate and relationships between the elements to consider. In the beginning, however, the games last only thirty minutes, after which the giants fall asleep and the game is over. During these matches we have to try to achieve new objectives to level up and unlock matches of sixty and one hundred and twenty minutes. As playing time increases, so does the progress that humans can aspire to. Unfortunately there is no connection between us (the four giants) and the men, who silently continue on their way. Of course, after some stages of social development an ambassador shows up to ride one of the four giants, but this gesture only serves to unlock new abilities. The feeling of infinite and absolute power, the prerogative of a deity, is denied to us in Reus. We are meticulous gardeners and managers busy solving intricate management problems until time runs out. Don't get us wrong, there is a certain satisfaction in achieving prosperity goals or successfully managing three human settlements, but it is a pleasure far from that of feeling ourselves the architects of the destiny of an entire race. If we decide to suppress a human settlement, nothing tragic happens: we are just efficient children who plane a sand castle with a shovel to shape a more beautiful one. It's a gaming experience that's hard to describe. Reus looks like a sandbox, but it's also a casual game, with its short games that don't foresee any failure, and at the same time it hides a difficult management system to master, which imposes precise choices. All in a neat and attractive package. So let's surrender to its nature and find out in detail, because this game can only be understood if seen closely. Colossal patience At the beginning of each game we have to create a habitable land. We can use the giant of the seas to create an ocean and then next to it use the giant of the swamps or the one of the forests to create an exotic and swampy environment or a lush green forest. Conversely, the mountain giant does not need water to generate a vast desert. Once the natural base has been chosen, it is sufficient to deposit a resource and the first human settlement comes to life. Reus works well from the first moment and proceeds step by step. War, for example, is a problem that we will never have to face in thirty-minute games, as well as greed, a factor linked to the excessive availability of resources compared to those necessary. In any case, even the bellicosity of human beings or the degree of danger within the borders of the village are not negative aspects, but cogs in the complex mechanism of balances that regulate Reus, in short, tools to be used to our advantage. The real difficulty of the game lies in the system of symbiosis and transmutation. Each village has a very limited area and in the few spaces available we have to place our resources close to each other so that they generate symbiosis. Unfortunately we are not free to do as we please: the village initiates the next development project by itself and we have to provide it with the necessary resources within the time limit. If symbioses increase resource production, transmutations evolve plants and animals to the next stage. The problem is that the skills are distributed among the giants in such a way that they cross over. So if we plant blackberries with the giant of the forest we must then make them evolve using the powers of the giant of the oceans, for example. Not to mention that depending on which giant welcomes an ambassador, different development possibilities open up. Furthermore, if we have more villages on the map we must plan well the sequence of orders to be given to the giants, since they take geological ages to move. To complicate the situation is added the fact that in this puzzle game there is no summary table of the evolutionary ramifications. To find out what a certain combination will produce, we are forced to exit the game and consult the Wiki page indicated in the main menu. This means that we will have to memorize all the combinations or lose ttime to make and unmake symbiosis. Moreover, the lines of development are very unintuitive. Strawberries for example provide food, but when they transform into trees similar to weeping willows they increase the supply of technological resources, which, you will understand, makes very little sense. Just as the fact that it is the giant of the oceans that develops a chicken coop is not what is called a logical consequence. On the other hand, when everything fits perfectly, Reus is a fantastic precision mechanism to admire. Populations develop before our eyes up to the atomic age, between synergies, genetic mutations and occasional regurgitation of violence and we enjoy the fruits of our work as a good craftsman does in front of his creation. Natural cycles Reus has left us mixed feelings. After leaving it for a few hours it's nice to come back for a game, because watching the ecosystem's natural gears flow smoothly elicits a sense of genuine amazement. Too bad it's a purposeless mechanism. The time limit is in fact a double-edged sword. On the one hand it takes away all meaning from what we do, destined as it is to be forgotten, on the other it offers the possibility of undertaking short self-contained sessions which often prove to be pleasant. Provided, however, that you have the Wiki of the game printed and close at hand. Unfortunately, every game always begins in the same way and the initial phases are quickly boring, above all because we cannot always aim for stimulating objectives: unlocking a new, almost invisible maritime species is not like going from the Middle Ages to the industrial age. And this is enough to dampen any ambition for greatness in a game that could aspire to greater wonders. In any case, Reus always welcomes us with its cleanliness in a lively and light-hearted world, full of loving details and which, if cultivated properly, oozes vitality from every clod. More than divinities, you will feel like an ecomanager cultivating a garden with painstaking patience", "date": "2013-05-31", "grade": "7.8"}
