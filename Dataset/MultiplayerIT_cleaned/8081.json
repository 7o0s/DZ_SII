DotEmu has collected these titles and enclosed them in a single compilation for iOS and Android devices, adding new modes and two different options regarding the touch control system: fast or arcade. In the first case, the movements of the fingers control the spacecraft producing larger movements, while in the second case, the game remains faithful to the original games. As for the modes, however, in addition to the classic one, you can face the individual missions unlocked or even try your hand at a ~training~ to become familiar with the mechanics before launching headlong into the action. A lot of stuff but with some problems Nostalgics of the series created by Seibu Kaihatsu will appreciate the conversion work carried out by DotEmu. The developers have in fact managed to create a very convincing upscaling of the graphics and anything but ~pixelated~, although the resolution of the first episode was just 256 x 224 pixels. In short, aesthetically the original Raiden certainly feels the weight of the years but has been carefully transported to current mobile devices, while the situation of the various Raiden Fighters is clearly better because they are more recent productions. However, translating an arcade shooter on iOS and Android is a job that goes beyond a purely technical discourse, and anyone who has been able to try the excellent conversions of Cave titles knows it well. What we mean is that beyond the good visual impact and the extra options, much more needed to be done with regard to the control system, which even with the ~fast~ option activated doesn't hold a candle to the reactivity and precision offered by the various Bug Princess or DoDonPachi. The movement of the fingers on the screen must in fact be very limited and produce large movements of the spacecraft, rather than offering us 1 to 1 movements, forcing us to drag our fingers several times to cover the entire area, with obvious repercussions in the most agitated phases. If we add to this an above-average rate of enemy fire, which therefore requires instantaneous reactions, it goes without saying that the final result can only leave us dissatisfied. While waiting for an update that can remedy this limitation, it must however be said that Raiden Legacy puts four games on the plate at a fraction of the price of any Cave shooter and that, as already mentioned, the opportunity is tempting for those who wants to relive the emotions felt in the arcade twenty years ago.", "date": "2012-12-28", "grade": "7.0"}
