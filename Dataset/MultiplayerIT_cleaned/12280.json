{"name": "Pokemon Ranger - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pokemon-ranger-recensione.html", "text": "Playing with Styler... Needless to say, the Pokemon Ranger of the title will be the player himself: the very long tutorial will in fact introduce us to life in the Fiore region, where a handful of specialized Pokemon trainers, the Rangers, have the task of preserving nature and helping inhabitants and pokemon to live peacefully. The main tool of a Ranger is the Styler, with which it is possible to manipulate the pokemon without forcing them into the typical Pokeballs that have always been the means of control and capture in the various episodes of the series: obviously the Styler is actually our stylus, and its use is clearly the focus of the game. Basically, Pokemon Ranger recalls the classic episodes of the series, we will in fact be busy wandering around the Fiore region and its cities, carrying out the missions entrusted to us by our superiors, simultaneously filling up our PokeDex: the difference lies precisely in the mechanism with which pokemon will be caught and used. The contact between the sprite of our alter-ego and that of a wild pokemon will trigger the ~fight~ sequence, and on the screen we will find ourselves facing the pokemon in question, free to move and act in real time. No turn-based combat, therefore, the player will have the better of the pokemon by tracing circles around him: the more powerful the pokemon to capture, the more circles must be traced to capture it. It goes without saying that things will get more and more complicated, as if a pokemon breaks the lines we are tracing by moving or attacking them, not only will we have to start tracing them again to capture it, but we will simultaneously lose Styler energy and when this is empty we will have to deal with an inevitable Game Over. Halfway between an action-game and an RPG, Pokemon Ranger requires not only quick reflexes and a certain skill, but also a pinch of strategy, which comes into play with Pokemon Tactics: they are nothing more than the special abilities possessed by each pokemon in our group, which can be used to facilitate the capture of a pocket monster. For example, we will be able to create bubbles of water to imprison it, unleash paralyzing electric shocks, make it levitate, raise barriers of grass and more: the Pokemon Tactic must be used carefully, because it not only requires a certain amount of dedicated energy (accumulative tracing the circles) but also because once the power of a pokemon has been used, the latter will run away leaving our group. Similarly, using the powers of a pokemon out of combat, for example to burn a hedge, put out a fire or lift a boulder, we will lose the little monster in question, and it will be necessary to look for a new creature, often nearby, that has the powers necessary to solve a certain puzzle or to simplify a capture. Pokemon Styler is all here, a continuous replacement of pokemon implemented through captures and the use of various powers, while we proceed in the main adventure, from mission to mission, which as usual will see us opposed to the bad guys, the Team Rock, and his criminal ambitions. Pokemon and DS: a step forward Unlike the meager visual quality of the recent Pokemon Mystery Dungeon, which as already mentioned was designed for Game Boy Advance, Pokemon Ranger presents a convincing though certainly not spectacular technical realization. We especially appreciate the new sprites created for this adventure, less super-deformed than in the past, rich in animations and details, both in the case of the various human characters and in that of the pokemon: the latter, during the combat phases, show a considerable amount of animations, which makes the fights decidedly pleasant, thanks also to the various graphic effects used to reproduce the various special abilities of the pokemon, including flames, lightning and various amenities. The variety of settings and the bright colors contribute to making this spin-off decidedly interesting, from a visual point of view, which however still maintains that Game Boy Advance feeling, all two-dimensional, which certainly does not show the best of the Nintendo DS, but a step forward compared to the graphic and stylistic approach to which we had become accustomed. The same goes for the audio department, a mix of marches and jingles as pleasant as they are repetitive, as in every pokemon episode for ten years now: unfortunately the same can be said for the verses of the little creatures, which continue to be reproduced in the form of short and nasty samples. For many years the Pokemon animated series has accustomed us to the bizarre voices of pocket monsters, isn't it time to introduce them into the video game as well? Pokemon Ranger is a brilliant varietynte of a concept that begins to feel the weight of the years, and relies on the same idea: the simpler it is, the more fun it is. The capture system with the Styler is ingenious and well done, and from the beginning it is noticeable that there is more than meets the eye in those circles drawn around the pokemon. However, it remains an adventure for the little ones, and therefore extremely linear and at times repetitive, although decidedly well done from an aesthetic point of view, despite the two-dimensional realization often reminds you that more can be done on the Nintendo DS. Too bad for the placid and abominable Italian translation of places and people (it's hard not to find funny manga-style villains called Pietro and Claudio, sympathizing with Constantine and Doctor Frenesio, as well as wandering around Winterpoli or Villeestate... in a video game where the little creatures have names like Kangaskhan or Cyndaquil) and the absolute lack of any multiplayer mode. Pros: Simple and fun Fairly long-lived Graphically pleasing Cons: In the long run repetitive Audio mediocre Lack of mulitplayer mode A criticism that gamers repeatedly make of the renowned Pokemon series is that of stagnating a little too much in the original concept: despite the various changes, additions, refinements made from chapter to chapter, from the original Red / Blue pair for Game Boy Classic to the now imminent Pearl / Diamond duo for Nintendo DS, the series has always maintained a rather static design over the last ten years, which the general quality of production has never allowed to consider it a real flaw. Experiments have always been entrusted to smaller teams that have created some spin-offs of the mother series, generating really tasty titles such as Pokemon Pinball (Game Boy Advance) or Pokemon Snap (Nintendo 64). But it is not always easy to modify a certain concept, while remaining faithful, without distorting it by proposing something new and original at the same time, whose diversity is a distinctive but not alienating element: Pokemon Mystery Dungeon recently demonstrated this, which attempted to change the player's perspective, making him switch to the side of the Pokemon instead of putting him in the shoes of the usual human trainer. The result was only half successful, perhaps also because the DS version of the game (Squadra Blu) was nothing more than a porting of the original game programmed for Game Boy Advance (Squadra Rossa) without too many technical pretensions, and that on DS certainly has disfigured in the face of much more visually complex and satisfying products. So it's up to HAL Laboratory to propose the first, real title with Pokemon designed for Nintendo DS and, of course, the touch-screen could not be put aside.", "date": "2007-05-15", "grade": null}
