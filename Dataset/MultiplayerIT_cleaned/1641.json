{"name": "Silent Hill 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/silent-hill-15.html", "text": "Eraserheads The alternate realities of Silent Hill are a continual reference to David Lynch's filmography, and particularly in regards to his debut work, the visionary masterpiece EraserHead. Made in black and white and devoid of narrative devices to revive the surrealist cinema of the twenties, it is a sequence of meaningless events of which the interpreter Henry is an image like any other, destined to suffer for eternity in a dark and misfit environment, alternately silent or covered in terrifying noises. Silent Heaven Our journey to Silent Hill begins, or rather does not begin, with a dream. A brief hallucination, too realistic, from which the young Heather will wake up shortly after. Slightly dazed, she goes to a public telephone and talks serenely with her father, in an absolutely ordinary context. A middle-aged detective, apparently delegated to track her down, fits into the girl's daily life, annoying her so much that she tries to escape from him by going from the back. It is sunset, an unusual silence hovers in the air. The quiet takes over the torment, inexplicable noises of unknown origin reverberate the gloomy atmosphere. A mysterious woman's ravings about paradise seem to leave no doubt: we have been drawn into the circle of madness of the silent hill. However Silent Hill is quite far away, what will be the reasons for this sudden expansion? In this start, as already anticipated in the introduction, the decision to re-propose the apocalyptic tones of the first episode is evident, focusing on the sensation of terror generated by the alternative settings, this time clearly more hallucinatory and degraded. As in the works of David Lynch, there are even self-quotations, so much so that at times you have the sensation of witnessing a re-edition, mitigated only by Heather, one of the most notable interpreters in a video game. Her typically feminine sensitivity, highlighted by an expressiveness and an emotionality bordering on hysterical, makes James's existential depression obsolete, narrated mainly through the interior monologue. However, the introspective of Silent Hill 2 is still an essential part of the narrative technique, especially in the second part, where the psychological devices take over by constantly raping Heather, but without ever reaching the complexity of the figures present in the prequel. A slight transfiguration, and the time has come to delve into the most criticized aspect of KCET production, the structure, mainly unchanged as could be guessed. The most significant difference compared to the other adventures is represented by the presence of two different realities, a normal one, in which the environments maintain their original composition, and an alternative one, in which they become desolate places used for orgies and torture of indefinable beings. The contrast is not only aesthetic, but above all structural, modifying the explorable area, the enemies, the puzzles. For the rest it is an exponent of the rather classic genre, to which slight improvements have been made to the interface and additions of lures for the monsters, which are decidedly useless to tell the truth. We close with some quick considerations on longevity, discreet as usual with the presence of different endings and extras to unlock, and on the conversion, which includes a valid Italian translation and the 50/60 Hz selector. Breeze in Monochrome Night The ancestral condemnation of the cursed city is also blindingly reverberated in the technical realization, one of the most emotionally impressive ever. The non-interactive sequences are now in real time and have a very high level of detail, especially as regards the astonishing expressiveness of the performers, especially Heather. It is only the beginning of a microcosm of the absurd, conceived entirely on the asymmetry of the settings, usually well-finished, but which in the alternative realities become endless expanses of icy metal, blurry reproductions of the atrocious medieval torture chambers immersed in eternal darkness. Surreal atmosphere further defined by creatures taken from the bleakest of hells, constantly in hyper-tension by the excellent use of chiaroscuro and dynamic lighting, as well as the volumetric fog effect, which has become impenetrable in its density. The animations are excellent, while the shots turn out to be excessively choreographic, forcing the player to adjust the camera for a more appropriate view of the environmentshey. Akira Yamaoka, the new Nero, hovers among the flames of the nightmare, intoning his usual ecstasy of pain with the keyboards, suffering this time pronounced with short compositions, and essentially underlined by that obsessive arrhythmic continuum reproduced by the degraded atmospheres of Eraserhead (see box ). Comment Silent Hill 3 can be defined as the ideal synthesis between chilling atmospheres and noteworthy narrative techniques. The plot perfectly reflects the delusional and apocalyptic tones of the first episode, inserting them in an internal context similar to the second, with a credible interpreter like Heather, constantly tormented in her innermost fears. The same emphasis is placed on the technical realization, excellent both as regards the terrifying settings, decorated with light effects and shadows in real time, and as regards the polygonal models, extremely accurate and plausible in their attitudes. Perhaps the weak point of Silent Hill is the structure, devoid of significant innovations, although the inventory management and the puzzle solving system have been improved. Longevity stands at good levels for the genre, especially considering that it is possible to set the difficulty of the riddles and as usual there are several extras to unlock. So ultimately a title that, despite not reaching the emotional heights of Silent Hill 2, still remains a valid experience in several respects, pending significant changes that renew the now antiquated conceptions. Pros: Technically valuable Discrete plot Atmosphere full of tension Cons: Outdated structure Repetitive Imperfect management of the camera Silent Hill can be defined as the ideal continuation of Alone in the Dark. Not only did it mark the return of literary and cinematographic quotations of a certain importance, unlike Resident Evil, but it even re-proposed its technical style, more attentive to suggestion rather than detail, and the same complexity of the puzzles. The sick atmosphere of Silent Hill, however, had distinct origins: It was above all a dreamlike illusion, suspended in the space-time void of Yamaoka's industrial dissonances. The mosaic of paranoia conceived for the sequel gave greater importance to the narrative technique, outlining a psychological drama in which the interpreter's subconscious was constantly tormented in a melancholy and nihilistic crescendo, which could only end with the purification of eternal sleep. An ode to suicide, underlined by persuasive voices, ethereal melodies, primordial noises. This sort of hermeticism prevented its positive response among fans of the first episode, attracted more by an atrocious visual sector than a stasis of twisted restlessness. The purpose of Silent Hill 3 is therefore to achieve an extreme synthesis between disturbed aesthetics and inner depth.", "date": "2003-06-03", "grade": null}
