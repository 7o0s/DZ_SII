Wii Karaoke U, however, uses a different model than usual, capable of monetizing if the initiative were to be successful but which could also prove to be a double-edged sword, considering the user target. Here's how it works: the software is downloaded for free from the eShop, after which it can be used by purchasing licenses with variable durations. We are given an initial one-hour license to try out the application, understand whether or not it is for us and whether it offers an appropriate tracklist, after which we proceed as needed with one-hour, twenty-four-hour or thirty-day tickets, respectively at the price of 2.99, 4.99 and 14.99 euros. These are not high figures per se, but it must be considered that the count of minutes is absolute and not relative: if we buy a 24-hour license today at 15.00, it will end tomorrow at the same time, regardless of the use of the 'application. A ~consumption~ setting would undoubtedly have been more convenient, also because the solution adopted by Nintendo risks relegating the product to very occasional use, the classic entertainment that comes out once in a while for a party or an evening with the friends. The second doubt concerns the completely digital nature of the offer, payments included, which could clash with the traditional figure of the casual gamer, who buys exclusively in-store, often taking advice from someone. But now enough with the negativity and let's see Wii Karaoke U in detail ... How does that piece do? If you remember the aforementioned SiNG Party, you will know perfectly well that it was a very, very, very limited product for what its ambitions were. The track list, in particular, presented itself as an ~everything and nothing~ that cut off very large slices of the public. It is precisely from that limit that Nintendo, also here as a publisher, wanted to start creating a new offer. Wii Karaoke U interfaces directly with the eShop for license management and navigating the software is a bit like navigating the Wii U system menus, exasperating slowness aside. The songs are many and belong to the most varied artists, so get ready to switch as if nothing had happened from A-Ha to Pantera, from Phil Collins to Korn, from Oasis to Megadeth. The search mechanisms are simple to use, even if often the songs for single singer/group are few, see Muse with only ~New born~, The Fray with only ~How to save a life~ and many other such examples. In short, the focus was on the quantity of names, simultaneously trying to capture as many threads as possible and therefore to intercept pieces that the public knows, which represents a key characteristic for karaoke. Unfortunately, younger users will have a nasty surprise, as the songs in Italian are completely missing, but perhaps in the future this gap will be filled with targeted updates. Furthermore, there have been moments (mostly in the evening) in which we have encountered a serious slowness in downloading the songs, which forces us to select the ~delayed~ start option and can generate even embarrassing waiting situations. Let's hope it was an isolated case. Wii Karaoke U is a simple, fun and full-featured karaoke app, but on the expensive side Lots of stuff How Wii Karaoke U works is very simple: you search for a song, select it and start singing, using the GamePad's built-in microphone or (much better) a compatible USB microphone, like the one sold in a bundle with SiNG Party. However, this only represents the first substratum of experience, which boasts a considerable amount of options. Each song can be modified in key and speed, you can adjust the various volumes (including the vocal track and the melodic guide, fortunately), increase the reverberation on the voice (possibly modifying its ~style~) and even set the sounds that can be produced by friends holding a Wii-mote to ~accompany~ us in the exhibition. It's easy to add songs and artists to your favorites list, so you can recall them quickly, and the aforementioned search can also take place on the basis of musical genre or ~thematic collections~ that revolve around ~mixes for the summer~, ~music divas~, to ~songs for male voices~, to ~great contemporary hits~ etc. etc. In short, we reiterate, there are not all the artists in the world (some quite popular ones are missing, in fact) nor all their songs, but the offer isstill quite substantial. And then there are the other game options, which go beyond the simple out-of-tune song and see us engaged in a precision competition (~Sfida ultima note~), with or without recording part of the performance, with a final evaluation that assigns a mark to the uniformity of the singing, the ability to reproduce the correct melody, the rhythm, the presence of vibrato and chromatisms. Finally, there is a section dedicated to customizing the scenario that we see on TV, a scenography that sees our Mii on stage and a large number of spectators all around, which can be modified in various ways.", "date": "2013-10-29", "grade": "7.0"}
