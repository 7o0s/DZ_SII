Since its launch, which took place 3 years ago, Playdead's indie has in fact touched Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PC, Mac and more recently also PS Vita. But beyond the cross-platform diffusion, it is for the quality of the product that Limbo has deserved (and deserves) all the success it has garnered; when indies weren't as fashionable as today, in fact, it was able to impose itself with bombastic evaluations on videogame magazines from all over the world, including the 9 of our review which we invite you to go and consult in case you really don't know yet what game we are talking about . In fact, here we will limit ourselves to describing and evaluating the conversion on the iOS platforms, the latest in the long series mentioned above to welcome the effort of the Danish team. One death after another The adventure of the boy protagonist of Limbo is one of the worst nightmares; alone, in an unknown place and full of dangers at every step. And by ~dangers~ we don't mean the risk of skinning a knee, but of being impaled by a giant spider or decapitated by an oversized trap, just to clarify. Playdead's creature is a two-dimensional adventure that reminds (to older gamers) Another World and Heart of Darkness, in which progression is continuously intertwined with the experience of bloody death which becomes the main vehicle for teaching game mechanics. In fact, only dying does one understand the mistake to avoid in order to move forward, in a flow of situations that amaze for their variety and for the stylistic key with which they are visually narrated. The minimalism of Limbo is in fact its greatest strength, in the ability to show only the indispensable by reducing the details to the maximum; this through the use of silhouettes and black and white (with all shades of gray) with a formula that many have then used as a more or less evident inspiration for other products. If necessarily after 3 years the freshness and novelty of Limbo appears a little nuanced, the quality of an emotionally touching and well-balanced game between the gameplay component and the purely aesthetic one remains intact. On the App Store, the Playdead title arrives in a universal version at the attractive price of 4.49 euros, a figure that appears correct both considering the average of Apple's distribution platform, and precisely the certainly not very recent release of the first edition. In terms of content, there are no differences of any kind; the adventure therefore remains rather short, between 4 and 5 hours, and the audio accompaniment deserves the use of headphones to be better appreciated. The critical point therefore naturally becomes that of the controls, which as can be easily deduced have been redesigned to take advantage of the touch screen. True to its philosophy, Limbo doesn't spend a single word on tutorials or explanations, but it really doesn't take long to understand how it works. In practice, the only virtual stick is detected anywhere on the screen you place your finger; moving it forward or backward allows you to move accordingly, up to jump and one tap to interact with objects. Alternatively, two coats can also be used for a better result. Unfortunately, in any case, the responsiveness and accuracy are fatally much lower than the physical keys, making the experience slightly more frustrating. For heaven's sake, nothing excessive, but in the most excited passages it is certainly not uncommon to die due not to one's own mistakes but to the laziness of the controls. A predictable and natural flaw, which however only slightly reduces the beauty of a title that really needs to be tried. It's not the best version, but Limbo on iOS remains a splendid game", "date": "2013-07-15", "grade": "8.5"}
