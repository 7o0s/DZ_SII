{"name": "Test Drive Unlimited - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/test-drive-unlimited-recensione-2.html", "text": "Beyond conversion One of the peculiar characteristics of Test Drive Unlimited is its starting setting: our character moves to the tropical island of Oahu and has to buy a house and a car by managing his initial capital in the best possible way. His ~growth~ will lead him to gradually buy better cars and a new house, in the meantime participating in a disproportionate number of racing events that come to life on the island's roads, and we are talking about something like 250 races on 2500 square meters of territory, which also on PlayStation2 scroll before our eyes without the slightest loading. This feature has been maintained in the conversion, albeit with some small defection: the character is fixed, you can't select him from a shortlist nor can you customize his appearance by buying clothes and accessories. Even the possibility of buying and testing motorcycles was eliminated, but in the end it was an ~exaggeration~ of the Xbox 360 version, which added nothing to the general quality of the product. For the rest, TDU on the Sony console succeeds in the miraculous intention of not disfiguring compared to the original: all thanks to an extremely capable team of developers (Melbourne House), who preferred to use a graphics engine born on PS2 and already successfully tested for being able to handle a large number of polygons without sacrificing the fluidity with which they are moved. A life on the road The numbers of Test Drive Unlimited are impressive, but it is its philosophy that surprises, its thickness. Once the first apartment and the first car have been purchased, selected after a visit to the numerous dealerships on the island, we will receive communications inviting us to compete in special single-brand clubs or in competitions divided into categories. No one will force us to proceed in one way rather than another, however: we can also decide to go out, do a few laps and find the races and challenges that interest us on the street, tackling them by selecting the level of difficulty and collecting a cash prize in case of victory. On the map, which can be called up at any time and can be customized in the display in a similar way to what was seen on the Xbox360, the races will gradually appear and will give us an idea of what the consistency of the game is: after a good few hours of practice, still being with a 2% completion rate only confirms an uncommon longevity. The presence of many events to participate in, moreover of a different nature, by itself does not guarantee the duration of a racing game over time. In the case of TDU, however, this abundance is supported by a convincing and accurate driving model, which leans towards simulation while not claiming absolute accuracy. The left analog stick manages to effectively dose the movement of the steering wheel, without obvious dead spots, and allows us to make the necessary corrections to avoid unwanted bumps: keep in mind that we will be racing on urban circuits with lots of ~unsuspecting~ motorists. .. Don't expect spectacular crashes, however: the developers have opted for a ~friendly~ approach towards car manufacturers, and so we will drive indestructible cars. This does not allow us to run around without scruple and ram anyone, however: the police are always there, and breaking the rules of the road will result in chases without quarter (these are spectacular), which will eventually lead to the payment of rather steep fines. Technical realization As already mentioned on a couple of occasions, Test Drive Unlimited on PlayStation2 is presented in the best way. The developers of the Melbourne House team have used a very powerful graphics engine, which manages to manage a very large number of polygons on the screen and to maintain a constant frame rate that perhaps does not reach thirty frames per second, but it comes very close. And don't forget the absolute lack of uploads: the rendering process of the scenarios is absolutely transparent. The polygonal models of the cars are truly faithful to their real counterparts and full of details, just think of the fact that the driver is perfectly visible, that even the interiors are viewable and that there is a view from inside the car showing the steering wheel and dashboard. The same view on Xbox360 is obviously more detailed and more beautiful to look at, but the fact of leaving it on PS2 is certainly a test of good will. If we want to find flaws in the graphic design of the game, the only way is to analyze the settings very critically, in particular the buildings that house the dealerships which are ugly to look at and very bare. For the rest, it was made evidentnly a matter of quantity and not so much of quality, in the sense that there are many elements on the screen and it was not possible to make them very realistic. This in no way detracts from the general atmosphere of TDU racing, which is exceptional - just look at the horizon which changes color depending on the time of day. The soundtrack of the game is really, really great. A good selection of ~signature~ songs was made, ranging from current rock to more ~classic~ pieces and effectively comment on the progress of the competitions. If the roar of the engines is very realistic and well done, perhaps the same cannot be said for the noise of the impacts, a bit ~fake~. All speech is dubbed in Italian, flawlessly. [C] While we rest on the sofa, we will receive invitations to compete in different clubs. There are four camera views available, and this is the first one. certainly the most suggestive. Each car & egrave; characterized by different values of speed, acceleration, etc. [/C] Comment Test Drive Unlimited in PlayStation 2 sauce is a product of great technical value, much more than a simple conversion. Huge, full of depth, equipped with an extremely enjoyable driving model, which allows us to appreciate even the journeys (guided by a convenient GPS system) that take us from one point of the island to another to participate in a race, to buy a car or to personalize it in various ways (there is no lack of elaboration, of course). If you like racing games with an urban setting, there is currently no better product on PS2 than TDU: the new title developed by Melbourne House is extremely well-finished, long-lived and fun. The presence of online multiplayer, in this sense, only closes the picture of a conversion made with passion and competence. Pros: Excellent graphics Soundtrack signed Very thick Cons: Environments not very detailed Some collisions ~block~ the car Slight pop-up effects in the distance. Test Drive Unlimited is available for PC, PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360. The version reviewed in this article is the PlayStation 2 version Quite a while has passed since the release of Test Drive Unlimited for Xbox 360, in accordance with the current philosophy regarding ~exclusives~ that ultimately are not exclusive, if not for a certain number of months. As also verified in the preview phase, for the PS2 version of TDU this expectation did not have the mere purpose of gratifying the owners of the Microsoft console, but served to organize the conversion work in the best way.
