{"name": "Fable 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fable-2-recensione.html", "text": "The Multiplayer.it guide Multiplayer.it Edizioni publishes and distributes the official guide to Fable 2, already available in stores at the recommended price of 14.90. The guide, 256 full-color pages, explains in detail everything there is to know about Albion, its heroes, secrets and quests! Some hero, food, children and a dog! Fable 2's approach is unique right from the moment of choosing the character, a choice that does not take place with a powerful editor with which to determine the features of one's avatar down to the smallest detail, but simply takes the form of the decision to play one of two brothers, a male or female. The characterization, as in the first game, takes place gradually, depending on the choices made, the degree of wickedness or goodness reached, the type of skill that you decide to level up, spending the experience gained in combat in one of the three parameters : physical strength, skill or magic. The other determining factors are the wounds, the hairstyles and tattoos that can be bought around the world, and the way in which life energy is recovered. As in life, eating all the rubbish around is much easier than going to buy magic potions every time, but our character will gain weight as a result. It goes without saying that when we closed the Albion adventure, our hero had a belly of epic proportions! The speech is different as regards weapons and clothes, all characterized and equipped with different animations, but with a far from stratospheric number, which will make the purists of the most radical RPGs turn up their noses. The youth phase of the protagonist is resolved in a short tutorial, in which we learn the basics of the game and how to relate to the NPCs, the most important supporting characters and, above all, the dog that accompanies us throughout the journey. It is worth talking about this animal separately, given the quality with which its animations and behaviors have been created, which elicit continuous smiles and which, above all, are decisive in the exploration of the areas: barking warns us of incoming enemies, treasures to unearth or treasure chests hidden in the seabed. Provided he is in a good mood and in good health. It is also fundamental for the interaction with the characters, given that they can be taught a whole series of useful tricks to make the inhabitants of Albion smile or annoy. Each of these has an indicator that tells us its degree of affinity with the hero, a degree that can be modified with the numerous expressions available and which can be learned by buying the appropriate books. This is how the social plan breaks into the real game, becoming decisive for obtaining discounts, getting gifts, enticing one's subordinates to work when buying a shop, when one wants to convince a woman or a man to fall in love or simply to have sex, protected or not, depending on whether you have a condom. The outcome, in the case of an unprotected heterosexual relationship, could also be that of pregnancy, which will lead to the birth of a little baby to give gifts and to play with. Under penalty of divorce and abandonment of the marital home! economic theories Making money for major purchases in Fable 2 is far from simple. Killing enemies, unless you upgrade your weapons with the necessary add-ons, does not earn you any money. To do this, you need to rent houses, sell things, do jobs, gamble or find treasure chests. This is not an end in itself, given that only by purchasing certain buildings will you have access to certain treasures, keys or even quests. The last and most sensational of which, among other things, will require life savings or a truly terrible choice... of which, however, we won't tell you anything. An important story One of the aspects on which Lionhead have worked the most is the consistency of the story told, finally with its epic moments and twists and turns worthy of an RPG, while maintaining that intelligence and irony that has always distinguished the works by Molyneux. Towards the end, perhaps, the plot resolves itself a little too quickly and, given the almost total absence of cut scenes, it fails to give that narrative paw that one would expect from the ending of a game of this magnitude, even for the lack of development of the personalities of all the supporting characters. What matters, in our opinion, is that the emotional bond that is created with one's alter ego is out of the ordinary, and that, once the storm has passed, there remains a great desire to continue playing with the combat system, to find all the secrets, buy houses and complete all the quests, moving among ugly thugs, adventurers and prostitutes. OurThe clock showed 15 hours when we first got to the bottom, with more than a third of the quests still to be finished, and with most of the secrets to unearth. Without forgetting the replayability, given that the blatant and sporadic choices of the first episode give way to many small decisions that influence the development of the world in which we move. Learning that even not tackling a quest can lead to consequences and changes that will only be possible to detect later, also with changes to the conformation of the terrain and, therefore, to the available quests. The pact is to get in tune with a title which continually invites the player to do things, rather than asking questions, to play, rather than figuring out how to do it. Also thanks to a very immediate combat system, which however has a good depth and which never faces the failure of death, given that the only penalty suffered is that of the loss of a minimum amount of experience. This is something that lovers of great challenges might not like. However, they cannot fail to appreciate a cooperative mode that allows two players to tackle any quest or moment, both collecting experience and money, both offline and online (even if this mode was not testable at the time of review). In local co-op, the camera moves away and is no longer freely adjustable and the two players are forced to play without separating, which creates some problems especially in the narrowest spaces. However, fun is also guaranteed for those who want to join a game, even if it lasts a few minutes. An important story I saw a dog flying in a breathtaking sunset... In this Next Gen of the reckless use of normal mapping, the thousand metal walls and randomly used particles, Fable 2 is a real breath of fresh air. Air that seems to breathe when you look out from one of the cliffs with the sea shining with the sun and the rays that dazzle the view, amidst a wave of flowers and tree twigs. There are finally waterfalls to dive from and caves to explore, in a game that is a thousand miles away from the freeroaming of titles like Oblivion, but where it's worth sifting through every millimeter of the map to find secrets and chests, scattered in locations made with the same painstaking care of the beautiful 2d art works that accompany it. However, the team failed to smooth out some long loading and all the imperfections, and we happened to get stuck in the seabed (once forcing us to start a quest all over again), blocked by some NPCs or seeing the dog suspended in the air. These are not defects that undermine the experience, but that clash in an overall picture that has no equal in the panorama of action rpg (even if sometimes one thinks that the real game to refer to is GTA). Among the many sound effects, the voices of the NPCs and the monstrosities that inhabit the dungeons, it is worth saying a few words about the soundtrack: it's beautiful. Comment Fable 2 takes on the role of the first chapter and grows in it until it rips the seams, making sense of years of spent words and giving life to a fun and convincing game from almost all points of view. Albion finally lights up with the sun of adventure, which dissolves the claustrophobia of the thousand invisible walls and immerses the player in landscapes that draw sighs of wonder, visual and sound. There remain some imperfections in the code, some indecision in the narration and a little avarice in the items to collect and use, going to constitute notes that stop Peter Molyneux's new effort from becoming a real timeless masterpiece. However, and above all, it remains the best title born from Lionhead Studios and an adventure in which to get lost and have fun for hours and hours. With malice and with the feeling of being faced with a single game, for better or for worse. Pros The settings and irony The integration between simulation and adventure The Combat System and the Dog The lights and effects Cons A few bugs Not always epic Few items and weapons Xbox 360 - Goals Given the genre, Fable 2 is quite generous. At the end of the first game it is not difficult to find yourself with loot ranging from 400 to 500 gamerpoints of the 1000 available. To get them all it will be necessary to finish the game at least three times, get lost with the co-op and the search for the gargoyles and the silver keys. We are certain, however, that many will not stop on the first lap", "date": "2008-10-21", "grade": null}
