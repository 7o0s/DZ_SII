{"name": "Astria Ascending", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/astria-ascending-recensione.html", "text": "The guys from Artisan Studios, a team founded in France that recently opened a studio in Canada too, strongly wanted to collaborate with three very important names in the panorama of Japanese role-playing games: one is Kazushige Nojima, who wrote various Final Fantasy, but also a bunch of other games; then there's Hitoshi Sakimoto, who has an appalling resume and has composed the music for numerous Square Enix titles, as well as the various Vanillaware games; finally we have Akihiko Yoshida, the pencil behind titles of the caliber of Final Fantasy Tactics or the most recent NieR: Automata. With these premises and the intention to pay homage to the golden age of 90s JRPGs and in particular real cult like Xenogears, Secret of Mana and Valkyrie Profile, the title Artisan Studios immediately attracted our attention, and after having played it thoroughly we can explain to you, in this review of Astria Ascending, all its strengths and weaknesses. A long story to get going Astria Ascending, the eight Demigod protagonists A very long speech could be made about the qualities of Kazushige Nojima as a writer, but let's limit ourselves to saying that it is controversial and that not all of his donuts succeed with the hole. As is normal, but when they come out well they are excellent and you would like to do an encore. Sadly that doesn't occur with the story of Astria Ascending and the point is that it's not entirely his fault. The slightly confusing premise would be this: the most disparate species live in the world of Orcanon, protected by representatives, called Demigods (in Italian, demigods) who exchange their lives for extraordinary powers and great riches: once these privileges have been obtained In fact, the Demigods only live another three years. Their aim is to protect the world from all danger, and above all to preserve Harmony, which in addition to being literally harmony, is also the name of the capital of Orcanon. Practically a team of similar Avengers, the eight protagonists of Astria Ascending are the heart of the story. They belong to different species and heritages and look at each other with distrust, but they are forced to review their positions when strange incidents begin to occur which would seem to suggest a catastrophic hypothesis: the Astrae, the divinities who represent the mysterious and supernatural Arbiters, are attacking the inhabitants of Orcanon instead of protecting them from hostile creatures called Noise. Investigating, the Demigods will discover that of course all is not as it seems and they will have to fight against enemies who come from their own pasts to secure the future they had given up. In short, the story is really interesting and throws some truly remarkable twists, but Nojima's efforts are frustrated by an exhausting pace, especially at the beginning: the plot really takes too long to get going, also due to numerous dialogues in English which for some reason cannot be speeded up, and which are interspersed with frequent and long pauses between bars. There are no interlude cinematics: the story is told through the balloons that appear above the characters as if they were a comic strip. In these situations, the animations are reduced to the bone and only rarely does the director resort to zooms or other movements of the shot to liven up the narrative. The insipid English dubbing doesn't help either: it seemed to us one of the worst we've heard recently, while the Japanese one is much better and fortunately can be changed at any time from the options menu. It's a shame because the narrative of Astria Ascending is far from obvious, it deals with interesting themes and surprises with unexpected dynamics, especially if you consider the type of game. The characters in the cast are all well characterized, thanks also to the refined character design of the excellent Akihiko Yoshida, although perhaps there are too many and the script ends up not giving everyone the weight they deserve. Part JRPG and part platformer Astria Ascending, the platform exploration is inspired by Valkyrie Profile In the introduction to this review we didn't mention Vanillaware at random, as we mentioned the composer Hitoshi Sakimoto, as always in great shape, even if a little less memorable than usual. Astria Ascending, just like Dragon's Crown, Odin Sphere or the recent 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim, is entirely hand drawn. The guys at Artisan Studios have a real talent: every background is a feast for the eyes, every animation is extraordinarily fluid and detailed even when you leave the protagonist Ulan still for a few seconds. The choice of soft but lively colors literally embellishes every screen, and the variety of environments is impressive: woods, deserts, swamps, ancient temples and cities withhe mirror the tribes that built them. The combat effects may appear sober at first, but there are spectacular spells that fill the screen. If we then consider that several sprites have been drawn for each character that reflect the different Jobs, you will understand that the artistic direction of Astria Ascending is truly impeccable: even the menus struck us for their cleanliness and clarity, rich in illustrations and details , and we were pleasantly surprised when we discovered that even the wielded weapons change visually depending on the equipped item. A real touch of class. Astria Ascending, the 2D graphics are breathtaking The level design is a bit less inspired, mostly because there is a real structural detachment between the cities, formed by horizontally contiguous screens, and the dungeons, which are instead stratified platform-style stages inspired by the never-forgotten Valkyrie Profile by Enix. Connected by doors and entrances, the rooms in the dungeons immediately appear quite repetitive aesthetically, but they challenge the player who has to jump from one platform to another, avoiding pitfalls and solving some environmental puzzles with the help of a magic ring that acquires different powers as you progress in the campaign: initially it will allow you to activate switches and paralyze enemies, but then you will discover how to manipulate water or burn some obstacles, and this means that you can return to previously explored areas to unlock new passages and find collectibles and similar. It is a convincing dynamic, and the structure of these dungeons - which are about twenty - becomes more and more intricate: the rooms that compose them multiply exponentially, and the 3D map doesn't help much, in this sense. We found it perhaps too essential, given that it merely indicates the generic position of the doors and chests that have already been discovered. Fight as Demigod Astria Ascending, a fight in the desert Except for the obligatory bosses, the fights begin only when the Ulan sprite comes into contact with the Noises represented in the form of a bubble in the dungeon: it is possible to jump over them with a jump, perhaps after having paralyzed them with the magic ring, or hit them with a sword to increase the chances that the fight starts with an advantage in our favor. At that point, Astria Ascending reveals all its old-fashioned JRPG nature. The fights are turn-based, ordered according to the agility values of the individual characters: on the one hand we have a variable number of enemies, on the other four of the eight Demigods. Fear not, however, because it is possible to exchange the Demigods on the field with those on the bench at any time, sacrificing a turn to completely reconfigure the team, regardless of whether our heroes are still alive or not. The characters have the traditional ones available commands that allow you to attack, defend, consume healing items or cast spells and special abilities. Then we have the Focus command, which allows you to skip the turn to load the resource of the same name represented in the upper right corner. Astria Ascending, Demigods are powerful but live a few years Focus can also be accumulated by intelligently exploiting the vulnerabilities of enemies, a bit like the Press Turn system in Persona and Shin Megami Tensei; after that, it is possible to download the accumulated resource to enhance any attack or spell up to 200%. In this way, even the characters who in certain situations are less useful can have their say in battle, but always thinking strategically about the aforementioned vulnerabilities, because the wrong attacks load the Focus of the enemies who can then give us tit for tat in the same way. We do not hide from you that Astria Ascending can become frustrating, with sudden and unsettling difficulty peaks regardless of how strategically you have studied your moves. In this sense, it becomes imperative to shop for weapons and armor - with the risk of finding them later in the chests, you are warned - to improve the equipment of the characters... or alternatively jump into the options menu that allow you to increase or decrease the difficulty, but also to alter some aspects of the combat system, making it a little more flexible if necessary. Astria Ascending, Eko is your best healer Astria Ascending also offers another way to face combat more serenely: a robust Job System focused on learning bonuses, spells and support skills. By spending individually accumulated JP in battle, the player can build his characters by choosing the order in which he unlockslook for the various upgrades, which are really numerous and multiply with the introduction of the main and secondary Jobs. The latter are unlocked a little at a time and the system is actually less flexible than it appears, but guarantees a fair amount of freedom of choice, in the face of some irreversible decisions that can condition the match until the end, forcing us to better structure our team of demigods. This is especially important when Cosmo Break is unlocked, a very powerful skill that can only be activated after having loaded the appropriate indicator: the problem is that this occurs only if the character on duty performs an action suited to his Job, and this means that you have to think even better before choosing a command. Secondary activities Astria Ascending, always consider the vulnerabilities of the enemy Luckily Astria Ascending is a smart game in some respects. In dungeons, when you are not fighting, your Life Points regenerate automatically and quickly too, allowing you to always face enemies in the best conditions. The same does not happen with Magic Points, which are restored only in the city; despite this, the generous distribution of checkpoints allows you to teleport between open areas of Orcanon at any time, and then return to the city, recover in seconds, and rejoin the dungeon from the last discovered checkpoint in the blink of an eye. flexibility helps in solving the many side quests that start by talking to NPCs who have the usual exclamation points in their heads. Often structured in multiple steps, these assignments will make us wander far and wide, fight and explore already visited scenarios, rewarding us with accessories, money and so on. Unfortunately, these side missions are not always very well written and, beyond the narrative deficits, the rewards in most cases are negligible, not to mention that the clues on how to solve them in some cases are all too indirect. However they represent an added value in terms of longevity, also because some complement each other effortlessly. Astria Ascending is a game that can be completed in about thirty hours, but Artisan Studios has promised at least double that for those who want to dissect it in all its aspects, including some fun mini-games. The one that stands out the most is called J-ster and is a kind of board game reminiscent of the Triple Triad and the Tetra Master from Final Fantasy VIII and IX respectively. J-ster is played with tokens that are obtained by defeating monsters or transforming them with a specific ability of the grumpy Arpajo, and almost every NPC of Orcanon is willing to play a game with us, following variable rules. Whoever wins can choose some of the opponent's tokens... and this means that we will have to go and get them back in case of defeat. Astria Ascending, a scene from history From this point of view, Astria Ascending does even more than recall the ancient glories of the past: it borrows some dynamics that JRPG players have liked in recent years, but in doing so it must be admitted that it loses a lot of personality, imitating this and that without putting too much of his own. In the end we have beautiful hand-drawn graphics, for heaven's sake, but which we have already seen in Vanillaware titles; a combat system that seems like a strange hybrid of Shin Megami Tensei and Bravely Default; a Final Fantasy-style Job System that tends to be redundant in terms of bonuses and skills; an exploratory dynamic taken from Valkyrie Profile. Depending on your interest in the genre, all of these can be absolute points in favor of Astria Ascending, but we have to admit that an extra ounce of courage and originality wouldn't go amiss.", "date": "2021-09-27", "grade": "7.5"}
