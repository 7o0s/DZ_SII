{"name": "The World Ends with You: Final Remix", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-world-ends-with-you-final-remix-recensione.html", "text": "The World Ends with You was one of the most innovative and popular titles to come out on Nintendo DS: it was 2008, ten years have passed and Square Enix's RPG still exerts enormous influence today, although the Japanese developer has postponed for years in the making of what would have been a very welcome sequel. In 2012 he instead converted the game for mobile systems, making considerable changes to the peculiar combat system to adapt it to a single touch screen: one of the peculiarities of the game, on Nintendo DS, consisted precisely in the dual control system that allowed the characters to fight on both the bottom and top screens of the handheld. The Final Mix version coming out for Switch is logically based on the edition for mobile systems, even if Square Enix has further reworked it, adding a new, short campaign that acts as a bridge for a now practically confirmed sequel. So is this an essential purchase? A story in the streets of Shibuya The busy commercial district of Tokyo is the stage for The World Ends with You: it is there that Neku Sakuraba awakens, a teenager who remembers only his own name and who discovers that he must win the Game of Demons if he wants to return to reality . In fact, Neku and the other participants move in a kind of reflection of Shibuya in which no one, other than the entities that have established the game and the rules and who call themselves Demons, can see them and interact with them. The goal is simple: each day, Neku will have a limited amount of time to succeed in a new endeavor, but if he fails, he will be erased from existence. It is clear that the adventure does not last just a week, also because the story reserves many twists and turns destined to constantly change the cards on the table. We immediately warn you that the first hours of the game can be heavy: the dialogues are expository and frequent, the dark tones mix in an odd way with the colorful and lively Shibuya, while the characters - and Neku, in particular - compete to seem hermetic and introverted. But this is also due to the central theme and the message that The World Ends with You tries to convey through a multifaceted cast and to the unprecedented Italian language localization that affects all the texts: unfortunately it is not possible to set the audio track in Japanese, but it is true that the dubbed dialogues are very few. On the sound front, moreover, this Final Remix immediately offers the possibility of setting the original soundtrack for Nintendo DS, rather than the new one, essentially remixed and refined over the years: in both cases, it is still a huge compilation of rock and J-pop songs that fit the setting and the story perfectly. Technically, in short, The World Ends with You is far from being a latest generation product, but the sharp character design and the always punctual stylistic choices not only make you forget the polygons and the most sophisticated effects, but also appreciate the variety and the care taken in the creation of music, sprites and illustrations. Linear and intricate at the same time We have emphasized that The World Ends with You can be a little too didactic in the first moments, but this is due to the fact that in the Square Enix title many decidedly unusual mechanics coexist and intersect, even for the colorful genre of Japanese role-playing games. Which is significant, considering the essentially linear structure: each day is a separate chapter in which the player, once he has discovered the new challenge, must fight enemies or solve puzzles in certain areas of the segmented map of Shibuya. The inevitable cinematic concludes the day and the cycle begins again. The World Ends with You is completed in about forty hours which include the inevitable extra content, such as the new, short campaign that tells a strange story to which the eventual sequel will probably be linked. And despite the linearity just described, The World Ends with You is a game full of events and parameters to keep an eye on constantly. The segments into which Shibuya is divided, for example, respond to different stylistic trends that push the player to wear the clothes that are fashionable in those areas, practically the blouses, hats and shoes that replace the canonical weapons and armor. However, it is possible to influence these trends by wearing other brands and slowly changing their diffusion to meet our preferences. In this sense, The World Ends with You is an extremely personal RPGbile. Among other things, it is in fact even possible to calibrate the difficulty at will, increasing or decreasing the level reached to make the clashes more challenging and, therefore, profitable. It is the player who chooses how many and which enemies to face in most situations, so the progression is almost completely entrusted to his decisions, even if there are moments in which it becomes necessary to play strategy, for example by consuming the right dishes to take advantage of the bonuses they grant in combat only after they have been digested. The new, controversial combat system And everything positive we've written so far brings us to the heart of our review, because all fans of the original have inevitably wondered how Square Enix has managed to translate the combat system to the Switch. We stated that The World Ends with You was a unique title in several respects and one of them was undoubtedly the combat: on Nintendo DS, the player controls Neku on the Touch Screen and the character who accompanies him into battle on the top screen via the cross directional pad or the front keys on the handheld. The Switch version, similarly to the mobile one, has been stripped of this uniqueness, and now Neku and Shiki, Joshua or Beat fight together on a single screen. And here, unfortunately, some logistical problems arise. So let's try to clarify. The World Ends with You is played only and exclusively with the touch screen in portable mode and only if you leave the Joy-Con connected to the device. In this case, the player taps the screen to move Neku, interact with the environment, or activate pins, i.e. psychokinetic powers that serve as weapons. There are hundreds of pins with the most absurd powers that respond to different types of commands: in short, to activate them, the player must draw lines on the screen, draw circles, rub the surface with his finger, repeatedly touch the enemies. In combat, Neku moves by tapping the screen, and drawing a fast line causes him to dash in the indicated direction, dodging potential enemy attacks. Neku's supporting characters respond to very similar inputs: Shiki, for example, attacks enemies that the player repeatedly touches, while Joshua hits those on which quick and rapid lines are drawn. The problem lies precisely in the limited variety of commands that the game often struggles to distinguish, especially if you want to move Neku but at the same time you have equipped a pin that gives a power based on the same type of input. Similarly, the game suggests alternating Neku's and his partner's attacks to build up a synchronicity gauge that allows you to unleash a powerful combo attack, but it's hard to do when Neku wears pins that respond to the same type of stimuli who control the partner. With a little practice, however, it is still possible to find a certain balance in the confusion that is generated on the battlefield and the clashes soon become very entertaining, even if some bosses manage to be frustrating precisely because they function as small puzzles that require lightning-fast reactions and precise inputs that the application can't always identify correctly. By holding the Joy-Con the situation, if possible, becomes even more complicated. To begin with, it is important to clarify that the game allows you to calibrate the sensitivity of the controllers only if you start the application with the Joy-Con disconnected, and therefore with the Switch housed in the Dock or simply used as the main screen. This step is essential and unfortunately the game does not explain it, but if you carry out the procedure correctly, you will find much better results. This does not mean, however, that the control system via Joy-Con appeared to us quite coarse and imprecise, so much so that Square Enix has well thought of entrusting a key with the possibility of resetting the pointer to the center of the screen at any time : a certainly impractical function, if you are busy targeting enemies or the spaces in which we want to move Neku. Even the way we decide to play affects the quality of the control system which, however, only uses one Joy-Con at a time. We found it much better to play with the Switch placed as a screen on a table or desk: the shorter distance and the reduced dimensions of the reception area allow you to aim more precisely and alternate the various types of gestures that activate the pins. The TV screen obviously provides more visual clarity, although the performance and fluency remain absolutely the same, but also a surface of rclearly broader perception that lends the side to greater imprecision and also to a certain physical fatigue, given that the wrist and arm have to be shaken more. In this sense, however, we found the co-op mode very convincing which allows a second player to hold the other Joy-Con and directly control Neku's partner: Shiki, Joshua and Beat then acquire more attacks than the second player can run through specific inputs. In co-op mode, The World Ends with You thus becomes a sort of couch party game, much more engaging, where players can actually coordinate in the heat of combat, splitting targets or focusing on specific enemies. Ultimately, although it is a very personal setting that can vary from player to player, the belief that we have matured in our test is that the control system via Joy-Con lends itself above all to the cooperative mode with the Switch housed in the Dock , while alone it is much better to play with a Joy-Con and the Switch as a screen. The portable mode which relies solely on the touch screen is clearly the most practical and versatile, but we had the clear impression that the software gets confused easily and does not interpret touch inputs with the necessary precision, which can lead to extremely frustrating situations. In general, The World Ends with You: Final Remix has lost the uniqueness of the combat system, but Square Enix has done everything possible to preserve its extravagance, for better or for worse.", "date": "2018-10-10", "grade": "8.0"}
