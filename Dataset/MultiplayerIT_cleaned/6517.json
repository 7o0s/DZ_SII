{"name": "Strategia interculturale", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/146383-heavenstrike-rivals-strategia-interculturale.html", "text": "~In Japan, lifetime achievement awards are given when it's time to retire...well, I'm not retiring yet.~ Hironobu Sakaguchi said it while in these days he collected his award at the Game Developers Choice Awards. After all, the founder of Mistwalker has signed one of the best free-to-play strategy games for smartphones for a few months, although for some absurd reason Terra Battle is not yet available in Italy. Here, playing Heavenstrike Rivals it's not easy not to think of the imprint that Sakaguchi has left (and continues to leave) over the years. Although published by Square Enix, this mix of jRPG and turn-based strategy is the result of a collaboration that straddles two continents. On one side is Mediatonic, an English development team made up largely of Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest enthusiasts. On the other hand, there is the Tokyo company, which in addition to publishing the game has contributed to influencing its design and aesthetics thanks to the participation of some well-known names. Heavenstrike Rivals is a turn-based strategy game that mixes Western and Japanese ideas and styles Card Game, RPG or Strategy? The goal of this collaboration between the English development team and the Japanese giant was immediately clarified by the two project managers, Paul Croft and Masanori Ichikawa: to create an original experience, with strong Western influences in terms of gameplay, but characterized by aesthetics and elements that made it very attractive also in Japan. Heavenstrike Rivals successfully succeeds in the enterprise, despite the character design of Ryoma Ito (Final Fantasy Tactics Advance) mistakenly suggests that it is a distinctly Made in Japan game. Part turn-based RPG, part board game, part trading card game, Heavenstrike Rivals sees two challengers use their available mana to arrange their units within a small 3x7 grid. Once positioned, the toy soldiers autonomously move forward, attacking anything in their path. The aim, of course, is to bring the opponent's health to zero, stopping the advance of enemy units and at the same time trying to implement an effective offensive strategy. It's the classic formula ~easy to learn but very difficult to master~, since each unit has different attack and health points, has a different range, movement capacity or special abilities. Some get stronger the more they attack, others are able to strike twice in the same turn, while still others act as support, healing or buffing their teammates. To this are added further ways in which to influence one's own units, manually moving them from one row to another on the grid or by passing on some special boxes to obtain various bonuses. Everything works very well: precisely because you have little control over the forces positioned on the field, you have to constantly think two or three turns in advance, trying to imagine the opponent's possible responses, exactly as you would in a chess game. The trading card game component is less subtle than one might imagine, and works for better or worse as in Terra Battle. At the time of writing, Heavenstrike Rivals has over 200 characters, which differ in rarity and can be obtained at the end of each match, ~unwrapping~ them as packs of stickers. Since the number of places in the team is limited, you have to build your own deck of cards while also paying attention to the classic mana curve (well known to Magic players). Then there is a pinch of RPG component in a similar way to One Piece: Treasure Cruise, with the player who can upgrade the different units by leveling up or using rare items. Collecting, upgrading and building your own strategy is a formula that works particularly well in online PvP mode, and the development team is already looking to build a strong community around the game through social options, different leaderboards and special events where you can unlock exclusive characters . For those who don't like to compete online, Mediatonic has included a substantial single-player campaign in the game, and even if the plot is not original at all, it is precisely in the short intermission skits that the contribution of the Square-Enix artists is most appreciated , from the backgrounds of Masahiko Dairaku (Final Fantasy X and XIII) to the music of Ryo Yamazaki and Hidenori Iwasaki (Front Mission).", "date": "2015-03-07", "grade": "8.0"}
