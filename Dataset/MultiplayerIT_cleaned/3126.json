The transition from touch screens to VR viewers inevitably required a change of course, a rethinking of the traditional mechanics of the franchise which, however, the authors have pursued in the best possible way, remedying this with a greater atmosphere and with an unprecedented feeling of involvement the lack of dexterity that users were used to. The result is a title that captures attention right from the start, immersing us in a fascinating and mysterious world, but which nevertheless fails to keep us busy for very long. Let's see why. History The Room VR: A Dark Matter tells an independent story, completely unrelated to the previous episodes of the series. Against the backdrop of London in 1908, in the game we take on the role of a police inspector charged with investigating the disappearance of a famous Egyptologist: the man seems to have vanished into thin air, leaving no trace, but clearly things are not like this. After having gone to his studio and having taken a look at a series of documents, we come into possession of the traditional binoculars, a recurring element in The Room series, which will allow us to discover numerous elements hidden from view and use them to solve the abundant quantity of riddles that separates us from the truth. All within the context of an inspired and interesting campaign, divided into five chapters (some more complex and multifaceted, others less demanding) whose duration, however, does not reach three hours: we would have hoped for something more. Gameplay As mentioned at the beginning, in the transition to virtual reality, the classic formula last seen in The Room: Old Sins was inevitably modified, in order to better adapt to this particular medium. While aware that the exploration of the scenarios would never be too busy, the developers preferred to cut the bull's head off and focus on teleportation: just select one of the possible ~stops~ within the locations to reach them instantly, unfortunately without the possibility to activate a normal movement system, which we would have much preferred not suffering from motion sickness. Having accepted this compromise, the interaction immediately reveals itself to be very physical: we find ourselves reaching out to open drawers, activate mechanisms and grab objects, looking from time to time for the right combination to be able to solve the numerous puzzles present in the campaign and thus take another step in the right direction. However, it is disappointing to note how many elements are not really tangible: a lack that ends up revealing in fact the great structural simplicity of the experience. Furthermore, as happens in many PlayStation VR titles, sometimes the calibration of the controller loses precision, forcing us to do some contortion too much. Playstation 4 trophies There are just six Trophies obtainable with The Room VR: A Dark Matter, and to unlock them just complete the five chapters of the campaign. Easy, right? Technical realization One of the strengths of The Room VR: A Dark Matter is undoubtedly its ability to create a great atmosphere, thanks to highly inspired scenarios and a fitting and effective sound design, which increases involvement and accompanies us in the best way through the chapters of the adventure. Apart from the limited resolution of PlayStation VR, which manifests itself through the inevitable jaggies, the developers have done a good job and some scenarios, in particular, stand out (see for example the church). The influence of a classic like Myst is evident in some situations, but the game manages to maintain a precise personality and it is really a pity, as already mentioned, that it is not possible to explore the settings in a natural way, avoiding the simplistic solution of the teleportation and the shots of the view to turn around.", "date": "2020-04-24", "grade": "7.0"}
