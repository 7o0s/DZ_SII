{"name": "Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tiger-woods-pga-tour-2004_b.html", "text": "2004 edition Already from the moment of installation of the 3 CDs contained in the package of this TW2004 it will be impossible not to have a jolt in the chair: the game paths of which it will be possible to tread on the grass amounts to a total of 19 locations. We go from real classics of the PGA Tour such as TPC Avenel (present since the very first and now archaic PGA Tour Golf of 1990) up to intricate and fascinating courses born from the imagination of the designers. Also during the installation phase, we will notice the presence of a course editor with which it will be possible to reproduce the holes of the Golf Club near the house or customize courses perhaps downloaded from the Internet. Intrigued, therefore, we open the manual and discover that if the courses available to us are decidedly numerous, the game modes can appear almost boundless: ranging from the classic course, to the 1 vs 1 game, to skill tests, to challenges on single holes and anything else for a total of about twenty different possibilities of competition. In short, we can tell you right now that if you love golf (virtual or otherwise) it will be practically impossible to get bored with this title. Super Tiger Woods RPG Once the game has been launched, witnessed one of the various (and sometimes really nice) introductions in the classic EA Sports style, noticed that - unfortunately - the whole game is in English (including the manual) and navigated a little in the main menu we will risk to find ourselves almost lost in front of the countless choices available to us. We will be able to immediately launch into a tournament, simulate an entire season, make some practice shots or challenge other human players via the Internet. However, the face of the young champion Tiger Woods is there looking at us, almost in a defiant tone, and it will be almost impossible for us not to immediately select the most fascinating and certainly rewarding method: that of a career. We mentioned earlier the attention to detail placed in this game, pardon, golf simulation: the creation of our digital alter ego is a prime example of this. Through a renewed version of the animation and human modeling software introduced by EA Sports some time ago with NBA Live 2000 it will be possible, through dozens of different parameters, to perfectly reproduce the physical characteristics of our character. Not even the possibility of customizing the clothing has been left aside (perhaps signed, thanks to sponsorship agreements with companies in the sector such as Nike) hats, visors, shoes, earrings (!), tattoos (!!), gloves, watches and all that can contribute to the exact definition of our expert golfer. As the latest fashions dictate, it will be possible to set, practically in Role-playing style, the numerical values that define the technical characteristics of our character. Attributes are Power, Long Game, Recovery, Short Game and Putting. Always with a nod to RPGs, we will start with few skill points but then, as we progress in our simulated career, we will be able to spend part of the money earned with our victories on the field to buy ourselves the possibility of improving a certain characteristic. Depending on our skills and our annual ranking in the various golf circuits, we will be able to level up and participate in increasingly prestigious and important tournaments reserved for the elite of world golf and then, who knows, beat the digital version of the champion of champions. Aren't you eager to get started already? Matter of style And here we are finally commenting on what is the beating heart of this genre of games and which for us, by virtue of the similarities with the already excellent Tiger Woods 2003, has fewer surprises. The whole simulation revolves around the revised and corrected version of the TrueSwing system. Unlike most of the traditional golf simulations where the act of the shot is simulated with the so-called ~three click~ method (launch/power/spin) in TW2004 we will be called to simulate the movement of our club directly by mimicking with the mouse the gesture that we would do in reality, obviously with some due differences. Depending on the speed of the mouse, the time, and the trajectory drawn by our movement, our shot will have the desired effect. We assure you that it is more difficult to explain than to do. For the more traditionalists it will still be possible to play with the more arcade and less simulative method of the ~three clicks~. Depending on the wood or iron chosen, the trajectory and the cut to give to ogni shot may also vary significantly, giving the game an almost unexpected depth from certain points of view. Furthermore, as in any self-respecting title, the weather conditions will greatly influence our games (we assure you that playing, for example, in the middle of a storm could prove to be a real nightmare) and also depending on the type of route it will be necessary to adopt always different styles of play from time to time. The grass is always greener on the other side The graphics of the various courses always appear luxuriant and decidedly effective even if the elements on the sidelines (including the public) can sometimes disappoint the most. As now mandatory, the infamous Pixel Shaders of the latest generation graphics cards will be exploited to give light to fascinating refraction and reflection effects. On balance, however, one will have the impression of being faced with the real weak point of the production: from this point of view, perhaps the title suffers from its multiplatform nature or, more simply, from the competition from other products that are accustoming the user PC all too well. Certainly, in the face of graphic qualities such as the excellent reproduction of the grass, it is easy to see how many textures are not exceptional (such as the trunks and branches of the trees) and how many surrounding objects are poorly cared for (such as the sand of the bunkers ). Let me be clear, the entire visual rendering still reaches high standards: let's say rather that in the 2005 version we will certainly be able to see several improvements in this juncture of production. Fortunately we have been able to notice how the game runs very well even on systems of no longer a very young conception. An honorable mention for the excellent animations of the players, always amazing and decidedly varied. The contour animations that help to immerse the player directly on the playing fields are also decidedly successful: swarms of insects and flocks of birds flying on the horizon help to make the recreated environments even more alive. Also on the sound side we must point out the excellent work done by the developers. Ambient music while browsing the menus, clear and crystalline sound effects and rather varied and fitting commentary are the strengths of the audio sector. Comment Not that there is much competition around, of course, yet this Tiger Woods PGA 2004 can rightfully boast the palm of the best title around. The product excels in just about every aspect. From the cosmetic components, but no less important, to those relating to the actual game. Even if we don't want to take multiplayer into consideration, the artificial intelligence of the computerized opponents will give us a lot of trouble but above all it appears flawed to the right point: more than once, for example, we have noticed an opponent in serious difficulty or back a few strokes. The almost infinite game modes, the included editor with the consequent possibility of downloading free amateur courses from the web, the excellent support for multiplayer tournaments via the Internet, the minimum hardware requirements and an excellent implementation of TrueSwing would make this title almost deserve the full of votes. Too bad for a few too many bugs that we had to deal with with systems based on ATI graphics cards (after all, the NVIDIA logo on the back of the package should already give us some doubts) and the total absence of the reviled Italian language both inside the game and in the manual itself. The appointment for the new surprises is next year: while we wait, we certainly won't have anything to get bored of. Pros: Attention to every detail, both on and off the pitch Effective and well-tested method of play Guaranteed longevity, also thanks to the excellent Multiplayer support Cons: Lack of localization In the face of excellent general graphics, certain contour elements clash Punctual as every year here comes, one season ahead of the numbering, the new version of golf on PC according to EA Sports. Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004 arrives in a certainly not crowded sector where by now the only competition is represented by the glorious Links and the previous Tiger Woods from the '03 vintage.", "date": "2003-12-15", "grade": null}
