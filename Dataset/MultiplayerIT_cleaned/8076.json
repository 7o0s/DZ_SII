The protagonist of the game, set in a Far West mysteriously invaded by hordes of demons and monsters, is in fact a cowboy equipped with sword and rifle, who faces his opponents by combining both weapons and bears a mark on his skin that would almost make one think of the sacrificial one of ~Berserk~. How else to explain what is happening around him? His old village is now deserted, the inhabitants have disappeared and strange magical seals block access to certain roads. The only way to remove them is to make their way with blows and buckshot, continuously outnumbered, perhaps casting a spell to open the defense of the enemy on duty and inflict sufficient damage to be able to ~finish~ him with a gestural combination. In this production there are many moves, many upgrades and many possibilities, and all this is assisted by a majestic technical sector, among the best ever seen in the mobile sector, strong in detailed polygonal models, convincing animations, beautiful light effects and an excellent level of detail for the scenarios. In short, has the action game genre on iOS (and, shortly, Android) found a new point of reference? Unfortunately not, and we will immediately explain why. The darkness that swallows you The Bladeslinger Ep.1 campaign unfolds through six chapters that are only the first part of a wider experience, which will eventually be enriched through the release of subsequent episodes. Beyond the plot, interesting but not very original, the title of Luma Arcade is held together by a traditional structure, in which you simply switch from one fight to another as you explore the scenarios, with few variations on the theme. However, the biggest problem of the game is not the repetitiveness, but the absurd, incomprehensible (in terms of design, of course) cumbersomeness of the control system. During the early stages, an on-screen warning clarifies the concept that Bladeslinger Ep.1 should be played with one finger, although the left thumb can be used on the touch screen to mimic the functions of a virtual analog stick. The ~ideal~ solution for the authors would be to touch with one finger upwards and then left or right to move our character, drag on the screen with two fingers to manage the view, perform a quick tap always with two fingers to roll on the ground and keep two fingers pressed on the device to block. That's not all: during a fight, dragging the usual two fingers on the enemy allows us to hit him with a fist, while a simple single touch activates the rifle and various gestures on the target translate into as many slashes. We have no idea what kind of reasoning has been done to consider such a terribly complicated approach better than the classic virtual stick with a set of buttons or a hybrid solution, the fact is that it is a huge problem, which heavily undermines the enjoyment of the experience and is felt in particular during fights with two or more enemies, when the action of rolling on the ground does not work in the way we would like, as it cannot be directed, and we end up locking ourselves in a corner at the mercy of the enemies . To an already so problematic situation we must add the excessive weight of the in-app purchases, given that the game releases very few coins with the standard progress and more than once we will find ourselves having to face a fight that is impossible to overcome because the vital energy it is almost sold out and we don't have enough money to buy a healing potion.", "date": "2012-12-31", "grade": "6.5"}
