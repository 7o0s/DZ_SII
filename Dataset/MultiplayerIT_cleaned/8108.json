Yes of course, how nice the idea of simulating the magical world of truck drivers. How nice to drive all over Europe to bring the goods. All beautiful, there's no doubt, but a fundamental detail is missing: where are the characteristic calendars? Come on, the ones that all other workplaces, stationary or mobile, would like to have hanging on their walls. How which ones? Don't be vague, they're the ones with artistic photos that as well as entertaining you pleasantly also teach you a lot of anatomy. Well, we don't know a truck driver who isn't also very knowledgeable about female anatomy, and all thanks to the above calendars! Such a contempt of human culture cannot be tolerated by an accurate product like Euro Truck Simulator 2. In reality, there is also a lack of restaurants with trucks... how, don't you know? Popular wisdom says (which in this case is so right) that if you are looking for a place to eat well, just look for one with parked trucks and you're on the safe side. Who better than these modern Ulysses to know which are the best restaurants in an area? In short, if you take away the best part of a job, you only half enjoy it. Hard work Idiot introductions aside, let's try to understand the nature of a particular title like Euro Truck Simulator 2. Let's say right away that it is aimed at a specific audience, namely simulation and truck enthusiasts. How many will there be in the world? It seems enough to have created a market, given that we are talking about a second chapter, therefore a confirmation. The player's aim is to start a business related to road transport, starting as an employee of other companies and then becoming an entrepreneur himself by buying vehicles and warehouses. At the beginning you have to decide the starting city and the level of the simulation, i.e. what kind of approach you want to have with the game. For example, we started by activating some options that would make our lives easier, just to gradually get into action, but we imagine that there are people ready to immediately select the maximum level of complexity of the simulation, which is also the one that allows you to enjoy it to the fullest all facets of Euro Truck Simulator 2. Explaining the concept is not difficult: once you have any job you have to bring a load from point A to point B, unloading it in a warehouse to get the money for the fee. However, such conceptual simplicity hides a considerable complexity in terms of gameplay. And this is where you have to try to figure out if we're talking about a product that might interest you or not: in Euro Truck Simulator 2 you have to drive for long minutes, from one part of Europe to the other, always keeping your concentration high. The problems encountered are of various types: on the one hand, deliveries must be made within a certain period of time, on the other hand, you have to deal with traffic and be respectful of the rules of the road. By violating too many rules, you end up paying repeated fines and frustrating your work effort. In short, the red traffic lights weren't set up for beauty, as were the toll booths that require you to stop, pay the toll and leave again. No full-throttle rear-end collisions and no high-speed corners taken, otherwise you end up damaging the truck and are a pain to fix. Maneuver Another problem of no small importance concerns the maneuverability of the vehicles. Arrived in a warehouse, the game allows you to automatically carry out the delivery by pressing a single button. In this way, however, experience points are lost, necessary to become masters in order to transport valuable goods and travel greater distances to earn more money, and above all part of the simulation is lost. The good truck driver maneuvers by looking only in the rear-view mirrors and scratching the packet of electronic cigarettes, but if you want you can help yourself by alternating the shots and choosing the one that gives you the best view as needed. We would never have thought it, but learning to maneuver these beasts has its charm, just as it has its charm to make long crossings while admiring the beautiful landscapes that cross along the way. Obviously, to get around, you don't have to go at random or read the signs, but you can rely on a handy GPS navigator that will always tell you the right direction. The risk of getting lost is minimal, but thrill seekers can select the option to replace the default maps with those of Apple, so as to travel practically at random ... no, this option is unfortunately not available. Too bad, that would have been a great idea. The kings of the road Obviously the real focus of the game is them, the kings of the road: the trucks. Recbuilt with painstaking care, there are many models, all with their own framework and characteristics. Enthusiasts of these imperious vehicles are sure to be satisfied 'wishing' through the streets in search of the perfect delivery. From a technical point of view you will have understood that Euro Truck Simulator 2 does its duty. The already mentioned excellent three-dimensional models of the trucks run on landscapes that are generally beautiful to look at. Too bad that if you look at some details, you notice several drops in quality. For example, the models of the cars that make up the traffic aren't that great, just as the cities deserved a few more details. However, one cannot complain too much, since it is not a title with a huge budget like others. The worst element however is the soundtrack, with the truck radios spewing really silly music.", "date": "2012-12-19", "grade": "8.2"}
