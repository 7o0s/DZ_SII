The characters depicted, the homonymous Denpa Men, are funny and colorful and recall an abominable cross between the Teletubbies and the Pikmin (here, tonight we will have nightmares). The truth, however, is that The Denpa Men: They came by waves and The Denpa Men 2: Beyond the waves were two old school RPGs designed especially for veterans of the genre who grew up on bread and Dragon Quest for years. The mechanics, accessible and very simple, made them real ~entry level~ titles for the little ones who came to terms with an RPG for the first time, but as they progressed in the game there was no shortage of frustrations and really hardcore moments that they liked to what has become a real fan niche. The Denpa Men 3: The Rise of Digitoll is dedicated to them... but not only. The Denpa Men 3 is overflowing with content and is designed for fans of the series and new RPG players They are all around us The Denpa Men 3 is based on the same foundations as its prequels, which are worth reviewing if you don't know the series, also because some time has passed since our last review. Everything - or almost - focuses on the Nintendo 3DS camera and augmented reality: this minigame allows us to see the Denpa Men who live in the radio waves all around us. Just look around with the console raised to find these little creatures, randomly generated perhaps under the bed or on the desk: their statistics and potential depend on the ether, so it will not be easy to find two alike, even if the differences are not that marked . The Denpa Men can in fact be distinguished by their elemental properties or by the skills they know, by their size and by the basic parameters, and it will then be up to us to build a first party with which to begin the adventure. The story is almost a pretext and, although it develops moderately in the ten hours necessary to conclude it, it always remains in the background without acute details. In short, do not expect a Final Fantasy-like plot, and do not believe that the disappearance of the Denpa Man that we will be asked to find initially hides who knows what surprises or twists. The game, once again, revolves around the exploration of the numerous randomly generated dungeons that we will have to complete to reach new areas and, above all, upgrade our Denpa Men, making them level up so that they become stronger and stronger. Fortunately, compared to the two prequels, changes have been made to the difficulty curve, now much softer than in the past thanks to the presence of various checkpoints at which to regenerate the strength of our party without being forced to return to the surface regularly. The enemies will still know how to be stinkers, be careful: visible in the corridors of the dungeons but almost impossible to dodge, they will often be outnumbered and will require a fair amount of strategy to be defeated, especially in the case of the bosses. At this juncture, The Denpa Man 3 shares the same flaws with its predecessors, namely a discrete variety of skills and options, as well as a considerable slowness in the development of battles, especially when completing the party and fighting with eight Denpa Men simultaneously . The 3D effect As in the case of the previous The Denpa Men, the mini-game based on augmented reality is very convincing and enjoyable, but for the rest of the game the three-dimensional effect is decidedly light and not very marked. Bigger n better? However, the growth and customization of the Denpa Men remains a crucial element of the gameplay, based not only on the capture of the best Denpa Men through the augmented reality mini-game, but also on the management of the equipment and costumes thanks to which the Denpa Men can improve their characteristics and adapt to the various challenges proposed in the dungeons. At certain times it is a fundamental micromanagement that could displace the little ones or newcomers to the RPG genre, bringing us back to the issue of the very delicate balance that holds the Genius Sorority title up. The automatic combat modes, for example, are not exactly optimal and can transform our Denpa Men into real kamikazes when facing the toughest enemies against which very specific strategies should be used. The dungeons, then, despite the certainly greater variety than in the past, still remain an exercise in linearity and repetitiveness that could make those expecting a relative adventure turn up their nosesrefreshed mind. Fortunately The Denpa Men 3 also implements a whole series of mechanics, already mentioned in The Denpa Men 2, which serve to diversify the experience and improve the general quality of life. At a certain point in the game, for example, it is possible to build an apparatus that will take care of capturing the Denpa Men for us, exempting us from the repetitive augmented reality mini-game, and it will also be possible to send a party of Denpa Men on an adventure, thus that we can raise another one while we're busy getting our main group to fight in dungeons. The multiplayer mode is limited but interesting: it allows us to face our friends' Denpa Men in asynchronous fights and to rent other people's Denpa Men or rent ours. There is no shortage of mini-games: fishing is back, for example, made more interactive thanks to a new and nice mechanic, and Genius Sorority has also had the idea of integrating a kind of ~mini Animal Crossing~, allowing us to furnish the houses of our Denpa Men with the objects found during our raids.", "date": "2014-06-25", "grade": "7.8"}
