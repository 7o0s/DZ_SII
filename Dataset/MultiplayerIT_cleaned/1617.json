{"name": "Castle Wolfenstein: Tides of War", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/castle-wolfenstein-tides-of-war.html", "text": "Like the PC original RTCW it offers excellent playability, both in single and multiplayer. Although the game, a classic for Id Software titles, places more emphasis on pure action and indiscriminate massacre, there is no lack of stealth elements of a certain importance. To survive it is often necessary to take advantage of the cover offered by the shadows and look for passages that are not in sight, move slowly avoiding making noise and attack the guards from behind with the trusty knife. All very simple actions to perform thanks to an excellently implemented control system, strongly inspired by that of Halo, and equipped with some decidedly interesting functions, such as the possibility of opening the doors quickly through a well-aimed kick, an action worthy of the best Hollywood films, or be able to break certain objects or surfaces. The management of artificial intelligence is fair, even if in some categories of enemies it seems decidedly better developed. Individually the Nazi soldiers are never a problem but, as expected, this is an eventuality that will rarely occur. So get ready for furious melees against legions of opponents simultaneously. The weapons available to the player are numerous and well made, with a mix of forties technology and futuristic hi-tech. The choice to limit the use of certain weapons due to their overheating after prolonged use is interesting, a detail that forces the player to think carefully about the choice of weapon to use. Lots of weapons, lots of firepower, but with a small drawback: for obvious reasons, you can't set quick selection keys for weapons on a console joypad and therefore, especially towards the end of the game, it becomes problematic to scroll through the inventory with the only two keys used for the purpose, to select the flamethrower (spectacular), or the sniper rifle, or the trusty machine gun. Castle Wolfenstein like other titles before him, starts almost quietly with the first levels that don't immediately capture the player, but fortunately the more you progress with the game, discovering the story, the more the fun increases. In fact, the advanced missions are not always linear, and offer more ideas than the classic, however valid, ~kill everyone and go to the next level~. More than ten hours of play are needed to finish the single player section, the longevity is more than satisfactory therefore, all this leaving aside the search for bonuses, or secret areas, which, in the best Id Software tradition, are particularly numerous. Massacro Live The strong point of the game, however, is the compatibility with Xbox Live: here RTCW, undoubtedly one of the best titles for the Microsoft online service, reaches its maximum level of fun. Many game modes, from classic deathmatch to missions with objectives, but not only: to enrich the experience there is the possibility of selecting different characters, divided into classes, each with very specific characteristics. They range from simple soldiers to doctors, each of these highly specialized in their tasks, such as treating allies or using turrets, and obviously equipped with a small list of selectable weapons. Of course, to be successful in team matches you need a well-matched mix of characters with different skills, being part of a well-balanced team is essential. The game supports up to sixteen players simultaneously via Xbox Live and the download of additional content, with the possibility of downloading new maps and perhaps new enemies and weapons. However, it should be noted that the game tends to have lag problems in games with many players on hosts with low-power lines. To avoid unpleasant surprises, it is advisable for the host to carefully follow the people limits recommended by the game, which analyzes the goodness of the connections before starting a new game. No problem for those who simply play games created by others: if the host's line is good, even a simple basic 256k ADSL ensures optimal performance. Technical aspect Graphically RTCW now feels the weight of the years. The engine hasn't been significantly improved since the PC version, which came out just under two years ago, with the aggravating circumstance that on Xbox there is too much slowdown in the outdoor sections. Slowdowns that, strangely, seem to affect the single player mode more than the multiplayer arenas. Graphically, the game makes an impression and has some noteworthy details, such as the use of really well-defined textures, the particularly pleasant creation of water and reflections and the total absence of pop-ups, but knowing the possibilities of the hardware Xbox still remainsa little perplexed by the creature Id, which certainly does not exploit the powerful Microsoft hardware to the fullest. As for the sound ... the music changes. Ok, the pun is terrible, but in this field the programmers have done a really good job, both in terms of the soundtrack and in the management of audio effects. Immersion guaranteed to all Dolby Digital 5.1 system owners, and guaranteed jumps on the chair. Comment RTCW: Tides of War is simply the best FPS on Xbox, obviously after Bungie's masterpiece, and one of the funniest Xbox Live titles currently available. The graphic aspect is not at the top, but the Id title compensates with a very enjoyable gameplay, albeit rather conventional, and a respectable sound sector. Guaranteed fun offline, but RTCW gives its best playing online. Definitely one of the best choices for the summer season, and an almost obligatory purchase for all FPS enthusiasts. A tasty appetizer waiting for big shots of the caliber of Doom III, Halo 2 and Half-Life 2. Pros: Online Sound Game It's still an iD Software game Cons: Some slowdowns Improved Artificial Intelligence Wolfenstein 3-D has always been more than a game. It is THE progenitor, the title that started the genre of First Person Shooters. And, after more than a decade of waiting, Id has decided to resurrect the brand. There are no more 286 or 386 and floppy disks, the bitmaps and the ~faux 3d~ have disappeared: but the call of the legendary Wolfenstein is stronger than ever... Like its counterpart from the early 90s, also Return to Castle Wolfenstein: Tides of War is set during the Second World War, precisely in 1943. The Nazi threat is more alive than ever and B.J. Blazkowicz, or the game's unblemished and fearless hero, has an important task, to investigate a big shot of the German SS, Heinrich Himmler, who seems to have succeeded in exploiting occult forces to strengthen the Nazi army, thanks to magical rites and decidedly unconventional medical experiments. Antecedent and prologue aside, the concept behind Tides Of War is quite simple and in line with that of thousands of other FPS on the market: kill the bad guys, be they Nazi soldiers or repulsive undead monsters, complete your tasks to foil Himmler's evil plans and returns home, more or less safe and sound...", "date": "2003-06-20", "grade": null}
