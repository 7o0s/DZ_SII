{"name": "Rogue Legacy", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/120741-rogue-legacy-eredita-in-due-dimensioni.html", "text": "First a jump back: do you remember the times when there was a sort of invasion of two-dimensional platformers? The same times when the Japanese were demonstrating that they had understood and brought to excellence a genre applied to two-dimensionality, while the Americans were experimenting with their first trips in three dimensions. Let's go back to the present: the indies. Despised by many, deified by others, but all agree that they are the new blood of a pure retro game, in many cases of quality. And if the truth rests in the middle, the fusion of ideas and intentions has led a decayed genre to find itself the protagonist of the videogame undergrowth. Simple, almost homemade ingredients, amalgamated to give the lovers of lost eras a constant flow of difficult, satisfying and somehow nostalgically current titles in their frankness. In no uncertain terms, Rogue Legacy is a pearl that Cellar Door Games has decided, through Steam, to propose and make available to anyone who wants to dust off a hardcore gaming of the most savvy origins. And if our words can hardly hide the enthusiasm in talking about the young Canadian team's latest effort, we are sincere in stating that, once you start playing, one game leads to another. Rogue Legacy responds loudly to those looking for an imaginary bridge to the sacred monsters of the genre from which it takes its cue (Ghouls'n Ghosts, Castlevania), with fast, direct, minimal gameplay but with precise and dry traits in the response to commands. There are no visual artifacts, there are no slowdowns, nor pieces that are in the wrong place: the ideas that make Rogue Legacy an extremely satisfying experience are the daughters of a clear will, which leaves no room for questionable design choices or deficient mechanics. Have we intrigued you enough? Sons of Gondor? Not really, but when fantasy is at home, so are dynasties, genealogies and legendary characters. Rogue Legacy takes up the second part of its title and focuses the fulcrum of the narrative on it. In truth, non-existent, as it is only a pretext to justify the registry and playful progress structure, but very entertaining. The idea is perfect for supporting the roguelike genre, to which the title belongs, with a generation of singular and never predictable characters. Imagine a timeline that advances inexorably, marked only by the protagonists you choose to use, and with whom you will inevitably face defeat. With each death your performance will be carved into the dynasty and from it will be born a trio of choice, exactly the children of the present era, and future heroes. The generation of eligible characters to choose from will be random in gender, class, skills and gameplay. To you the difficult decision of advancement, with which you will have to live with in the next level playthrough and which you will inevitably have to leave in the past once you meet death in the game. Forever, without the possibility of appeal in case you are attached to an ideal combination of parameters. The choice of Cellar Door Games is a winner, as it gives constant freshness to the subsequent attempt to advance in the adventure, skilfully mixing randomness and choice constraints; the limitations imposed force players to experiment with an often different style of play, building a varied experience that is hardly similar in flavor. Heroes that change, attributes that stay. Traveling the genealogical line, unlike other roguelike titles, does not involve the loss of characteristics, level and equipment, all obviously fictionalized as a legacy handed down to the successor of the dynasty. Sons who surpass their fathers, as a good fantasy novel teaches. Rogue Legacy combines entertaining platforming with RPG progression, with a surprising result I want a castle You never get tired of farming, especially if driving the action is the stimulus for playful revenge against a hardcore soul that leaves no way out. If we were to make a parallelism in three dimensions, the thought would immediately go to Dark Souls. And if the zeroing of expendables (simple coins) is added to the perennial deaths at each entry into the level, the similarities grow. Thanks to a random generation of the game world, the sessions offer an ever-changing starting point for action, with easily recognizable destructible elements of the scenario which in a short time make collecting money an automatic action, which does not take away resources and attention to exploration and to dodging enemy attacks. Having met the defeat of chance and chosen the new heir with whom to retry the quest, it is in that medium that Rogue Legacy fascinates and gives new stimuli.A deep character advancement system, embodied in a castle under construction, combines with the ability to evolve equipment and spells thanks to specific non-player characters. Translated: the desire to build the mansion and jointly to become stronger and stronger will lead the players to lead, attempt after attempt, very prolonged game sessions; satisfying, but never tiring, often close to a fast and light hit-and-run philosophy. It goes without saying that such a title would have been ideal for a laptop. The immediate use style can be lived in a carefree way, aware of the infinite possibility of retry, or in the opposite key, extremely committed and attentive to every touch of the pad. That's right, the pad, an extremely recommended accessory, sometimes mandatory in certain chaotic situations, which do not go well with the use of the keyboard. Non-stop map In terms of gameplay, Rogue Legacy does not go beyond what it deserves. Thanks to an immediate response, the few simple commands allow perfect control of the character. A few sessions are enough to get used to every single frame of movement, so as to be able to calculate and merge attack, jump, skill and use of the supplied object, which will consume magic points. To enrich the dish there is an intelligent management of the equipment and the runes to wear, since it will not be uncommon to need particular characteristics or physical abilities (finding yourself with a dwarf hero?) To explore each room with the right abundance. The random environment generation would be an almost perfect addition, except that failing to pass conditions when opening certain chests would make it totally random to try again in the next session, as everything would change on the next generation. This is where the third NPC, the Architect, comes in: thanks to him we will be able to ~block~ the dungeon generated in the previous attempt, provided we sacrifice part of the gold that we will recover. A small duty to pay, which allows you to save a lot of time, otherwise spent in vain trying, perhaps in vain, to re-propose a similar situation. This opens the door to criticism from purists: being in its depths an extremely punitive title, the desire to want to immediately retry the challenges of specific rooms will be very common and the Architect simplifies everything, avoiding gratuitous frustrations. The possibility of stopping the map actually offers a second shortcut, or rather allowing, through portals placed in the conjunction of the 4 game sub-worlds, to arrive immediately from the boss of each sub-section. Also in this case it is the player's freedom and his desire to challenge to try again with a new map or try again immediately, avoiding the accumulated efforts to go up in smoke. The system works, albeit with a not indifferent flaw: if tackled in a particularly aggressive way, the playful offer of Rogue Legacy risks burning its peculiarity in the first hours of the game, while maintaining a fair balance thanks to a high difficulty and a system well-researched character growth stories that keep you interested.", "date": "2013-07-04", "grade": "8.5"}
