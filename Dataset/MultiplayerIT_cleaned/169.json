{"name": "Point Blank DS", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/point-blank-ds.html", "text": "Load the nibs... aim... fire? This porting can probably be counted among the bravest ones ever: how to translate a concept that is based on the use of a device, the gun, into a version for a laptop? Namco Bandai thought about it and concluded that the stylus and the touch-screen could perform the function of the Light Gun, replacing it without necessarily affecting the gameplay. It is a correct idea, but with some flaws that affect the final result. As we said, Point Blank presents a series of mini-games that test reflexes, concentration, observation and precision: qualities that can also be highlighted by using a simple stylus to hit the targets that move on the lower screen of the NintendoDS. In short, in its incarnation for the Nintendo handheld, Point Blank retains the psycho-physical requirements that represent the challenge of the game, offering an enormous amount of mini-games to test the user, in a compilation which includes both internships to the Point Blanks of the past, and brand new levels designed especially for this edition. After choosing between various difficulty levels (which affect the complexity and frenzy of the stages) we will be forced to face crazy tests such as hitting spinning saucers on the right side, shooting down criminals while avoiding hostages, exploding fireworks, filling buckets of garbage and more: in the end our performances will be evaluated and we will be assigned a score and a title, among the many available. Among the various game modes, the most interesting is certainly the one that draws heavily on the recent trend of Brain Training: in fact, we will have to face the intelligent mini-games proposed by following precise rules, often even doing the math before shooting to hit the target Right. On paper, the idea of this compilation is good, and the mini-games are quite fun, but the deadly flaw is just around the corner... Argh, my nib got stuck! After testing Point Blank, the regret for missing the gun is persistent, you can smell the missed opportunity. It's not a matter of mechanics, as the concept works better than you think, but of ~feeling~: without the Light Gun factor, the game appears decidedly trivial. The technical realization is discreet, and the use of the graphic potential of the DS is evident only in a few stages in which there are three-dimensional elements, the rest is entrusted to a very colorful and detailed 2D, but which does not make one cry for a miracle. The audio component, on the other hand, offers sound effects, decidedly frequent, well made and hilarious music. But the discrete technical quality doesn't save a simple compilation of mini-games whose longevity is based on the collection of useless nicknames and the hi-score, extremely superfluous elements nowadays, when the amount of titles available on the market would require at least a replayability factor based on less ephemeral assumptions. The multi-player mode, on the other hand, is usable through a single cartridge and proves to be quite fun. The brave - or reckless? - Namco's choice to propose Point Blank on the DS was not a real failure, softco showed another face of the noble versatility of the DS, and now we know that the nib can even replace an infrared gun, without distorting the concept or game mechanics. But it is undeniable that the titles lose all their charm, when the device that gave meaning to their development is missing, even being the creative conceptual basis. But the problem with Point Blank DS lies above all in its longevity: it is a decidedly arcade compilation of mini-games, and as such destined to be placed on the shelf soon, and dusted off only on rare occasions. The road is still open, let's hope that the ball will be seized in the future to propose similar ideas, perhaps more elaborate. Pros: Maintains the challenge of the game even without a gun Excellent variety of mini-games Cons: No gun and with it a bit of a sense of the game Few incentives to replay it For those unfamiliar with Point Blank, it is a series of shooters conceived by Namco years ago in the arcade, then landed on PlayStation and PlayStation 2, which it was possible to play with the help of one of the most exciting peripherals ever: the Light Gun. Holding the massive plastic pistol to shoot the criminals was already satisfying in Time Crisis, but in Point Blank it was a whole other matter, when the player had to face challenges of reflexes, precision and speed at da little crazy, assisted by a hilarious and irresistible style. It's nice to find the crazy characters of Point Blank on the Nintendo DS, but one immediately wonders how to play now, missing the gun. Obviously, with the nib.", "date": "2007-01-11", "grade": null}
