As crazy as this idea may have seemed, and as much as no one would have ever bet on its success, yet the Traveller's Tales Lego games have proved to be splendid pastimes, in single and sometimes in multiplayer mode, captivating the most casual players with their cheerfulness and simplicity. Of course, not all of them have always proved to be of excellent quality, which has varied from format to format, but Lego titles have rightfully entered the history of videogames, at least for the highly original idea. And so, just a few months after Lego Indiana Jones, Lego Batman also arrives, probably on the wave of the success of the film Batman: The Dark Knight. But there's some news... LEGO-criminals and LEGO-heroes Unlike previous games that closely followed the story of the six Star Wars films and the classic Indiana Jones trilogy, Lego Batman offers an all-new story that in no way relates to the film directed by Christopher Nolan. In this adventure, some of the most; Famous criminals from the Batman universe have escaped from the famous Arkham Asylum and threaten the integrity of Gotham City: Batman and Robin just have to jump into action to stop them. The narrative freedom has allowed Traveller's Tales to design broader stages, with situations and bosses typically inspired by the super-criminal of the moment: Batman will face the Joker, the Penguin, the Riddler, Two-Face and other historical enemies, beating meanwhile their minions, jumping from platform to platform or driving some vehicles in short dedicated sessions. Among other things, the way in which at a certain point the story turns upside down, and the player finds himself facing stages impersonating the bad guys on duty, is original. Both Batman and his rivals are faithful counterparts in the Lego version, with a funny and colorful look, equipped with hilarious blocky animations that simply contribute to entertaining the player, especially during the cutscenes through which the story unfolds, humorous despite the total absence of dialogue. In short, graphically everything is well done, especially within the limits of the PSP: compared to the home versions, on the contrary, the realistic detail of the locations and above all of Gotham City is much less noticeable, which clashed with the comic and surreal aspect of the characters and means of transport. However, the same flaw on the sonic side has been maintained: an at times reckless abuse of the classic Danny Elfman track historically associated with the early Batman films directed by Tim Burton. This short track is repeated during the game with excessive frequency and sometimes out of context: it's beautiful, okay, it's famous, it's okay, but a little variety wouldn't hurt at all. More of the same Beyond the narrative component, Lego Batman does not depart particularly from the concept of the previous games in the series, on the contrary it offers the same mechanics, starting from the main ~hub~, the Bat-cave, from which you can choose the levels to play or replay , buy additional features and other amenities, already seen and reviewed since the very first Lego Star Wars. The aim of the game is always the same: the levels are tackled initially to unlock the following ones, then to collect as many ~studs~ and secrets as possible: the ~studs~ are once again a sort of monetary unit with which to unlock numerous game options. additional gameplay, such as secret characters. After all, it is important to take control of as many characters as possible to replay the various stages: each hero or villain in fact has individual abilities that allow him to overcome certain obstacles or solve specific puzzles. The player controls two characters at a time, one directly while the other is managed by an unfortunately incomplete artificial intelligence: by combining the skills of the various characters while replaying the levels it is possible to solve previously insurmountable puzzles and recover ~stud~ and additional bonuses. In short, Lego Batman is certainly not a very long game, but it offers enormous replayability to all those who want to dissect it, unlocking everything and more: the possibility of selecting various characters in myriads of possible combinations is a pleasant increase in gameplay variety , especially considering the main flaw of this PSP version of Lego Batman, that is the absence of any multiplayer mode. Anyone who has played Lego Star Wars on PlayStation 3, for example, will certainly remember how much fun it is to tackle the internships in the company of a friend, online or locallye: on PSP this is not possible and you have to rely on the cold and often illogical automatism of our virtual partner.", "date": "2009-02-09", "grade": "7.8"}
