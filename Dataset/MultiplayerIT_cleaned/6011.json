It is objectively difficult to match the impressive qualitative and content offer of the 2K series, but with this new chapter we can already say that the house has once again managed to outdo itself and offer its best chapter, thanks to new additions and further refinements on what was already good. The flagship of this edition is the renewed My Player career mode; one of the main focuses for years, but never as complete as now. The idea of proposing a film-like experience had been in the air for a long time and the prestigious collaboration with Spike Lee brought that extra edge that was missing. However this is just one of the surprises that 2K Sports has prepared for the career mode, which has left us genuinely amazed by the introduction of American universities, an addition that no one hoped for after the increasingly difficult relations between video games and the National College Athletic Association. NBA 2K16 is one of the greatest incarnations of the franchise created by Visual Concepts Social basketball NBA 2K16 Continues Near Full Integration With Online Features; despite the complexity of the package, the game communicates continuously with the 2K servers for the management of the personal player, which is created even before arriving in the menus and represents a persistent identity. The Virtual Currency returns, a virtual currency that can be accumulated by playing the various modes, or purchased with real money, which allows you to improve parameters and shop in the game's internal shop. We can therefore dress our avatar freely. And again, 2KTV counts once more on the young player Rachel A DeMita, who presents the various episodes of a broadcast that will be proposed throughout the year and which sees the presence of illustrious guests from the NBA world. Movies are easily viewable in the main menu, but also within the game. Michael Jordan reappears as a spiritual icon and protagonist of the game's Limited cover, even appearing in menu transitions and bringing back memories of NBA 2K11. The menus are perhaps one of the least convincing elements of Visual Concepts' masterpiece. Every year a different and original solution is sought but the results are never fully convincing: there is little harmony in the screens and some are spartan and poorly maintained, including the main one and the in-game menu. Nothing capable of affecting its functionality, of course, but perhaps in this respect 2K Sports should take some cues from the competition. On a completely different level the presentation, simply breathtaking this year thanks to the presence of three commentators: Shaquille O'Neal, Ernie Johnson and Kenny Smith, the latter well-known for his assessments in the half-time interval and now a performer at all field. The interventions of the trio are interspersed throughout the match, with an unprecedented television effect. But that's just the beginning: 2K Sports has also included a double set of post and in-game interviews, both through Real Voices technology and in the studio, with close-ups of the players. Everything is meticulously cared for. Could the cheerleaders be missing? Obviously not, so let's get ready to experience timeouts embellished with spectacular dance routines. Simply put, it's like watching a real sports broadcast. But who are you, Spike Lee? Aside from the presence of the various modes that characterize the package, such as the Complete Season, the Team and Manager mode, the highlight of this edition is represented by the new My Player career, mentioned at the beginning, which sees the participation of director Spike Lee. The idea was to offer a cinematic experience, a trend more or less latent in previous iterations, but expressed here at its best. What we are facing is therefore to all intents and purposes a film called ~Living the dream~. Regardless of the choices made in the editor phase, our player takes on a unique personality, that of the Frequency Vibrations character, a promising young sportsman who grew up in the ghetto together with his twin sister and family. The career alternates games with long cutscenes, with real supporting characters played by actors through motion capture technology, but it is also possible to connect to the net for a few games with friends in My Park mode. What is astounding is the already mentioned license granted by a dozen US colleges: UCLA, Arizona, Louisville and others have offered their brands for ssimulate a youngster's rise from the school fields to the top division. After having excelled in high school, ~Freq~ (name with which he will be identified by commentators) finds himself making an important decision for his future, choosing the college from which to receive the coveted scholarship and then continuing his climb towards the NBA draft. Despite the absence of any reference to the March march, names, real features of the players and the NCAA, the rendering of the collegiate basketball atmosphere obtained by 2K Sports is impressive, with repercussions also on the gameplay, as we will see later. From the school gym to university arenas, with a different interpretation of the spectators - obviously younger and more vehement - you live a significantly different basketball experience, so much so that the shadow of College Hoops 2K8 emerges. It almost seems like a waste to see all this material confined to one modality; it would have been really nice to be able to face the colleges even in the simple exhibition, on a par with the Euroleague teams, obviously present again this year together with a new selection of classic teams. Perfecting the myth As far as playability is concerned, NBA 2K16 aims to refine the good things achieved by the previous episode, adding improvements and refinements that are always welcome. The most relevant novelty was the implementation of a shooting bar, which last year replaced the previous (and obsolete) viewer of the ideal detachment point. The meter also returns in this chapter, thus allowing for greater control over accuracy. However, it should be specified that the safety of a basket is ensured only by making an optimal shot, extremely difficult to obtain, while in other cases the result is established by calculating a large number of variables, not least the position and skills of the individual player. Note a significant change to the passage system: the quick call to icons remains unchanged, but now it is also possible to perform three types of launches associated with specific keys, while the combinations of analog commands are still linked to special moves. On the other hand, the quick schemes are less practical, always activated through a non-invasive in-game window, but now completely entrusted to the right analog stick. The heart of the game remains substantially unchanged, while enjoying a series of improvements and modifications that can only be seen by true fans of the saga and real sport, who remain the main target audience after all. Without bombastic revolutions, 2K Sports has integrated into its ranks several users specialized in sliders, i.e. freely modifiable game parameters, and present again this year. This has not only helped to improve the artificial intelligence, but also to create a close bond with the gamer community, who have contributed their feedback. Leaving all the parameters unchanged, NBA 2K16 is an extremely demanding title even at the freshman difficulty level. The artificial intelligence is relentless and punishing, ready to exploit any space not covered by the defense (still difficult to manage), enjoying an almost superhuman ability to collect rebounds, intercept passes and nip the player with lightning fast breaks. The score gap will be large in the first few games, so we need to prepare for the worst, even if as always perseverance helps to improve. The lack of attention towards newbies and in general those unwilling to assimilate all the nuances of this sport is all too evident, we are facing an even more inflexible simulation than in the past and the lack of tutorials is a further declaration of intent. However, the work is not entirely free from criticisms: without touching the sliders, the shooting percentages of the artificial intelligence are still high, while on our part some errors in the conclusion phase, such as a simple lay-up, are excessive and penalizing under the basket. In general, the spectacular nature of the NBA game makes the games very exciting. That's why the changes to colleges in career mode are almost a breath of fresh air: more passes, less dunks and actions generated by team harmony, before individual performance, are just a few elements that contribute to fantasizing about that College Hoops which unfortunately we will never see. Playstation 4 trophies NBA 2K16 features 51 Trophies, the first ones can be easily conquered by facing the My Player career, and it will be really worth it, believe us. There are also objectives related to specific players or particular actions to be carried out during a game, such as a tripla-double or 15 and more points earned with 3-point shots. There are also many Trophies linked to My Team, a mode full of surprises. Good luck! I go to the max Visually NBA 2K16, in the current gen edition, reiterates the goals achieved with the transition to the new consoles, with detailed players, a native 1080p resolution and a frame rate almost always pegged at sixty frames per second. Particularly relevant is the new body scan technology, which ensures a greater identity to the various body types; essentially we won't have the usual generic model with the player's face, but each one is elaborated in its entirety on the real counterpart. Having said that, we need to understand the 2K Sports philosophy: each generational change corresponds to a new graphics engine, the subsequent iterations focus on the details. For example, compared to last year there is a higher level of reflections on the parquet, a better use of shaders for surfaces and an evolved sweating system. The result is still a genuine eye candy, like the rendering of the great champions, identical to their real life counterparts. The effort put into the soundtrack is also commendable, with the beauty of about fifty songs with the contribution of DJ Premier, DJ Hhaled and DJ Mustard, all through five playlists reached also by recovering some songs from previous editions. The genres draw strongly from the hip-hop universe, but also with various digressions that have characterized the last chapters of the franchise. Off to artists like Nas and Jay Z then, but also rock with the Ramones, Living Color and dance with Calvin Harris. Also present were our local Club Dogo, with the song Fragili. The only area in the shadow of the production is unfortunately historical: the still uncertain online. While the servers weren't fully operational at the time of our tests, we did suffer a few niggles, such as our player being wiped off the network, various disconnections and issues in Pro-Am mode. Hopefully this will be resolved upon release.", "date": "2015-09-28", "grade": "9.0"}
