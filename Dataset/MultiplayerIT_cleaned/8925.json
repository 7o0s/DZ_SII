Precisely the absence of a title dedicated to the Italian plumber in the first months of life of the platform represented one of the major impediments in terms of sales for Nintendo, with all the unfortunate consequences that this caused. The arrival of Zelda and Starfox has improved the situation without letting it take off completely, basically because they were two remakes which - even if excellent - due to their very nature could not represent real killer applications. In short, 3DS owners, potential undecided buyers and Nintendo itself were literally consuming themselves waiting for Mario: and our hero answered the call with the style he prefers, or rather with a title capable of justifying the purchase of the console. The importance of the name Super Mario 3D Land is not called that by chance: for this debut on 3DS, the good old plumber wanted to put aside the interplanetary experimentation of Galaxy and the multiplayer tone of New Super Mario Bros, referring instead to the style of the Super Mario series Land born in 1989 on Game Boy. Which means a return to a more classic play structure, but strong in the peculiar characteristics of the Nintendo portable and above all enhanced by the apparently boundless creativity of the EAD developers. Few frills and immediately a lot of substance for Super Mario 3D Land, which delegates the narration of yet another kidnapping of Princess Peach by Bowser to a short cutscene and immediately places the user in the familiar scenario of the level selection screen, divided into eight worlds and arranged strictly in single file: and as if the classicist ambitions of the title were not already evident enough, the pixelated sprite of the first Super Mario Bros used as a placeholder to reiterate the concept takes care of it. This obviously also extends to the very nature of the stages, which in Super Mario 3D Land offer a more concentrated and linear experience than in Super Mario 64 and all its spiritual sequels: the emphasis is on intensity rather than on exploration, with the user being guided towards the finish line in a fairly rigid way but making sure that you can enjoy every single moment of this journey. The result is excellent, and unless you are firmly against this old school approach, it is impossible not to consider this new Mario adventure as a real level design jewel. It is particularly surprising that every single game scenario presents something that makes it different from the others, whether it is a particular gameplay mechanic, the characteristics of the setting, the camera setting or even just a single element (an enemy, an object, a power-up) but juxtaposed with such perfection as to turn the meaning of the entire stage. An almost perfect balance is also the one that exists between tradition and innovation, with essential elements of the old Mario platformers - such as the time limit and the flag at the end of the level - which bind without any jarring with the many small original ideas cleverly scattered from EAD throughout the entire adventure. Even a historical component such as that of the upgrades has undergone an impeccable restyling here: you can use the fireballs of the Flower of Fire to make a bank and the Super Leaf guarantees a better glide, while in the context of the new entries the Boomerang suit allows you to knock down enemies and collect objects from a distance and the Helix Cube is used to reach otherwise unattainable heights. A small but nice gameplay niche has also been reserved for the console's gyroscope, used to move the view when using the cannons or when you find telescopes thanks to which you can scan the surrounding scenario in search of hidden Toads who will thank you for your consideration by bestowing various types of bonuses. Very strong emotions As we have illustrated so far, Super Mario 3D Land has been able to keep an eye on the fundamental pillars of the series, and this could only involve the discourse related to the control system. Which, incidentally, is so intuitive that it doesn't even need a tutorial line: the analog stick, the two front buttons and a backbone are all you need to control the protagonist on the screen, with that incomparable reliability that brings the user to only get angry with himself in case of a badly calibrated jump. The lower touchscreen is instead used to illustrate some related informationto the stage you are facing, to move the camera slightly to the right or left (a function that has very little use since the view is simply impeccable) and above all to have access to the reserve power-up, an action not necessarily delegated to the mere purpose of saving the skin in case of difficulty: on several occasions, in fact, a pinch of planning is required by the user to achieve the most difficult objectives, keeping a specific enhancement for the most suitable areas or even alternating two different ones to maximize the results. Despite this, it must be said that the overall challenge level of the experience is not among the highest in Mario's history, above all as regards obtaining the inevitable stars, here in the form of large coins: each stage contains three and , apart from very rare cases, you really need to have blinders on to get to the end of the race without having taken home the vast majority. But it is the difficulty in general that is (deliberately) calibrated downwards: the extra lives arrive in buckets, the power-ups never fail and the really challenging moments can be counted on the fingers of one hand, exorcised by the fact that the game gives away a golden Tanooki Suit that grants invulnerability when registering a rapid succession of game overs. These are certainly not aspects that ruin the experience, and on the contrary make it even more enjoyable and faster in perfect harmony with the dictates of portable gaming, but some Mario fundamentalists could turn up their noses in the face of such a delicacy. However, it is enough to be patient: in fact, by completing the eight worlds that make up the adventure, as many are unlocked which not only increase the longevity of the otherwise very short product, but finally prove to be able to give some satisfaction even to the most hardcore users . These are levels that in some cases represent very successful remixes of stages already tackled previously (so elaborate as to be almost completely unpublished), while in others they prove to be real new entries. However, all of them are characterized by tougher enemies, more difficult obstacles to overcome, tighter time limits, various maluses and so on, in a further cornucopia of original ideas that almost makes you cry. And speaking of feelings, access to these special worlds also unlocks the possibility of using Luigi as the protagonist: in short, if Nintendo wanted to hit the nostalgics in the heart, it hit the mark. The 3D effect As we have already had the opportunity to state in the body of the review, it is no exaggeration to define Super Mario 3D Land as the first (and so far only) 3DS title to exploit the main peculiarity of the console for a very specific and tangible playful purpose. The sensation of depth helps in the execution of the jumps, allows you to better appreciate the difference in height between the various platforms, helps to detach the elements of the scenario from the backdrop in a much more marked way and more. In addition, the EAD developers had fun inserting some boxes with deliberately deceptive perspectives in which the activation of the 3D effect is essential to reach the finish line. The fact that it is also very beautiful and pleasant to look at is the proverbial icing on the cake. Mustachioed and always liked From a technical point of view, Super Mario 3D Land is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful titles to watch on 3DS: not only for the mere visual impact (however excellent), but above all for a three-dimensional effect that is as convincing as ever and that for once delivers on the promise of being both a feast for the eyes and a real integral part of the gameplay. The most immediate confirmation can be obtained simply by observing how the stages are structured, in what we would not hesitate to define as the real three-dimensional evolution of the classic concept of scrolling platform game: even if the direction to follow is almost always one and the same only, the title enjoys playing with depth of field by making Mario run away from the screen or towards it, and more often than not launches into dizzying vertical wheelies, all with a camera that frames the action from the best possible perspective. EAD's taste for experimentation has also involved this last aspect, as can be seen for example from a stage set in a dungeon with a bird's eye view, an evident homage to pre-Ocarina of Time Zelda. Returning to the subject of 3D, there are numerous situations in which - thanks to a particular use of perspective or other tricks - Super Mario 3D Land is actually easier, more pleasant and more intuitive to play with the effect activated thanrather than off: all this, combined with real visual gems such as cannonballs and fireballs that seem to come out of the screen, means that the Nintendo product is one of the few in which one has never even remotely touched the idea of lowering the slider that adjusts the three-dimensional depth. But as we mentioned earlier, it is not only the 3D that excels as regards the cosmetic realization of the title: graphically, Super Mario 3D Land offers soft and detailed polygonal models, first class animations, defined textures, bright colors and everything you can expect from a Mario adventure in terms of design. There are the ~old~ Goomba and Koopa along with brand new enemies, and a similar dualism also involves the look of the levels, which draw from scenarios typical of the series (the underwater world, the haunted house, Bowser's castles, the flying ships of his minions and so on) but without skimping on new solutions that are almost always of great effect. The same can also be said of the sound accompaniment, with traditional effects and music alternating with convincing ad hoc motifs. Last note of color regarding the often mistreated Street Pass feature, used here to compare your scores with those of the players you meet and even to unlock some special challenge rooms in which you have to eliminate all enemies and/or collect all the coins within ten seconds to get an extra star.", "date": "2011-11-21", "grade": "9.5"}
