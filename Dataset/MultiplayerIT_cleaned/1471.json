{"name": "Dragon Ball Z Budokai 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dragon-ball-z-budokai-2.html", "text": "Game mode After an excellent animated introduction, which will delight fans of the series, and the choice of starting a new game or loading a save (small neo: it is possible to make only one save, therefore more people will need different Memory Cards), Budokai 2 offers Dragon World, Duel, World Encounter and Practice modes. Of the four options, three belong to the classic mentality of fighting games: it is possible to challenge a friend or the computer, selecting a scenario among those available (~Duel~), become familiar with the countless special moves and with the control system (~Practice~ ) or take part in the Tenkaichi Tournament (inexplicably called the ~World Match~, in fact), possibly earning a certain amount of money. The ~story~ mode is very interesting and different from the usual, which in this case is called ~World of the Dragon~ and differs from what is generally proposed in titles of this type. Rather than selecting a character and facing all the others in sequence, as is usually done, in the ~World of the Dragon~ you will have to, briefly, relive all the events that characterize the Dragon Ball Z series, at the command of Goku and a or more companions that you can choose from time to time. Each scenario is represented by a map, characterized by boxes connected by ~rails~, and on which the characters can move in turn, usually one ~step~ at a time. On some squares it is possible to find money or bonuses (which improve the characteristics of the character), and when you reach the square inhabited by an opponent, you start fighting. Both your warriors and your opponents have a certain number of ~lives~ (which can be increased by visiting the box of the young Namekian Dende), and they lose one following a defeat. When you permanently eliminate an enemy, you acquire one or more skills, for your character or others. These skills can be of different types: special moves, upgrades of various kinds, the availability of new warriors in the Duel and World Encounter modes or new scenarios. When it comes to special moves or power-ups, you can assign them to characters during movement phases. In the first levels of the game it is not very important to exploit the skills acquired, but the more you proceed and the stronger the enemies become: at that point it is absolutely necessary to exploit everything you have to get the better of your opponents. To break the monotony, the developers thought of equipping certain boxes with particular conditions in the event of a fight: there is the box of the ~viral heart disease~ (in which the participants in the fight see their vital energy drop down to the minimum and must fight despite everything), the one in which you start without spiritual energy or in which it drops continuously, and the one in which it is not possible to use the parry. These boxes represent a definite disadvantage when facing an enemy of a certain level. Finally, the collected money can be spent on purchasing skills in the Capsule Corporation shop, assigning them to characters for the other modes. Finaaaaaaal Flaaaaash!!! Some special moves are ~interactive,~ in the sense that both characters are called upon to make choices or spin the left analog stick in an attempt to counter each other's strength. The sequences in question are absolutely spectacular, even if the damage caused by the attack can disappoint Control system and technical characteristics The control system of Dragon Ball Z Budokai 2 is practically identical to that of the first Budokai: a key for the punch, one for the kick, one for the parry and finally a key for controlling spiritual energy, to launch blows of 'power. The combinations available with the left backbones have been eliminated (perhaps not to make everything too easy), while the combinations on the right backbone remain, useful for making tricks or to simplify the sequences necessary to obtain certain moves. It is also possible to use only the two analog sticks: the left one to move, the right one to deliver the various blows (depending on the direction). Personally, I preferred the ~classic~ approach. If you want a comparison between Budokai 2 and any ~real~ fighting game, like Tekken 4, we can't satisfy you: they are two opposite ways of conceiving fights. If in Tekken 4 it is possible to create technical and realistic clashes, dodging and parrying the opponent's blows, in the new Bandai title the emphasis is placed completelyon the super moves and superhuman abilities of the characters, who even cannot stoop but who on the other hand manage to break mountains or buildings by throwing them at the enemy. The most spectacular sequences are ~automatic~, so the player's involvement is limited to the good execution of more or less long key combinations. From a technical point of view, the step forward compared to the first episode is clear: the graphics are now in cel shading, the best system for representing cartoonish characters, and the reproductive fidelity is impressive. From a distance, some doubts may arise, but in the close-ups it is scary to note how Goku, Vegeta, Tenshinhan and so on have been well made, identical to the manga. If the texture animation capabilities of the PS2 had been slightly superior, we would have been faced with the best example of how it is possible to recreate the aesthetics of a cartoon in a video game. The music is functional to the clashes, and the whole game has been translated into Italian in the best way (apart from the English dialogues, even graphic elements of a certain importance have been translated!): a round of applause to Atari for the work done. Comment Dragon Ball fans have been satisfied: Budokai 2 is the best game taken from the series, the most complete and the most careful in using all the elements of the cartoon in a constructive way. An essential purchase for those who live or have lived with Kamehameha and battles between Super Saiyans. If you don't know the cartoon or the manga, however, you will certainly notice the defects of a product like this: practically absent depth and technicalities, impossible to compare to a ~real~ fighting game and with the many characters more or less the same in practical terms. Pros: Graphics extremely faithful to the anime Long, complex and varied ~story~ mode All texts translated into Italian Cons: If you are not a fan of DBZ, you will hardly appreciate it Fights without depth or technique Moves aside, the characters are all the same Bandai has produced, over the years, countless video games based on highly successful Japanese animated series and TV series. The vast majority of these titles fell short of mediocrity, sadly, and exceptions to the rule have always been rare. For some time, however, thanks to the technical potential of new gaming systems and, no less, the use of more and better resources, we have witnessed a trend reversal, of which the Budokai series is the undoubted protagonist. Intended as an obvious successor to the insipid Dragon Ball Final Bout, Dragon Ball Z Budokai has taken advantage of polygonal graphics to reproduce the epic battles between Super Saiyans in the most spectacular way possible, covering the events and characters of the Dragon Ball Z cartoon from the very beginning. (the arrival of Raditz and the discovery of the existence of the Saiyans) to the saga of Cell. Dragon Ball Z Budokai 2 completes the work, in practice, adding the last saga present in the manga (the clash with Majin Buu) and introducing new and interesting game modes.", "date": "2003-11-28", "grade": null}
