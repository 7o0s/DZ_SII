{"name": "Manhunt", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/manhunt.html", "text": "The figure of the good in Manhunt does not exist. The protagonist of the game and our alter ego, James Earl Cash is not exactly a saint. Indeed, let's say that he is the prototype of the bastard, all muscles and a tough look, sentenced to death for the crimes he has committed. We meet her in the game's introductory sequence moments before the sentence is carried out by lethal injection. But something doesn't go right, and what was supposed to be the end is actually the beginning of a terrible nightmare. Believed dead by the authorities, forgotten by all, Cash becomes a puppet in the hands of the mysterious Mr. Starkweather, a psychopath who likes to be called ~The Director~, whose only passion is snuff movies, absolutely illegal underground films in which the actors die. For real. Cash finds himself the main protagonist in spite of himself, on a huge film set that reproduces the suburbs of a city, of the greatest snuff movie ever filmed. And he will have to sell his life dearly, following the instructions given by the director to the letter and killing all those who stand in front of him, to survive. Welcome to Prison City Thus begins Manhunt: Cash finds himself alone, abandoned in a desolate urban landscape populated by gangs of criminals, the Hunters, hired specifically to hunt him down. The director's voice guides him through an earphone. The game is basically a rather atypical stealth game, which starts from the basic assumptions of the genre to evolve them according to a very particular scheme. The focal point, unlike a Metal Gear Solid or a Splinter Cell, compared to which Manhunt is much more forgiving and flexible, is not so much sneaking around without being intercepted, but escaping the Hunters, luring them into a trap by hiding in the shadows, and transform at the right moment from prey to executioner, brutally executing unsuspecting opponents. There is a perverse voyeuristic taste in observing the victims, obsessively following their movements with their eyes, listening to their ravings from a safe position, waiting for them to turn their backs on us and stealthily attack them, following them and giving them the coup de grace. As interesting as it is brutal, the system implemented for executions. Once he is behind a Hunter, Cash raises an arm, an unequivocal sign that he can kill with a single blow, and at this point just hold down the attack button: the longer you hold it down, the more violent the attack will be. execution (there are three different levels of gore, which also vary depending on the weapon used) and more points, essential to unlock the inevitable extras, will be obtained. Obviously the longer you wait, the greater the chances of being discovered. And the adrenaline rises, as does the incessant tum tum of Cash's heartbeat. Obviously it is also possible to face the Hunters in a direct hand-to-hand fight, managed with the classic fighting game dynamics, but it is really better to avoid: the madmen who populate the streets of Carcer City are incredibly strong, and a couple of direct fights are enough for reduce Cash at the end of life. Really very good in all situations, although not without some flaws, the control system. The major flaws are to be found in the camera management system, often difficult to orient at will, but fundamental in many game situations, given that it is always necessary to be able to adequately keep an eye on every movement of the Hunters. Certainly the game mechanics, however interesting, tend to become repetitive in the long run, especially considering the vastness of some levels, really exhausting to complete, and the artificial intelligence of the opponents. The AI is of a very high level, and it is a pleasure to observe the reactions of the Hunters who are chasing us in the most disparate situations, such as a suspicious noise caused by us ad hoc or the discovery of the corpse of a killed comrade, but yes he has the clear impression that there is no real evolution of their behavior patterns as the levels progress, and Hunters belonging to different gangs tend to act in more or less the same way anyway. The variety of weapons is remarkable, divided into four different categories by size, type and the noise they cause during executions. And it must be underlined how the game, in some levels in which Cash is equipped with firearms, is transformed from a stealth game into a frenetic shooter, adding a little variety to a formula that tends to get tiring in the long run, above all considering the linearity of the twenty levels of which the game is composed, to be tackled strictly in sequence. The plot that binds the events is comStill quite engaging, and there are a couple of twists to keep the player glued to his seat. The level of difficulty is decidedly high, even very high in some stages so as to border on frustration when it is necessary to replay entire rather long sequences, accomplices save points from which to restart a little too distant from each other. Low incentives to replay the title once finished, although there are some extras to unlock. Of the technical aspect one can only say a great deal of good: the realization of Manhunt is excellent in all respects. The solid graphics engine is exploited properly to recreate oppressive and annoying atmospheres, the design of the environments and of the Hunters is very spot on, as are the effects, which aim to make the image as similar as possible to amateur shots made in eight millimeters. The visual violence of the executions is hallucinating, impossible not to be strongly impressed, especially considering the realistic graphics and not calmed down, as in the case of GTA, by a deliberately caricatured setting. The work done by Rockstar is also excellent in terms of audio. Noisy background pieces, good effects and a perfect dubbing to say the least, unfortunately only in English, although subtitled in Italian in the most important dialogues. It is a pity that the sentences spoken by the various Hunters during the game are not subtitled: those who do not know the language from across the Channel will irrevocably lose some goodies. A curiosity: it is possible to use the PlayStation 2 headset sold with SOCOM to listen to the Director's instructions in headphones and use the microphone to attract the attention of the Hunters. An element capable of further loading the already heavy atmosphere of the game, immersing the player even more in the sick world of Manhunt. Comment Manhunt is not a game for everyone, and this is primarily evident from the VM 18 sticker on the cover. A fully deserved stamp: the new Rockstar effort is perhaps the most violent and raw game that has ever been programmed, with a very strong emotional impact. And precisely the oppressive atmosphere, accentuated by the careful choice of colors, by the ruined metropolitan settings, by the pure 8mm-style cut and by an exceptional audio accompaniment, is the greatest strength of the game. In addition to an exceptional form, substance is not missing: solid gameplay full of winning tricks, albeit not perfect and sometimes repetitive. Manhunt deserves it, but only if you have the guts, and the age, to play it. Pros: Fun and enjoyable, good finds Exceptional atmosphere Excellent technical realization Cons: AI of the Hunters not developed properly In the long run repetitive Come on, it's time for a change. No more GTA, at least for a while, and for this Christmas the Scottish guys from Rockstar North, ex DMA, have decided to delight the fans (which are really many), with an ambitious and completely new project: Manhunt. The contents are strong, the VM 18 sticker on the cover is not lacking, but never as in Manhunt has Rockstar demonstrated its ability to skillfully combine deliberately excessive themes with a top-level game structure, focusing everything on substance, as well as on appearance and the image. And getting amazing results.", "date": "2003-11-26", "grade": null}
