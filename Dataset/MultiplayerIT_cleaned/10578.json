{"name": "Soccer Manager 2022", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/soccer-manager-2022-recensione.html", "text": "Although it is normally associated with the PC world, the managerial genre could ideally adapt very well to mobile use and this review of Soccer Manager 2022 demonstrates how, at least by someone, concrete results are emerging in the exploitation of the formula in this area too. Available on iOS and Android, the game is part of a now rather consolidated series between smartphones and tablets, but also on PC and Mac, given that the origin starts from the desktop version, as an indie and free-to-play response to the excessive power of football manager. There is therefore now a well-established basis under the increasingly complex and refined mechanics of the last few chapters, with the structure now going on mainly by increases in content rather than substance. To tell the truth, there are no huge changes in Soccer Manager 2022 compared to the previous edition, which you can learn more about by reading our Soccer Manager 2021 review. However, in a game like this, even the simple progress through the seasons with consequent updates of squads, names and regulations, all under the FIFPRO license obviously makes a difference and the fact that it is still offered as free-to-play leads to a practically automatic passage of users from one chapter to the next, provided that total saturation has not been reached. We know well how football management, especially in a land of football enthusiasts, has an irresistible attraction, which is why it is easy to overlook the lack of novelty and the harmful consequences of the freemium model to jump on this other edition as well. Gameplay: a club in your pocket Soccer Manager 2022, a screenshot showing one of the main menus The amount of options and facets that Soccer Manager 2022 manages to bring to small smartphone screens is impressive, staging gameplay that is equivalent to that of other major and noble productions, albeit with some modifications made to meet style monetization free to play. It is always about coaching and managing a football club, both from the point of view of the field and in terms of controlling the finances and the general health of the club, trying to achieve ever better sporting results. The game concentrates in the hands of the users an enormous amount of statistics to keep under control and options to interact with, managing however to always remain quite clear thanks to an interface which, already designed to work best on portable displays, results in this even more optimized and clearer edition. Soccer Manager 2022, in the image we see that modules and tactics are substantially unchanged from the previous chapter From this point of view, we must praise the streamlining effected in terms of reading and navigation, despite the fact that there hasn't been any lightening in the options, which have indeed increased: contrary to the previous chapter, in this case there is no longer vertical scrolling but everything is visible in a single screen, with the ability to quickly switch from one to another with side swipes. Through these menus, which are the heart of the game, we have to control the fate of the team by dealing with the transfer market and negotiations with the players, structured training on different characteristics, developing the game form and tactics and obviously directing the team during the actual match. Changes: between game systems and technique In Soccer Manager 2022 the match graphics are not exactly the best, but the game is not based on this In addition to the improvements applied to the interface, which are immediately evident, there has also been a certain evolution in the graphics relating to the matches, with more varied and detailed stadiums and better animations for the players, although obviously this remains a minor part and in any case it is somewhat subdued compared to more action-oriented football games. The most notable technical evolution is then probably found in the management of artificial intelligence, which now offers both more difficult opponents (even too much in several cases, with suspected influences on the issue of micro-transactions) and more reactive players. By this we mean not only on the pitch, but also in the management phases: the dynamics of the team, the chemistry between the players and also the reactions that they may have based on their performances have been better elaborated. Requests for contract adjustments or ~stomach aches~ due to incompatibility with the team emerge in a more convincing manner and force us to take further managerial aspects into consideration. The progression of the coach himself also represents a significantnovelty of this chapter, which allows you to apply experience points to increase the statistics of our alter ego, as in a sort of role-playing game. In Soccer Manager 2022 it is possible to expand and enrich buildings and sports facilities, with the usual expectations At the beginning we can choose between three standard types of manager: the coach more focused on physical work, the tactics specialist and finally the finance genius, but starting from these basic archetypes it is then possible to evolve the character by applying points to increase statistics and improved in various respects, customizing our coach. Finally, other changes concern the introduction of non-league tournaments, which can be used to test modules and formations as well as to earn some extra money, and some changes to the player transfer system, which to tell the truth is still rather confusing and unclear, with the introduction of additional agreements and pre-contracts. The consequences of free-to-play Soccer Manager 2022 allows you to manage your training in detail It is not easy to evaluate, in a few days of testing, the actual impact of microtransactions on the balance of Soccer Manager 2022, which all in all seems quite fair. Also in this chapter we have to deal with forced expectations regarding the construction and improvement times of the structures, which is also sensible, while the presence of advertisements is rather intrusive, which can in any case be eliminated by making at least the basic purchase of 5.99 EUR. The latter can be considered an acceptable agreement to be able to enjoy the game in a more peaceful way and paying a rather low price: the problem is that the monetization system is in any case inherent in the mechanisms of the game and sooner or later it will emerge, especially as regards the management of bonuses and boosts, as well as additional save slots, which then partially affect the general balance by pushing towards in-app purchases.", "date": "2021-10-15", "grade": "7.0"}
