{"name": "HEROish", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/heroish-recensione.html", "text": "The multiplayer online battle arena, for MOBA friends, are part of a strategic sub-genre that can boast very worthy representatives even in the mobile sector. Well, it is precisely that formula that inspired the developers of Sublink for their new title, available exclusively on Apple Arcade, while introducing quite a few variations on the theme. As we are about to tell you in the HEROish review, in fact, the game offers yes some multiplayer modes in which the competitive mechanics of MOBAs somehow find their place, with two or four players challenging each other to destroy their respective crystals, but the main focus of the experience is a single player campaign that also brings into play especially different elements. Structure: three campaigns and six characters HEROish, the navigable world map for accessing missions On the wings of a not exactly original story, in which the reign of the protagonist heroes is threatened by a dark army, HEROish offers three different campaigns in which we control first the Imperials, then the Cursed and finally the Beasts, with a total of six playable characters , two per section, and the possibility of choosing one or the other in order to increase the degree of replayability of the experience. The commander that we will be able to pilot at the beginning responds to the name of Flynn, but we could easily call him Thor there are many points in common with the god of thunder from Marvel. Armed with a war hammer that emits lightning and can be hurled at enemies, this fighter corresponds a bit to the figure of the speck-hero, smug and defiant, depicted in many Disney feature films. Gameplay: between MOBA and card battler HEROish, Flynn fights alongside his troops The gameplay, as mentioned at the beginning, is presented as a mixture of different elements: the control of the character takes place via a repositionable virtual stick (but the Bluetooth controller is supported, as in almost all the titles on Apple Arcade), while the attack automatically activates as soon as an opponent is within range. However, it is not the standard shots that will make us complete the missions successfully, but the cards that appear in the lower part of the screen, which can be used using the energy that is recharged over time and allow not only to launch powerful special attacks, but also and above all to summon a whole series of units that they will accompany in battle. It is precisely at this juncture that the references to MOBAs become clear: there are towers that could eliminate us in a matter of moments, forcing us to restart from the crystal that is at the beginning of the stage, and that is why we will have to send our minions forward and use them as a shield while we also try to inflict damage on the structure until we move on to the next threat. Among increasingly numerous and strong waves, barriers and alternative routes, the missions of the three HEROish campaigns become more and more complex and multifaceted . However, another factor is striking, namely the innovations that are introduced when, for example, you switch to controlling the ~bad guys~ in the Cursed campaign, or even when you put yourself in command of the Beasts. HEROish, the second campaign with the Cursed ones changes the cards on the table... literally This type of variety manages to fill the shortcomings of a combat system that is not always satisfactory also due to the automatisms, together with direct navigation on the world map for access to new businesses or impromptu fights with bands of wandering enemies. Finally, let's not forget obtaining new cards and the possibility of upgrading them from specific artisans using the gold collected up to that moment. Then, as mentioned, there are the multiplayer modes, in which all these mechanisms are declined in a competitive environment, with the possibility of using the characters unlocked up to that moment and of facing one-on-one or two-on-two matches in which you have to manage your cards in the best possible way to reach the opponent's crystal and destroy it: a pleasant content, but the campaign seemed more interesting to us. Technical realization: the typical cartoonish fantasy HEROish, an ongoing siege If it is true that in terms of structure and gameplay HEROish can count on an alternative approach, different from the usual, on a purely artistic level the game does not have much to say and limits itself to retracing paths already widely traveled by other cartoonish fantasy-themed productions , see for example the series of Orcs Must Die! or Warcraft itself. In any case, we cannot complain about the design of the characters and above all the amount of minions that we will be able to summon during the different campaigns, while for thescenarios we would have preferred a bit more personality since different solutions appear rather generic, as well as the music that we will find to accompany us in the action.", "date": "2022-07-31", "grade": "7.6"}
