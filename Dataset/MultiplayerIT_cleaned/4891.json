In this case, however, it is difficult to do otherwise. So let's remove the tooth: for the writer, NieR: Automata is a masterpiece. A game, as often happens when it comes to the master Taro, which hits you like a well-aimed punch in the pit of the stomach. Three matches, one different from the other but all inextricably linked to each other, which create a narrative choreography that is difficult to remember elsewhere in the recent panorama. It is undoubtedly, despite the fact that we are still in May of a crazy year, one of the games of the year and that will not change despite a crazy DLC. NieR is a journey that you should all experience, with its incredible stories, the difficult choices it puts before you, its philosophy, one of the most beautiful soundtracks ever and, given that it is a video game, seasoned with a gameplay that never had a Taro game had, thanks to the skilled hands of Platinum Games. For some, NieR: Automata will be what Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain never was. For a few weeks we had been assured that no extra content would arrive  and instead Square Enix has seen fit to launch a first DLC. Let's find out starting from the clear and simple assumption that 3C3C1D119440927 is not objectively worth the price of the ticket. The NieR: Automata DLC is a strange journey through little content and yet another great message Call me what you want Without making the now very obvious jokes about the name of the additional content, let's start immediately by making it clear that this is not a real expansion. Inside you will find a series of contents almost certainly cut from the final release, with some small juicy additions to afford to go out on the market. The focus of 3C3C1D119440927 revolves around three arenas scattered across the vast (not too much) open world of NieR: Automata. Do you remember the famous door in the desert in front of which one of the biomachines destroyed itself after forbidding you to enter? Welcome to the first of three arenas. Each of these unfolds in the slums, highlighting a real sub-world in which the androids of the resistance and the biomachines themselves manage a series of structures that are incredibly reminiscent of the Colosseum or, more cinematically speaking, of ~fight clubs~. What you will be asked to do is face these tests (about six for each of the arenas) and claim your loot. They range from classic clashes to special requests such as not using dodge, up to follies such as never touching the ground. There will also be new bosses, including the now highly anticipated CEOs of Square Enix and Platinum Games, who will give life to a battle that is as short as it is crazy. At the end of each you will be rewarded with materials, chips and cosmetic items (the much coveted clothes for 2B and A2 that are actually borderline legal). So far, everything is normal, at least until you realize that Taro, despite the drive to create something to make more cash, wanted to pay homage to everyone with a series of narrative goodies that will cause the usual shiver in the hearts of enthusiasts. Trust us when we tell you that the true ending of this DLC will hit you as hard as the original did, but we won't say anything because it would ruin a great moment. Returning to the concreteness of the gameplay, this content suffers from the same balancing problem as the base game. The tests all have a preset difficulty and this will lead you to experience them in an extremely simple way or like a real nightmare based on the situation of your characters. And if, like us, you have made the ~choice~ on the ending, well, know that no one will come to your aid. You will be called upon to prepare brand new fighters ready to slaughter each other, exponentially increasing the completion time of the DLC, which ranges from a minimum of a couple of hours up to increase dramatically due to the need for sometimes extreme farming. All this and a pinch more is the NieR: Automata DLC. Take it for exactly what it is: a content built in no time with what was eliminated from the base title. The good news is that Taro and his team wanted to add an extra twist that, while it doesn't objectively improve the perception of a crazy price, may subjectively be worth the ticket, given the emotional whirlwind it can cause. Even a simple dialogue in an arena between an android and a biomachine can snatch a tear and this is what the Japanese author has accustomed us to over the years. If you are part of this group, transformand seamlessly that ~no~ in a ~yes~. Take or leave.", "date": "2017-05-08", "grade": null}
