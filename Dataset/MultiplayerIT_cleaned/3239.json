{"name": "Kick-Flight", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/kick-flight-recensione.html", "text": "Kick-Flight review: the new 3D multiplayer-based brawler for iOS and Android developed by Grenge takes an important step in the direction of the anime style on mobile devices, making the most of cel shading to create very well characterized characters, equipped with a convincing design and spectacular animations, especially when activating the supers. The main source of inspiration of the game is undoubtedly Dragon Ball, if we consider the way in which the protagonists move and fly, accelerating thanks to a simple touch on the screen and projecting an energetic aura that really leaves no doubt. However, the contaminations are probably numerous, and considering some solutions we would also say Digimon due to the clothing and weapons that the characters wield during their furious battles. The rules of the game are simple: within a series of arenas it is possible to try your hand at three different competitive modes in which eight players challenge each other with eliminations or totalized scores by capturing flags and conquering control points. All with a view to a progression system that refers to the best freemium productions, in this case a system of cards and upgrades to Clash Royale. Gameplay and structure After completing a short tutorial, Kick-Flight immediately launches us into the action, urging us to activate the very fast matchmaking to find new games. Unfortunately, in these first few days there are some uncertainties of the servers, which perhaps signal weak connections even when they are not with the risk of running into unjust penalties, but beyond this the experience immediately proves to be pleasant. As mentioned above, we find ourselves flying within the scenarios, chasing our opponents thanks to semi-automatic pointing and unloading our entire repertoire of moves on them, represented by a series of cards found in the lower part of the screen, rigorously displayed in portrait mode. We are therefore talking about a game designed mainly for smartphones rather than tablets, to be played with one hand and without too many thoughts. In truth, the simplified touch control system works well for moving and exploring the environments, but becomes extraordinarily uncertain and cumbersome when it comes to fighting, since the view tends to go crazy and there are not enough support mechanisms to better adjust the movements and avoid flapping left or right in an attempt to hit an enemy. The inevitable lack of support for Bluetooth controllers does the rest, giving us an experience full of untapped potential. It's a pity that in practice the gameplay of Kick-Flight turns out to be so chaotic and slippery, because otherwise the production Grenge does everything right, indeed very well: the technical realization is fantastic, there is a great care for the animations and the general design, both of the characters and of the scenarios (the latter, however, a bit generic), while the aforementioned progression uses very well-tested solutions between boxes with timed opening, achievements, cards and the inevitable season pass.", "date": "2020-02-18", "grade": "7.4"}
