{"name": "Doom II semplicemente l'FPS!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/77781-doom-ii-doom-ii-semplicemente-lfps.html", "text": "A great game from the past is back in the limelight thanks to a conversion dedicated to the Microsoft console and available on Xbox Live. At the cost of 800 Mp it is in fact possible to purchase the entire package which contains the 32 levels of the original Doom II: Hell On Earth and the 9 layouts of the new Doom II: No Rest For The Living. History made pixels As for Wolfenstein 3D and for Doom himself, also in this case it is a real leap into the past which, after our test, was still decidedly fun. It is evident that the entire content is absolutely dated but it is also true that walking through the narrow corridors amidst the screams of enemies is nothing short of exciting. The product available for download is absolutely faithful to the first version that appeared on PC back in 1994 as a sequel to the first Doom, which confirmed the great love of gamers for this fps and this setting. For the uninitiated Doom II is part of the genre of first person shooters, in each level you fight face to face with demons and monsters who are waiting to kill us while we look for the way out of the labyrinth / stage. The opponents waiting in the individual levels must be eliminated by force, or with our fists or, more easily, through the various firearms that can be encountered over the course of the game. The difficulty of Doom II, although it is possible to choose between 5 challenge levels, is never a big problem, after all it is a title that has its age and today's users are certainly more savvy than they used to be. An important facilitation catches the eye and is the possibility of saving at every point of the level, without the adventure ever becoming frustrating. Xbox 360 goals The 200 points are not difficult to obtain by completing the two episodes of the game, even if it is necessary to replay the title by changing the difficulty level and face many matches in deathmatch. In addition to the normal scores expected for the objectives, 4 avatar awards, 2 celebratory t-shirts and 2 Marine overalls can also be unlocked once the No Rest For The Living chapter is finished. Hand to the pad and off to frag! This version of Doom II provides support for the coop both with the shared screen, which as far as we have tested does not generate any kind of slowdown of the game engine, and online via Xbox Live, and here we actually encountered some lag problems , and we can only confirm that in any case playing with friends is always rewarding. The multiplayer doesn't stop at the cooperative mode but obviously it includes the classic deathmatch challenge, against other players, in this case the only problem is to find online opponents, we had some difficulties. From a graphic point of view there is not much to say, the conversion has not brought any improvement and the textures make you smile as well as the poor definition of the polygonal models of the enemies, but the feeling has remained the same and all the lovers of the original version they can only be satisfied. The graphical interface is basic but absolutely functional, showing us our state of health, ammunition, type of weapon and the state of our armor. A forerunner ~hud~ that has only been abandoned for a few years by the most innovative productions, which now tend to show less and less information on the screen, making it rather ~live~ to the character, such as for example the view that is changed once the protagonist is wound. Actually something similar exists in Doom II too and the screen turns blood red when our man's health visibly deteriorates. As we have specified a few lines above, the ID Software title was born for PC but the conversion for Xbox 360 was very successful, obviously we are not talking about the graphic level but we are referring to the controls, now perfectly calibrated to the Microsoft console joypad. It is evident that it is a bit strange nowadays to move the character but not be able to jump or raise and lower the view, basically if an enemy is above or below us it is possible to shoot him since the aiming aid will get the bullets to target but you can't aim them accurately. The sound is something superb, or rather absolutely archaic but, thanks to the absolutely successful midi of that time, the leap into the past is more than complete, introducing realistic sounds would have made no sense and would have distorted the essence of Doom II.", "date": "2010-06-04", "grade": "S.V."}
