{"name": "Pi forte della gravit", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/111547-fallblox-piu-forte-della-gravita.html", "text": "It was just under a year ago when, just in time for Christmas, a hilarious, intriguing, intelligent Puzzle Game by Intelligent Systems was released for the Nintendo digital store Pullblox, which since then remains if not exactly in first place, certainly among the top three in the ranking of the most beautiful eShop titles, easily managing to compete even with the best ~traditional~ releases on card. Evidently it must have met with success proportionate to the quality, if the Kyoto house and its ~accomplices~, creators of successes such as Fire Emblem, Advance Wars and Paper Mario have decided to make a sequel, again for eShop, always with the little sumo wrestler as the protagonist, always focused on blocks to move and answer, with only one, but fundamental, novelty: ladies and gentlemen, here is Fallblox. Birds for diabetics If possible, the premises of Fallblox are even crazier than those of the prequel. Life flows placidly as always in the village of Mallo and Mastro Blox, until one fine day Poppy arrives, the beautiful (?) Granddaughter of the creator of the Pullbloxes, to visit her elderly grandfather. Mallo, clearly moved by the vision of such an irrepressible beauty, therefore shows off all his strength to make himself beautiful in the eyes of the newcomer, without however considering that she arrived in flight on a very particular vehicle: a sort of hot air balloon in the which instead of the balloon there is an enormous aviary full of birds (they look like parrots and this is confirmed by the fact that they can also talk, but we wouldn't swear), an ingenious invention - after all we are talking about Mastro's niece Blox - aptly named ~Stormon Balloon~. In short, the impetuous Mallo's display of strength frightens the poor birds, who run away and take refuge, guess where? That's right, right on top of the blocks that the old inventor enjoys building, who knows why. And while you're at it, guess who gets to pick them up one by one? Exactly, precisely to Mallo, that is to you. Those unfamiliar with the first title may find this not particularly difficult: however, they must know that Mastro Blox is a well-known sadist who enjoys building these structures made up of many blocks of different shapes and composing them in such a way as to make the top inaccessible; only by moving the blocks, which can be pushed and pulled in the four main directions, in front, behind and to the side, in a certain way will it be possible to create the ~ladder~ that allows the unwary customer, who thus passes from puzzle solver to athletic protagonist of Platform, to reach the top. Now, passing over the fact that parrots so well trained (if they weren't poor Poppy would have fallen to the ground on her first flight) they could easily return to the storm balloon by themselves, the important thing is that while the Pullbloxes of the first game worked almost like of chest of drawers, with the blocks that ~came out~ from a common plane for a maximum of three spaces, these new ones, the Fallblox to be precise, are subject to the law of gravity and no longer have movement restrictions: by moving the block below , that or those above just fall to the ground. It is essentially one of those apparently small changes, but which in reality manage, thanks to the skill of the programmers, to almost completely change the essence and philosophy of the game, let's see how. The 3D effect Given the greater three-dimensionality of the concept that now allows you to move a block wherever you want in the play area, stereoscopic 3D has even more meaning than it had in the first episode, still failing to be indispensable for perfect fruition, but getting there very close. And then, by virtue of the structure of the blocks so solid and squared, as in Pullblox also in its sequel the 3D is really a good look that does not affect the fluidity, so why not activate it? It's raining blocks! The entry in grand style of the concept of gravity and the absence of the limitation to three spaces for the movement of the blocks (there is also another, small novelty: in Pullblox it was not possible to push or pull a block when this meant putting a foot in the foul, in the following one can (obviously accepting the fact that then one will fall under) they almost manage to change, we were saying, the very essence of the game concept. It is one thing to strive to understand how to ~pull out~ a structure that you know will remain at that height, quite another to worry about the fact that if you move a block the one above will fall to the ground, and therefore try to figure out how to do it drop in the place where it is needed, or try not to drop it at all. It is in general the greater freedom granted in Fallblox to the player, who also sees theintroduction of some elementary concepts of physics and which is substantiated, among other things, in a fully three-dimensional environment complete with a camera to be positioned where it is most needed, to change the cards on the table: if Pullblox's puzzles had by their very nature a single, even if often and willingly diabolical, solution, those of his sequel propose more than one, and sometimes they don't seem as refined as their predecessors even though they appear at first sight generally more difficult. The other side of the coin is that the game seems to adapt to the rhythms and way of thinking of the player, precisely by virtue of the greater freedom it grants him: in Fallblox, in short, you will feel much more ~masters~ of a game world that is perhaps a little rougher than seen in the past, but which still maintains very high levels of ingenuity, challenge and difficulty without, as is good tradition, ever being frustrating, also thanks to the good ideas of the first episode such as the possibility of rewinding time, to completely reset the puzzle and to ask for help from Master Blox, who return in full. And all this for the one hundred levels of the ~storyline~ which introduce, from time to time, some extra elements such as blocks with particular properties and doors which act as shortcuts between one block and another, to which you go to add 90 extra levels, called ~exercises~, which immediately present a greater difficulty. The level editor is back by great demand, which allows you to create your own puzzles, transform them into QR Codes and thus share them with the whole world, and several very amusing extras also make their appearance, including the possibility of immediately present have a chat with the released parrots, who, if they really don't have any advice to give you, will surely put a smile on your lips with their highly refined humour. All seasoned with the usual technical sector from the eShop title, which certainly won't make you cry out for a miracle and which is not at all different from the past, but which in any case does its duty perfectly both as regards the graphics, colourful, fluid, nice, both for the sound full of music that succeed in the difficult task of not being annoying while you ride between the different blocks.", "date": "2012-11-27", "grade": "9.2"}
