As I have repeatedly pointed out on these pages, the driving games sector has seen a flourishing of different sub-genres that satisfy all types of gamers, from the most savvy to those who prefer less pretentious games. STCC2 is immediately close to Arcade games, without however disdaining some purely simulation aspects. If we want to compare it to titles such as F1RC or GP3, we realize that the latter are products, which, while not reaching the rank of simulators (which belongs only to Papyrus titles), prove to be more complex than the Dice title. It should be emphasized that in the Touring car championship the cars involved are certainly less sophisticated than those of F1 and therefore the setup of the cars is decidedly simpler, but it is also true that the number of adjustments on which we can act in the game is really limited. moreover the values are not expressed in their unit of measures, but expressed with adjectives (for example the anti-roll bars can be: Soft, Normal and Hard) characteristic of strictly Arcade games. After these premises one would expect an approximate driving model, and instead STCC2, on this aspect, surprises proving to be superior to many titles, and even reaches excellence in support for peripherals with Force Feedback where it stands at decidedly higher levels. The weather conditions are also foreseen, which show off a nice wet effect, which however is not comparable to the best achievements of the genre such as those of F1RC or GP3. Hmm what am I doing? A Mondeo? A Honda Accord? Or rather a 156? We were talking about the Swedish championship, where it is possible to drive the best cars of the genre ranging from the Audi 4 to the Alfa 156 or opt for the one-make championship with the Camaro Z28. What is not fully convincing are the circuits. Let's understand each other they are well made and graphically satisfying, but they are not the best because they are a bit small and unknown even if quite technical. On the other hand, Anderstorp or Keimola may be known, but I don't think Mantorp or Kinnekulle are very famous! Returning to the cars, it should be noted that the internal cockpits are not bad, but they do not have any functioning instruments and therefore the only information is given to us in superimposition. However, the graphics are very flashy, if a bit flat. Unfortunately, the graphics engine does not appear optimized, especially when compared with that of Nascar 4 or F1RC, which manage to provide much better frame-rates. The damage model is also well done, except that the game automatically brings us back on track after the most disastrous outings. Well this is just like an arcade game! Let's end this quick roundup with the sound that proves to be without infamy and without praise. Singleplayer and Multiplayer Up to now we have had to deal with a discreet title that can be played and appreciated despite some flaws. But some of you will object that we haven't talked about Multiplayer! And in fact I haven't dealt with this topic yet, on the other hand the only viable way for Multiplayer is offered by the more ~professional~ titles such as Papyrus (GPL and Nascar 4), so I don't have high expectations from STCC2. And instead surprise!! The Multiplayer that STCC2 is able to provide is a pleasant surprise and demonstrates how the On-Line game, if one wanted to, can be exploited in a decidedly better way than it is done today (true Ubisoft and Microprose?). The Internet races can be played with up to 8 competitors and take place on a small client supplied with the game, at this point just insert a Server and the game is done. The system consists of chat rooms and game rooms. But there are also some interesting news. For example, it is possible to join the game, even if it has started, to watch the race as spectators. Furthermore, during the race, we can read the name of our opponent on the roof of the car, or we can still see the brake lights come on when he brakes. I must say that despite having a 56K connection I have always played very well, demonstrating a good job done by the programming team. Another particular feature of STCC2 is the exclusion of collisions (obviously it is an option that can be selected by whoever commands the server). This may seem like a contradiction, but if we consider that there are often real crazy people who go around with us, such a choice can only be welcome. There isn't much to say about the singleplayer, there are the classic modes that can be expected in a driving game, the only consideration must be made with regard to the AI which does not prove particularly aggressive even at the highest levelsthere. Let's understand each other she behaves with dignity, but she certainly doesn't make people cry for a miracle. Conclusions STCC2 proves to be a discreet title, with excellent support for multiplayer and which is able to give us hours and hours of fun. I remind you that the patch to version 3.2 has been released, which is essential for playing on the net and which can be downloaded from the manufacturer's website. I miss TOCA so much! A few years ago an interesting title was released which responded to the name of STCC and which represented one of these strange cases whereby a game is underestimated by distributors and instead appreciated by the public. The main ~defect~ of the game consisted in the setting that recreated the Swedish Gran Turismo championship, which certainly made Scandinavian gamers happy, but the others a little less (in this regard, can you imagine a game like this with our tracks Magione, Misano or Pergusa? slurp!!), moreover he found himself battling with much more famous titles, first of all a certain Toca 2. that this is due to the lack of competing titles in a videogame panorama that still sees us stuck with titles such as the aforementioned Toca 2 or SCGT, both more than seasoned titles. In any case, the game is so popular that even the most refractory distributors decide to publish the title and finally give it worldwide dignity. These are the background facts, and the result of this is tangible and present on my desk in the form of a package with manuals in Italian (it must be said that the game came out a few months ago, but the publication in Italian is only these days ). So shall we go see this brother of Toca? Well let's put on a coat and reach the cold lands of the North to experience emotions that are anything but glacial.", "date": "2001-05-30", "grade": null}
