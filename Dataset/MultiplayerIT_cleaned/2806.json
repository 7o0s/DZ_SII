The Frontier Developments title is not actually something completely new, on the contrary: we proposed its review for PC back in 2016. Four years later, however, improvement after improvement, it was decided to think of a big debut style even on current generation consoles. We had the opportunity to try Planet Coaster: Console Edition on PlayStation 4, to date the best heir (spiritual and material) of the famous RollerCoaster Tycoon. Gameplay: how to play Let's start with the most important question, which every review should never ignore: how to play Planet Coaster: Console Edition? The genre of belonging is that of management simulation: you will take care of the creation of your amusement park (from scratch, or from an already started project) and you will try to improve it continuously to make ends meet and entertain the public, objectives to keep in mind constantly and always at the same time. The gameplay of Planet Coaster: Console Edition thus provides the player with a frankly impressive editor, with a very large number of objects ready to be placed wherever desired. The possibilities are almost infinite, just follow the thread of your imagination: you can build your amusement park in any geographical environment (in the mountains, in the tropics, near a river, in the city), modify the elements present at will, constantly enrich it with new attractions and shops, designing every single roller coaster from scratch (the developers' attention was particularly focused on the latter). If the creations available are not enough for you (which is practically impossible) you will still be able to access new sources of inspiration and that is the most brilliant ideas of other outdated players, duly shared on the net; and you yourself can show the world yours too. Once again (and it is normal, in 2020) the watchword is sharing. Game mode The console version of Planet Coaster brings with it all the game modes already seen on PC at the time, without any unreleased content of any kind: not that it's a bad thing of course, given that the launch version was already more than complete. The least interesting offer of all is certainly the career mode: here the game will ~throw~ you into amusement parks that have already started, asking you to achieve certain objectives within a certain period of time. It may be a particularly large sum of money, a degree of customer satisfaction, and so on; generally the level of challenge is not overwhelming, however. Much more interesting, however, the sandbox mode, through which the player can choose his favorite geographical environment (within about ten pre-established options) and start his career as an amusement park manager from scratch. There won't be any kind of rush, nor will there be particular objectives to be met: you will simply follow your imagination, taking advantage of all the possibilities of the Planet Coaster: Console Edition editor. You will therefore be able to dedicate yourself to a very contained amusement park but with attention to every single detail, as well as to much more complex and vast experiences. Finally, the main game menu allows you to check the challenges proposed by the developers of Planet Coaster: Console Edition: completing them all will take you a good amount of time. Consider that potentially the title could last literally years, depending on your passion in management of this type. Playstation 4 trophies Planet Coaster: Console Edition brings a good list of trophies to PlayStation 4, including the Platinum Trophy. Getting them all won't be particularly difficult, but it will take a long time; you will also have to dedicate yourself to all the game modes present, on all the Career. The conversion Planet Coaster: Console Edition arrives on PlayStation 4 with an excellent conversion, without giving up any of the content present in recent years on PC. From a graphic and technical point of view, the production is more than satisfactory, and manages to manage numerous elements on the screen without heavy slowdowns; moreover, it is possible to change perspective, going from a bird's eye view to one that is in all respects a first person to explore the park, without any loading. If you wish, you can even go on board the roller coasters, to enjoy the same experience as the visitors. Also noteworthy is the adaptation systement of the command map: for obvious reasons the experience is not the same if you have a keyboard instead of a controller. However, beyond the first few hours needed to familiarize yourself with the mapping of the DualShock 4, the use of Planet Coaster: Console Edition is not at all compromised by the new input system.
