{"name": "Lotus Challenge", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lotus-challenge_a.html", "text": "The game itself Anyone who has tried the Lotus saga on a computer, at a time when 16 bits represented the maximum available on the market (Amiga, Atari ST, Snes and Megadrive), will remember how a screaming audiovisual creation was accompanied by a very high playability and an enviable longevity thanks to that desire to play and replay until you drop a racing game that is still remembered by fans of the time. However, Kuju Entertainment, the developer chosen by Virgin Interactive (distributor of the game), has preferred the path of simulation (always speaking of the console area, we are certainly not talking about Gp3 or GP Legends for PC), bringing the title in question above all to Ferrari 355 Challenge, the masterpiece created by Yu Susuki of Am2 (Sega's internal team), arriving next year also on the Playstation 2. Indeed, the control system looks very much like the racing game conceived by the father of Virtua Fighter and Shen Mue, one of the most misunderstood masterpieces of the gaming industry (perhaps due to the presence of only Ferrari and a single view?), also for the implementation of aids to the stability of the chosen car, in acceleration, braking and so on. A rookie who grew up only with arcade racing games such as Daytona, Ridge Racer and Out Run, even with all the aids enabled, may have many difficulties in managing his own vehicle, not only due to the extreme difficulty of the game system programmed by Kuju Entertainment but also due to the tendency to skid very often at high speeds, even if all the aids are enabled, which did not happen with the F355. Simulation enthusiasts will certainly find bread for their teeth, especially if they play without any facilitation, but a more rigorous test in terms of driveability would have helped a lot Lotus Challenge: what's the point of enabling one or more driving simplifications if in any case 215km/h, I slow down to enter the bend, the car swerves and it's not possible to countersteer? Too bad, it would have been one of those games with a great longevity, idolized by the most ardent fans of the genre, especially if they are also of the manufacturer, given that there are also historic cars from the sixties, seventies and eighties (as well as a sort of ~history by Lotus). The game itself In addition to the usual quick race, a slightly different time attack, split screen for two players and the championship mode, the Kuju programmers have included a very ~Granturismian~ mode where you have to pass certain tests (however not licenses) to continue, participate in races on races (some very long while others in circuits full of traffic) and have the opportunity to drive ever better cars. A curiosity: in addition to playing Lotus Challenge with the analog or digital pad as we have always been used to, it is possible to set the analog stick as if it were a real steering wheel, turning it left and right, instead of just giving these directions. Needless to say, we regret the good old Namco Jogcon Graphics! After an introductory full motion that defining historical is equivalent to using a euphemism, having selected the game mode and the car of our dreams (in every sense!), we are ready to hit the track (dozens of loading seconds permitting). The very first impression given is that of being faced with the aberration that takes the name of Driving Emotion Type S by Squaresoft or the discreet XG3 by Acclaim: to hide as much as possible the lack of Anti Aliasing (and when ever!), Kuju Entertainment has well thought of cloaking the graphics of the game with the blurring effect of Motion Blur, trying to mask the less than excellent experience on Sony's 128-bit hardware. Leaving aside the first impact, certainly not excellent, let's analyze the cars at our disposal: the polygon count varies from more than adequate to the excellent circumstances (especially for more recent cars). Speaking of the special effects implemented, the Environmental Bump Mapping entered there is not in real time as happens with the beautiful Gran Turismo 3 A Spec, it is fictitious just like (a random title among many) the good Le Mans 24 hours of Melbourne House . However, the glare of the sun certainly has an impact, really well done, even if for the reasons that we have illustrated a couple of lines further on, it does not alter the color palette of your vehicle while to season everything there is some special effect of discreet workmanship such as fireworks. However, unlike the aforementioned masterpiece by Kazunori Yamauchi, here the cars are damaged (loss of wheels for example), both aesthetically and in the driveability of yourfireball. Finally, there are four views available: two external (close and distant) and two internal while we regret to point out the absence of a rear-view mirror, very important in a video game like this. Graphics! Overall, if Lotus Challenge had come out a year ago in conjunction with the Pal release of Playstation 2, we would have talked about a good level graphics sector that gives the beer to Namco's Ridge Racer V but forwarded 2001, we can talk about sufficiency and enough, a little 'little with Gt3 around. Sound Those who know me certainly know my passion for disco music and I am always very happy when there are videogames (preferably racing games) with soundtracks House or Dance (to be clear, if the Wipeout saga were a videogame abortion , it would appear in my collection anyway), but something went wrong! If there is absolutely nothing to say about the sound effects and the mediocre Italian dubbing no longer surprises anyone (although there is also the good Stefano Albertini) but the music therein is absolutely not galvanizing and enthralling, even if made with care more than discreet. Conclusions Lotus Challenge, despite not being totally a throwaway game, finally turns out to be a game of just sufficient workmanship: the graphic design, overall, is just ok, the music simply doesn't catch on, the Italian adaptation could have been better, the control of the various means range from adequate to rough and nothing, sometimes, the aids simplify the life of racing game newbies a little more complex. Fans of simulations will like it a little more but some flaws in the control system of your vehicles will also make them feel that inappropriate sense of frustration. Not a disaster, then, but nothing worth splurging on! Therefore dedicated to the most diehard Lotus fans, to those who collect all the racing games, especially if armed with a lot of patience! Pros: some nice special effects various game modes Cons: graphically it doesn't excel mediocre playability Mini prologue About ten years ago, the Lotus brand was already somehow related to the fantastic world of video games, thanks to the magnificent saga programmed by the coders Magnetic Fields, responsible for the magnificent Rally Championship that delighted us so much on PC a couple of years ago . After a long time and brute power in terms of hardware, as well as with the transition from two-dimensional to three-dimensional, here is finally a new racing game full of cars produced by Lotus, this time also four vintage wheels as well as more recent design masterpieces. The question that arises is: will it be a masterpiece like the magnificent driving games distributed by Gremlin, a can or something in between?
