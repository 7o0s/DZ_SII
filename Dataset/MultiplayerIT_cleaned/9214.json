Well, in the light of this new version of Tour De France, that issue appears in an even worse light with the title dedicated to the Giro which, despite having been out for less than a month, is literally swept away by Pro Cycling Manager - Tour De France 2011. Small changes, big results From the point of view of the interface and the possibilities of the game, there are not many innovations compared to the Giro d'Italia edition, although the management component is deeper with the sponsors, whose subsidies are fundamental, now attentive to the performance of the cyclists. But from the point of view of the actual cycling race, the changes are evident and numerous. In fact, Pro Cycling Manager - Tour De France 2011 adopts an improved version of the three-dimensional engine created by Cyanide and, although there is still a large margin for improvement, the results are considerably higher than those obtained with the previous versions. Nothing earth-shattering, of course, but the animations, the faces, the matching of statistics with the performance of the cyclists and the collisions have made a significant leap forward, at least in relation to the intrinsic limits of the formula. In fact, every improvement must take into account the very high number of cyclists who go to compete in a stage and every change must be contextualized with respect to a niche title that certainly cannot afford the investments of a FIFA. But let's go back to talking about the increase in the relationship between a cyclist's skills and his performance, which certainly doesn't make things any easier. Indeed, daring too much with a rider who is not too strong or getting the wrong equipment will have even more serious consequences. And this is certainly not a bad thing: on the other hand, in a title like this, which does not lend itself to quick sessions and does not seek unbridled gameplay, all the flavor is in the challenge and simulation. Unfortunately, even in this incarnation several problems remain, among which a certain rigidity of the group stands out, whose members always take the curves with identical timing and inclination. Furthermore, the animations are not perfectly interlaced and also in this case the wide margins for improvement are evident. But the asynchronous and more convincing rides are undoubtedly a godsend and create that set of rhythms and movements typical of the group which is now decidedly less robotic. Finally, the cyclists no longer look like photocopies thanks to the use of different models which are always few but characterized by more defined and less flattened faces. Furthermore, Cyanide has also added different types of sunglasses which, although they have a limited effect on the graphic appeal, diminish the feeling of being in the midst of a herd of clones created by an evil association intent on conquering the cycling world. Still imperfect but increasingly convincing The biggest change is collisions. When spaces get too narrow, interpenetrations still appear, albeit in a reduced form, but finally cyclists are physical entities and above all they have a brain so evolved as to allow them to avoid those who join them. In short, on balance we are now faced with more convincing riders who get up on the pedals in a credible way, who fight shoulder to shoulder and so on. And all these elements, although not without flaws, give a completely different overall effect - and better - than what we saw in Pro Cycling Manager 2010. As far as the global structure is concerned, the title remains faithful to its recipe with a few more options for sponsors and some tweaks to the interface which in any case remains familiar and easy to navigate. Among the relevant additions we note a message system that warns us verbatim of what happens in the race and which largely solves the problem of the absence of a dynamic direction. There is also the editor, hundreds of famous stages, the possibility of speeding up the race, training, multiplayer, pre-race statistics, the possibility of discovering new cyclists and all those basic activities that make the Pro Cycling experience Manager rather rich although still perfectible. In fact, from the point of view of tactics, the title could be more daring, perhaps taking inspiration from titles such as Football Manager which articulate more training, strategy and relationship with the media. But if nothing else, some of the most serious problems of the previous edition and iThe leap in terms of enjoyment is clear. From the sound point of view, the title once again relies on repetitive but still qualitatively acceptable sampled tracks. Even the audio effects are limited to carrying out their task without overdoing it and the commentary is quite good but it is in English as opposed to the texts which are also available in Italian.", "date": "2011-06-24", "grade": "7.8"}
