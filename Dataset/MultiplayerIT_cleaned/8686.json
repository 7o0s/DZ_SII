{"name": "Twisted Metal", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/100039-twisted-metal-twisted-metal.html", "text": "Awaited for almost eleven years (excluding the episode that appeared on PSP in 2005 and then converted to PlayStation 2 in 2008), one of Sony's historic franchises is finally back on our screens with a new chapter exclusively for PlayStation 3. We're talking about Twisted Metal, the competitive shooter on vehicles as always developed by David Jaffe and Eat Sleep Play, a title that doesn't seem to have lost the polish and appeal to the public of its predecessors, and that it is ready to give to them, to the longtime fans in particular, all the emotions and adrenaline unleashed by the brutal clashes that take place in the game arenas that are always full of power-ups, weapons to collect and enemies to be killed mercilessly. Talking about Twisted Metal without however separating the offline component from the online one would be a mistake, not so much for a question of excessive differences in the gameplay of both, but rather for the density of content that distinguishes them, and which in fact deserve equal treatment and description. So let's start in order. Apart from the local multiplayer which we will discuss in a more complete way later, in the product you can play offline in the fun Story mode which includes three narrative plots to be relived by playing three historical characters from the series, namely Tooth, Mr. Grimm and Dollface , through a simple plot also told with rather particular films for violence, strange situations and brutality, which introduce or intersperse the individual stories until the end. However, each of the three characters is engaged for different purposes in the tournament promoted by Calypso, the incarnation of evil on earth. The campaign takes place mainly through a series of missions with different objectives which generally involve fights to the death with different and fierce opponents, up to the canonical challenge with the boss on duty. Crazy vehicles for crazy people The latter, let's say it right away, are not particularly difficult to deal with, especially once their movement patterns have been identified, but due to the lack of even the slightest indication of what needs to be done to cause them the damage necessary to knock them down or on any useful means to do so, sometimes eliminating them or simply fighting against them becomes an exercise that is often not very fun. However, returning to talk about the product itself, there are more than a dozen vehicles in the game, all of which can be associated with any character. We find almost normal means such as the motorcycle or the helicopter, others absolutely crazy such as a huge tire, a ~particular~ ice cream van, up to a hearse, and each of them is characterized by ability, personal checks and statistics. The van, for example, is able to transform into a powerful mech as if it were a Transformer, while the tires just mentioned can close in on themselves and roll at high speed against enemies. As if that weren't enough, all the vehicles can also be customized both through some simple chromatic or visual elements, and in some functions, such as for example in the side weapon, the one to be clear which is standard and which does not require ammunition and which can be equipped on each vehicle, which, for the record, then has two other specific ones with unique types of attacks, and as tradition can collect others scattered around the arenas to be used on the spot. In the latter case, they range from rocket launchers to shotguns, passing through machine guns or small radio-controlled explosive droids, where defensive skills and powerful attacks are recharged over time. In short, Twisted Metal really has everything, including the possibility of activating the turbo to escape the most dangerous situations. Fighting arenas As far as everything else is concerned, the raw and raw gameplay is typical of the saga, and is focused as mentioned on fighting within large scenarios with a varied style and ranging from arid and desert areas to snowy areas or cities full of moving pedestrians, cars and dangers that lurk around every corner. When needed or when you feel like doing it, you can interact with the scenarios perhaps to raze them to the ground and make them collapse on your opponents, or for the simple sake of destroying everything. The clashes are always brutal, violent, but with that touch of macabre irony that permeates the entire production. Nothing inside the various arenas is more fun than destroying an enemy vehicle, seeing its occupants being overturned in flames and as they roll on the ground in desperation, driving your car over it to recover some energy and reinforce the defenses of the vehicle or out of pure sadism.To guarantee a certain variety to the patterns of deathmatch-style clashes, the Juggernauts then take care of it, who at more or less regular intervals release another enemy onto the map, for races that become real challenges of speed and strategy that take place in circuits full of checkpoints and obstacles. In these situations, in fact, it is not enough just to be the quickest to reach the finish line first, but also the most cunning, given that in order to get on the top step of the podium you have to avoid being kicked off the track by your opponents or by wrong choices like maybe taking a shortcut which then turns out to be a death trap. What has just been described, managing the various means and at the same time attacking one's opponents or defending against them may seem like a complex operation at the beginning, but once you have practiced a little with the various keys, everything happens naturally. In any case we have the fronts which are all related to driving the vehicle, acceleration, braking or sudden steering useful for abruptly changing direction. The backbones are instead used for everything related to one's paraphernalia, such as changing weapons, primary and secondary fire. Playstation 3 trophies Twisted Metal offers forty Trophies divided as follows: 29 Bronze, 5 Silver, 5 Gold and 1 Platinum. To obtain them, as always, you must perform certain actions such as killing a player in less than five seconds, watching the credits until the end, eliminating 100 enemies with each type of missile online, completing the Story mode without dying or changing cars and much more. Crazy on four wheels By completing the game you can unlock many of the vehicles and weapons (others unfortunately require you to get gold medals in the various stages and are more difficult to get) to play in multiplayer locally or online. In fact, Twisted Metal provides in the first case the possibility of challenging up to four friends at the same time in split screen, also using bots if you want if the playmates are not enough. Once on the net, however, things get much more interesting. You can play on the local network by organizing a co-op campaign with another user, or go online and enjoy the approximately seven game modes present, almost all of which can be replayed over and over again, with many variations and options. Among these there are the classic single or team Deathmatches up to sixteen players, and the more particular ones such as the team mode called Nuke, whose ultimate goal is to capture the leader of the opposing group and send him inside a special truck meat grinder, load kill after kill a missile and then fire it to hit the emblem statue of the enemy team. It should be highlighted that in any case the maps in which to move and fight are quite large and can generally be navigated in their entirety, or reduced to various sectors if necessary. Too bad for the lag and for the excessive difficulty in accessing the services which during our tests more than once gave us server errors. In this sense we hope that the developers will soon find an effective solution. To conclude our article, let's take a look at the technical sector. From an aesthetic point of view, the title has many ups and downs, especially in the boundary elements that make up the arenas or city structures and in some less complex textures. However, these small shortcomings are abundantly repaid with good fluidity, an excellent level of detail of the cars, excellent special effects and a unique spectacularity of the action deriving from collapsing buildings, walls that fall apart and so on. Furthermore, the color palette tending towards darker shades goes well with the context in which the various levels are set. As far as the audio sector is concerned, we have an excellent heavy metal soundtrack, an all in all excellent Italian dubbing and game effects absolutely in line with what happens on the screen, with a special mention for the full-bodied explosions.", "date": "2012-03-12", "grade": "8.5"}
