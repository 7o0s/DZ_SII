The endless race is essentially the basis from which to start to try new experiences, adding characteristics drawn from different fields and trying to find a composite and multifaceted but sufficiently solid solution, which possibly finds its own identity by drawing inspiration from different traditions. A difficult task which often results in chaotic hodgepodge that is not very suitable, but which in some cases results in truly interesting fusions. Dash Quest falls into this second eventuality, certainly presenting itself bizarre and composite but also managing to be decidedly engaging, based on tested mechanics and on the classic, inevitable grinding that always proves to be an irresistible mechanism for gamers. We therefore find ourselves controlling a character who moves inexorably forward along various scenarios, without the possibility of stopping him or changing direction within a pre-established path and with the only commands relating to attack and defense. Swarms of enemies of various shapes and traps descend from the top of the screen towards the protagonist, leaving a few seconds to make his move and try not to lose energy, while advancing continuously trying to get to the boss fight, which awaits us at the end of each scenario. Not being able to act on the running of the protagonist, the control system is limited to simple touches to defend or attack: touching the left side of the screen you defend yourself, while touching the right side you attack, trying to get the right timing and limit the most possible damage. Spells and potions are inserted as additional keys allowing further strategic choices to be adopted in the short period of time in which we can make our moves. Offense, Defense, and Upgrades: Back to RPG basics as you run non-stop in Dash Quest Let's start again What can be complicated about a game that only requires you to attack and defend at the right time, while advancing on a set path? Pretty much everything. The problem is the number of enemies that crowd the screen and the difficulty in understanding exactly how and when they attack the protagonist, which is further complicated by the tendency of these to overlap each other by hiding the exclamation mark that appears above the heads to indicate the imminent blow and thus suggesting the right moment to defend oneself. Once the energy is exhausted we are forced to restart the game from the first scenario, but keeping the experience level reached and the upgrades purchased, thus referring to the roguelike tradition. Hence the fundamental element of Dash Quest intervenes, i.e. the grinding, which becomes necessary in order to advance in the game, making it possible to purchase ever better armor and weapons with the money won in battle, increasing the character's statistics at increasing the level of experience and expanding the possibilities of attack and defense by adding new spells and abilities in the designated slots. The mechanism is therefore based on a continuous repetition of the same levels but accompanied by an equally constant progression, which makes each game functional to continue in the game. It is obvious that repetitiveness represents a big risk but the sense of evolution of the character and the amount of purchasable weapons, armor and skills keeps the interest high, at least until the endgame, which given the not excessive amount of levels can reach a relatively short time and greatly dampen interest. The pixelated graphics are perfectly suited to the action-RPG-roguelike style of yesteryear, providing a decidedly nostalgic characterization to a game that blends modern (almost post-modern) elements with other historical ones. Dash Quest can be downloaded for free but the constant presence of advertising videos makes the in-app purchase that removes the ads (2.99 euros) strongly recommended, while the other micro-transactions are aimed above all at those who want to reduce grinding times , offering gold at various prices and fast experience increases.", "date": "2015-10-15", "grade": "7.8"}
