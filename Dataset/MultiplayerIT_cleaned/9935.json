Therefore, it is impossible not to approach this Tournament of Legends with a pinch of skepticism, also the result of the title belonging to a really uncomfortable genre as regards the Nintendo platform. So now let's see if we can have the pleasure of being proven wrong... Thanatos actiregularis Drawing and revisiting Greek mythology in a rather questionable way, Tournament of Legends is based on a sketchy narrative structure, which basically involves a handful of ten wrestlers eager to reach and defeat Thanatos, the god of death, in order to thus be able to inherit his enormous powers. Each of the ten available characters is moved by the most disparate motivations, described by comic-book-style static sequences that act as the opening and closing of the appropriate Story Mode. The differences between the various fighters obviously do not end here: following the clichs of every self-respecting beat'em up, we go from the powerful but slow warrior to the agile but weak one, with all the middle ground of the case. If we exclude these due concessions to classicism, Tournament of Legends is a scrolling fighting game with a discreet innovative charge, represented by some facets of gameplay that are conceptually more than valid but which however struggle to find a correct videogame translation. This is the case of the equipment that can be assigned to the hero on duty, consisting of a set of weapons and a magical power that guarantees a particular bonus throughout the duration of the match: as you defeat opponents, you get new elements to draw on to change the fighting style of one's alter ego, in what would seem to be a forerunner to a considerable variety of games. And instead a rather simplistic combat system, closely linked to the need to move Remote and Nunchuck to carry out the attacks, ends up debasing a good basic idea, reducing the clashes to a waving devoid of significant tactical components. A similar argument is applicable to the role played by the armor that protects the wrestlers, divided into four sections and capable of absorbing a certain amount of damage before falling apart: in this case, the blows inflicted on the uncovered part cause more damage, pushing the user to always repeat the same slashing instead of exploiting all the moves at his disposal. Which, for the record, include the use of thrown weapons and the exploitation of a handful of special attacks, both of which can be carried out after loading a special indicator. Unfortunately, the variety of offensive tools made available by High Voltage definitely takes a back seat if to complete the Story Mode it is sufficient to constantly swing the Remote on the vertical axis, also helped by an AI of the opponents that is anything but difficult. Beautiful soulless The impression one gets of Tournament of Legends is therefore that of a product that on paper had all the credentials to rise above the average, but which lacks some fundamental precautions in the actual construction phase. The depressing cosmic void that the title shows in terms of game modes falls within this area: the Story Mode is flanked only by the inevitable Versus and Training, while sections useful for increasing a longevity which, as it is, are really poor . The absence of any type of unlockable material becomes even paradoxical if you think that the collectible items of equipment in single player are absolutely useless except to be shown off in local challenges with another human player. And it's a real shame that Tournament of Legends wastes so badly a good potential, also made up of a respectable technical realization in relation to the Wii standards: graphically, the High Voltage work is capable of producing even spectacular glimpses, especially on the occasion of the various special attacks, but in general it is positively striking for the quality of the arenas in which you fight, treated in every detail and fairly varied. Excellent feedback also for the polygonal models of the characters (generous in size and also in this case very well cared for in appearance as well as for what concerns the animationsparticularly fluid and inspired ions) and for the plays of light that fill every single slash sent to sign. The sound does its good part, with orchestral music with the right epic attitude and convincing effects: in short, if the rest of the High Voltage production had been at the level of the audiovisual sector, we would be here talking about a new Soul Calibur...", "date": "2010-07-02", "grade": "6.8"}
