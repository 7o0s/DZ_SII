Each campaign has more or less a dozen missions in which the plot will be deepened and carefully developed, a pity that only half of them will be really interesting for the purpose of the plot. Let us explain better: within the ten missions present, only about five of them will develop the plot, while the others will be randomly generated and will serve exclusively to make us increase the experience on the battlefield, and to earn ~gold~ to be used then in subsequent developments. These submissions, therefore, although they are not related to the main plot, are absolutely essential to be able to finish the campaign. KUFH obviously continues in the wake of the first episode, halfway between a real-time strategy, an action and an RPG The adventure begins KUFH obviously continues in the wake of the first episode, halfway between a real-time strategy, an action and an RPG. Once inside the game we will have to direct our general on the map, in a direct approach to the battlefield, in the event of a clash with opposing troops the shot will change and we will take full control of our commander, who with combos and special attacks will unleash a real hell among the enemy ranks. Well, in these moments the game betrays its inspiration, which is not even hidden from the Dynasty Warriors saga. We will find ourselves moving around the battlefield, without many points of reference except to slay as many opponents as possible. After each victory we will earn experience and gold to then spend on various upgrades. It should also be noted that after having made our way through the enemy ranks to the sound of combos made using the X key, we will be able to ask for the help of the other generals by pressing the black or white key, or choose whether to unleash our special move with the Y key. After each victory we will gain experience and gold to spend on various upgrades. Through the back triggers we will be able to both switch to commanding our other allied units, and frame a mini-map that will allow us to safely guide our troops towards the best points from which to attack the enemy. The control system proves to be really accurate, as already in the previous chapter, and able to satisfy all our requests. Real Time Strategy On the RTS front we really have to recognize that the work done by the Phantagram developers was once again very accurate, not only are the movement of the troops well managed but now the impact of the terrain in which the battle takes place has taken on greater weight. For example, the forest will be a very valuable aid against enemy archers, or it will be a damned obstacle. If our troops are attacked at the moment of fording a river they will be absolutely at the mercy of the adversaries we will have to be absolutely careful and plan our moves carefully. Just in case of failure, a somewhat frustrating part of KUFH will emerge, namely the fact that it is not possible to save during the campaigns, usually quite long, in which we will be able to see our general collapse, and start the game over, right at the last battle, maybe after a long game session. There are four new elemental units represented by the Earth Golem, Thunder Rhino, Flame Wraith and Ice Lady It is almost needless to say that we will be able to command different types of units, which in turn will be characterized differently if they belong to humans or to the dark legion (nothing but an alliance between orcs and dark elves). Some armies will then be exclusive to the ~race~ such as the Mammoth of the dark elves. The number of available armies is then increased by the new four elemental units represented by the Earth Golem, the Thunder Rhino, the Flame Wraith and the Ice Lady. The elementals can be used by both the dark legion and humans, and constitute a very valid support army but, also given the cost of their training, they are more suitable for online play than for the single player campaign. The maximum number of units that we will be able to command during the campaign will be five ~active~ and one support. We will be able to make our troops stronger in the breaks between one mission and another, in the castle or in the other base camps, using the gold and experience points earned in the field to buy equipment, learn new skills and change their role. Technically the game is a child of its predecessor, it is impressive to see the armies simultaneously on the screen without ever an uncertainty of the graphics engine. Certainly, however, ~the amazement effect~ that had caused the Crusaders had been superior, but we can with pleasure note the refinements made to this second chapter of the saga. The polygonal models are always very good and defined, certain animations are a bit jerky but in principle there is too much chaos on the battlefield to catch the small imperfections. The only comment should be made to the camera not always perfectly centered, but they are subtleties and nothing more. Probably the Xbox hardware has really reached its limit and we couldn't ask for more from the developers, but the doubt also remains in consideration of the fact that Phantagrams have been dealing for some time (perhaps neglecting Herpes?) for several months of 99 Nights, led by Mizuguchi to make a big debut on Xbox 360, which will surely be the spiritual sequel to the Kingdom Under Fire saga. Technically the game is the son of its predecessor, it is impressive to see the armies simultaneously on the screen without ever an uncertainty of the graphics engine The big news added in KUFH is given by the online which, unlike the first chapter, now allows you to challenge each other three against three in the hero's battle, a mode which in turn differs in two types of clash, namely the three against three and three against the A.I. the latter particularly apt and engaging, it will be a question of defending our castle from the enemy assault together with two other friends. How to say all for one and one for all! Lastly there is the troop battle mode, always three against three, a little more technical since you start with a hero, three infantry units, an archer and an air support unit. In the numerous challenges we have faced, no drawbacks have occurred and indeed, as mentioned, the method in defense of the castle has particularly impressed us. Comment KUFH is an excellent game, well done technically, slightly modified in its content compared to its predecessor, with some welcome additions in the online mode. What's wrong? Very few things, but more than anything else its only flaw is that of being a sequel, of following in the footsteps of something already seen: as about a year ago Crusaders amazed us with the amount of enemies on screen, so Heroes can no longer surprise. However, the Pantagram title remains highly recommended, with the Korean software house abandoning the first Microsoft console in the best possible way, to give us an appointment with that 99 Nights which already seems to be one of the most interesting and impressive titles in the Xbox 360 line up. Pro Simply best console RTS Technically good Online 3 vs. 3 Cons Some small drool Sometimes a little frustrating Phantagram returns to our Xboxes with the sequel to the best RTS released for the green cross console. As almost everyone knows by now, the Kingdom Under Fire saga was born on a personal computer and is set in a fantasy world very similar to that of the Lord of the Rings, in which the usual two entities, good and evil, light and darkness fight to gain the upper hand. From the beginning we will be able to choose which side to take and which narrative plot to reveal. The story of Kingdom Under Fire Heroes (henceforth KUFH) is a sort of prequel, which develops before and simultaneously with the plot narrated in the Crusaders. We will discover other details related to the first chapter and thus deepen our knowledge of the land of Encablossa. However, you don't have to be scared since KUFH is a title in its own right and enjoyable in all its depth even by those approaching the saga developed by the Korean house for the first time.", "date": "2005-10-22", "grade": null}
