In the combat system of Shurado, the new mobile game by Ganbarion for iOS and Android, you can in fact recognize hardcore action RPG influences, ranging from the considerable degree of challenge to the stamina bar, which regulates the amount of hits and parries that we can perform in a certain amount of time, ending with the timing of each single move, strongly influenced by the type of weapon we hold. In the game we wear the heavy armor of an undead samurai, who awakens as a pure spirit and feels he still has a mission to accomplish: to walk the steps of a sacred mountain evidently inspired by the shrine of Fushimi Inari, in Kyoto, and face opponents increasingly strong in view of an apparently endless structure. The experience starts as a sort of running game, even if in this juncture our intervention does not determine the change of lane of the character, but only the collection of light blue or yellow will-o'-the-wisp, which can respectively increase our health and that of gold, the latter usable between one game and another to enhance the weapons that we have collected in the meantime and that we can equip, having three alternative styles to use in fights. Kyoto drives out Kyoto The progression within each stage is practically identical: you climb different positions and face ~normal~ enemies, up to a path dotted with red doors (just like those of Fushimi Inari, in fact) which leads to a boss: if we will defeat him we will be able to proceed with the next level, characterized by a greater challenge but by the same situations; otherwise it will be game over and we will have to start all over again, but being able to count on a stronger warrior than in the previous stint. The formula works, especially as regards real duels: you have to pay close attention to the enemy's movements, understand when he is about to attack and perhaps activate the parry at the last second, so as to be able to counterattack automatically with a kick that will stun the opponent and will allow us to sink a blow or two in freedom. Unfortunately, the blows do not work as in Infinity Blade, as the Ganbarion title adopts simpler and more immediate solutions, with only the alternation of a normal blow and a loaded one, but the strategic depth of these phases is evident and involves right from the start jokes, urging us to improve. The big problem is the absolute lack of variety: if the challenge becomes more intense from one level to another, the same cannot be said of the characters and scenarios, which remain almost identical. A real pity, because the presence of even minimally different settings would have guaranteed a greater desire to move forward, also due to an excellent technical realization, which offers a dark, evocative and fascinating interpretation of the famous Kyoto shrine and its infinite stairways . And the freemium mechanisms? They don't constitute a big problem, being linked only to the possibility of quickly opening the chests that we conquer during each game, and which contain new weapons.", "date": "2018-01-10", "grade": "7.0"}
