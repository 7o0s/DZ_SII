{"name": "4x4 Evolution 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/4x4-evolution-2_a.html", "text": "Unfortunately 4x4 Evolution 2 does not seem able to resolve the fate of the series, retaining most of the flaws that had marked the predecessor. Nevertheless, the attempt to improve the product with a series of fixes that make the game fun even if for a short time is evident. The game modes available are: Quick Race, Free Roam, Time Attack, and Career. The quick race is the inevitable fast race that allows us to compete on a single track with a vehicle of our choice. Free Roam allows us to search far and wide the environments that host the races; Time Attack is instead the classic race against time and against ourselves in an attempt to complete the planned circuits in the shortest possible time. However, the most interesting ideas come to us from the Career, present in every self-respecting driving game. Gran Turismo has made school and in fact we find here too a good part of the options of the Polyphony Digital masterpiece. We will initially have a certain (limited) amount of money available with which to buy the first off-road vehicle and possibly other parts to modify the vehicle's appearance and performance. Once in possession of our four-wheel drive racing car, we will have the opportunity to participate in a series of competitions of various types which, if successfully completed, will provide us with the necessary funds to purchase new vehicles. Our good results will also serve to get us noticed by organized teams and maybe be able to snatch an engagement, once they've won their trust, thus moving from less prestigious teams to more ambitious ones. Moving on to the actual game, the decidedly arcade aspect of the same should immediately be underlined, which offers a rather simple control and a good response of the vehicle to our commands. The same cannot be said of the response to the stresses of the terrain and the physics of the vehicle, which are often not very faithful to reality. The great vastness of the settings is probably the greatest value of a game that, to tell the truth, has little else to offer. Over time (not much), the feeling takes over that, despite the innumerable varieties available, the game is rather repetitive and not very satisfying. A more accurate guidance system would probably have improved the situation. Added to this is the fact that of the game views available, not all of them are useful for the purposes of the game and others end up making our guide even more difficult. From the technical realization we get the most painful notes. Grainy, poorly defined, the graphics of 4x4Evolution 2 demonstrate like few others the minimal exploitation of the potential of the XBox hardware. The textures and the poor cleaning of the image would disfigure on PlayStation 2, let alone on the Microsoft console which has made high-resolution textures and the impressive graphic impact its strong points. The off-road models behave decidedly better, well made although not at the level of other productions. On the other hand, the light and particle effects are sufficient. The sound accompaniment is instead adequate and stands at more than acceptable levels. In conclusion, this 4x4 Evolution 2, as happened with its predecessor, fails to convince and indeed makes the limits of a game that has become inadequate for the console for which it was conceived even more evident. Enthusiasts of driving games could still find a fair but limited entertainment but my advice is to save your money waiting for much more interesting titles. Pros: Very large environments Funny ... Cons: ... just boring In the long run Indecent graphics Much more is expected from XBox Materials: Trailer Screenshots Formula one cars race, grand touring racing cars race, motorcycles and jet skis race and now SUVs race on consoles too! The acronym SUV stands, according to the terminology of the Americans, for Sports Utility Vehicles, an apparently mysterious name but which instead is attributable to large cars that we usually see with a certain ease on our roads. In fact, these are 4-wheel drive off-road vehicles, capable of covering any type of route on any type of surface in any climatic condition. The omnipotence of these means has been exploited on more than one occasion by the world of video games and the latest case is that of 4X4 Evolution 2, a sequel to the game released a year and a half ago on PlayStation 2. original passed by tAll unnoticed, certainly not surprising as 4x4 Evolution is anything but a good game. The hope is that things may be different this time.", "date": "2002-06-07", "grade": null}
