{"name": "Driven", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/driven_b.html", "text": "A cinematic plot One of the opening films of the current film season was Driven directed by Renny Harlin, which starred the likes of Sylvester Stallone (Joe Tanto) and Burt Reynolds (Carl Henry) just to name a few. The story was based on Jimmy Bly, a great Formula Cart champion vying for the title of champion in that specialty. But unfortunately a great driver on the track, but also rebellious and unruly in his private life. To prevent him from committing madness, which would undermine his leadership in the championship, the manager of his team puts a veteran driver, Joe Tanto, with him. A crescendo of difficulties on the track and in his private life, complicated by Joe's girlfriend, with whom Bly falls in love, will form the backdrop for a film judged by the press and the public to be far below expectations. It is precisely from this base that this Driven for GBA takes off, the peculiarities of which we are going to analyze. Many modalities, little originality On the main screen we can choose between different game modes: arcade, single race, time trial, story, multiplayer, championship and bonus challenge mode. As you will understand from the names, these are modes that we can find in any other existing racing game, just as classic are the options that will offer us the possibility to decide the number of laps to do and little else. The only truly original available is the story mode that will allow us to experience the film interactively in the role of Jimmy Bly and Joe Tanto. The computer will entrust us with a series of missions based on the cinematographic product that we will have to complete triumphantly to continue in the next stage; for example finishing a race in first place or acting as a support for our teammate and so on. Also interesting is the multiplayer option that will allow up to four players to challenge each other on the track via link cables and after having a copy of the game for each challenger (I think it will be almost impossible to find more than two people who have this title). In total we will be able to enjoy twelve pilots, all from the film, and twelve tracks that will be gradually unlockable in the game after finishing the championship and the story mode. Graphics and sound The developers have chosen an isometric engine for Driven, with a camera that follows the action from above so as to allow you to have an overview of what is happening on the track. Very colorful and clean graphics in which, however, there are evident contrasts. The programmers have taken care of some small details, even insignificant, neglecting fundamental aspects such as the collision of the sprites and the frame-rate in moments of greater chaos. But they start in order. If you take a careful look at the cars, you'll notice that the wheels steer regardless of the behavior of the sprite depicting the car, this is definitely a virtuosity that is certainly appreciable. But unfortunately the speed of the game, in moments in which there are several cars on the screen at the same time, suffers sharp drops which undermine the playability. A real shame since it stands at good levels thanks to a high level of ease in driving, so much so that the A key will be used to accelerate and B to brake and voil the race is done. Moving on to the sound sector, I can simply say that it is a title without infamy or praise, with the usual tunes to keep us company in the game screens and during the race Last on track Had it been the first racing game to hit the Nintendo handheld, it might have had a shot at notoriety, but with the likes of GT Advance and Mario Kart Advance out there, it's going to be hard for anyone to spend their hard-earned cash on it. Driven. The only people who might find it decent are die-hard fans of the movie it's based on. Driven PS2 Review Driven Filmpro Review: good number of cars and drivers cons: such license, such game graphics can be improved Cinema-videogames! Winning pairing? In a period of scarce creativity and fear of experimenting, developers are always looking with greater interest at the ~outside world~ in the constant search for a good concept that can be the backdrop for their next videogame creation. Cinema has always been, and will always be, a splendid inspiring muse for the videogame industry, so much so that the gap that separated these 2 environments, years ago, is slowly shrinking, giving way toa series of game-cinema and cinema-game conversions that unfortunately seem to have a single common denominator: mediocrity. The Bam guys seem to have moved in this wake who, making use of the Driven film license, have come up with two videogames for PS2 and GBA.", "date": "2002-02-17", "grade": null}
