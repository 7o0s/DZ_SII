Whether it's the heresy of a young Han Solo without Harrison Ford's face, or yet another inevitable reincarnation of Doctor Who is revealed, controversy is always around the corner. It also happens in video games, and so when Sony and Insomniac Games announced a remastered edition of Marvel's Spider-Man on PS5 last September, not everyone welcomed the choice to change Peter Parker's face with enthusiasm, with the protagonist not he looks more like New York actor John Bubniak than 26-year-old model Ben Jordan. Regardless of the reasoning behind Sony's decision, the change does not in any way compromise the excellent work done by the development team in proposing a technically improved version that can bring all those new PS5 owners who have not yet played the original. On the contrary. For our review of Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered on PS5, we spent a few hours with the game, comparing it side-by-side with the original. In a new light With Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered the developers' goal was clear: to take one of the most successful games that appeared on PlayStation 4 and modernize it so that it didn't disfigure on PS5 next to its pseudo-sequel Miles Morales. This means the addition of new graphics options, the ability to play it with a higher framerate and support for the features of the new DualSense controller. The result is an edition that, from the very first moments of the introductory cinematic, shows a clear visual detachment from the original work. When the game shows Peter Parker's apartment, with the protagonist preparing breakfast and putting on his iconic costume for the first time, the new lighting system makes the sequence much more realistic and intense. Insomniac has taken the opportunity to change a few objects here and there, add some details and modify certain materials in the room, but what really makes the difference is the contrast of lights and shadows and the way in which natural lighting invades the room, yes it reflects on the surfaces and creates contrasts and chiaroscuro both on the objects in the room and on the character's costume. Especially if you compare it with the original, a more intense image emerges, paradoxically darker and decidedly less lively and cartoonish: it is as if the game had moved away a few steps from the ~Spider-Man comic~ to get even closer more to the cinematic one. It's a stylistic change, and maybe someone will even say that they preferred it before. Although it is ~only~ a remastered edition, from the first seconds everything seems to be designed to communicate the idea that the PlayStation 5 hardware can literally revolutionize the look of a game. And if this is already noticeable in the introductory cinematic alone, it becomes even more evident when Peter Parker, now Spider-Man, launches himself like a slingshot out the window and onto the streets of New York City. Manhattan changed overnight. Or rather, from day to another time of day. Or who knows, maybe it's just another day, because the sky is cloudier, the city is tinged with warmer colors, the shadows of the buildings are in a different position and there are more people around on the streets. Those who play Spider-Man for the first time in its remastered edition will find themselves swinging in a more enveloping New York, which in these first few bars has a different atmosphere, and in which Spider-Man's red and blue costume detaches in less evidently by the gray and brown of the buildings of the city. It won't always be like this, and in the course of the adventure you find yourself crossing Manhattan at different times of the day, each time with a different atmosphere. However, it is when you stop in the streets or explore the interiors of buildings that you can appreciate the implementation of ray tracing on surfaces, puddles and the windows of skyscrapers which reflect the lights coming from the surrounding environment in a much more credible way. Remember the ~puddlegate,~ that pointless controversy about removing certain puddles in the original Spider-Man? In an almost provocative way, this Remastered seems to have clouded the introduction of the game precisely to justify the addition of new puddles and wetter sidewalks, thus capable of highlighting the introduction of ray tracing even before entering the FISK Tower with its thousand reflective flooring. Smoother than ever In short, whether you are swinging between the buildings of the city, fighting in a den of bandits,or whether you stop to admire the view from the top of the Avengers Tower, the aesthetic improvements introduced with this Remastered are evident. Yet, exactly as we told in our review of Spider-Man: Miles Morales, the biggest benefit of the arrival on PlayStation 5 is undoubtedly the Performance mode, with the possibility of playing the entire adventure at 60 frames per second . Especially those who have already devoured the original on PS4 will find this time an almost unprecedented action experience, more fluid, faster and, in general, more fun and thrilling. There is no doubt that many will prefer to sacrifice the new features of ray tracing and the more advanced lighting system in favor of a higher framerate instead. Whether you play in ~Loyalty~ or ~Performance~ mode, however, loading times have also been reduced to the bone to practically disappear completely. Hallelujah. Finally, there is the question of the new face of Peter Parker, who after the initial estrangement appears perfectly integrated into the adventure. Let's be clear, the writer was one of the first skeptics of Bubniak's choice, a little too similar to Tom Holland's Peter, a little too young to appear credible in his dynamics with Miles. All prejudices neutralized by greater attention to the animations and expressions of the new Pete, more effective than the previous one. Although to a lesser extent, the other characters have also received some small tweaks: from Mary Jane to Aunt May, passing through a certain cameo and even reaching the people on distant boats (now a meme for their very low quality). One of the easter eggs aimed at fans of the original game", "date": "2020-11-13", "grade": "9.0"}
