A decade ago, Resident Evil became nothing less than the paradigm of a new videogame genre. Survival horror, beyond the quarrels on the genesis of the genre and on the real precursors, would have colonized every console in the following decade, finding in the Capcom game an official progenitor from which to draw to vary its formula, introduce novelties, in some cases contest certain assumptions . Playing Resident Evil on DS today will have a certain nostalgia effect on anyone who played the original when it first came out. The conversion is very faithful, and on the Nintendo DS players will find exactly the same adventure faced by Playstation owners. Capcom, however, has opted for two game modes to provide DS users with a fresh experience to complement the remake. The first mode is the ~classic~ one, faithful in all respects to the original, with the exception of some variations on the position of certain enemies and puzzles, made to prevent the game from being resolved in an identical way. Here, as on Playstation and the GameCube remake, players will take on the role of Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine, for each of whom the adventure will take a particular turn and difficulty, and will face the repertoire of zombies, viral mysteries, puzzles wall clock, gigantic monsters and medicinal herbs inaugurated by this game, which in the meantime has become a stereotype of an entire genre. Don't touch that screen... The second mode, Rebirth, features new features designed by Capcom to exploit the potential of the DS. The player will often be faced with attacks from enemies which automatically bring the view into a subjective view and allow you to use the touch pad to eliminate enemies. By touching the screen with your fingers it will finally be possible to rage on the enemies ~with your own hands~, with cutting blows and on selected points. In other cases, the game takes advantage of the DS microphone to allow the player's breath to transform into the gesture of removing poison from a wound or other similar find. The Rebirth mode also unbalances the game towards the action component. The available bullets will be much more numerous and the enemies in far greater numbers than in the classic mode. This is an attempt to bring the game closer to the spirit of the fourth chapter produced on GameCube, making the experience less difficult and alienating. Bishop rules. This variation on the ~action~ component is not actually enough to actually vary the game structure, which has simply become less cohesive in terms of rhythm. Once you introduce more action and less reliance on ammo, the very meaning of tough survival gets a bit lost by the wayside. Nor do the subjective modes have all this great depth: the movement of the character is not allowed and the touch with the fingers is too imprecise and forces you to unleash the nib on the fly or wear the lace perpetually. Sure, it's exhilarating to play with the stylus that game where, like Bishop in Aliens, you use a knife to move it frantically between the spaces of the fingers of a hand resting on a table. Just as many veterans of the series might like a new ~walk~ in the first, historic survival horror, with more ammunition and extra first-person games that are somewhat reminiscent of House of the Dead. While younger players could discover the always valid original game in a very faithful and portable version. Bishop rules. On the other hand, one of Resident Evil DS's only two shortcomings (the other being the multiplayer) is the fact that the graphical conversion, while perfectly successful, is somewhat affected by the screen size and available memory. The movies are all there, it's true. And the digitized backgrounds and polygonal models are equal to, if not sometimes better than those for PSX. However, the former show a necessarily very high compression, while the latter lose grain and detail due to miniaturization, giving the graphics a somewhat fuzzy look. Things that, combined with the ten years of evolution that have elapsed, are certainly not good for the aesthetic presentation of the game in comparison with the most recent proposals. However, one can easily turn a blind eye to the story, considering the fact that this is one of the prices to pay for being able to play a super classic under the covers, hanging out in the woods, in an abandoned church, or anywhere else in where one can bring the good DS. Waiting for the next typewriter to arrive and leaving it on stand-by because the bus has arrived at its destination, on the other hand, yes, gives a certain sense of boredom, and makes us understand the limits of the spirit of the genre.n portable version. Wireless horror Resident Evil's multiplayer modes require one cartridge for each player involved (up to a maximum of four). In the cooperative mode, players have a common energy level and must work together to reach the end of the levels to eliminate enemies and solve elementary puzzles. In the competitive mode, players have to reach milestones in a set time against each other. However, not only is armed confrontation not possible, but human characters do not even coexist in the game environment. Each player has his own level in which to act, and a star in the room is the only signal of what other players are doing at that moment. These modes are not particularly exciting. It is true that the extras and characters to unlock, excelling in single-player modes, are not few, and guarantee a good dose of replay value. However, rather than on these extras, the programmers could have opted for some extra work on level design, and to properly provide the opportunity for merry carnage among friends. Deadly Silence is an appreciable conversion of a classic that still manages to work, after ten years and numerous sequels, clones and imitations. The crass acting and the dialogues so ridiculous that they are pleasant, the sense of shock of the monsters attacking us from the windows, the frustration for survival against the most filthy beasts, the angst from ammo shortage and all the other reasons that made Resident Evil a historical game remain intact in the classic mode. Maybe the graphical presentation will be outdated, the definition a little fuzzy and the control obsolete. But after all the genre - heavyweights aside - hasn't gone that far, and another advantage of this version is that you could take the game with you at night, in the woods closest to home, to increase the atmospheric effect and terror: a new and horrifying use instead. In addition there are the touch-screen and blow-on-the-mic modes, which are not bad to play and are inserted in a new, more frenetic mode and in line with the fourth episode. The multiplayer, of course, does not work very well. But on the other hand, Resident Evil is a game born to be played alone, and as such it will be appreciated on DS by those who want to try a new variant or carry it around. While the few who have never tried it will have no more excuses for not playing the mother queen of zombie games. Pros A piece of gaming history Atmosphere still great Interesting use of the DS Cons Archaic control system played and replayed too many multiplayer not that great Resident Evil DS Resident Evil: Deadly Silence, whose subtitle winks at the initials of the Nintendo portable console, is a faithful conversion of the original released in 1996 for Playstation. Delivered on a DS cartridge, in which Capcom has also managed to introduce some original game ideas, the adventure has not lost its ability to excite and horrify and shows the still good hold of a classic after a decade. The conversion also highlights how the survival horror experience on a portable console becomes hopelessly different, showing its strengths and limitations.", "date": "2006-04-13", "grade": null}
