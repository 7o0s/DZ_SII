{"name": "Dangerous Driving", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dangerous-driving-recensione.html", "text": "It's been a long time since Burnout dominated the unscrupulous universe of arcade driving games in the first decade of the 2000s. Anyone who lived through that period probably remembers with pleasure the hours spent dispensing noisy doors left and right in a riot of drifts, sparks, spectacular accidents and adrenaline-pumping background music. As we often repeat, the panorama of racing titles has changed a lot over the years, but someone doesn't seem to have wanted to give in to the inevitable evolutions dictated by the market. That someone responds to the name of Three Fields Entertainment independent studio founded five years ago by a small group of former developers of Criterion Games. Dangerous Driving was born from the desire to re-propose a pure and uncompromising arcade product: essentially a tribute to tradition, which winks at those who have had the opportunity to appreciate a specific way of approaching the world of racing in past generations. After getting our hands on the PlayStation 4 version, we are therefore going to express our opinion in the review. You are ready? Engines running... let's go! I want reckless driving It only takes a few minutes to realize the extremely conservative nature of Dangerous Driving. It is already perceived after a quick glance at the rough game menus, but further confirmations come after selecting the first car that is made available to us to test the asphalt of the initial track. A few moments and the feeling of rewinding the tape of the last fifteen years inevitably begins to make its way into the player's head and heart, bringing him back to the now Jurassic 2004, the year of release of that masterpiece of yesteryear that responds to the name of Burnout 3: Takedown. If it weren't for the graphic part, it would really seem to be in front of a product landed by express from another era. All the characteristic elements of the old Criterion Games series are present: the highly adrenaline-pumping races on strictly closed tracks, the drifts that seem to never end, the continuous tussle culminating in the brilliant use of the takedowns. But also the boost indicator, there in the lower part of the screen, suggesting that in such a game simply pushing the accelerator to the tablet certainly cannot be considered decisive. And so off, without having to repeat it twice, at breakneck speed towards the checkered flag. Dangerous Driving places us at the wheel of six different vehicle classes, ranging from the basic category to the very powerful Formula DD, passing through solid variants such as SUVs, Coupes, Supercars and Hypercars. Overall you have access to 69 single player events spread across multiple racing modes. Of course, the traditional race against five other CPU-managed opponents could not be missing, accompanied by other standard solutions such as time trial and 1-on-1 clashes. In Road Rage competitions the nostalgic feeling reaches its peak, as we are required to carry score a certain number of takedowns to get the coveted gold medal. In Pursuit you are the protagonists of a ferocious chase aboard a police car, while by accessing the Eliminator events you must try to remain firmly at the top of the rankings in order not to be prematurely ousted from the competition. In Survival you have to try to survive as long as possible without making an accident, while in Heatwave you have to do your best to activate the turbo and not let go to create a combo that compensates for the absence of ramming. Finally, at the end of each category of tickets, access to the GP is provided, i.e. a series of tournaments divided into several stages where a score is assigned based on the position earned after crossing the finish line. Playstation 4 trophies There are a total of 41 Dangerous Driving trophies, divided into 22 bronze, 15 silver and 3 gold. Most can be collected without too much effort during normal races, while others take a little longer to unlock. In any case, reaching Platinum is not a particularly complicated undertaking. Takedowns like it's raining Dangerous Driving has the advantage of capturing the conservative user in its canvas, but after the first few hours of play, even the most incurable nostalgic cannot help but indulge in some critical considerations, dictated very simply by the weight of time. Starting from the tracks, really too anonymous and lacking in detail when compared to the high standards of the current market. The landscapes make the atmospheres that you respthey raged in the first chapters of Burnout, but it would have been preferable to be able to enjoy a little more density and some courageous variations on the theme to make them a pinch more recognizable. The other flaw that quickly emerges is linked to the presence of an artificial intelligence that is not particularly reactive, which easily suffers takedowns but does not try to put the player in difficulty by trying to send him crashing into the guardrails and other sporadic objects present in track. In short, outside of the time trials you are hardly really put to the test, and it's a shame. A side note deserves to be made as regards the graphics sector: Dangerous Driving in fact runs steadily at 60 frames per second on PS4 Pro and Xbox One X, while those who own the standard models will have to settle for a fluidity of 30 frames with sporadic perceived dips in fluidity during busier situations. It goes without saying that the premium configurations are more in line with the characteristics of the older games to which this title winks, which at the time of their release were calibrated to the standard of 60 FPS. The current lack of a multiplayer mode, both online and locally, does not play into the longevity factor, but Three Fields has already confirmed its intention to provide a free DLC that will be made available to the public in the near future. The obvious limitations that the project had to face did not allow the implementation of an adequate soundtrack, but we found the ploy of guaranteeing the integration of Spotify to allow the user to create playlists and customize the playlists at will. tracks that can be used in the menus and in the live competitions.", "date": "2019-04-11", "grade": "7.0"}
