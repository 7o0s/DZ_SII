{"name": "Worms: Open Warfare 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/worms-open-warfare-2-recensione.html", "text": "It's open warfare! After an introductory animated sequence, unfortunately afflicted by heavy compression defects, Worms: Open Warfare 2 presents the large list of game modes available. And there really is something for all tastes: you can try your hand at a quick game or a personalized one, or access the four single-player modes (Puzzle, Campaign, Laboratory and Training) or even challenge someone in multiplayer (both with two copies of the game than with one, but also online via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection). The fulcrum of Open Warfare 2 is contained in the single-player modes, which initially represent an obligatory destination due to Training (essential for becoming familiar with the philosophy behind Worms) and which constitute the most substantial part of the THQ title. The Puzzle mode, first of all, puts us in each of its many stages a puzzle to solve: at least one worm of the team must reach the exit, and to do so he must use the objects and weapons that are made available from time to time. Sometimes the solution to the problem is clear and fast, sometimes instead you have to go through several game overs to understand what exactly needs to be done. The Campaign mode is decidedly more action-oriented and brings back the classic action of the series, which is a war between teams of worms that is fought with weapons and intuitions. In this specific case, we will face teams with ~themed~ locations, changing the setting only when we have completely destroyed the enemy on duty. Finally, Lab Mode contains three different applications that use the unique input system of the Nintendo DS. In the first we will have a worm that has to reach the exit of a very particular stage, using only the parachute and our... blow into the microphone of the console; breath which, depending on the intensity, will make the character rise more or less, in a decidedly new inertial context. In the second application, there will always be a worm to get to the exit of the stage, but to make it move we'll have to cause more or less strong explosions by pressing the stylus on the touch screen. The third application also sees the use of the stylus, but in this case we will use it to draw barriers on the screen which will allow the worm to reach an area of the stage propelled by some explosions. The game Anyone who has already had the opportunity to try a recent title in the Worms series knows very well what to expect from Open Warfare 2: hundreds and hundreds of stages, divided into various modes, in which we will find ourselves facing puzzles but also spectacular battles, distinguished by important elements strategic. The control system in the classic game modes does not take into account the Nintendo console's touch screen, presenting an essential set of commands: B to jump (pressing it twice, the worm performs a backward somersault, higher than normal), A to use the equipped item or weapon, Y to access the item menu and X to possibly modify its values (change the bomb timer, determine the direction of a bombing, rotate an iron beam before placing it, etc. .). The directional cross moves the character and his crosshairs (with Up and Down), while holding down one of the backbones L and R you can move the view to understand where the various worms are within the stage, but also to have a idea of what the characteristics of the environment are (which is displayed on both screens in extended mode, as if they were one). The number of weapons and objects present in this new episode of Worms is truly incredible, and each tool boasts specific characteristics that make it unique. When hitting another worm, a whole series of factors must be taken into account: the direction and strength of the wind (if we are using a rocket weapon), the accuracy of the weapon and its ~reverse~ danger (never shoot with a rocket launcher when there are obstacles close to our character), the power of the attack and the possibility of performing a second one in sequence. The action takes place in turns: each of our worms can move and use objects for a certain period of time, and the turn ends when we use a weapon or when we damage the character in some way (for example by falling from a high point) . In the end, the team that manages to eliminate all opponents, even if they are left with only one worm alive, wins. Every time a worm dies, an ironic and merciless ~concern~ sentence appears on the screen, which has always been a trademark of Worms. Technical realization Apart from the animated sequences (which, as mentioned, suffer from excessive video compression), Worms: Open Warfare 2 is prexempt as a technically very valid product, which manages to fully convince while making use of essential graphics. The merit goes first of all to the fluidity of the scrolling and polygonal animation: probably everything moves at 60 fps, and it is a pleasure for the eyes to see such a beautiful combination of 2D and 3D graphics, characterized by a solid and flawless style. Each location has a precise identity, which translates into the use of certain shades of color and the presence of different elements. The sound sector makes effects its strong point: the little worms abound in grotesque and nice verses, which can be modified in the options to better respond to our tastes (there is also the possibility of having verses in Italian or in. .. Picciotto) and which create a truly strange and particular atmosphere. The control system is really ready and immediate, practically free of defects, and the developers have done an excellent job also for the Laboratory mode, in which both the stylus and the microphone are used very well. A few words also for the multiplayer, really well done especially in its online form: it is possible to organize different types of matches with people from all over the world and access a ranking of the best players, all very quickly and intuitively. Only voice chat is missing to complete the picture. Comment Worms: Open Warfare 2 is a product that makes solidity its strong point. Solidity represented by a well-tested gameplay, by the presence of numerous game modes and by the (literally) hundreds of stages that it is possible to face. Around this system, which would work well on its own, we have a respectable technical realization, which combines style and humor, as well as the interesting possibilities of an online multiplayer that does not disappoint. The only limit of this new episode of Worms, if you will, lies in the lack of strong innovations for the series (apart from the Laboratory mode, which lays the foundations for interesting applications on the Nintendo DS), which could make people turn up their noses who expected a small revolution. Well, there was no revolution, the game is basically the same as always... but it works damn well, and that's it. Pros: Technically well done Lots of modes, lots of stages Exclusive applications for the Nintendo DS Cons: Very similar to previous episodes Blocky cutscenes Sometimes frustrating inertial system The Worms series has been raging on all gaming systems for years and years, starting with the Amiga and PC and ending up on the latest generation consoles. With the succession of episodes, the simple original structure has grown and gained a considerable thickness, which is now revealed in the presence of dozens of weapons and objects that the worms can use to be right with each other, divided into teams fierce. Worms has also landed on Nintendo DS, of course, with an episode that unfortunately disappointed in many respects, primarily as regards the technical implementation. Now the developers of Team 17, for the occasion together with Two Tribes, want to make up for it with a completely redesigned sequel", "date": "2007-09-12", "grade": null}
