{"name": "Ferrari Challenge: Trofeo Pirelli - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ferrari-challenge-trofeo-pirelli-recensione_a.html", "text": "The Ferrari brand has been inextricably linked to the racing world since the founding of the car manufacturer in the late 1940s. Formula 1 enthusiasts remember well the historic feats linked to the single-seaters of the Prancing Horse; not everyone, however, knows the reality of the one-make championships, of which the Ferrari Challenge is a part. Born in 1993, the tournament sees ten teams, for a total of almost forty drivers, compete at the wheel of the same car (currently a Ferrari F430) on tracks located in Italy, Europe and the USA. As mentioned in the introductory lines, the Ferrari Challenge has already been a source of inspiration for a video game, in this case a realistic and addictive arcade game developed by SEGA in 1999 and subsequently converted for the Dreamcast and PlayStation 2. Now it's up to the British System 3 team to bring your vision of this one-make tournament on console: with such fierce competition, will the experience of the creators of classics such as International Karate + and The Last Ninja be enough to make the difference? unlike most games that use the Wii-mote horizontally as a steering wheel, the System 3 title proves anything but accurate First impact Without boasting a monstrous number of modes, Ferrari Challenge: Trofeo Pirelli tries not to miss anything. In fact, from the start screen, it is possible to take to the track in one of the available events, manage the cars that have been unlocked in the showroom (modifying their paintwork, applying vinyls and liveries...), organizing your own team (changing their name and nationality) , check progress in races and challenge a friend with a simple card game based on Ferrari cars. Those who are beginners should start with the tutorial which explains in a simple and complete way how to manage the car using the control system we prefer between the two available: with the Wii-mote alone or with the Wii-mote pair plus Nunchuck. The first option is typical of racing games on the Wii and sees the controller held horizontally (or inserted into one of the many ~steering wheels~ on sale) to take advantage of the internal motion sensor, with keys 1 and 2 to activate the brake and accelerator, and possibly the d-pad to change gears. Unfortunately, the impressions about this setting are not exactly positive: unlike most of the games that use the Wii-mote horizontally as a steering wheel, the System 3 title turns out to be anything but precise and there is a consistent ~lag~ from when we move the controller to when the car steers on the screen. Very often, then, the input is not implemented at all, resulting in frustrating and unexpected off-piste. The situation improves substantially by connecting the Nunchuck and using the analog stick to change the direction of the car. In this case the game responds immediately and without problems, but the layout of the commands leaves something to be desired: you have to accelerate with the B trigger, but to brake we will have to use the Z button on the Nunchuck. The worst thing, however, are the keys assigned to the change: they are 1 and 2, placed in a position that is anything but easy to reach if at the same time you need to accelerate. Form and substance Once we become familiar with the control system, we will be able to dedicate ourselves to the various game modes available. In addition to the classic options such as fast racing and time trial, we will be able to access a fairly substantial arcade mode, consisting of four different levels of difficulty (beginner, intermediate, expert and legend) set in as many locations, each divided into four races that you have to finish in first position to unlock the next races, as well as new selectable cars (the total is about fifty cars, which retrace the history of Ferrari from its beginnings to current production). Then there is the ~challenge~ mode, which takes its name and de facto from the Ferrari Challenge championship and sees us tackle a total of twenty-one events in Italy, Europe and North America. Unlike the arcade mode, in this case you won't simply have to overcome all your opponents and cross the finish line first, but always set the best time, paying attention to all stages of the race. Unlike SEGA's Ferrari F355 Challenge, which made a single first-person view available to the player, we will be able to choose between seven different camera settings. However, the one from the cockpit appears to be the weakest and worst done, from every point of view: from the detail of the interior to the portion of the screen useful for watching the track, which is far too limited. Technical realization When faced with multiplatform productsform, it is clear that Wii owners cannot expect a graphic rendering comparable to that of the PlayStation 3 version. Too often, however, developers tend to demean the technical capabilities of the Nintendo console beyond the lawful, and this is unfortunately the case with Ferrari Challenge , which comes with good polygonal models but with a shaky and anything but smooth frame rate. A good job has been done as regards the differentiation between the various Ferraris that we will find ourselves driving (also thanks to the technical consultancy of a talented young man like Bruno Senna), but on the screen so much effort is not highlighted: everything appears tremendously below average, without hints, without even the intention of daring something more than the usual ~Wii homework~ of which we are really bored by now. Therefore, the GPU was not used well, but neither was the Wii-mote: if you choose to use motion detection, the control system leaves much to be desired, making the gaming experience frustrating. By connecting the Nunchuck, things improve a lot, but we collide with an organization of controls that is anything but comfortable. On balance, perhaps the sound sector alone manages to raise the average a minimum, thanks to the original rumbles of the Ferraris and a series of good-level effects. Comment In the Wii version, Ferrari Challenge: Trofeo Pirelli disappoints, and not a little. The game features good gameplay, with a rather neat simulation look, and a decent number of ~hearty~ modes. The problem is that to find out you must first become familiar with a control system which in the ~Wii-mote horizontally~ version reveals too many shortcomings and which improves using the Nunchuck but only up to a certain point, losing moreover the peculiarities of motion detection . We must also turn a blind eye to yet another technical achievement to forget. If you own the Nintendo console and you want a racing game that isn't Mario Kart, then the situation is a bit complicated... but you'll find several titles around that, at least in terms of motion-sensing controls, will give you satisfaction. Unfortunately this is not the case with Ferrari Challenge. Pros Good driving model A good number of cars and modes Well done roar of the engines Cons Mediocre control system Slow and poorly detailed graphics Unexplained absent multiplayer", "date": "2008-09-17", "grade": null}
