Since then many have sought this rich loot, but no one has ever found it and there are so many versions of the original story that we can now only define it as a legend. Treasures of Montezuma, on the other hand, is a much more concrete franchise that has enjoyed good success for some years, to the point of having generated sequels and variants on almost every machine. It should therefore not be so surprising to find it on PlayStation Vita, albeit in a decidedly particular form, designed for super-fast games and users so eager to play that they are willing to pay to continue doing so! Betreasured To tell the truth, Treasures of Montezuma Blitz is an almost completely free game: just go to the PlayStation Vita Store to download it in a few minutes, in fact it weighs less than two hundred megs. We'll explain why it's ~almost completely~ free shortly, for now let's take it one step at a time. Alawar Entertainment's new proposal for the Sony console is designed as a simple and quick pastime to play for a few, intense minutes at a time, ideal for those who don't have much time to devote to gaming and are looking for a mind-blowing puzzle game to play maybe on the bus. The idea is not bad, but it is not implemented properly as the game requires an internet connection to save progress, and it takes almost a minute to finally be able to play after launching the software due to an unreasonably long initial load. Finally having reached the initial screen, we are faced with a visually very clean and colorful product. Don't expect a science fiction creation, but rather a series of well-defined two-dimensional sprites and a catchy background music. The problem, if anything, is that nothing about the game itself is explained to us and we have to grope from the start, navigating through a handful of menus that are anything but clear. The tutorial is relegated to a few suggestions proposed during the first few games, not particularly exhaustive to tell the truth, which more than anything else risks distracting us and breaking the pace of the game. Treasures of Montezuma Blitz is in fact yet another variant of Bejeweled. Gems of various colors are arranged in an 8x8 grid and our task is to align at least three of the same color in order to destroy them and earn points. We will be able to do this either by moving the cursor with the directional cross and selecting the gems to swap places with the pressure of a key, or by touching the touch-screen: this last method actually didn't seem very precise to us, and often we risk tap the wrong gem, wasting precious seconds of gameplay. PSVita trophies Treasures of Montezuma Blitz does not offer any Trophies. Out of the grain! When we destroy three or more gems of the same color, their place will be taken by another series of randomly generated gems that will fall on the grid. If you find yourself unable to find a combination of gems, just tap an icon to reshuffle the grid layout and continue playing. This action takes a few seconds, a luxury that is rarely afforded. In fact, the matches last sixty seconds, an intense minute during which it will be necessary to try to destroy as many gems as possible, perhaps causing chain reactions that increase the canonical score multipliers. Treasures of Montezuma Blitz in fact revolves around the points collected in each game, which can be compared online in a sort of leaderboard. Each game also guarantees a certain number of gems with which it is possible to buy upgrades that will offer us some advantage during the games, allowing us for example to destroy all the gems of a color or to slightly increase the duration of the game. More slots are unlocked as you play to house these power-ups, but this is where the ~freemium~ model takes over. Every day it is possible to play a maximum of five games, for a total of about five minutes, after which you will have to wait a few hours before being able to play again. The games also consume the same crystals with which you buy the power-ups, so at a certain point you find yourself unable to play unless you win them every day with a sort of ~lottery~ or go to the Store to buy some extra crystal. The service offers various packages ofvarious prices, in any case still quite expensive (with the minimum package you play no more than a few days). So Treasures of Montezuma Blitz is by no means free as it seems, if anything it takes advantage of the microtransaction model now widespread especially in the mobile video game market, a strategy that in this case does not seem very apt.", "date": "2012-04-25", "grade": "5.5"}
