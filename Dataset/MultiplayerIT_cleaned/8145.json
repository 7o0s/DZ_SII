In fact, we are talking about a completely new experiment for Yakuza and its spin-offs, as well as the possible preamble to a substantial change of course for the entire franchise. The reason is easy to say: as you know, the historic producer of the series, Toshihiro Nagoshi, has left the Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio together with Daisuke Sato, and although a new chapter in the Yakuza: Like a Dragon series is already in the works, the fate of Judgment is not equally certain due to a dispute with the agency that manages the image of the actor Takuya Kimura, who plays Takayuki Yagami. Put simply, there is the possibility that this new adventure dedicated to Kaito could represent a farewell to the spin-off that inherited the brand's gameplay action in conjunction with the transition to the turn-based RPG mechanics of Like a Dragon. And as a goodbye, well, that felt a little disappointing. History The Kaito Files, Masaharu Kaito in one of the flashback sequences of the expansion While Yagami is working on a case on the road, Kaito runs the Kamurocho detective agency. After collaborating with the lawyers of the Genda firm to catch a group of former Yakuza red-handed who have organized a ring of blackmail against innocent people, the man receives a visit from Kyoya Sadamoto, president of a prestigious IT company, who asks to investigate the disappearance of a woman. It is his wife, Mikiko Natsume: two years earlier a body was found which DNA analysis turned out to be hers, but Sadamoto is not convinced that things really happened like this and would like to know the truth. Is she still alive? The question paralyzes Kaito for a very specific reason: Mikiko was his girlfriend and the two lived together, but they broke up sixteen years earlier, when the demands of the Matsugane mafia family made their relationship difficult. Too involved, the investigator refuses to deal with the case, but then comes into contact with Jun, the young and rebellious son of Mikiko, convinced that Kaito is his father and therefore has a moral obligation to investigate what happened. The fact that the same group of ex-Yakuza blackmailers are on the trail of the boy convinces Yagami's partner that something is not right and that Mikiko might really still be alive. What really happened? Set only in the scenario of Kamurocho, the story of The Kaito Files presents the traditional ingredients of the Yakuza series between well-defined characters, ruthless enemies, fights to the death and twists. The latter, however, turn out to be a bit phoned and use gimmicks that the series has already explored extensively in the past, which inevitably undermines the quality and freshness of the plot. Gameplay The Kaito Files, a fight in the streets of Kamurocho While remaining faithful to the gameplay we talked about in the Lost Judgment review, The Kaito Files puts us for the first time in the role of Masaharu Kaito, a decidedly less refined character than Yagami, who never backs down when it comes to fight, but at the same time equipped with highly developed senses that prove to be fundamental during investigations. Using the first person view, in fact, we will be able not only to focus on the visual details of a crime scene, but also to use our nose and hearing to identify barely perceptible odors or noises. It is a nice novelty, but which is a bit forced in certain moments, testifying to the fact that the authors have tried to introduce elements of freshness into the Judgment formula but without success. The Kaito Files, an investigative sequence Much better when you fight, and from this point of view Kaito definitely doesn't let himself beg, showing off two fighting styles which however are only partially original: Incursore is an interesting mix of direct hits, dodges and strategy, while Maciste is basically a copy of Kazuma Kiryu's Beast style and therefore has very little new to say and give. In both cases the grips are strongly weakened, and so are the traditional finishers, limited to attacks on the ground or with blunt objects. Mind you, the combat system is still very pleasant and the excellent impact yield increases the fun, although notice in some moments some problems with collision detection and the usual inventory trick persists from which to draw food and medicines on the fly before the health bar is completely empty, even during the most demanding boss fightsi who are thus trivialized. Structure The Kaito Files, Kaito and Jun posing in front of a SEGA Club, now a legacy of the past The big problem of The Kaito Files, however, is structural: the duration of the expansion is just six hours because the secondary quests are completely missing, which have always given color and substance to the episodes of the franchise, and the adventure takes place only among the streets of Kamurocho, without taking advantage of the (relatively) new setting of Isezaki Ijincho. If we consider that the Lost Judgment campaign runs very smoothly around forty hours and that this DLC is sold for half the price of the base game, i.e. 29 99, it goes without saying that something is not right: the developers could certainly have taken better care of the introductory part and added something to the Yokohama map in order to strengthen the offer. The Kaito Files, Kaito during one of the (boring) stealth phases of the expansion A real pity, because in terms of direction and interpretation (in Japanese or English, with Italian subtitles) The Kaito Files has its why, and technically it uses the excellent system of the base game and its splendid Kamurocho, never so alive and rich, to create an adventure that could have aimed to be much more than a partly wasted opportunity.", "date": "2022-04-03", "grade": "7.0"}
