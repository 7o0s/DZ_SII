For once, then, it is an all-European excellence, French in particular: the protagonist Gallic warriors, also well known in Italy, are practically unknown in America and Japan. The arrival of Asterix & Obelix XXL 3: The Crystal Menhir on the market, among other things, was not even so obvious: thanks also to the publisher Microids, which last year proposed the remaster of Asterix & Obelix XXL 2: Mission Las Vegum (published way back in 2005), and which returns these days with a real new chapter, more than ten years later. But does a video game dedicated to Asterix and Obelix still have its raison d'tre today? How did he have to change his nature to adapt to modern times? And above all, the legacy of tranges Libellules (developers of the previous title) with how much fidelity has Osome Studio taken up? The plot: these Romans are crazy Asterix & Obelix XXL 3 presents a plot that is not particularly brilliant, but in line with the narrative cues and situations to which more than fifty years of comics and cinema based on the Gallic franchise have accustomed us: hence the two protagonists Asterix and Obelix (and the latter's faithful little dog, Idefix) set off on an adventure to save something or someone. In particular, in this case it is a priestess, a longtime friend of Panoramix: she has warned the village that the whole world is in danger. You have to find the woman and save everyone, but no one knows where she is... except for a magical Menhir. And when it comes to Menhirs, obviously Obelix is needed to load it behind his back with great, methodical delicacy: after all, the rooster in question is very strong, having fallen into the pot of the magic potion when he was a child. Thus begins the adventure of the two protagonists, divided into some chapters (not excessively long) that will take them from time to time in different settings, however, always full of Roman warriors to be beaten. Meanwhile, the player will unlock some powers relating to both the protagonists and their travel companion's menhir, thus enriching the actual game offer. The title offers three different levels of difficulty, from the simplest to the most difficult, with a challenge that can prove to be interesting most of the time even for the most experts of the genre. To get the Platinum Trophy on PlayStation 4 it is mandatory to complete the adventure even in hard mode. Playstation 4 trophies Asterix & Obelix XXL 3 has a beautiful shiny Platinum Trophy: taking it home will not be impossible, but neither will it be as easy as you might imagine in such a production. First of all, it will be necessary to complete the plot in difficult mode; and as for the 200 consecutive combo trophy well, good luck to those Romans. Gameplay: Lots of changes, same beats Asterix & Obelix XXL 3 presents a visual setting and gameplay that are profoundly different from those of its predecessor, that is Asterix & Obelix XXL 2: Mission Las Vegum: it was more the narrative context of the production that remained intact, which was impossible to change because obviously linked to the French reference work. More than a real action, now the series seems to have adopted the characteristics of the scrolling fighting games: you proceed in very linear levels by eliminating all the enemies on the screen, with some standard moves and some special ones. The approach is diversified according to the character you control at a given moment: Asterix is agile in his movements and faster, but Obelix naturally hits harder and has a much more generous energy bar. The latter allows you to perform special (and specific) abilities, such as pirouettes capable of hitting all the Romans in the vicinity, an uppercut that sends them into orbit (even with nice sound effects), and so on. Some ~moves~ are then necessary to continue through the levels: Asterix can jump from one platform to another, Obelix cannot. To understand this, it is important to underline how in Asterix & Obelix XXL 3 the jump command has been definitively eliminated, therefore also vertical exploration of the world is practically absent, or in any case limited to short junctures and a few platforms in full evidence. From time to time the progression requires solving very short and linear environmental puzzles (such as ~pull thelever and lower that grate~). Further on in the adventure the menhir of the title is unlocked, and here the offer becomes more diversified: on balance you ~abandon~ control of Asterix to stake everything on Obelix, the only capable of being able to use the powers of fire and ice against enemies.It is a pity that the production exploits these few ideas in almost all situations, even if in an original way: with some other powers and a greater variety in enemies and present worlds, the game would have been much more interesting. The view has also changed, compared to Asterix & Obelix XXL 2: Mission Las Vegum. The third person has been replaced with a general bird's eye view with isometric perspective. You see the game world and the characters acting like a close-up Diablo 3, in short. The nice dubbing in Italian, pleasant and not obvious in a title like this, deserves a particular mention; the texts on the screen, on the other hand, would need some adjustments from an orthographic and grammatical point of view, but even from this point of view, all in all, the result is pleasant, especially if we consider that for products with a limited budget, you usually have to settle for the English language both in the texts on the screen and in the dialogues.", "date": "2019-12-03", "grade": "6.8"}
