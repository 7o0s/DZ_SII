The title developed by Robot Invader, released over two years ago, stood as an interesting variation on the theme of horizontal scrolling endless runners, drawing on the genre of traditional platformers and action games to pull a fun product out of the hat, frenetic, challenging and multifaceted, net of a little frustration; all offered on the App Store and Google Play at a very accessible price. In short, there was a certain expectation with respect to the sequel, which has been available for a few days for iOS and Android devices, and which in no way betrays the original formula but rather seeks to expand it by working on the surrounding elements. In the first episode, our brave spring knight saw his four skills gradually introduced, namely the jump (even double), the ability to roll, the sword strike and the protection with the shield against stones or barrels coming from above. In Wind-up Knight 2, on the other hand, the entire repertoire is quickly recalled in the introductory stages, thus leaving room for a series of variations that characterize the environment around us: wobbly platforms that turn into chasms, frozen surfaces that increase the speed of running and turf that, on the contrary, reduce it; as well as a renewed attention to the element of replayability, with a view to a reward system that requires a certain number of achievements to be able to move on to the next area and which provides three secondary quests for each mission, which can be completed, for example, by collecting certain objects or avoiding attack any enemy. Wind-up Knight 2 is fun, challenging, but also quite frustrating and a bit expensive How much do you cost me? The developers have done an excellent construction job for Wind-up Knight 2, enriching the structure of the game with many new scenarios and enemies, with an eye to the fluidity of the action and therefore the quality of the animations. Starting from exotic settings instead of focusing primarily on panoramas more relevant to the context could perhaps make some users turn up their noses, but in reality the campaign reserves surprises for everyone and it is therefore difficult to be disappointed by what it has to offer. We have detected a certain increase in the difficulty which, unfortunately, touches the keys of frustration already in some way stimulated by the debut chapter, despite the presence of numerous checkpoints. Quickly switching from one button to another, as required in some situations, does not in fact prove to be a very simple operation and makes us reflect on the lack of alternative interpretations for touch controls, given that, for example, it would have been possible to activate certain actions via gestures (the leap, above all) without losing sight of the original vision of Robot Invader. Similarly, it cannot be said that the developers have been able to differentiate the offer in a substantial way, as one would expect from a sequel. Well, except for one thing: the price. Wind-up Knight 2 can be downloaded for free from the App Store and Google Play, but to unlock the full game you have to spend a good 7.99 euros (6.49 on Android). Sure, there's an introductory offer that cuts that amount in half, but under normal conditions we're talking about five times the price of the first episode, and it honestly seems like an exaggeration.", "date": "2014-04-16", "grade": "7.8"}
