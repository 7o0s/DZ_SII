Three pieces of a puzzle that materialized when, exactly two years ago, the There Came an Echo Kickstarter campaign ended successfully, raising over $115,000 against a goal set at $90,000. Landed on Steam for a couple of weeks, the game quite clearly mentions the first chapter of the ~Matrix~ trilogy during the initial stages, when programmer Corrin Webb receives a call in his office from Val, a mysterious girl who warns him of an imminent danger: some agents are going to pick him up and there is a real risk that, after obtaining the information they want, they will kill him. Corrin at first doesn't believe Val's words, but soon realizes that things are exactly as his interlocutor told him on the cell phone, and therefore decides to run away. The goal of the men in black, apparently, is an encryption algorithm that the programmer has created some time before, the Radial Lock, and which it seems cannot be surpassed in any way. During the escape Corrin meets Miranda, a skilled mercenary who offers him her help, although it is not clear for what purpose, and two other characters who will form a real party during the strategic phases of the game, in a sequence of events and twists that will eventually bring the story to an impactful conclusion. Strategy take me away It is certainly not the first time that a video game includes a voice command system, but in the case of There Came an Echo it is a central feature, which can be set aside but at a high price, as we will see. After a few tests and a couple of quick time events in which we are asked to indicate Corrin the direction to take during the escape, the gameplay of the Iridium Studios title finds its definitive form in a series of relatively short missions, in which one must coordinate the actions of the protagonist and his companions within scenarios often supervised by guards in the pay of those who finance the operation from which the story began. The characters must be sent to certain points on the map (where they are indicated by a name, for example ~alpha 1~, ~alpha 2~ and so on, otherwise it is simply not possible) and they lie in wait there, eventually opening fire on the enemies (~target 1~, ~target 2~, etc.) following automatic mechanisms which are based on the consumption of an energy battery which powers not only the weapons but also the shields. Deciding when to reload is therefore of vital importance from a strategic perspective, as well as concentrating fire towards a target or giving life to devastating choral actions (~at my go hit all that enemy~). It is also possible to bring a grounded ally back to life and on more than one occasion you find yourself moving in stealth mode, memorizing the pattern of the guards to avoid their gaze as you reach the desired point in the scenario. In principle, however, the degree of difficulty is not very high and at the same time the thickness of these strategic phases leaves a lot to be desired. There Came an Echo has a nice storyline and excellent audio, but the game itself disappoints do you hear me? The first, big hitch of the There Came an Echo experience lies precisely in its voice command system: the Italian language is not supported in any way, which means that the characters speak in English, but above all we will have to do it too to give him orders. And here the proverbial donkey falls, because it all depends on the pronunciation of the sentences, which must be enunciated very clearly and at a controlled speed. Not exactly an ideal situation, when you are in the middle of a shootout and the victory or defeat of the team can depend on our command. Orders can be customized by simply writing new ones in the options screen and letting the software interpret them, but always following the phonetic rules of the English language. The mix of almost perfect pronunciation and tonal ~flatness~ is devastating for non-native speaker gamers, who find themselves in great difficulty, with the game transposing one command out of three when it goes well, creating episodes of great frustration. Is there a traditional alternative? Fortunately yes, but it is clear how the developers have paid very little attention to it. It is in fact the usual ~decision wheel~ that appears on the screen when we right-click with the mouse, and which presents the commands relating to that specific situation. The operationHowever, the interface is rather cumbersome, and you have to pay attention to which order is highlighted when you click, or you risk making the characters perform risky or counterproductive actions (for example, energy recharge when the bar is almost full, a real classic). The narrative first The feeling, during the approximately four hours that make up the There Came an Echo campaign (almost half of which consists of cutscenes), is that the developers' goal was mainly to tell a story, dressing it up with a prominent feature ( voice commands, in fact) in order to increase the involvement of the player, who in the end takes on the role of a mysterious individual interfaced with Val and with Corrin, connected from who knows where. An interesting story, without a doubt, which also makes use of excellently crafted English dialogues, interpreted among others by Wil Wheaton (if you watch The Big Bang Theory you know perfectly well who he is, beyond his old role in Star Trek: The Next Generation), Ashly Burch (Chloe in Life is Strange) and Laura Bailey (Fiona in Tales from the Borderlands), and accompanied by an excellent soundtrack signed by Ronald Jenkees and Big Giant Circles. The problem is that everything that goes beyond the narrative element in this production doesn't shine at all: from the aforementioned problems with voice commands, in particular for Italian users, to the cumbersome interface where you want to play in the traditional way with the mouse; from the flatness of the RTS phases, short and without particular challenge, to graphics that on the one hand offer beautiful settings, on the other it proves to be really mediocre as regards the animation of the characters. The picture that emerges from this analysis is that of a somewhat experimental title, with major shortcomings in terms of design and a limited duration, which is not resolved by the addition of the War Room mode (a traditional horde with increasing difficulty), considering the quality of the strategic gameplay.", "date": "2015-03-17", "grade": "5.0"}
