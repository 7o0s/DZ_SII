Surely the most successful is the Xbox both in terms of graphics, with cleaner and more defined textures, and in terms of the fluidity of the game engine. This version is closely followed by the one for GameCube which also enjoys the possibility of connection with the Game Boy Advance, which, if equipped with a copy of Medal of Honor Infiltrator, turns into a constantly updated map. The PlayStation 2 version is the one that technically shines the least but on the other hand it is the only one that can boast an online mode, but we will talk about this in the appropriate box. It's not a game, you volunteered The EA game plunges us into the midst of World War II on the Pacific front, from the attack on Pearl Harbor to the retreat from the Philippines to Singapore. Surely Rising Sun bases much of its appeal on the strong emotional impact that the reconstruction of those days offers, exploiting as far as possible also the success of a film like Pearl Harbor, which definitely influenced the developers in the first and, moreover, better successful scheme of the game. We will face less than a dozen missions, each lasting about half an hour set in the various locations that have marked the development of the story, from the battle of Guadalcanal to the bridge over the River Kwai. The imprint given is obviously that of an immediate fps, not particularly tactical and more than anything else marked by an extermination of all the enemies we meet on our path. The stealth phases are very limited (the Singapore mission is an exception) and not at all encouraged by an AI of our opponents that leaves something to be desired. In fact, more than once we will be able to get close without seeing them react, the case in which, by killing one of their fellow soldiers nearby, we will see them petrified as if nothing had happened and we will be able to shoot them with disarming ease is emblematic. Some phases of the game will take place in the name of even more extreme carnage aboard trucks or other means (even an elephant) with the task of shooting on sight. A decent variant to break the monotony of the usual move - look for the piece - destroy the place, even if all too easy in certain situations. During the missions we will sometimes take possession of a stationary machine gun, but the situation, from dramatic will almost turn into a farce, the Japanese will come out of their hiding places at that precise moment and let themselves be shot without reacting much and indeed almost running towards us for the sake of being mowed down by gusts. Corporal Griffis, played by us, will be armed from time to time in a different way and will use perfectly recreated weapons identical to those used by the marines during the Second World War. With all the advantages and disadvantages of the case, such as lower accuracy and long loading times. Online on PlayStation 2 Due to known disagreements between Microsoft and EA over online gaming, the only console that supports the service is the PlayStation 2. Nine maps are playable with up to eight players in two simple modes: deathmatch and team deathmatch. The gaming experience is certainly interesting, even if a little too frenetic, after all, like the single-player game, the online one is not at all based on a stealth approach. The first few games are thus certainly satisfying, but in the long run the game risks being boring. There are no lobbies or chat rooms before entering the game, only the current games list. Online game service therefore present, but a little too reduced to the essentials. Freshman soldier! Cross-platform, sir The EA game, developed as it is known for all three new generation consoles, enjoys a generally discreet technical sector. The polygonal models of the characters are good, even if sometimes a little too angular, the animations are good. The scenarios unfortunately, except for the first level, truly a cut above all the others, are monotonous and insufficiently recreated, the textures dull and poorly defined, not to mention that the interactivity with the backdrops is almost nil. Yes, it is possible to destroy a few boxes of ammunition and a few barrels here and there, but nothing more, shooting against walls will not always show the holes of our bullets, just as our fellow soldiers cannot be injured by friendly fire. The framerate, on the other hand, defends itself quite well, proving to be stable even if subject to some drops in the most concrete situationsnannies. The localization work of the game is also discreet, which in any case is limited to the texts, thus making the context lose some emphasis and rhythm, forcing the player to read, distracting him from what is happening around him. Moreover, the decision to insert the text in boxes which, instead of resetting themselves, add up the lines of speech one below the other, making the player perhaps engaged in a shootout lose the ~thread~ is decidedly questionable. On the other hand, the music chosen by the developers appears to be excellent, very suggestive, which immerse the player even more deeply in the clashes. A final note of merit certainly goes to the intermission films between one mission and another, thanks to them we will in fact enter the historical events without having to go and open some encyclopedia, making the immersion in the game more and more effective. Freshman soldier! Cross-platform, sir Comment Medal of Honor: Rising Sun turns out to be a title capable of capturing the attention of the player, but also of disappointing him in several situations. EA has not been able to repeat the success achieved by the previous version of Medal of Honor, both for a decidedly lower attention to detail than expected, and for a subdued technical sector that denotes large gaps especially as regards the Artificial Intelligence of our enemies. Moreover, the difficulty appears calibrated a little too low, making it almost useless to play at a normal level and requiring a higher setting to entertain and engage the player. However, the shortage of fps on GameCube and PlayStation 2 makes the EA title moderately attractive, a little more difficult for this operation to succeed on Xbox, where the first-person shooter front is decidedly well covered. A seven to the PS2 and GC versions, while if you own the Microsoft home console, take away half a point due to the overabundance of valid alternatives. Pros: Captivates the player with an exciting atmosphere Immediate and fun Great soundtrack Cons: Technically only fair Too easy Bad A.I. of enemies Fire, explosions, big jolts, all around you men screaming and running. You make your way among your comrades, also marines, and also embarked on a warship docked at Pearl Harbor. You step out onto the deck and the sun is overcast, but it's not night, it's 8.15 in the morning on December 7, 1941, it's just obscured by the multitude of Japanese Model Zero planes whizzing by at very low altitude dropping their load of death and shooting multiple I can't against the first organized resistance. They hand you a rifle and you too begin the difficult defense, but Asian fighters are everywhere. An explosion knocks you into the water and you see dozens of mortally wounded and drowned bodies of your fellow soldiers. With difficulty you hoist yourself aboard a small armored boat and put yourself to the machine gun, they tell you to fire on everything that moves and you do it, or at least you try, the anguish is strong, the surprise was so great and the amazement of the attack. The moored battleships begin to sink and you continue your grueling little battle which fortunately ends after a while. The budget is tragic for the US military, but you are a Marine and they have trained you to never give up, you will make those cursed Japs pay dearly. Don't worry, we haven't gone back in time, and luckily a tragic episode like Pearl Harbor doesn't have to be relived in person, it's just the latest installment in the Medal of Honor: Rising Sun series that will see us fight as a brave United States marines against veritable hordes of soldiers from the rising sun. In fact, EA has shifted the focus from Europe, the scenario of its previous title, to a new theater of war, the Pacific, and we have been invited as ~interactive spectators~ to the clash between the two powers.", "date": "2003-12-16", "grade": null}
