From a seed a strong and luxuriant shrub has sprouted and the second chapter has expanded and expanded the good developed in the original game, adding Dark Elves, Lizardmen, High Elves and the pestilential Skaven. Obviously, many races present in the universe created by Games Workshop are missing, and if it is true that a third chapter of the trilogy is still missing to close the circle and be able to consider the work complete, nothing has prevented Creative from fleshing out Total War: Warhammer II with new heroes, modes and factions. For example, if the Mortal Empires have united all the species currently present in a mega battle for control of the planet, it is with Rise of the Tomb Kings that the fifth race of the new chapter faces your PC ready to upset the vortex campaign and to bring new strategies to the battlefield. Arise my armies! Rise of the Tomb Kings smacks of pure add-on content, a project clearly born after the idea of war between the original four factions and inserted on the sidelines of the battle for control of central Ulthuan. The Tomb Kings will thus have a separate starting area from the previous regions and, more importantly, will not actively compete in the conquest of the vortex, having very different objectives in mind. The sands reveal a new deserted portion south of Ulthuan, in an inhospitable region populated by the undead and a bad climate for all who seek to colonize them. Hordes of skeletons led by revived Liches and Lords rise from the deserts of Nehekhara, driven by the desire to regain power over the world. The great vortex has no use for the old kings who instead are driven by the insatiable desire to regain possession of the Books of Nagash: nine tomes scattered throughout the various regions capable of guaranteeing absolute power to those who control them. However, the two-tailed comet that crosses the sky sends a benevolent warning and only five of these books are now needed to perform all the rituals required to enter the Black Pyramid, the final objective of the mission. As you may well have understood, the Tomb Kings will be able to feast on the corpses of enemies and assault all the opposing cities without ever entering the heart of the battle, a tactic that allows them to easily carve out well-defensible regions rich in raw materials. Iron is in fact one of the most important elements for this new race since, together with the canopic jars, it will allow you to obtain objects, armor and even troops with little effort. It is one of the new mechanics designed for the race, an original idea that guarantees a continuous influx of new forces to existing armies. The Tomb Kings also have the peculiarity of not having to pay the maintenance costs of normal skeletons (whether they are archers, swordsmen or spearmen) a huge bonus that will guarantee you the control of truly immense armies. Although their single strength is nothing compared to that of the first teams you will meet, the large number and the possibility of encircling the opposing troops will make the difference in combat allowing you in agility to win battles only thanks to the quantity of soldiers deployed, and this despite the initial abilities of the four available lords are nothing particularly strong or destructive. Not as much as those of lizardmen and dark elves at least. To further enhance your army of undead, the basic skill of the race will also take care of it, an automatic cure that will activate as soon as a sufficient number of losses are reached, a considerable boost during the most tense matches that can even reach its climax allowing you to summon units of huge ushabti anywhere on the battlefield, even in close combat, with siege weapons or enemy archers. At the end of the clashes you will then get the opportunity to refresh your undead and flesh out their ranks or loot the organs of the fallen enemies by acquiring the canopic jars we were talking about earlier. It goes without saying that an aggressive tactic will allow you to quickly get to developing the most dangerous creatures, perhaps accompanied by powerful rituals whose functioning you should already know. As far as technology is concerned, the Tomb Kings do not rely on the classic growth and upgrading of buildings but rely on glorifying the old dynasties, choosing one at a time and activating it in 15 turns, a tlong time to then unlock the various more canonical upgrades to the units. Not the only undead The new race is therefore excellent for diversifying game mechanics. However, it is when it comes to going into battle that the difference is really substantial compared to the four pre-existing factions. Since you have no maintenance costs and you can basically call as many skeletons as you want to fight alongside you, while still maintaining the turn limitations for creating additional units, you'll only have to be careful about the buildings you decide to build because these will limit the capacity of members in your army. The more your army grows, the more you will learn to understand that the sacrifice of these piles of bones is not only useful, but even becomes essential to act as a wall for your elite troops. Giants, sphinxes and deadly scorpions will thus be able to charge distracted enemy units from the rear, keeping their hit points intact and gaining important bonuses in combat. The downside of having all this power on the battlefield is obviously seen when you lose one of the cities you control. The buildings cost significantly more than those of the other factions, and their development times are also slower. The Tomb Kings will therefore have to continue to expand in a slow and controlled way without risking attacks on remote citadels or raids without control. In short, if you learn to manage your possessions in the best possible way, you will have nothing else to worry about, given that the Tomb Kings do not substantially have major weaknesses on the battlefield. They have huge and powerful creatures, poison-based magic that is effective but slow to research, and they even have some of the best tanks in the game due to their speed and utility. There are also flying creatures and troops for the vanguard: in short, a real all-round killing machine.", "date": "2018-01-19", "grade": "7.5"}
