{"name": "Mission Impossible: Operation Surma", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mission-impossible-operation-surma-3.html", "text": "Splinter Cell wannabe? Mission Impossible: Operation Surma is the latest addition to a series that has enjoyed moderate popularity on 32 and 64 bits, but which today finds itself in the unpleasant condition of someone forced to clean up the crumbs of an overused plate. Aware of this, the game tries the way of easy usability, looking for the breach in the less intransigent hearts. We discover that the programming is entrusted to Paradigm Entertainment, and this is certainly a pleasant surprise, since we are talking about the authors of Pilotwings 64. A little less pleasant to find them in a production that is certainly not a reference, but dressed as the best Holywoodian blockbuster . And it must be admitted that, at least in the cut scenes, he almost manages to recreate John Woo's assorted craziness in the second filmic chapter, with the protagonist making Pellizzari blush by doing his utmost in endless apneas, or avoiding a bazooka bullet with Matrixian grace (!). W action games and w video games. But this is Mission Impossible, gosh! Therefore, ultra-secret messages subject to destruction 5 seconds after reading, or very soft approaches to the most sophisticated computer terminal in the world, supported by dental floss, cannot be missing. But don't give up. Ethan is not alone, and as in the film he will be able to count on a team that includes his faithful ~IT~ colleague (in the sense that he watches your exploits with his butt warm) Luther, and a rather clumsy agent who will cause you various problems . The aim of the game is to counter the Surma of the title, the inevitable subversive organization intent on planetary disorder, as we can admire in the intro, after receiving the aforementioned explosive message, our handsome hero throws himself busily to work. From now on it will be up to us to decide the good and bad weather (or almost, as we will see later). Just to accentuate the kinship with its celluloid brother, Atari has done a very fine localization job, recruiting Tom Cruise's usual Italian dubber, the very good Roberto Chevalier, as well as a number of competent backing voices. The picture of the frills is completed by the proposition of the famous musical theme of the show (could it be missing?), arranged for the occasion in various sauces in relation to the type of scene. All this, it must be admitted, significantly galvanizes the player, but how does the game appear from a purely playful point of view? Instead of introducing the player to the gameplay mechanics through a training course, the programmers decided to throw him directly on the field, with a fairly long first mission set in a villa under a roof of fireworks. A functional choice, since for each action to be performed a functional window will open with the description of the commands to be used, in this way it will be possible to test Ethan's skills in practice. Objective of the mission: take some photos to send to Luther (who said Solid Snake and Otacon? No soldiers in their underwear, thanks!) and escort an informant out of the structure. As expected, the situation will precipitate, forcing us to the onerous task of saving the skin by relying exclusively on our experience as a secret agent, on the other hand, what impossible mission would it be? Xbox vs PS2 Born as a cross-platform project, the Paradigm creature does not sport an engine capable of presenting particular outstanding qualities for the two platforms in question. In a nutshell, the tested versions are almost indistinguishable from each other, except for the usual greater video cleanliness of the Microsoft console. A difference so minimal as to be completely negligible. Secret agents under the tree After a few hours of play, the nature of the Atari product is clear, evidently designed for a not too problematic use. The situations are suggested to the player without the possibility of interpretation, a factor further highlighted by the few moves that Ethan can perform. Some gameplay choices are perplexing, such as the impossibility of jumping unconditionally: by default the character performs a somersault, and only at pre-established points does this action turn into a jump. The references to Splinter Cell are quite scandalous, almost cheeky in Ethan's posture and walk, practically the same as Sam's, while in the advanced stages we see him wearing the same suit, or holding the weapon with a photocopy-pointing system. It is a pity that MIOS does not reproduce in the slightest part the high interaction with the scenarios, the plays of light and their exploitation for an alternative resolution of the various missions. Ingenuity comes abbimplemented by a linear development and without surprises, certainly not embellished by an exemplary AI. In fact, it is enough to diverge from the pre-established patterns of the guards to be faced with annoying bugs that testify to a hasty realization from the Christmas timeline. Despite these considerations, the product is adequately satisfying and fun, thanks to its intrinsic simplicity, which makes it a soft-stealth for those who don't want to commit too much. The various trinkets made available are also interesting, ranging from grappling hook guns to ingenious lockpick cards, all bells and whistles already seen in the film. Finally, certain touches such as the need to use the footprints of the corpses to open sophisticated tactile locks, as well as the general variety of situations to be faced, alternating between stealth and combat phases, are appreciable. Nothing particularly original, but easily manageable without excessive headaches. Technically, the work done is competent, but not outstanding: the polygonal engine is sufficiently fluid, even if there are sporadic drops in framerate, but not particularly rich or defined in the texture / lighting sector. The overall result is not even remotely close to the photorealism of the Ubisoft title, more reminiscent of a clumsy and colorful comic in the characterizations of the characters. On the other hand, there are pleasant aesthetic touches in the scenarios, such as the fireworks in the first level, and the zoom on Ethan's corpse as a tragic consequence of the mission failure, equipped with a much more incisive scenic effect than other productions. Comment They're all Sam Fisher's children, yes, but the 128-bit Mission Impossible seems to take this relationship too seriously, bordering on plagiarism, but without ever replicating its depths. Awareness or limit? For our part, we believe it is a real shame to find the prestigious Paradigm grappling with a markedly alimentary work, not without bugs attributable to a hasty realization for the holidays. Ultimately nothing more than a B-series production dressed for big occasions, but which adequately respects its users. In any case, lovers of the film series will find more than one reason for satisfaction, for all the others a good ~light~ and complementary stealth game, assuming they have already played Splinter Cell... Otherwise, there are really no excuses. Pros: Decent graphics, but without flashes Good soundtrack Easily accessible Cons: Limited interaction Very linear Some bugs ~My name is Sam, Sam Fisher.~ We will have to wait a little longer for his return, on the other hand we have Ethan Hunt who is proposed as a replacement. You understood very well, we are talking about the protagonist played by Tom Cruise in the film adaptation of the famous spy show, that Mission Impossible arguably adapted to the canons of today's action movie. But here we are talking about video games, and a spy movie can best express itself in the playful field only with the language of stealth games, and what is the pinnacle of the genre?
