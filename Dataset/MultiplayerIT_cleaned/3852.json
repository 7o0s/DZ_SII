{"name": "Forged Fantasy", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/forged-fantasy-recensione.html", "text": "Forged Fantasy re-proposes the now classic formula of many productions by Hothead Games, a Canadian development team that has been able to raise the genre of cover shooters for iOS and Android towards new quality standards. However, it does so in a different way than usual, aiming for a fantasy setting and ranging between particularly evocative scenarios, very well differentiated from each other, in which a terrible war takes place between the forces of good and those of evil. From this point of view, the tutorial is somewhat destabilizing: the first hero at our disposal is a warrior who wields a two-handed broadsword and who fights by slashing at the first targets that come within range, in a sequence of blows in which basically whoever has the highest attack and defense values wins, without involving the player's skills in any way and indeed presenting a semi-automatic approach, not very interactive and even less fun. Fortunately, however, additional protagonists are immediately introduced who enrich the ranks of a team that can support up to five components, with the possibility of switching from one to the other at any time of the mission via a simple touch; and they are all ranged, i.e. fighters equipped with weapons such as bows, crossbows, throwing knives and even spells that strike from a distance. The bizarre mix is carried through the various levels in a captivating way, with the knight who acts a bit as an automated tank to thin out the enemy ranks and his companions who become real protagonists of the action, targeting enemies from afar using a touch control system very similar to that of the excellent Hero Hunters, with a virtual analog stick and large buttons on the right side of the screen. Gameplay and structure The similarities between Forged Fantasy and the aforementioned Hero Hunters do not stop there, however: the authors have decided to re-propose the formula whereby some enemy bosses, once defeated, become part of our roster; and in the same way the combat system also uses lateral discards which are used to dodge any attacks and avoid suffering damage, although a real scheme of shelters behind which to lurk has not been inserted. The problem is that the two souls of the game often collide, creating real chasms in terms of balancing and artificial intelligence of the opponents. In fact, it happens that you can replay the missions at a higher degree of difficulty, in order to collect richer rewards, and in doing so you have to substantially reduce the team members. Well, precisely in this area it turns out that using only ranged fighters very strange things happen on the battlefield: many enemies are completely unable to attack from a distance and remain there to be targeted, including bosses. In general, the fact of having included two different categories that do not automatically balance each other translates into a challenge that is very poor in ideas, which involves thanks to the general quality of the production but which remains ambiguous even in the more advanced stages of the campaign and beyond, among the secondary modes, which include competitive multiplayer, cooperative raids, challenges, special events and single player raids. It's a real pity that the ideas put into play don't connect perfectly, also because from a technical and artistic point of view Forged Fantasy really has nothing to be reproached for, on the contrary: the polygonal models are detailed and well animated, the settings large and inspired, the effects are very nice to look at and the fluidity of the action is impeccable on the iPhone X. All this is supported by a sound perfectly suited to the action, which accompanies the clashes effectively, while the freemium mechanisms do not give trouble for several hours: although there is an indicator of the energy of action and various references to monetization, it is possible to play for free without problems or expectations, nor do you come across rigid paywalls.", "date": "2019-01-22", "grade": "7.0"}
