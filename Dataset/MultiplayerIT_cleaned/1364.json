{"name": "Silent Scope Complete", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/silent-scope-complete.html", "text": "Silent scopes First episode of the saga, Silent Scope has the merit of introducing an innovative element in the rather rigid panorama of pistol shooters. In the role of a skilled sniper in government service, the player finds himself stationed in the most disparate places to manage his viewfinder in order to zoom only when he has to hit an enemy. The movement of the viewfinder is reasonably slow and precise when the magnification is activated, while it is faster (and imprecise) when it has to be moved from one part of the screen to another. The game takes place in one direction: the shooting position changes but not the basic concept, with the only variations represented by the (absurd) end-of-level bosses. Accuracy is rewarded both through the assignment of points and, in a realistic way, with the instant killing of even bosses through an aimed shot to the head. From mission to mission it is possible to choose alternative routes, in order to vary the playful experience from game to game. Everything sells out in a few hours, however. Silent Scope 2 Virtually identical to the prequel, it offers the theme (later revised in other titles) of the initial choice of character, which will lead the player to face enemies from different points of view, thus varying the visual experience just enough to add an element of replayability. Also in this second episode it is possible to change the route from mission to mission. Furthermore, there are situations in which you have to turn around to shoot the first terrorist who threatens our safety, from all sides. Technically there are very few changes, maybe you move a little more, with more freedom of camera, and the characters are made slightly better. Nothing transcendental, though. Silent Scope 3 Again with a single character, Silent Scope 3 has the advantage of basically containing two different games. The first is the arcade one, in which the missions are tackled in the usual way and any crossroads to follow are decided along the way; the second, however, is a sort of story mode that allows us to enter the levels of our choice, starting from a map. It is also possible to save progress, a real revolution for products of the genre. In this chapter the developers have introduced a convenient automatic aiming system (when you frame an enemy to shoot at), but also a more realistic approach to those situations in which the trajectory of the projectiles is modified by the wind or by other atmospheric factors (water, for example), which is why you need to aim intelligently and follow the curvature of the shot. Of course, in reality this curve exists and must always be contemplated, but they have not yet produced a ~Real Sniper Simulator~ (and I hope they never do, however boring it might be)... Technical analysis From the point of view of those who bought Xbox for its technical capabilities, Silent Scope Complete is clearly a mediocre product. The three episodes of the series, in fact, were packaged without any reworking. Even the most recent of them has nothing to do with what was seen on the Microsoft console, and we often find ourselves amazed at how badly some sequences or the low number of polygons on the screen have been made. The sound sector offers nothing more: the effects are average, the acting is at the classic arcade level, certainly not excellent, and there's not much else to quibble about... All three games support the light gun, a unlike what happened previously on other consoles, but personally I don't recommend buying the pistol specifically for Silent Scope Complete: the scope control becomes too imprecise, and it is an obvious thing since the arcade had a fixed rifle. Comment In accordance with its nature as a compilation, Silent Scope Complete presents itself as an attractive product for fans of the series who may have only tried the first chapter and want to take home the three titles for the price of one. It is certainly not a title recommended for those looking for depth, graphic miracles and a stimulating structure in video games. Rather, SCC is repetitive, thin, and technically poor. At the same time, however, it is an excellent representative of what is the very essence of the arcade video game: immediate, with a plot unworthy even of a Jackie Chan film, very improbable bosses and super tamarri protagonists,action-packed and idea-poor. In short, gamers might like Silent Scope Complete, especially those nostalgic for arcades and their atmosphere. Pros: Naturally immediate Three games in one. Almost four. Light gun support Cons: Light gun support Mediocre graphics Completely lacking in thickness To take advantage of a favorable moment with regard to the Xbox toy library, where light gun shooters are certainly lacking, Konami has decided to publish a collection that offers Microsoft console owners the three chapters of one of its many Arcade successes. While waiting for a possible new episode of the series, in fact, Silent Scope Complete allows you to play with three distinct shooters", "date": "2004-03-20", "grade": null}
