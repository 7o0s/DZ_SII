{"name": "Super Dragon Ball Z", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/super-dragon-ball-z-2.html", "text": "The alternative As already written in the preview phase, it seems that the Budokai Tenkaichi series has in all respects replaced the Budokai series as far as Dragon Ball games on PS2 are concerned, probably due to the new possibilities offered by a gameplay that differs from that of the classic fighting games. In agreement or not with these theories, we will still be able to return to the ~classic~ with Super Dragon Ball Z, a title whose development even involved some of the minds behind Street Fighter 2 and which therefore does not try to offer anything that is foreign to its nature : two-dimensional combat, in its simplest form. Of course, this type of formula can work in the arcade, but it is difficult to sell on PS2, especially given the average thickness of recently produced titles. So the obvious ~Versus~ and ~Z Survivor~ have been added to the classic ~Story~ mode, all three linked to a character customization system. The ~Story~ mode does not reserve any surprises, as it allows us to choose our warrior and engage in a series of fights that will culminate in the clash with Cell. The complete ~success~ of the match will determine the type of ending we will witness once defeated the dreaded green android. Nothing new even in the ~Versus~, while the ~Z Survivor~ mode is more interesting: it is neither more nor less than the classic ~survival~ in which you fight a series of single rounds against other characters while maintaining your energy bar . With two differences, however: the clashes are ten in all and not infinite, and at the end of each of them it is possible to use a sort of ~roulette~ which can make us earn dragon balls or various types of power-ups. Upgrades? Yes, the strength of the ~Z Survivor~ mode is not so much its substance as the fact that to access it it is necessary to create a character. This character must obviously be chosen among those available, but will have the ability to ~grow~ with each fight both in terms of normal skills (ability to inflict and withstand damage, energy level, resistance to fatigue, etc.) and special ones. The latter can be acquired by spending the experience points that are earned at each fight, and moreover you can choose a ~path~ that will lead your alter-ego to develop certain types of special moves instead of others. It is also possible to learn new moves by resorting to the dragon Shenron, after having collected all seven spheres: in that case we will be able to grant a wish chosen from among those that gradually become available. The power-up mechanism works really well and really adds substance to a game that otherwise couldn't have offered anything more than combat for its own sake. Furthermore, you can create more than one character at the same time, and perhaps choose which one to concentrate your efforts on depending on the repertoire of feasible moves. Speaking of characters, it must be said that in Super Dragon Ball Z the developers have made at least original choices: the miles of Goku, Chi-Chi, are immediately available and it is possible to unlock Gohan in the ~Ultimate~ version, Piccolo in the his first incarnation, Vegeta possessed by the Magician Babidi, Cell, Frieza in cyborg version and Videl. [C] Videl vs. Chichi, clash of the titans... Surprisingly, Majin Buu is also there. been included among the characters available immediately. The spectacularity of Budokai 3 is; a mirage, but something is saved. [/C] Gameplay, cross and delight That Super Dragon Ball Z falls within the vein of classic fighting games is beyond doubt. The control system proves it: two attack buttons (one light and one heavy), one for jumping (which allows us to stop in mid-air) and one for blocking, assisted by the back buttons for simplified combinations ( as in Tekken). The special moves are performed in pure ~Street Fighter~ style, or using crescents and the like, but the directional cross of the Dual Shock 2 does not lend itself too much to this kind of evolution. Using the analog stick, unfortunately, does not improve the situation. In any case, the ~substance~ is there and it shows: the collision detection is excellent and the sense of ~impact~ is clearly perceived, even if not always. The interaction of the stages, in which it is possible, for example, to hit an opponent until he breaks through the walls, helps to create frenetic clashes, in which the speed of execution can really make the difference and make one of the two contenders helpless and unable to react to the violence and speed of blows. In all this, the energy moves do not boast the spectacularity seen in Budokai 3 and are decidedly more ~human~, with a noteof ~impact~ represented only by their use to end a fight: if you finish off your opponent with a special move, a huge ~krak!~ appears in the background. and a yellow light; if, on the other hand, you end the match with a special super move, you really see a planet split in two. When you engage in challenges with friends, you can clearly point out the similarities between that orb that breaks and their backside [C] There are some really cool moves, like Piccolo's ~radio-controlled~ orb. Gohan vs. Majin Buu. In spite of some applications of the camera, the game is still very simple. basically a classic fighting game. [/C] The technical question Is Super Dragon Ball Z a good fighting game? Yes. Is Super Dragon Ball Z a good fighting game? Not exactly. The comparison with Budokai 3 and with Budokai Tenkaichi, from a technical point of view, is unfortunately merciless: on the one hand the characters of SDBZ are well made and well animated, drawing liberally from the polygonal models already prepared for the other Dragon Ball games for PS2. On the other hand, they move on backdrops that vary from sufficient to mediocre, with peaks of absolute sadness (the stage set on Namec, for example), characterized by a poor level of detail and in general by a disheartening paucity in the number of elements on screen. And the sound sector does no better, with only functional music and effects, which leave no mark. Comment While waiting for a second episode of Budokai Tenkaichi, perhaps capable of being less cumbersome and more exciting than the first, this Super Dragon Ball Z has the advantage of offering us a few hours of carefree fun in pure arcade style, with the addition of a great character customization mode and tons of unlockable extras. The clashes are pleasant, even if they cannot compete with the technique of the various Street Fighters, but the technical sector needs to be reviewed, especially in some situations. In principle, however, another good product for fans of Goku & company. Pros: Excellent customization mode Characters, moves (many) and unlockable extras Well done fights Cons: Poor locations from every point of view Anonymous music and effects The PS2 pad is not the best with crescents While waiting for the second episode of Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi, NAMCO Bandai Games has seen fit to entertain the numerous DBZ fans with the conversion of Super Dragon Ball Z, an arcade fighting game which on PS2 is enriched with new modes and extras.", "date": "2006-10-09", "grade": null}
