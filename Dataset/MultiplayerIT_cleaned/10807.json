{"name": "Holiday Sports Party - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/holiday-sports-party-recensione.html", "text": "With more than forty million copies sold worldwide, Wii Sports is the real killer application for Nintendo Wii, so much so that many ~casual~ users even end up confusing the game with the console and vice versa. It is an extremely simple and essential product, in some ways even comparable to a mere ~tech demo~ due to the lack of a real structure. Wii Sports shows the strengths and weaknesses of a control system that in over two years has been talked about more for its potential value than for that actually expressed. But let's not digress. On balance, the real problem is that neither Nintendo nor third parties have been able to continue on that path, offering users an equally simple and fun sports title but perhaps with a minimum of depth. Some have tried, of course, but the results have been mediocre. Holiday Sports Party addresses the issue from a different perspective, so not even in this case are we faced with a competitor to Wii Sports: the new Ubisoft product, in fact, offers us the beauty of eight sports which, however, have nothing to do with as seen in the Nintendo game, and indeed in some cases introduce original and imaginative practices. Family holidays The sunny holiday village of Holiday Sports Party, after the customary welcome, invites us to enter the data of our family in the hotel database. We will therefore be able to create a save slot and manage the characters we want to recreate in the game, a particularly fun practice if faced together with one's family members. A simple and intuitive editor, in many ways similar to the one for creating Mii characters, allows us to shape the avatars as we see fit, acting on facial features and clothing. Success in sporting challenges will give us access to further content in this sense, expanding the customization discourse as our family moves from the standard suite to the ~princely~ one. The tokens earned with victories can also be spent on the ~pay per view~, consisting of additional (but far from spectacular) minigames such as table football. Once the appropriate choices have been made, we will be able to return to the hotel reception to try our hand at a quick game or with the ~sports challenges~, which in fact constitute the most substantial part of the game. In any case, it is not a ~career mode~ or a tournament, but simply a series of sequential tests that see our family and another family pitted against each other, with the only prize up for grabs being tokens and from the ability to unlock new items. But what are the sports available? The first is Go Kart, in which we have to face our opponents on a circuit with the aim of crossing the finish line first. The control system sees the use of the Wii-mote horizontally, with buttons 1 and 2 for braking and accelerating, while button A is used to activate the turbo when we have collected the relative power-up on the track. Motion detection is good, even if not immediate, and the setting is typical of Wii racers. The second sport available is Disco Golf, a sort of bizarre cross between golf and Frisbee that sees us throw a plastic disc in an attempt to hit a straw target. After adjusting the ~aim~ by pointing the controller at the screen, we'll have to perform a throwing motion to shoot the Frisbee. For all tastes Then there is the dodgeball, probably the least fun discipline in the game also due to the completely manual controls: the Wii-mote d-pad to move the character and the buttons to throw the ball or pick it up. Beyond the particular name, the Paleta Frontn is nothing more than a sort of ~wall tennis~, or ~squash~, in which you have to hit the ball with the racket and try to prevent the opponent from receiving it. Unfortunately the collision detection in this case leaves a lot to be desired, with some unwatchable solutions (the character who replies while the ball is two meters above him, etc.). Darts are the classic ones, which we all know, with a board and a score to be achieved in the shortest possible time. You aim with the Wii-mote, then launch in a real way and wait for the arrow to stick in the desired area. We then move on to Air Hockey, which maybe someone already knows since it is present in many arcades: a sort of ice hockey simulation in which the player must try to push a puck into the opponent's goal. In the game this works through the Wii-mote pointing system, so the ~physicality~ of the experience and the sense ofimpact with the disc. Beach Cricket is perhaps the most complex sport among those available, given that it involves launching and batting turns as well as rather cumbersome controls. Finally, Petangue takes up the classic game of bowls: you throw a white ball and then you have to throw the following ones as close as possible to earn a point. Technical realization Being a ~family game~, Holiday Sports Party focuses on colorful, cartoony and simple graphics. The characters, in their simplicity, are certainly more complex and detailed than the Miis, and they also feature a decent set of animations. The possibility of customizing its appearance is interesting, even if it is a practice for its own sake. The locations are also very simple, differ above all in the colors and certainly do not impress with the number of polygons on the screen. From this point of view, the most spectacular sport is undoubtedly Go Kart, even if between one bend and the next one realizes all the shortcomings of the scenario, also obviously designed for ~casual~ users . Given the static nature of almost all disciplines, the graphics manage to be quite fluid and this makes it easier to control via the Wii-mote. Control that unfortunately is not always punctual, indeed in many cases it leaves something to be desired and fails in the attempt to propose a ~real time~ response to our requests. The sound sector boasts well-made Italian dialogues and a set of ~ambient~ sounds that surround the disciplines, while the music is catchy but repetitive (and conspicuously reminiscent of the theme of ~The Little Mermaid~...). Comment Holiday Sports Party is a simple, colorful product for the whole family. The genre to which a game belongs, however, cannot and must not justify its shortcomings. After all, Wii Sports belongs to the same vein, and despite all the limitations of the case, it manages to do its job very well, that is to make the most of the Wii-mote's motion detection system. It is precisely at this juncture that the Ubisoft product unfortunately accuses the blow, with some technical solutions that leave a bad taste in the mouth for how approximate they are: the ~impossible collisions~ in wall tennis, the cumbersome nature of Beach Cricket, the motion detection in bowling, etc. The idea of the holiday village and the unlockable content is nice and won't fail to win over younger and/or less demanding players, but we would hardly recommend this product to those who expect quality entertainment from even a simple ~family game~. Pros Eight different sports Good customization system Nice and colorful graphics Against The average quality of the disciplines leaves something to be desired Fairly limited gameplay Many technical solutions are inadequate", "date": "2009-03-21", "grade": null}
