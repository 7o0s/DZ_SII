A project that evidently did not give the desired results, given that with this FIFA 10 the developers have opted for a decisive turn towards a totally arcade approach. Let us now see if the imbalance towards one of the extremes of the equation has borne fruit. Renegade the past The change of direction is evident right from the start of FIFA 10. Already the look of the menus, much more colorful and casual-friendly, suggests a clear stance in favor of simplicity, which materializes as soon as you investigate a little ' deeper. As mentioned, there is no longer a division between a ~serious~ part and a more arcade one, but the entire product is based on mechanics much closer to titles such as Mario Strikers than to EA's previous works on the franchise. This can also be understood by the reduction to the essentials of the game modes: it is possible to face an exhibition match in single or multiplayer, try your hand at a tournament or in the so-called Challenge for Glory (a sort of coach mode purged of most of its more technical aspects) and finally practice in training. No more minigames, unlockable extras or 5-a-side football with Miis, nor much less big concessions given to managerial elements such as the management of formations, practically present only as a formality. In short, EA has applied the concept of a pick-and-play product to the letter, even if a little more effort in terms of the playful offer certainly wouldn't have hurt. Moving on to the graphic component, here too the change of course is quite clear: abandoning any desire to seek realism, FIFA 10 offers the eye bright colors and deliberately caricatured polygonal models, obviously complete with exaggeratedly plastic animations. A style which, if it cannot really be defined as exciting, is at least courageous and innovative, even if it does not prove sufficient to guarantee the title a noteworthy cosmetic impact: the low definition of Wii does not help, and FIFA 10 overall appears rather poor , with some flaws that will not go down to football lovers (above all the very little resemblance of the players on screen with their real counterparts). So is the sound, with a fairly flat and repetitive commentary by the award-winning company Caressa - Bergomi which is accompanied by music and effects that sometimes seem really out of place. Infernal Catapult! However, the strictly playful area in which FIFA 10 shows off all its desire for change. The first and fundamental aspect is the control system, again divided into three options put to the user's scrutiny: Remote + Nunchuck, Classic Controller or the Remote alone. The first two choices guarantee a fairly classic approach to the genre, and differ only in the arrangement of the keys and the fact that - in the first case - shooting and sliding are carried out by shaking the device. The use of the Remote only is instead intended exclusively for more casual players, with the movement of the athletes managed automatically by the CPU: ease of use is guaranteed, but in fact this system is so limiting that the gaming experience is reduced to a sort of interactive demo. Once on the pitch, the presence of a Momentum indicator immediately catches the eye, which fills up thanks to ball possession and successful passes, and which once filled allows you to perform sprints, feints, dribbles and shots with greater intensity. Precisely the latter constitute one of the most controversial aspects of this FIFA 10: there is no way to dose the power of the football, nor to give the ball a trajectory, but every single attempt results in a cannon shot a la Holly and Benji which inevitably it is bagged at the intersection of the poles. Most of the time you look for the way of the net, moreover, you have to put up with a slow-motion animation which becomes annoying already after a few games. In short, the search for spectacularity and immediacy is fine, but similar choices also contribute to stripping the game of a good part of bite. Instead, the new mechanics that regulate the execution of set pieces and penalties have been promoted: in both cases, it is necessary to shake the Remote (or press a button) in correspondence with the green area of a special indicator, in order to increase power and precision. At the same time, the goalkeeper can intercept the shot by performing the same action the instant the ball lights upna. A sort of quick time event which here too sacrifices technique in favor of usability, but which at least is fun and well implemented. In all its elements, however, FIFA 10 proves to be a decidedly unrewarding experience in single player, considering how simple it is to pierce the defenses controlled by the CPU: the situation improves if you play in company (even online, where you can also count on an unprecedented two-against-two option), it being understood that the latest addition to EA has very little to do with the sport that inspires it.", "date": "2009-10-02", "grade": "7.2"}
