{"name": "Naruto Ninja Destiny - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/naruto-ninja-destiny-recensione.html", "text": "One of the most disruptive manga phenomena of the last few years is certainly the one represented by the Naruto series, which quickly took the place of dragonball in the hearts of mangophile enthusiasts. Unfortunately, the same still cannot be said in the videogame field, where by now the annual games dedicated to Dragonball demonstrate a typical squaring of those who have done a lot of their apprenticeship, and know which points to tickle to satisfy even the most demanding players. The immature naruto in video game version has instead spent the last few years experimenting with solutions, going from the clash series (one step away from perfection, but never really considered as a fighting game with technical depth), to the excellent hybrid-rpg for xbox 360 up to the strictly 2D versions for gba and DS. But it's time for the series to take another step towards maturity and transform the last remnants of two-dimensional sprites into not too complex cel-shaded polygons, the time has finally come for all DS owners for their first portable Naruto in 3D version. Warning: spoilers Naruto Ninja Destiny - this is the name of the last born in the Tomy house - starts immediately after the exam in the forest of death which represents the first, fundamental stage of a ninja's journey to become chuunin. The entire game examines a good portion of what is the history of the manga already published in Italy, starting precisely from what is the final exam for chuunin and reaching up to the choice of Tsunade (one of the three legendary ninjas together with Jiraya and Orochimaru) to become the Fifth Hokage. The ways in which this Naruto divides the gaming experience do not escape the foundations of the genre, with a story mode that follows the story of Naruto & Co. already narrated on manga and anime, a mode vs. cpu and finally a wireless mode for two willing game cartridge owners. The story mode, as previously mentioned, starts from the chuunin exam and puts the player in the role of the various characters of the game (naruto, sasuke, shikimaru, jiraya, tsunade, orochimaru and so on) depending on what is the narrative phase you are going through. By completing one battle after another, we then reach the final battle of Naruto against Orochimaru, to convince Tsunade to become the fifth Hokage and thus return to the service of the leaf village. unfortunately it is in the narrative structure that Naruto Ninja Destiny has the biggest flaws The game controls definitely aim for simplicity rather than relying on complex key combinations: B and Y are entrusted with attack hits, X is used to jump while pressing A is used to use the player's signature chakra-based move character you are using, the backbones L and R are instead respectively used to take advantage of the particular move that moves your character behind the opponent and to parry. As if that weren't enough, on the touch screen the player can find 6 particular 'cards' useful to support his character in battle: chakra increase, energy increase, opponent's chakra block, defense and concentration increase, each card is specific for certain moments of the fight and to be exploited strategically to achieve victory. Unfortunately, however, all this only works on paper, and in reality the limited difficulty leads players to victories that are decidedly not very sweaty and tactical, where all that matters is to press the buttons dedicated to the attack indiscriminately until the chakra bar is filled and thus freeing his own power capable of draining in most cases well over half the opponent's energy bar. As if the poor calibration of the special moves weren't enough, often and willingly to successfully complete one's mission it is enough to continuously use the L backbone, automatically moving to the opponent's back to land him with a painful combo of moves. If the game controls due to their excessive simplicity prove to be the cross and delight of the game, it is in the narrative structure that Naruto Ninja Destiny presents the biggest flaws. In fact, if at first glance the many volumes of the comic examined to compose what is in fact the main mode of the game - the story mode - could foreshadow several hours of gameplay, in reality Naruto Ninja Destiny in all its difficulty level fails to offer more than 2 hours of poor gameplay, with a narrative structure that is most often hasty and skips entire parts evidently deemed superfluous or unattractive for a fighting game. In addition to the actual poor longevity issue, one of the things it probably weighs ofmore on the chosen narrative line, it is the choice of the programmers to put the player in situations with an already written ending; simplifying things a lot, it is good to remember that Naruto is a comic, and as such it has an already written story made up of winners and losers that is difficult to get around, and it happens several times during the adventure to be forced to gameplay to win your fight, only to undergo the next cutscene in which we see that the victory obtained on the field is sacrificed on the altar of the correct narrative line. In purely graphic terms, Naruto Ninja Destiny does not make you cry out for a miracle but still proves that it does not deserve attention thanks to the well-crafted character animations and above all to a granite framerate that does not suffer from any slowdown, favoring frenetic game action. The use of cel-shading winks at the Clash series released in recent years on home consoles, duly adapted to the limited 3D potential of Nintendo's portable. The sound system, on the other hand, does not record particular points of note: the developers have decided to eliminate any trace of voice over from the game, leaving the game action to be underlined by the soundtrack alone several times tending to monotony. Naruto Ninja Destiny is a fundamentally naive game: although it manages to come up with a series of good ideas and insights that are certainly to be taken into account for the next chapters, it often gets lost in a glass of water, both as regards iteration between played and narrated that as regards the pure and simple fighting game structure, often and willingly too simplified even just for a game more devoted to fun than to technique. The fact remains that the game has been able to take the good of Clash of the Ninja and bring it to a portable version, with the interesting (but too unburdened) insertion of objects on the touch screen as a support to the battles. Pros The inclusion of objects accessible with the touch screen is interesting Good foundations for the future Cons Very little story mode longevity Very unconvincing and botched narrative structure The game controls need to be perfected and balanced", "date": "2008-03-26", "grade": null}
