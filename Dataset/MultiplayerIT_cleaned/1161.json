{"name": "Beyond Divinity", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/beyond-divinity.html", "text": "Comment Beyond Divinity will certainly conquer all the players who have spent (like me hehe) hours and hours on Diablo and Baldur's Gate, while not fascinating with an innovative plot but having fun and providing a very, very complete character management system. It should also be noted that the levels are not very imaginative but really huge and BD is not finished in an afternoon! Unfortunately for us, the Italian version of the game will not have (according to the Larians themselves) the beautiful little book in English by Rhianna Pratchett entitled Child of the Chaos, which I'm sure will become a gem for collectors! Once the bugs still present have been identified and fixed (nothing a good patch can't do), this Beyond Divinity will be able to give many hours of fun. Waiting for the return of Richard Gariott, this Beyond Divinity could be a valid RPG. Pros: Excellent character management Huge game worlds Cons: Graphically only discreet Gameplay without innovations or elements that distinguish it Thunder and lightning! The graphic style won't make you scream at the miracle but you can't object to the spectacularity in the most excited moments of the action, with spells, demonic creatures and weapons as you can't. The isometric graphics combined with a sometimes not ~happy~ location design makes it difficult to identify useful and sometimes indispensable objects for the purpose of the adventure. However, it should be noted that the graphics engine used by the Larians for this sequel is the same that moved the first chapter Divine Divinity more than two years ago... Fire and flames! The animations are cured both as regards the ~main character~ and as regards the hostile creatures. The effects generated by the casting of spells and those already present in the environment live up to the title and manage to create a sense of spectacularity on the screen. The design of the ~portraits~ among which we will choose our ~virtual face~, all rather woody and not very expressive, seemed to me not particularly inspired, but this is really a trifle for the record. Spells in BD are wasted and the effects related to fire are truly noteworthy. The Soulforged That's what I mean by a five-story demon wanting to bite my head off First point: you are ~the good~. Second point: You would do anything to eradicate evil from the world and defeat the darkness. Third point: due to an unpleasant spell by a powerful demon, you find yourself in a parallel dimension, which is already unpleasant and moreover linked in fate with a DeathKnight. Not bad as a start... The Belgians Larian Studios try again and after the good results of the first Divine Divinity weblog 2002 they give us this Beyond Divinity where as already anticipated we will be called to wear the role of a paladin who tries to fight the Forces of Darkness. Then, due to a spell cast by a powerful demon, our poor character finds himself body and soul bound to a DeathKnight in an unknown universe. Since this demon knows as much as you do about this whole matter and not even he is enthusiastic about it, the only way out will be to file the differences of orientation and join efforts to dissolve the spell. The plot in some ways recalls those films where two antithetical characters are forced to collaborate forcibly ... With Beyond Dvinity Larian Studios offer us a rather well-finished action Rpg even if we certainly cannot say that it is an innovative product in the face of a plot solid but somewhat predictable. The real strengths of this title lie in the vast customization possibilities of your two characters (really high) and in the effective and fun gameplay. Fun, here is the right word to describe this Beyond Divinity: while everyone strives to squeeze the maximum graphics cards and processors, the Larians focus on isometric graphics and are more concerned with giving us something to have fun with which, not a small thing, allows many hours of gameplay being characterized by a very large explorable area. At the beginning of our adventure we will be asked to create our brave hero, choosing between a man, a woman and even a boy. As already mentioned, our character is bound body and soul to the DeathKnight so it seems obvious to me to say that if he dies, it's ~Game Over~ for you too. This factor adds the need for careful handling of situations at the expense of a more hack-and-slash approach. All that glitters is not gold... Reading what I wrote you might think that Beyond Divinity is an experience that can be exhausted without problems: well, unfortunately that's not all. The graphics do not cry out to the miracle ma is simple enough to encourage action The game suffers from some bugs that I'm sure will be fixed with future patches but we can't even close our eyes to problems such as the interpenetration between characters and environments or, even worse, the disappearance of objects from the inventory that are essential to the game. However, I am convinced that the development team will take very little time to notice these flaws and fix them. The level design is certainly vast, and ~rich~ in objects and points of interaction, but a very limited chromatic palette penalizes everything. Furthermore, I was not favorably impressed by the spoken English which at times is not very effective. The DeathKnight's voice and his speech rather than frighten and give that sense of ~evil~, snatch more than a smile ... Although the longevity of the title is a more than positive factor, I did not find the level of difficulty well calibrated it appears immediately as rather demanding in relation to our equipment. All of this adds depth to the gameplay but at the same time creates a barrier for the first-time RPG player to choose BD. Suddenly dying is a rather frequent (and frustrating) thing at the beginning of the story, when we are rather weak: fortunately, with the passage of time and the improvements to our equipment, this problem is easily resolved. Let's work together In Beyond Divinity it will be, as already mentioned, essential to learn to collaborate. One of the main differences from the Divine Divinity which previously caused a certain uproar lies precisely in the fact that if in the prequel we were alone against the enemy, now we have two characters available. Both the ~good~ and the Deathknight are fully customizable, which means that there will not be a character guided by us and the other by the game's AI, but we will have a free hand on all parameters, including various equipment, weapons, protections , assorted items and last but not least, spells. To give you an example, at the beginning of the game you will find yourself in a gloomy prison where you will make the ritual introductions with the Deathknight, who in ways that are anything but polite will ~invite~ you to collaborate to get out of that unhealthy place. Collaboration becomes important the moment you realize that your arsenal is embarrassing nothing! At this point all that remains is to work on a strategy and have the character dedicated to ~evil~ fight while you try to equip yourself as best you can. These choices and these situations occur several times in the course of history and sometimes also involve giving up on equipment. Remember that if one of the two characters dies, the other will follow the same path automatically. But what a mess!!! Do you remember the nice Diablo 2 inventory? Tidy, precise even if not huge... do you remember that? Well now forget it for Beyond Divinity! The guys at Larian have made the most chaotic and confusing inventory since Ultima Online. A real chaos where objects overlap each other and where finding an amulet or a key is like looking for a needle in a haystack... I think this is the only aspect of an interface that otherwise would not would have nothing negative...

Remember that if one of the two characters dies, the other will follow the same path automatically. Skills and Battlefields and Rules... A few words must also be spent on the skill system that includes primfirst of all a vast range from which to choose and secondly the possibility of creating your own and personalized ones. The Unlearn Skill function is interesting, with which you can free up experience points to be assigned to other skills. Larian speak of 300 different skills from which to draw to enhance our two characters, so the progress from the first Divine Dinivity which had about a hundred is clear. Really many that, obviously, it will be difficult to get to use in full. Remarkable at least for the first hours of the game, is the presence of Battlefields: these ~battlefields~ are arenas where we can make our two alter egos fight and exercise. This is remarkable as it allows us to improve both in the use of the interface and the commands (we all know how difficult it is to navigate the menus relating to spells when a five-story tall demon tries to feast on our heads...), and power up our heroes for some tougher ~real~ fights. The Battlefields are intended only and exclusively as Ultima Online dungeons, or places where we can enhance and enrich our PG. Furthermore, in the Battlefields we will find several sub-quests to deal with, all quite canonical but well done of the type ~find object, bring object~ but not only. BattleFields are sometimes the only way to get out of dead ends: imagine that you have come in front of an enemy that is too strong for you at present, catapulting you into this parallel dimension, the Battlefields in fact, you can practice and gain the little strength you it will allow you not to be immediately destroyed by the monster. In any case, it will be necessary to manage the strategic part well from the beginning of the game in order not to run into unpleasant situations with obvious differences between the characters. The creation of your own character is quite complex even if we can classify it as a Warrior, a Magician or a thief / adventurer hybrid. You can develop the skills and characteristics of the two characters separately, which means that it is possible to orient one character more towards hand-to-hand combat and the other towards using spells. The fights are fast and quite spectacular and the opponents are certainly not there to get killed, so action, strategy, fire and flames. It is also possible to pause the action during the most agitated fights to allow our two PCs to change tactics, modify the equipment and last but not least, to prepare regenerative potions, both for health and for Mana. Another feature not to be underestimated concerns the possibility of summoning creatures to fight for us. Think about when you summoned dozens of skeletal wizards to fight the hordes of enemies in Diablo 2 with your necromancer, while he stood on the sidelines enjoying the show...Back to BD, here too you can summon different creatures which will help you in the fights and which will give greater complexity to the clashes.", "date": "2004-10-28", "grade": null}
