The game has therefore constantly changed registers, production values, control systems and so on, even abandoning a classic sales model two years ago to marry the more popular formula of free to play. A sequence of choices that have caused a constant decline in quality of the series, a process that now comes to a sad conclusion with the here present FIFA Mobile. In FIFA Mobile you spend and unpack, but you play little and badly Blessed are the ultimates Continuing on the path traced by the last two episodes of the series, FIFA Mobile also offers in fact only the Ultimate Team mode, denying users the possibility of playing as their favorites: one is therefore forced to start with a team made up of illustrious unknowns, unlocking gradually of the packages that integrate new forces in their staff. It goes without saying that anyone who has never felt a visceral love for this specific mode will hardly change their mind thanks to FIFA Mobile, which indeed adds the well-known - and often unpleasant - dynamics of free to play to the equation: in addition to the inevitable in-app purchases and the dual currency pay system also peeps out a new energy indicator which frankly was not missed, which decreases with each game and which must be fleshed out by spending credits or waiting for the time necessary to recharge. Really many limitations for a title which, when the action moves to the playing field, demonstrates a qualitative paucity hitherto unknown to the EA franchise in its already not very brilliant career in the mobile sector. The unpleasant sensation is that of being faced with a product made on the cheap, primarily from a technical point of view, thanks to absolutely mediocre graphics (especially as regards the polygonal models of the athletes) and sound effects that can be counted on the fingers of a hand. Not that the gameplay behaves better, of course: the defects of the previous episodes recur here further exacerbated, above all the incredibly ~slippery~ and unresponsive behavior of the players, which prevents both from pressing the ball carrier satisfactorily in defensive phase, and above all to set up an attacking action worthy of the name. After being (rightly) trashed in last year's edition, then, the control system via tactile gestures makes an inexplicable return, optional but capable of getting worse with each release. Making an effort to see the glass half full, it can be said that the poor performance of FIFA Mobile on the field does not have even such an imposing weight in the global evaluation of the product, given that there is very little room for football played: despite the presence of leagues, leagues and various challenge modes, the focus is all on compulsive unpacking, at least made easier by an interface that does a much more effective job than the counterpart from the last chapter. However, it is difficult to be enthusiastic about a product that is too shallow to be considered a full-fledged managerial one and lacks the fundamental elements to satisfy the appetites of those who would only like to kick a ball four times. A striking aspect of how totally out of focus FIFA Mobile is in the new Attack mode, which is a clumsy attempt to provide the title with a sort of asynchronous multiplayer: essentially, you only play a certain number of actions in the offensive phase in an attempt to achieve the as many goals as possible, to then wait for the opponent's results and determine the winner. A solution that can be good for Madden NFL Mobile (the first title to exploit this dynamic), but which has very little to do with football.", "date": "2016-10-20", "grade": "5.0"}
