{"name": "Neverwinter Nights: Orde dal sottosuolo", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/neverwinter-nights-orde-dal-sottosuolo.html", "text": "The threat comes from underground Hordes from the Underdark picks up right where Shadows Of Undrentide left off, although the story was also created for those who don't own it (although some prestige classes and some talents remain exclusive to SoU), thus providing only vague hints of the adventures previously experienced by the protagonist and catapulting him directly to the center of this new adventure. The only element that binds the two plots together, leads back to a magical object, which in the previous expansion was found just towards the end of the game and which turned out to be necessary for the success of the main mission, even if its real powers remained hidden from the eyes of the player, who will be able to slowly reveal them instead by venturing into the world of HotU.Initially, in fact, this object will perform the same function previously provided by the teleportation stone in Nwn, and the ring entrusted to us by our mentor in SoU. Unlike these, however, we will have the possibility of marking specific points in the game world, up to a maximum of five, where we can be teleported at any time (at the cost, however, of a charge, which we will be provided in limited numbers), consequently making it very easy to move through the key points of the game or to return to the trustee of a submission in progress, and effectively reducing those moments in which it was necessary to travel on foot for entire locations. The story is presented as yet another cry for help from a city in trouble, Waterdeep in this case, which has recently suffered the invasion of drow, who live underground. If, in fact, until recently the road to the surface was barred to them, barred by an underground labyrinth located right between the abyss of the subsoil and Waterdeep, property of a mage who is said to be mad and immortal, now it seems that the drow have found a way to get back to the surface, putting the entire city at great risk. The threat comes from underground This time the adventure presents itself in epic characters right from the start, given that as soon as we have taken control of our character, we will immediately acquire a sufficient amount of experience to take us directly to the fifteenth level (unrealistic but necessary in the case of those who, not owning SoU, they are forced to create a character from scratch), or even we can start from an even higher level, choosing to use a previously created character, and suitably trained during the previous adventures which can reach up to the fortieth level, the cap of HotU. We will thus have the opportunity to immediately observe, with the introductory film, the new camera system adopted in this new expansion, which, although it remains graphically not excellent, especially now that the graphics engine is starting to have a few years of age, it proves to be a pleasant innovation and will certainly surprise us positively. After watching the animated scene, fortunately we will wake up at the right time, in trouble right away, just as we are being robbed of our possessions. We will be able to get the better of the thief who will then try to assassinate us, but although our assailant now lies dead at our feet, it seems that with the aid of magic he has still managed to make our things disappear. After a brief conversation with some mercenaries who came to help the city just like us, and the manager of the inn who hosted us, we will suffer a new attack by a squad made up of numerous drow and duergar, their allies. Once rejected, we will lose consciousness following a further surprise attack, while the other mercenaries will chase the enemy into the depths of the underground labyrinth. When we finally regain our senses, we will have to prepare ourselves in the best possible way and we too will begin the descent into the abyss of the subsoil... The creation of the hero The creation of the heroAs previously mentioned, we will have the opportunity to create our character starting from the first level, making it possible, thanks to the immediate advancement up to the fifteenth, to immediately experiment with the different combinations made possible thanks to what is added by the expansion in terms of prestige classes, talents, skills, weapons and various magical items. However, it should be noted that some of these innovations have not been implemented in their entirety in accordance with the third edition of the D&;;d rules from which the game is inspired , in some cases, either due to the limitations of the engine that moves the game, for balancing reasons, for the use of a real-time and not turn-based combat system, or for other reasons, modifications were necessaryhe to some prestige classes, skills, talents and spells, or even the non-implementation of some characteristics of these. However, all this certainly does not undermine the vastness and quality of the new content, which if you are willing to turn a blind eye to some of these small alterations, will make even D&;;d purists pleased. First example of all, starting with the prestige classes: the Red Dragon Disciple, reserved exclusively for those able to manipulate magic in an innate way (sorcerers and bards ), which with advancing levels will allow us to cultivate the powers of a red dragon. We will earn bonuses to strength, we will develop the ability to spit a cone of fire, up to the so-called ~dragon apotheosis~ from which the growth of a real pair of wings, which we will not be able to use to fly as in a D&;;d campaign on paper, but which in any case are very well animated and beautiful to look at. Among others: the Palemaster, a necromancer able to replace his arm with an undead prosthesis, which he then uses as a weapon, together with the ability to summon all kinds of creatures from the underworld; the Dwarven Defender, a solid fighter, exceptional in defensive techniques; the Champion Of Torm, a warrior dedicated to destroying the enemies of Torm's church and mythical beasts with his divine powers; the Weapon Master, able to establish a sort of empathy with the weapon of his choice and reach such a level of affinity with it, as to make it lethal in close combat thanks to its deadly blows; finally the Shifter, a druid who has focused his training on shape mutation, capable of transforming into some of the most fearsome beasts at will. Always remaining in numerical terms we will be able to experiment with over 50 new talents, among which they will their appearance epic ones, more than 40 new spells, and 16 monsters. Even the eye wants its part From an aesthetic point of view, some improvements have been implemented, not only in terms of quantity of textures and new tilesets, which enrich the game scenario with greater variety and improve the already wide possibilities offered by the powerful toolsets to create of the new campaigns, with new settings, but also from a purely cosmetic point of view. First of all, in fact, it will be nice to know that if the cloaks have unfortunately not yet been implemented because they are not feasible, the wizard and monk tunics have been added . Furthermore, with the advent of the free camera we will now be able to observe the sky in all its splendor assisted by the always excellent effects of light and shadows that the graphics engine still manages to offer. To emphasize all this, some of the new skills of the game come in handy, such as for example those to customize weapons and armor, which allow you to model the shape and the chromatic colors of the metals used, packages will also be sold containing the necessary to color our dresses and therefore make our character more visually satisfying. With the advent of new talents, new animations have also become necessary, supplementary to the remaking of the previous ones, and to the increase in polygons for each model. Unfortunately, however, the new animations have aroused conflicting opinions, since they are less fluid than the previous ones, less harmonious overall. Precisely for this reason, a file created by a player appeared on the Bioware forum, which replaces the new animations with the old ones, while preserving the unpublished ones absent in the original title, thus satisfying everyone's tastes (even if it is not an official file, it is not supported by Bioware). Finally, a series of racial traits such as tails, horns and wings was created to allow Tieflings, Demons and so on to be properly represented, consequently allowing the graphic creation of any race using the toolset included in the game. don't forget the multitude of new portraits and additional faces to make our character even more unique in appearance, but above all the new music composed by Jeremy Soule, always pressing and majestic as he has accustomed us up to this part. Endless descent The whole adventure will include a progressive advancement in the maze of the subsoil, up to the heart of it, where we will be able to visit the cities inhabited by the most dangerous races of the Forgotten Realms. As it was also in Neverwinter Nights, the first moments of the game they are not the happiest. With the excuse of the danger of further attacks by the drow, the city has been declared in a state of siege, therefore outside the inn where our peregr beginsinare and a couple of small shops outside of it, we will not be given the opportunity to visit it and engage in any kind of conversation with anyone, outside of a couple of secondary NPCs, from which we will, however, be able to extrapolate a vague hint of the stories previously lived in the first expansion and in Neverwinter Nights. As soon as we arrive at the entrance to the underground labyrinth, we will be greeted by a goblin terrified by the sudden and sudden change of life underground. It seems in fact that the great wizard who regulated its functioning and the creatures that inhabited it, have disappeared, and thus an internal struggle has begun between the local monsters, to take control of them. Naturally the little being will ask for our help, and we will be free to get rid of it at our complete discretion. Initially, the exploration will be able to maintain a good degree of interest, the traps will turn out to be well arranged so as to punish the rash ones, the doors and the secret passages will be present in good number, but there will be some moments in particular to make the stay in the labyrinth pleasant, such as the meeting with the mercenaries met at the inn, which will turn out to be the ones also present in Nwn. Thanks to a magic wand , able to resurrect the dead, of which we have been given a gift, we will be able to resurrect ourselves, our comrade in arms precluding its use as cannon fodder, since it was enough to return to the temple, in the base game , to find it safe and sound, repeating the operation dozens of times without problems. Obviously the charges of the magical instrument in our possession will instead be limited, forcing us to be more careful during the combat phases. Unfortunately, however, after these very first phases worthy of praise, we will find ourselves facing what is probably to be considered the most boring part of the expansion, except for other sporadic details at the level of the one previously described. In fact, the fun will decrease considerably, as will the quality of the labyrinth, present only in flashes, where by now boring puzzles recycled dozens of times will dominate, and where we will have further confirmation of Bioware's love for the number four, given that if in Nwn we had to recover the four creatures for the cure, and in SoU we had to recover the four artifacts (although fortunately it was not mandatory to find them all and above all we could do with them what we wanted with the exception of the one necessary for the story ), here in Hordes from the Underground we will have the opportunity to experience the enigma of the four keys, the enigma of the four chains and so on. Fortunately, starting from the last stages of the first chapter until the end of the expansion, the situation will definitely change for the better, the story will begin to emerge more and more clearly and become interesting in the eyes of the player, and a series of twists will contribute to the success of it. In fact, although the subsoil has already been widely used in Baldurs Gate II and in the two Icewind Dale, we will finally have the opportunity, starting from the second chapter, to visit a drow city, and finally change the perspectives after an entire chapter spent slashing and avoiding traps in the labyrinth from which we have come. Here we will be given numerous choices on how to act, we will have a couple of evil opportunities to twist the story, and even a new surprise ending, for those who can find it, while we are still halfway through the game. The last chapter will instead be a very welcome surprise, taking us in fact, in contrast to its predecessors, towards the best ending achieved in the whole series, which will reflect the, unfortunately few, moments in which our choices will influence the story, and which will take place in another plane, which will make Planescape Torment fans happy. This last part of the game, although it remains mainly dedicated to fighting and exploration, especially towards the end, is still excellently done, contains numerous submissions, which must be solved, at least in part, without the aid of violence, and which will ensure that we can recover the same information we need from several characters (in different ways of course, thus allowing all characters to recover it in the way they prefer ), giving importance to many non-player characters and making conversations with them highly profitable. Endless descent Epic violence Fortunately or unfortunately depending on your tastes, the fulcrum of the game will however remain combat, where unfortunately we won't find much entertainment, due to a bad balance and the excessive repetitiveness of the method with which they will take place.
