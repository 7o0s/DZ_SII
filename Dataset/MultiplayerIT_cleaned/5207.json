Until November 7, the first chapter can be downloaded for free on PC and Android, while the complete five-episode series can be purchased in full for 22.99. The text contains some plot spoilers. There is little to envy to Batman, especially in the guise that Telltale Games is showing us within its series on bat man. As if being forced to fight against the usual bad guys who want to take over Gotham City wasn't enough, the ~poor~ Bruce Wayne must also deal with heavy revelations about his family, which came with devastating effects to shake his role as unblemished hero. As in the two previous chapters, Realm of Shadows and Children of Arkham, the developers also continued in New World Order to play with the world of Batman, effectively mixing elements that have become classics with ideas designed for the occasion. The result is a story that, as we have already said, is able to involve even the most ardent fans of the Dark Knight, brought together with all the others to deal with the events following the attack on Harvey Dent. While the latter is forced to meet his inevitable destiny and Two-Face therefore begins to make himself known together with his inseparable currency, the past of Bruce Wayne's parents continues to hold court, even within Wayne Enterprises where discontent is spreading. . Without going too far in revealing the plot of New World Order, we can say that it is a transitional chapter, a little slower than its predecessors. Arrived exactly halfway through the story, however, it was reasonable to expect it as an obligatory step, to ensure that the plot develops in the direction conceived by Telltale. The clashes that will resolve the issue in the last two episodes promise to be rather unpredictable, especially in light of the twists developed by the developers in these first three chapters. Despite a somewhat slow start, New World Order presents a final crescendo, leaving the figure of Batman once again aside for most of its duration, obviously more devoted to action than Wayne. Ample space therefore for the political intrigues that grip Gotham, while the group of criminals known as the Children of Arkham acquires more and more power in the city. Among those who pay the consequences of all this, we also find Bruce Wayne himself. Batman and Bruce Wayne against an enemy to be discovered, in episode 3 of Batman: The Telltale Series! Everything as always Apart from the Crowd Play gimmick to play Batman: The Telltale Series in ~multiplayer~, also for this series the team based in San Rafael has shown that it does not want to stray too far from the game mechanics that distinguish its adventures. The phases in which we control Bruce Wayne are rather piloted, really at the limits of a walking simulator in which we have only apparent freedom of choice, to be exercised before the game reaches one of the key points studied by the screenwriters. As for Batman, however, we continue to see fights linked to quick time event sequences, very well done by Telltale also thanks to the arrival of a new enemy with a rather particular weapon. Compared to the second episode, the investigative part returns, in which we have to connect various elements present on the screen to reconstruct what happened in our absence in a certain place. However, the puzzle is so simple that defining it as such is really exaggerated, and it's a shame because in this way the risk is that it will be seen only as an obstacle. Unfortunately, we report a new deterioration in the game's performance, at least on Xbox One where the number of frames per second proved to be quite a dancer. It's a problem that has several consequences, from speech out of sync to cut animations where the player would interact with the controller, preventing him from making a selection. On the dubbing front, the performances of the various characters seemed quite convincing to us, especially as regards Harvey Dent struggling with his split personality.", "date": "2016-10-27", "grade": "7.2"}
