It is a first-person adventure belonging to the ~walking simulator~ sub-genre, therefore a real interactive story with bland and essential gameplay elements, inserted exclusively for the purpose of the narration, along the lines of what was seen in Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter or Dear Esther. The protagonist of the story, Edith Finch, is a girl who returns after a few years to the house that has belonged to her family for generations; to be precise since his great-grandfather Odin built it, following a disastrous sea transfer from Norway which left the remains of their previous home on a shoal. The Finch family was a troubled family in the 1800s and unfortunately changing towns hasn't improved things, as evidenced by the crowded cemetery in front of the mansion. However, every missing person hides a story, as we will be able to discover through a fascinating journey through the secrets of our relatives. What Remains of Edith Finch is a unique, surprising, touching title Family business What Remains of Edith Finch is stylistically wonderful: it is a product that rests on very solid foundations of aesthetic research and innovative visual solutions, which perhaps explains why it took so long to complete the project. Each environment has its own personality, a distinctive design, different shades and a wealth of elements that does not, however, appear overflowing. The very first stages see us reaching the house and discovering that the key in our possession does not open the front door, but something else: after having forced our way through a door for cats on the back, we will discover a whole series of imaginative steps secrets that are unlocked precisely with the key that has been given to us, through the opening of animated books and diaries that hide locks and sliding doors. There are no other ways to visit the many rooms of our deceased loved ones, since all the doors have been sealed, perhaps to prevent memories from taking off. The exploration takes place slowly and it is not possible to rush, but it rarely makes you uncomfortable: the story goes hand in hand with Edith's movements, painting a textual narration in Italian in the air and on the surfaces that accompanies the oral one, beautifully rendered in English. An original solution as it has been implemented by the developers, who have played with it, experimented and reached conclusions of great impact, while always maintaining an underlying refinement that is difficult to find in other games, even the ones we mentioned at the beginning . In short, Edith Finch's experience stands as a synthesis of the other walking simulators in many respects: on the one hand, the adventure does not last more than two hours, a very tight timing indeed if compared to the sale price; on the other hand, there are no long, boring pauses that marked the albeit very valid dialogues of Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, however net of an equally dense plot. What remains of us The misadventures of great-grandfather Odin, told through a simple sequence of frames, are in fact nothing compared to what happened to his children and grandchildren. Very sad and mysterious stories that Giant Sparrow has had the ability to tell in a unique way, through a sequence of simple but inspired and terribly original minigames, although in some cases the gameplay reveals the cards of an approximate realization. This is particularly noticeable at the very beginning of the adventure, when we retrace the story of little Molly and her vivid dream in which she first becomes a cat, then an owl, then a shark and finally a huge sea monster, always preying on to dreadful hunger. Edges that however are welcome if you consider the extravagance of what is shown on the screen: sometimes closed and brief situations, sometimes wider and more multifaceted, with variable degrees of freedom and movement, but never punitive or frustrating; it is no coincidence that game over is a concept that has not touched the authors in the slightest. Each story therefore arises as an experience in itself, and once the game is completed, while aware of having remained glued to the screen without a moment of boredom or hesitation, accompanied by a truly wonderful and highly inspired soundtrack, one legitimately wonders if the developers could have enriched these watertight compartments with further elements, in order to increase the overall duration of the product. We will never know the answer, aware that dfaced with titles of this kind, everyone is right: both those who expect a minimum of gameplay from a video game, and those who consider What Remains of Edith Finch too short a story in relation to the price, and finally those who will find it hard to keep a tear when we get to the end credits.", "date": "2017-04-26", "grade": "8.5"}
