{"name": "Manhunt", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/manhunt-2.html", "text": "Only You only against everyone The new game from Rockstar Games arrives in the Xbox version, already with the fame of a much discussed title. The reason is immediately said: the violence, so much, deliberately gratuitous and highly spectacular, which required the game sticker reserved for adults only. We can only agree with this choice, but it is right that you know that Manhunt, as heinous as it is, is a game capable of arousing intense emotions and taking the action-stealth genre to high levels. We will find ourselves in the shoes of James Earl Cash, a prisoner sentenced to capital punishment, who, incredibly, instead of dying, wakes up in a place unknown to him, known as Carcer City, and with a voice in his head that tells him: ~ Don't worry, we gave you another chance!. It is not his conscience that speaks to him, but it is the voice of a madman, a snuff movie director (films in which one witnesses a live death), who wants to create the greatest show ever seen, of which we are the protagonists. The problem is that we are not alone, following the instructions given to us by the ~Director~ Starkweather, we will have to go through the different areas of the set, avoiding the numerous gangs of delinquents that we will find on our way. We will experience the game through very cinematic shots: in fact, our entire journey is constantly followed by the cameras and the 8 mm-style cutscenes will give us the impression of truly being in a film. We will be alone against everyone and our only hope of salvation will be to go unnoticed, evading surveillance, making targeted ambushes to hunters, transforming us from prey into executioners. Manhunt, in this, differs a lot from the film mentioned in our preface, in which Schwarzenegger, in his own way, went ahead like a tank, destroying what he found in his path, without worrying about acting in the shadows. Earl will be able and will have to use different moves to act in silence and decide the path to take, the most famous is certainly the Solid Snake one, which, backed to the wall, allows us to observe behind it without being seen. The killing component is fundamental and, fortunately, we will be helped in this by the three types of weapons that we will encounter: the non-reusable ones, such as the glass splinter, the smaller ones that can be used several times, such as knives, and the devastating but quite noisy ones like baseball bats. Direct confrontation is almost always not recommended, given the resistance of the opponents and their numerical consistency. It is always preferable to act in the shadows, attracting our prey to a chosen point and then, silently attacking it from behind, zack execute it. This is the spirit of the game, that is to study the situation, choose the point where to hit and then move on to execution. We will go through long moments with a beating heart and the music that raises the tension, carefully studying the stage before moving into action. Manhunt is not a game for children also for this reason, those who expect an easy and immediate approach will be disappointed. In the Rockstar title you die more often, with the obligation to retrace long areas, given that the checkpoints are far from each other, and consequent frustration, but the well-balanced challenge will always be an incentive to move forward. The executions are certainly the most violent part of the game, deliberately excessive and made in an excellent way, with a happy coordination between the use of the joypads and what is seen on the screen: we will see Earl raise his arm like a cleaver, the voice of the ~Director~ he will incite us to kill and, by pressing X or A, we will attack the victim by killing him with a single, spectacular, action. The title is divided into several levels, about twenty, almost all devoted to stealth action, but with different and quite varied objectives; it is certainly not the plot that dominates, even if some twists and turns are truly surprising. At the end of each stage we will get a score, which faithfully reflects our killing ability, which will be important for the bonuses to be unlocked. Killer Instinct Technically speaking, the title from the authors of Gta is certainly interesting, certainly superior to the Christmas version released on Ps2 as regards the sharpness of the textures and the light effects. The playing area only needs to load, very fast actually, only at the beginning of each level, breaking the pace of the game only briefly. In principle, the entire graphic sector is well made, corroborated by good animations and a good stylistic characterization of the enemies (the scariest and most terrifying bullies ever seen). Each gang is characterized differently and moves according to good routinesamentali, in the long run actually similar between the different characters, but still well done. The hunters, once awakened by a noise, carefully search the area, following different levels of alert indicated on the motion detector, which marks their position, based on different colours: from ~yellow - they don't know we are there~, to red-they saw us. Another notable feature of the title is certainly the ability to arouse anxiety, agitation and pure involvement thanks to the certainly decisive video component, supported by the excellent choice of inserting the ~disturbance~ to the images as if they were taken from an external camera. In addition to this feature, which can be deactivated in any case, there is another equally important one, namely the audio sector and here we must really congratulate Rockstar. The music that accompanies the whole game is very atmospheric and follows the rhythm of the game perfectly, but the sound effects are even more so: the sound of our footsteps, capable of attracting the sentinels, the giggles and cries of our enemies, their whistling (we swear that after a few evening gaming sessions you will begin to hear them even with the Xbox off), the dialogues in pure American slang and unfortunately not translated into Italian (only the main ones are), but often still understandable. The director's cynical comments are also a stroke of genius: he will compliment us on the well done kill or incite us to hit our enemies hard; his utterances, whether we like it or not, will guide us throughout the game. Connected to this, it is very interesting the possibility of using the voice communicator to hear the Director's voice directly in our ear, and that of making noises, speaking into the microphone, to arouse the hunters, being careful not to scream with joy after a kill. We found some small flaws only in the framing system, which is not always perfect, and in the management of the camera with the right stick, which is not always as effective as it should be. Comment Manhunt is a title that certainly causes discussion, deliberately excessive and angry, it will certainly not go unnoticed. However, behind the reputation of a violent game there is an excellent title, which oozes gameplay from every pore. Don't stop at appearances and rumors that are heard around, try it at least a little and we assure you that you will be impressed, always provided you are not faint of heart. A product that further enriches the Microsoft lineup and, moreover, strengthens the relationship between the creators of the Grand Theft Auto saga and the Redmond giant. Pros: Exciting Technically well done Oscar sound compartment Cons: High level of challenge A.I. good, but not perfect Camera not always accurate Do you know the current governor of California? In one of his first films, ~The implacable~, set in a hyper-technological and very violent future, he was forced to participate in a televised game in which he put his life on the line, competing in a city-arena against terrible gang of thugs, fully armed and paid to kill them. That's why the comparison: the film, full of action and with a Schwarzie in great shape, is very similar, with due proportions, to Manhunt, the new game from Rockstar Games which debuts these days on the Microsoft console after making its debut on PlayStation 2.", "date": "2004-05-04", "grade": null}
