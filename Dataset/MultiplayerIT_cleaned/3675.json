{"name": "RAGE 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rage-2-recensione.html", "text": "RAGE 2 is a whirlwind of mixed emotions, as we will try to explain to you in this review: a mix that, after all, was reasonable to expect given that the game was developed by two different teams, id Software and Avalanche Studios. The authors of DOOM have limited themselves to supervising the project, yet their positive influence is evident in the perspective of shooter action, which offers highly spectacular sequences, weapons full of personality, special abilities and the typical dynamism of their school. However, what surrounds the excellent gunplay of the title produced by Bethesda, we say it immediately, leaves a bad taste in the mouth. The open world approach adopted represents a sensational missed opportunity for a whole series of reasons, and what was supposed to be a map that may not be huge but full of content actually turned out to be much less exciting than we hoped. You can also imagine our surprise when we completed the last mission of the campaign and the Steam interface counted for only ten hours of gameplay, leaving us at the mercy of an endgame that was basically a waste, with little to offer beyond a few locations yet to be conquered and some convoys to be eliminated. What went wrong? Let's try to understand it. Story and characters The initial sequences of RAGE 2 conspicuously limp in terms of direction and narration, and although that is not the focus of the game, it is also true that even a trivial plot can be told with a minimum of effort. The impact is frankly ugly and leaves us perplexed about the general quality of the production, also thanks to some glitches related to the dialogues of the supporting actors; but fortunately things improve quite quickly. As already reported, the story is set thirty years after the events of the original RAGE and it is possible to choose the gender of the protagonist, Walker, to then be catapulted into a sudden attack by the revived Authority on the city of Vineland. Our character takes possession of the armor of the last Ranger of the devastated area when the latter is torn to pieces in the fight with a huge mutant, but at a certain point he ends up knocked out and reluctantly witnesses the killing of Prowley, the old woman commander who raised him, at the hands of the evil cyborg general Martin Cross. Determined to take his revenge and destroy the Authority once and for all, Walker goes in search of three figures who can support him in this difficult mission: John Marshall, who returns from the first episode aged but still combative, with a network of spies that make him an important resource; Loosum Hagar, skilled Wingstick thrower but above all mayor of Wellspring, aware of some contacts between the Authority and one of his political rivals; and finally Dr. Anton Kvasir, a scientist who rebelled against General Cross in the past and helped found the order of the Rangers. The plot is nothing revolutionary, as per the premise, but the Italian dubbing also has its faults: most likely the recordings were made ~in the dark~, i.e. the actors were unable to see the context of the dialogues, and this further scuttled the yield of certain moments. The interpretation of the protagonist often seemed out of place and the exchanges appear confusing, but when we move on to the monologues, things improve substantially and the quality of the cast of voice actors selected for the occasion emerges. Open world and vehicles The exploration of the RAGE 2 map is completely free from the beginning, without limits or barriers. After the incipit you get on board the protagonist's default vehicle, an armored car called Phoenix and equipped with a winking artificial intelligence (~I'm too hot!~, he exclaims when we overheat the machine gun). It is the only upgradable vehicle among the sixteen that can be unlocked, finding them around the scenarios and taking them at least once to a safe port, and then recalling them if necessary by spending a few dollars. The open world is divided into six zones that can present completely different landscapes: in most cases they are wastelands with some settlement from time to time, but there are also mountains, swamps, forests and abandoned lands of the previous civilization. There are two cities that can be visited and some minor locations, and at this juncture the hub of the first RAGE comes to mind, with the bounty board but also several characters to talk to to unlock new missions. A GPS system guides us clearly towards the goal we have set, but various things can happen along the way: it happens to come across improvised checkpointsi that you have to open after eliminating the enemies who guard them, bases and service stations to free, clashes between factions in which we can intervene, pilots who challenge us in a race of speed and convoys that transport resources. The Phoenix performs quite well in all situations, especially when you unlock some extra weapon (there are for example the upgraded turrets or the homing missiles) using the collected loot, but the same cannot be said of the other vehicles: the bikes have handling that leaves much to be desired, cars designed for racing have no weapons and vehicles equipped with cannons are deadly slow. In short, at the end of the games the act of finding a car and driving it into the city to unlock it in the menu turns out to be an end in itself, a pure matter of collecting which, however, is not recalled too much by the gameplay nor does it provide rewards such as to justify the 'I commit. On the street you can clearly perceive the proximity to Mad Max situations, including bullet time, but we were frankly thinking of something better. Assault on convoys remains the most interesting assignment when you are around, and this does not bode well for RAGE 2. If in fact Tim Willits had guaranteed that the map would be full of things to do, in reality you don't go beyond those three or four types already mentioned in part: checkpoints, bases, convoys, the annoying Towers of Authority and the Arks, manned positions where you can obtain special abilities and weapons deriving from archaic technologies. Thinking about it, there is no barrier that delimits what we can or cannot do, an RPG-style progression that dictates the rules and prevents trivializing what the game's content offer is. After all, as soon as you get hold of the Icarus gyrocopter it's easy to give in to the temptation to take off and speed up moving from one point to another: further confirmation of how little focussed this part of the experience is. Gameplay, weapons and enemies As written at the beginning, id Software has taken care of overseeing the development of RAGE 2, but we imagine that the team's work has gone much further, judging by how some missions and levels clearly evoke the gameplay and style of DOOM. It shoots damn well, both playing with the keyboard / mouse combo and with a controller, without needing aids in aiming as the system acts precisely when a target is framed and allows virtually eliminating enemies without even resorting to the iron sight. The arsenal is made up of eight weapons, each with its own peculiarities, all accessible from the traditional wheel (which can be called up using the Y / Triangle button): although only two tools can be switched ~on the fly~, this solution allows you to wield any rifle in the within moments, since time stops when the selection appears and there is no risk of being hit. The Ranger assault rifle is amazing from medium and long distances, in close quarters the shotgun dictates the law and then there are more particular devices that lend themselves well to specific situations, such as the homing rocket launcher or the gravitational dart launcher (shoots a series of shots that lock on to the target and project it violently towards a surface indicated by us), the Firestorm revolver (with projectiles that can ignite on command) or the devastating pulse cannon and hypercannon. Added to these tools are grenades and the Wingstick, RAGE's iconic boomerang that can be upgraded to lock on targets and is a great way to silently eliminate an enemy. By carrying out eliminations in series it is finally possible to activate the Overload, which unlocks further fire modes and multiplies our power for a few seconds. There is only one problem: it will be difficult for you to resort to it, because at the intermediate difficulty level the challenge is so inconsistent as to allow you to knock down even the huge bosses in a matter of seconds. Fighting in RAGE 2 is very beautiful and exhilarating, you run like trains and dispense blows left and right, quickly alternating rifles and activating the four special abilities that can be unlocked at the Arks to inflict further damage: a telekinetic thrust that projects the unfortunate in the air, a shot from above that generates a shock wave, a barrier against projectiles and finally a quick dash to dodge attacks. However, as mentioned, the balancing of the difficulty is really perplexing: our suggestion is certainly to immediately opt for a higher level than the normal one, so as to make the missions a minimum challenging.As for the enemies, the different factions that we will find waiting for us see the presence of the crazy and violent Bullies, the wild Boars, the disturbing Immortal Shrouds and the mutant aberrations of the Authority. Their artificial intelligence is discreet, they move quite a lot and find cover, advancing with some armored units that we will have the task of ~dismantling~ with our shots, but at the intermediate level of challenge they do not pose a serious threat even when they are very numerous. There is a small problem of visual variety, in the sense that many human opponents share the same polygonal models and it would have been enough to randomize some aesthetic elements to fix it, while for the bosses the problem is deeper and more rooted: in practice, they are always the same two creatures , dressed up differently but characterized by simple patterns, which takes a few moments to learn. Mutant Bash TV and speed contests There are some extra activities that appear towards the middle of the RAGE 2 campaign, when the protagonist needs to become a VIP in order to meet a certain character. The first and most important is Mutant Bash TV, the crazy TV show that makes its return in this second chapter and that will see us face a series of enemies in an arena in which blood and dismemberments represent the main dish to give fed to the spectators. Then there are the circuit races too, with a number of categories to climb for glory and money, but a lackluster rendering. Technical realization RAGE 2's graphics are enhanced by the use of abundant effects, the real protagonist during firefights: the Apex Engine manages to render explosions and particles in an excellent way, returning great visual satisfaction when we make opponents jump with a grenade or missile launcher. The interesting thing is that all this mess does not seem to put the engine in difficulty, which is not the victim of sudden drops in frame rate but remains consistent even in the most agitated situations, with dozens of enemies and flames all around. The only blunders, on balance, occur when we fly over the map aboard the Icarus, witnessing frequent pop-up effects on the shaders. The level design of the bases is convincing and recalls both the style of the aforementioned DOOM and that of the original RAGE, but when you leave the confined places and go into the open world, the more generic solutions multiply, with obvious repetitions of structures and landscapes that do not speak in favor of the variety of the game world. The supporting actors and the enemies are well done even if, as mentioned, the latter would have benefited from some further precautions regarding the types, reduced in number and therefore inclined to recur frequently: in the case of the mutants and the immortals, this goes unnoticed because we are talking about opponents with the same appearance, but with humans more attention would have been needed. On PC it is possible to enjoy a large number of adjustments that allow you to scale the experience based on the configuration, but this time we didn't bother too much and activated the automatic scaler to keep the input constant at 2160p and 60 frames per second stable while keeping all effects maxed out. On further verification we can say that with a GTX 1080 Ti it is possible to play at the real resolution of 1440p with everything on ~ultra~ without ever running into a problem, while stubbornly sticking to fixed and non-dynamic 4K you have to settle for 30 fps, which however they don't do justice to RAGE 2's excellent gunplay.", "date": "2019-05-13", "grade": "7.5"}
