{"name": "Pikmin", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pikmin_b.html", "text": "But what is, in short, this Pikmin? Pikmin is Nintendo... Pikmin is imbued with that typical Nintendo mentality, devoted exclusively to total fun-enjoyment that can be extrapolated from the final use of the product; no, no redundancies, no bad movies, no smoke and mirrors, but only as intricate as simple, as complex as immediate, digital fun... Refined entertainment... Shigeru Miyamoto, the master, has once again put everyone in line, with his incredible and sophisticated philosophy of approach to the interactive experience! Basically, the latest NCL effort is to be considered an RTS (Real Time Strategy), stuffed and seasoned with massive doses of research, exploration, puzzle solving, and even a pinch of platform-gaming... Something as revolutionary as already seen, damned frenetic and at the same time extremely reflective... An extremely delicate mixture to handle: stuff for expert hands, when you want to make the ludic package easily accessible to all videoplayers! I swear; even if you are not an experienced gamer, you will handle it in a few minutes! The language (jappo strict) does not constitute a barrier at all, if only for the fact that in the entire game there is not the slightest dialogue; ahm, the learning curve is as soft as my pillow, need more? Ah, right... The game... A small, in the true sense of the word, space explorer suffers an engine failure of his spaceship and crashes into the wooded planet of the Pikmin, microscopic little beings who see a Smurf as a giant, as well as our hero after all, but damn helpful towards those who brought them into the world (you! Then I'll explain). Imagine being in command of an army of ants... Well, the background against which the game stands out is precisely that, where the weed, five centimeters high at the most, appears to you as a thick undergrowth, and the rusty cans, lying here and there on the ground, they take on the appearance of gloomy and frightening caves (in which to take refuge, when hunted down by some beast)... You will certainly have understood that your enemies can only be pseudo-insects, pseudo-amphibians, pseudo-snails, pseudo-little land animals in general, since, after all, we are on an alien planet. In our eyes, and above all to those of the poor Pikmin, who will have to deal with them ~on the front line~, they will appear incredibly huge and voracious... Not all of them however, since some creatures are absolutely peaceful, still others, even, will reveal precious allies. The main node of the gameplay is, however, to exploit the three types of Pikmin (red, yellow and blue, although we continue to speak insistently of a fateful purple ~species~), each equipped with diversified peculiarities, for being able to find and recover the pieces of the spaceship scattered everywhere in the boundless alien undergrowth. Every single piece hidden in a stage will be signaled by the interface, at the icon level, like the old stars of Super Mario 64; example: in stage X there are 5 stars, but only 3 of them are highlighted (you have recovered three pieces, of the 5 here). Finding all the pieces will be a titanic operation... But what is the backbone of the playful package? Basically we will find ourselves, at first, having to cut down some flowers in order to take possession of their bulbs... They will release seeds and the seeds, wedged into the ground, will make the Pikmin sprout... Pikmin to be shaved like turnips (Super Mario Bros. 2 docet), Pikmin ready to use. Pikmin have a sort of home/base (even an aircraft if necessary) always in the shape of a floral bulb, complete with spaceship-style paws! There they rest, sleep, from there they are born in the form of seeds! To give birth to new Pikmin we will find some spherical-shaped items (flower bulbs: there are red, yellow and blue ones) with a number engraved on them: these items (bulbs/eggs) when transported to the base (base bulb/spaceship) of which I was talking to you before, they will be sucked in and will release 30 Pikmin if 30 was engraved on it, 20 if 20 was written and so on... They will not release Pikmin at first, but simple seeds; seeds that, as mentioned, will sprout and give birth to a Pikmin when uprooted by our mini astronaut! This first operation lets us guess what will be the core of the gameplay! For example, to carry an ovule with a large number engraved on it (say 20), therefore a large, heavy ovule, obviously, a single Pikmin will not be sufficient: the game interface will let appear, on all the background items, be the number of Pikmin needed to interact with it, and qWhat we are currently using! Example! If you need 20 Pikmin to carry a bulb, and I give you 11, the HUD will display the ~11/20~ overlay: 9 to go! Created, uprooted and destined there for another 9, or more (the number can exceed, but not be less than that requested), the object will be carried by weight to the base! Example 2... A box blocks our way: it takes 30 Pikmin to remove it and I have 12! I look for the flowers, have their bulbs transported to the bulb base, create new Pikmin and come back with 8 or more of them to move the box. The basics are this, but you don't have the slightest idea of what efforts your little brain will have to make in the future, considering both that Pikmin of different colors (yellow-red-blue) boast different abilities (only the blue ones can enter the water and go saying), and that within the same species the Pikmin have as many as 4 diversified stages of ~evolution~ (reachable by making them eat!), with their relative and obvious differentiations in terms of ability! And all this will add up to both pure action phases, such as fights or obstacle courses, as well as research phases: the search for spaceship pieces scattered everywhere in the undergrowth! Ok, at first the mission seems daunting: it's not at all, since we've never seen such a complex product, scroll away with such ease of access at the interface level! The control over the troops is always total, nothing gets out of hand, not even with 100 little creatures under orders and not even with the army divided into several battalions destined for different operations! The gameplay is that of a real-time strategy (RTS), WestWood style just to be clear! A little reminiscent of Cannon Fodder, for the movement of troops which can take place both en masse and in separate groups, therefore separately manageable... A little reminiscent of Lemmings, for the varied abilities of the Pikmin, such as being able to build bridges for reach locations otherwise unreachable. A little reminiscent of The Legend Of Zelda, both for the magical setting and for the essentially active juice of clashes, explorations and paths full of pitfalls ... A little reminiscent of War Craft II, for the industriousness and manual work to which our troops will be subjected... Well, after all, he remembers a thousand titles and none of them, and we have no fear in saying that the entire PC strategy tradition can easily go into hiding! The most incredible thing, the first to catch your eye, is that every time you hold the pad, you always end up discovering something new, even if it was just a mere touch of class that you missed at first... And all this not a little tempts the lucky player, to dissect, to test, retest, actions-options that apparently seemed improbable: ~Nooo, don't tell me that... How wonderful!~... Basically you will try your hand at the impressive variety ' of situations/actions that each stage of the game proposes, and it will always be a discovery. The maximum number of sketches, intended also as mixed colours, that can be driven around is 100... They are not at all few, also considering the considerable amount of polygons on the screen displayed by the cube in each, immense, stage! But underlining the technical merits of the hardware is what interests me the least, although the cosmetic structure, also understood as the number of on-screen polygons, special effects (the water effect is the most convincing in the entire videogame history! ), texture quality, and so on, is a real marvel in Pikmin. The shadings, the transparencies, the reflections, the same textures of both the characters and the surrounding settings are particularly successful... Once enraptured by the gameplay, you will feel like you are truly a micro-man located in the undergrowth of your home garden, so much is the fidelity that binds the places that can be visited in Pikmin to this common vegetative typology. A small drawback of the choreographic sector can only be found in the not very high frame rate, identical to that of Luigi's Mansion: very good, but which nevertheless fails to reach the fateful 60 FPS ... In any case, this out of tune note alone does not manages to absolutely undermine the incredible graphic quality of the last born in the Nintendo house: mind you, it runs abundantly above 30 fps and without any slowdowns, not even with over 100 sprites on the screen! The transition from day to night (The Legend Of Zelda style) is also of considerable visual impact, marked by a handy icon placed on the front of the screen. The charm... That charm that only Miyamoto's productions are able to bestow on every pixell... Unthinkable, unique, as crazy as familiariare... New experience in a market that smells more and more of the old. The audio counterpart is incredibly tasty; excellent, perhaps unforgettable, the calm and relaxed traces of the various levels, never repetitive, anomalous, just as anomalous is the entire play package! Highly varied, from the carefree, to the symphonic, to the country, to the blues, all extremely melodic as complex and articulated in the drafting ... Ehm, just like the gameplay ... Not to mention the hilarious mutterings of the Pikmin, their typical expressions, always different, fundamentally onomatopoeic... The sound of the mythical whistle with which the astronaut gives orders... In the audio/video field, as was legitimate to expect, the third ~cubed~ game convinces and excites... If we want to be honest, it amazes... Never had the strategic game gone so far, not even in the wildest fantasies of PC environments! Miyamoto arrives, for the first time, and in one fell swoop he redefines an entire genre by providing horizons, both graphic and conceptual, absolutely unknown to the entire tradition... Honestly, four reviews would not be enough to talk about Pikmin, since one cannot ' not even dream of analyzing each of its components, even in passing! The play package is a surprise that always gives out new surprises, a whole divided into perfectly homogeneous parts, never separated from that whole! I am happy to think that such a little-known genre can now be understood and appreciated by console users as well; I regret instead seeing us play a PC user, like my neighbor, who has lived only on strategic games and in front of Pikmin, and a Japanese console, he understood how limited his experiences had been so far. He's going to buy a GameCube on Saturday. Already Andrea himself who had never wanted to hear about consoles, beat'em-up, Final Fantasy-style RPGs and various&variegated Japanese... Who knows why Miyamoto always manages to get everyone to agree... Even me and Famitsu... Apologizing for the shortcomings that the review of a production like this obviously brings with it, I say goodbye, after about forty hours of play... Speechless... Long live Miyamoto and... Ahm, I almost forgot! The sequel is already under development: decidedly anomalous if we consider the Nintendo tradition, but it seems that the master is literally going crazy for this saga... Let's play, then! Pros: Incredible cosmetic and conceptual complexity Ultra light learning curve Miyamoto style Cons: Below 60 fps Instructions in jappo Although many are ready to argue that Miyamoto, in reality, is not a human being and although I certainly do not have the right tips to resolve the age-old question, I can certainly reveal to you that his daily life, apparent, phenomenal, is in all respects similar to ours... Yes, to that of all of us. Laughs, eats, sleeps, reproduces... Moves... Yes, moves house, just like a common human being! And like a common human being, he also dedicates himself to garden maintenance work; garden of the house he has just moved into, of course! So? So it happens that one fine day, pleasantly tired by this and that household chore, he sits on the grass in the back of his new home, and is kidnapped by the organized, pre-established and orderly movement of the ants that move under his nose... I know what you're thinking: perhaps he smokes weed... Ok, I admit it: I too have suspected it several times... Anyway, the ~journey~ into the universe of ants is over , runs to the phone and calls the ~company~: ~Guys, I've been observing the ants for two hours: they are incredible!~; a voice on the other side: ~Hey, Shigeru, don't tell me you're back smoking?~... ~No, this is serious, I mean, ants, I mean Pikmin... Baaaah, I jump and I'll tell you everything!~ A group of coders immediately gets to work, while the project involves our Miyamoto to the point of pushing him into the woods with a camera: his intent is to perfectly recreate the undergrowth, that thick & tangled vegetation, those meanders in which armies of ants and such amenities move... During the official presentation of the title, it will be Shigeru himself who declares: ~One day you will go to a wood and you will look where to put your feet, with the fear of trampling on some Pikmin !~...", "date": "2001-12-05", "grade": null}
