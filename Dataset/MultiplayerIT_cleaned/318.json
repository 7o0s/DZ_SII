During the chat phases it will be possible to activate a series of particularly amusing graphic effects, which allow you to modify the image displayed, giving it a modern, unrecognizable or cartoonish touch. During the chat you can interact with our interlocutor by making him vibrate the joypad by pressing the back triggers. An absolutely useless function which, however, we believe can give several moments of hilarity. The video chat works very well resulting fluid and anchored to 30 frames per second, during the sessions it will also be possible to zoom in on every detail that ends up in the shooting frame, click on the magnifying glass icon, a small rectangle appears which indicates the area to be enlarged, another click and we will see the chosen detail in full screen. Simple and effective as a system to show your friends the details of your room or perhaps simply to set the view only on your face. The Xbox Live Vision completes the chat possibilities already expressed by Xbox Live The possibility of taking photos to be stored on the Xbox 360 hard disc allows you to change the personal image associated with our tag, however this image will remain viewable only for our ~friends~, the contacts we have in the list. The implications don't end here, from the moment we connect the camera to the background of the Xbox 360 dashboard, the image taken in real time will be constantly visible. In the same way, when we play some piece of music using the capabilities of 360 on our television, the image taken will appear with a very particular graphic effect, a sort of image reproduced among a thousand distortions, for those with historical memory it seems to recall a bit the virtual deejay of Super Ranking Show famous television-music program of the eighties. The future implications will be innumerable allowing for example the insertion of our appearance to virtual characters. The first example we will have with Ubisoft's Rainbow Six Vegas which will allow you to insert your face on the soldier we will use. From what we have seen, it will be enough to take two photos, one frontal and one in profile to insert a texture representing our face on the polygonal model. The customization of games will always be higher. The Xbox Live Vision, reflecting Microsoft's idea of making the Windows and Xbox worlds increasingly convergent, is perfectly compatible with all PCs equipped with Windows XP with Service Pack 2 and a USB 2.0 port. We encountered some small problems during installation given by the search for drivers to install the device, drivers that are not found by the automatic Windows search, but mysteriously the camera works perfectly, even under Messenger. Totem Ball Review TotemBall is the Live Arcade title available for free to all Xbox Live Vision owners. It is Microsoft's way of welcoming the new little creature that joins the Xbox 360 universe. The game uses the camera as a sort of Eye-toy, recognizing the movements that the player makes in front of the screen. In the case of TotemBall it is about guiding a small turtle, which is lying on a colored sphere, to capture the pieces of totem scattered around the levels. Every time we recover the piece of sculpture it will be positioned above the turtle's head and we will hear new background music, indeed to be precise every time we add the totem part a musical instrument will join the background music making the rhythm and more and more captivating melody. The fundamental part of the game is the link between the gameplay and the Eye Toy-style control method. Yes because we will not use the traditional joypad but we will interface directly with the Xbox Live Video Camera. The interface combines the view of the playing area, from a classic third-person three-dimensional platformer, with two large indicators placed on the sides of the screen, one on the right and one on the left, which simulate two waterfalls and which will act as detectors of our movements real in front of the camera. In practice, by arranging our arms, spread out, in the two cascades we will be able to decide the movements of the sphere, by raising our arms the sphere will advance and lowering, it will first stop and then go back, raising one arm and lowering the other at the same time the sphere will turn in the direction of the lever armor to the sky. All this is much easier to do than to describe, however what immediately catches the eye is the biggest flaw of the Live Arcade title, keeping your arms wide by making movements from bottom to top and vice versa is quite tiring, and even a trained physique is definitely affected after about ten minutes. Aware of this problem, the programmers, almost as an apology for this defect, have inserted various pause zones in which it is possible to rest for a few seconds. Keeping your arms raised for a long time is very tiring Unfortunately, the commands are not so precise, so the effort will most often be amplified by the fact that the camera translates movements that we have not actually made into video information; on other occasions, however, we will find ourselves waving like crazy to get the camera to recognize the right input. Technically, the game while exploiting high definition has an average quality that closely resembles the PlayStation and Nintendo 64 productions, nothing exceptional but it certainly amply satisfies the purposes for which this game engine was created. TotemBall also offers numerous game variations, only for the most ~fit~ players, in the true sense of the word, such as cooperative play with another friend, unlimited exploration, the super challenge in which we will have to face the whole game with only one life and with strict time limits. Finally, it is necessary to point out a variant of the title and that is the pinball machine, in which with the movement of the arms we will raise and lower the game triggers by throwing the ball with the turtle around the screen. It could have been a lot of fun, but unfortunately the delay in the game's response times to our movements completely invalidates the experience, making this mini-game practically unplayable. Comment TotemBall turns out to be a nice variant of the usual gameplay, the basic ideas are good, a pity that they have been implemented in the wrong way, making the title a bit too tiring from a physical point of view, but above all making it difficult to manage due to a system inaccurate control. We certainly understand that this is only a demonstration of what can be done thanks to the interaction with the video camera, certainly we are not, at least in this first production, at the precision levels of the Sony Eye-Toy. Pros First game developed for Xbox Live Vision Technically sufficient Cons Inaccurate and difficult to manage controls Fatiguing and frustrating Finally the long awaited web cam for Xbox 360 has arrived on the European market. The small white accessory as well as being very pleasant from an aesthetic point of view, allows, by connecting to one of the Xbox 360 USB sockets, to shoot and transmit perfect images at 30 frames per second, with a resolution of 640 x 480 and allows you to take photos like a good 1.3 megapixel digital camera. These possibilities will obviously have repercussions on future games, you can already read the first news in terms of gameplay at the bottom of the article with the complete review of TotemBall, one of the first titles, together with Uno, to exploit the capabilities offered by the Xbox live vision.", "date": "2006-10-23", "grade": null}
