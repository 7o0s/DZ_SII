{"name": "NeoGeo Battle Coliseum", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/neogeo-battle-coliseum.html", "text": "Necrophilia, take me away NeoGeo Battle Coliseum is to begin with an aping at times embarrassing of what Capcom has achieved with the titles of the Versus series. And believe us, that's not exactly a compliment. The idea of making the various SNK heroes collide is excellent in theory, but in practice it is reduced to a circus show where, however, the extraordinary technicality that has always characterized the SNK branded fighting games is missing. If the concept worked for Capcom, thanks to a fussy adjustment and balancing work for almost all the characters, maintaining a variety of gameplay based entirely on the characteristics of each fighter that influenced the general mechanics, the opposite work was done in NeoGeo Battle Coliseum , adapting the various fighters and the mechanics of the original games (on which they were studied) to a new and decidedly chaotic gameplay. The basic idea is that of the tag-team: in fact, the player can choose two characters, not just one, and swap them on-the-fly by pressing a simple button, through which it is also possible to perform questionable special moves that exploit both the wrestlers. But the moment you directly control one of the two fighters, you realize how much the apparently functional gameplay lacks that exceptional depth that has always distinguished SNK fighting games. This is clear above all in the case of the new Desperation Moves: the complex variables that allowed their execution in the various episodes of The King of Fighters, Fatal Fury or Last Blade have been cancelled, in favor of a more immediate and at the same time less technique. Three bars for the super move, loadable by attacking, receiving damage or through the appropriate key combination, and each move capable of exploiting one or all of the bars, changing in intensity: a simplistic mechanic that would have certainly worked more in an episode of Street Fighter. Even the most basic fighting techniques available are cumbersome and not very original, also due to a rather disastrous balance of the various characters, who from various series maintain the same characteristics and fighting skills: consequently Marco, from Metal Slug, is armed with every type of ranged weapon and also possesses a bizarre hand-to-hand technique, but at the same time it is too cumbersome and defenseless against more direct and powerful warriors such as Haohmaru or Terry Bogard. Not even the variety of game modes shows potential depth: the usual Arcade, Versus and so on modes, without the possibility of digging into a particularly stale gameplay in more detail. Atomiswave, where are you? What this little word, Atomiswave, should entail is certainly not what NeoGeo Battle Coliseum shows us. Technically, in one word, this SNK-Playmore fighting game is poor. Poor in details, poor in graphic effects, poor in the will to make it graphically ~fashionable~: we are not asking for another Guilty Gear (still graphically unattainable fighting game) nor an exaggerated high resolution as in the case of the Sammy game, but the idea to tear the sprites from the titles of origin and make only a few slight modifications before placing them in this collage is not particularly commendable: as is obvious, the result is an extremely pixelated minestrone, where the original sprites created especially for the occasion are saved ( Marco, Ai and Yuki for example) which however do not shine for character design. The quality of the backdrops is also only fair: although three-dimensional and generally well made, complex and spectacular, theoretically really pleasant, in practice they are completely static. Forget the spectacular animated backgrounds of SNK VS Capcom 2 or Marvel VS Capcom 2, those of NeoGeo Battle Coliseum stand out aseptically against the background of fights where only the quality of the animations does justice to the names of the protagonists. The soundtrack is sufficient: not too original, it still maintains a constant and frenetic rhythm during the clashes. Comment The charm of the possibility of having Haohmaru collide with Terry Bogard could be one of the incentives for the purchase of Battle Coliseum by a fan of the series, but ultimately SNK VS Capcom 2 allowed to do it sooner, and better. Joking aside, the plethora of selectable SNK heroes is the real reason why a player should be interested in this new SNK-Playmore fighting game, provided he knows them and has some interest in using them. NeoGeo Battle Coliseum is yet another confirmation of the tiredness of this house, which in the current situation is hardly able to re-present the formula that made it successful years ago: this productin short, it is outdated, lacking in depth and complexity of the gameplay, poor in the desire on the part of the developers to amaze and satisfy the players. The technical comparison is just enough, with excellent animations counterbalanced by practically static backdrops and an embarrassing resolution. The idea was great and SNK fighters have a unique charm... too bad their original titles are much more suitable for them to fight. Pros Lots of SNK heroes NeoGeo fans will like it... maybe Cons Lacks depth Technically mediocre It's sad to say, but SNK is dead. Yup, that's right: SNK-Playmore is the opaque shadow of the glorious software house that until a few years ago lived on the success of its arcade cabinets and some console portings, mother of timeless masterpieces such as the fighting games of The King saga of Fighters or the amazing Metal Slug action series. Economic hardships have torn SNK apart, forcing it into various mergers and trudging on the legacy of its own legend. With questionable results: in recent years even the sequels of his greatest masterpieces have suffered from a tiredness that has discouraged the most ardent fans of SNK, above all because of the questionable portings and the magic lost by the milestone series, contaminated by that modernity that does not belong They. NeoGeo Battle Coliseum tries in some way to pay homage to SNK and its historic console, a cornerstone of the gaming market, by bringing together the characters of its most famous sagas in a single battle-royale: from Fatal Fury to The King of Fighters, passing through Mark of the Wolf, World Heroes, Last Blade, even Metal Slug and Athena. But will this pout-pourr be enough to remind us of the SNK that was?", "date": "2006-12-20", "grade": null}
