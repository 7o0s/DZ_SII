{"name": "Eternal Sonata - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/eternal-sonata-recensione.html", "text": "The first time information about Eternal Sonata appeared, we are sure that more than one person wondered what could have been the relationship between Frdric Franois Chopin and a typically Japanese RPG. Actually knowing the developer, Tri-Crescendo, there is no reason to be too surprised. The Japanese team has developed the sound part of the Tri-Ace titles for many years, which include jewels such as Valkyrie Profile among their ranks, but for some time they have detached themselves to develop their games independently and completely. After trying their latest creation, we can only be happy with it. Eternal Sonata can be considered as a tribute to the extraordinary Polish pianist and composer, who at the beginning of the 19th century ushered in a stylistic trend that has had no equal since. The story unfolds through a dream that Chopin allegedly had during his last days of life, on his deathbed, and the game then tells his moments of joy, fantasy, doubt, courage, through a very engaging and effective narrative, divided by chapters. To this fictitious development is added a part dedicated to the real life of Chopin himself, with photographs of the time especially related to his numerous travels in search of the best condition and his most important relationship, the one with George Sand. In short, if the premises were a bit ~weird~, the result is absolutely remarkable, thanks also to the excellent graphic style, which we will discuss later. It all begins in a small village called Tenuto (note the constant musical references here too) and continues through various passages, with the main protagonists having to discover the reason for some very harsh taxes imposed by the local government, with the exception of mineral dust, one strange chemical medicine that has numerous side effects on people, even genetically transforming them. At this point the real adventure begins, which sees Frederic himself among the protagonists, surrounded by a series of characters born of his own imagination. The journey continues passing from village to village and facing various fights, which alternate between the classic clashes with enemies (visible on the screen, no random fights) to those with bosses, to then also face some dungeons that have a minimum puzzle component , relating for example to the movement of some gears in order to find the way out. Just the combat system, together with the technical aspect, represents the strong point of this production. Each enemy can be faced with three characters, while the others remain on the ~bench~ but still receive a slightly lower amount of experience points, necessary to level up. The clashes can be defined as a hybrid between turn-based and real-time, with the action linked to a time bar, positioned on the left of the screen, during which the player can move the characters and attack his opponent. If initially this bar remains fixed until the first move occurs, subsequently it allows only a few seconds before starting to run out, according to an evolutionary scheme that with each completed chapter provides new moves and the possibility of channeling some combos between several characters, to be kept perhaps for the next round. The second supporting element of this system is represented by the Light/Darkness dualism: in practice, each character, in addition to physical attacks, has at least initially one move for each of these two factors; if he is in an area reached by any light source, he can attack with the first, if he is in the dark, he can attack with the second. Movement on the battlefield therefore becomes very important, because some enemies will be weaker in the face of one type rather than the other; needless to say that there are objects that are used to wrap the characters in light or darkness, thus adding further complexity to the comparison. Dulcis in fundo, there is the possibility of parrying enemy attacks by pressing the B key with the due timing, which proves to be essential during the most difficult battles. More difficult to explain than to implement anyway, thanks to all these characteristics the combat in Eternal Sonata is innovative, varied and above all fun, a right hybrid that certainly represents one of the strengths of the Tri-Crescendo production. The game, for the rest, is very linear, but flows smoothly also thanks to the topics covered, which range from social divisions to revolution, denoting a further tribute to the period lived by Chopin. An element that clashes is instead represented by the ability of one of the main characters, Beat, to take some photographs during the battles, which based on their rarity can be sold to the various shopkeepers scattered in the villages. Well, the bad calibration of this feature makes it really too easy to earn money during the game and therefore buy any item or equipment upgrade for sale. On the other hand, little to criticize as regards the technical sector, which reaches the highest peaks from a stylistic point of view, with colorful characters with a good visual personality, and often breathtaking and aliasing-free fantasy settings, with splendid and very varied decorations . The camera is also an accomplice, which remains fixed or automatically follows the player, always choosing the best view to offer, even if there is no control by the player. Nothing extremely ~heavy~ from a purely technical point of view therefore, but definitely above average as far as the artistic one is concerned. The sound sector is equally splendid, with extremely enjoyable original music, which is gradually also unlocked for listening in the appropriate menu. Very nice, in particular, that of the combat, which even after several hours of play does not get tired at all. Finally, in the menu it is possible to choose the audio dubbing between Japanese and English, while among the choice of subtitles there is also Italian, generally of a good standard. Comment Eternal Sonata will please all Xbox 360 owners who are waiting for a J-Rpg with fresh and fun mechanics. If on the one hand we have a very linear story, a duration that can be improved and little variety, on the other there is an enjoyable title which, thanks to the indisputable technical quality and the combat system, can be completed without accusing glaring drops or moments of pure boredom, which is difficult in a genre so linked to not exactly innovative mechanics. An applause must therefore be given to Tri-Crescendo, which, even without memorable moments, has created a fascinating and captivating game, the best exponent of the genre currently available on the Microsoft home console. Pros Artistically and musically splendid Combat system fun and innovative Fascinating theme Cons Longevity can be improved (25-30 hours) Very linear development of the story Not exceptional variety and depth XBox 360 - Goals The 1000 points available have been divided by the developers into 22 objectives. The simplest ones are obtained simply by proceeding through the game chapters, still others by killing some bosses under certain conditions, the perhaps more difficult one is to collect all the pieces of musical scores scattered around the game world, useful in the only minigame present.", "date": "2007-10-31", "grade": null}
