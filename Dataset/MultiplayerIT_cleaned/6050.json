However, after the initial turmoil, Quest of Dungeons reveals its potential, exponentially increasing the respect for Upfall Studios, its creators. But let's go step by step. We are facing a classic roguelike-type dungeon crawler, therefore with randomly generated levels and the inevitable permanent death. Although the title has a very efficient manual save system, there is no way to recover the saved position in the event of a game over. At the beginning of each game we have the possibility to choose four different characters, rather stereotyped indeed: we have the warrior, the magician (a sensational reference to Final Fantasy), the assassin and a more original shaman. You will have understood that we are talking about the most classic fantasy canons, from which the title draws without particular digressions. Each character has two distinct skills, the first of which represents the basic attack, while the second is a special blow that consumes mana points and must therefore be used sparingly. The presence of some books allows you to learn new skills, which can then be easily selected as needed. The powers in question are interesting and outline the characteristics of the quartet; obviously the magician develops the magical arts, which allow him to hurl powerful elemental attacks from a distance, while the warrior concentrates his spells to intensify his strength and so on. Basically what distinguishes the four protagonists is precisely the main attack: the shaman and the warrior strike only up close but compensate with their strength, while the thief and the magician are able to launch attacks from afar but are weaker. Quest of Dungeons follows the rules of the roguelike type dungeon crawler Strategic combat, but not too much Quest of Dungeons is represented through a bird's eye view and with a retro graphic style, from the 16-bit era to be clear, and a setting of the maps - the classic dungeons - in blocks, each of which represents a step of the character on the two axes (it is impossible to proceed diagonally, but you can shoot). The enemies behave in the same way, trying to get close to attack our heroes; to understand each other better, if we stand still nothing will happen, but any movement along the blocks, including the attack, will be registered by the artificial intelligence as a move. It's easier to see this mechanic in action than to explain it, but what we're dealing with is basically a turn-based combat system cleverly disguised as an action. On many occasions it works well and is also stimulating, but on others it exposes the side to some criticism and shows the mobile origins, not perfectly reinterpreted for the controller. For example, the warrior carries out the basic attack both through the A key and by moving the analog stick in the direction of the enemy; in the latter case even more effectively and thus making the first solution not only useless, but almost counterproductive. It is clear that the system is designed primarily for a touch device, where the player can directly indicate the enemy to attack, and that the interpretation on a controller is therefore cumbersome in the first bars, even if you get used to it as you continue. The technical realization moves along the same lines, functional but also full of approximations that are less digestible on a television, such as the animations reduced to the bone. Another problem is that of balance: it doesn't take much to understand that the mage and the assassin/thief have a clear advantage over the other two, thanks to ranged attacks, which completely distort the gameplay of Quest of Dungeons. The game does not make it clear if it is a deliberate choice, even if one would think otherwise, but know that, although there are four difficulty levels, the most demanding challenge is undoubtedly the one in the role of the warrior. Xbox One goals Quest of Dungeons presents the canonical 1000 player points typical of a retail title, thus representing a rather tempting opportunity to enrich our score. Considering the dynamic nature of the levels, there is no precise order in which to conquer the first objectives, even if the one linked to the opening of a special chest will arrive sooner than you think. But others, such as completing dungeons on Inferno level, may take a little longer. Order in chaos As written above, Quest of Dungeons follows the dictates of the roguelike role-playing game, thus making each game always differentand diluting the traumatic effects of permanent death. In theory it is possible to finish the game even in less than half an hour! The procedural creation of the labyrinths leads to all kinds of outcomes: we happened to find the ladder to the next level behind the first door, but also the final boss of that particular level, expected to be tackled after a logical development process of our own character. A similar and premature eventuality translates with a certain certainty into defeat, in case one proceeds obtusely towards the enemy. This falls within the characteristics of this genre, it doesn't take much to recover the experience and the objects lost in the previous game, but what clashes in the setting is the framework prepared by Upfall Studios in the levels. The ~pattern~ in the end is evident and is expressed in the keys to be taken to open bonus chests, the inevitable shop for buying and selling items, teleportation portals and more or less all the clichs that a retro fantasy RPG can suggest. The team has even managed to insert bonus missions within each floor of a level, unlockable by breaking special crypts. These are simple operations, such as finding a certain enemy or a precious object, but they represent objectives for the player that are not exactly in tune with the permanent death system. In this sense, the general irony helps, already recognizable from the nice introduction, which highlights how what we are facing is a product that has no intention of taking itself too seriously but simply wants to represent a carefree entertainment. In short, one always gladly returns to the maze of Quest of Dungeons, especially for a quick game, even if on a console the whole system is slightly less spontaneous.
