{"name": "The Case of the Golden Idol", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-case-of-the-golden-idol-recensione.html", "text": "Some decades-old genres, especially on the indie scene, are still incredibly popular and continue to evolve over the years, while the graphic adventure genre, after the golden age of LucasArts white disks, has long been neglected even by the realities more alternative and nonconformist indies. It is no coincidence that Return to Monkey Island has been able to gain so much attention, it has not only represented the return of one of the most iconic symbols of the entire medium, but also the opportunity to return to play a point and click for all those who had been dramatically widowed by this type of experience. We warmly advised you to keep an eye on him already on the occasion of the trial a few weeks ago, but if you recognize yourself in the category we have just mentioned, you should seriously entertain the idea of approaching The Case of the Golden Idol, a point-and-click investigative adventure that had managed to win our interest thanks to the demo released on Steam by Color Gray Games, an independent Latvian studio made up of just two developers, Ernests and Andrejs Klevins. The game is available from today, and the time has finally come to reveal if all the potential that emerged from the demo has managed to materialize. Let's find out, in the review of The Case of the Golden Idol. Idols, sects and curses The Case of the Golden Idol stages crimes of all kinds Violent murders, unfortunate accidents, enigmatic crimes. All connected to a single object, a golden idol that seems to give its owner great fortunes, but also a premature and particularly violent end. There are twelve cases that the Klevins brothers' game stages with a splendid pixel art graphic style, and by solving each of them we will be able to slowly reconstruct the history of the idol through the passing of generations, even if from a certain point onwards the title focuses on a small cast of recurring characters that is very easy to absorb thanks to a splendid characterization, which largely concerns their cunning and their misdeeds. Every detail on the characters, however, can only and always be conquered through analysis proof, because yes, The Case of the Golden Idol is certainly not a classic interactive adventure and in some ways it is not at all, since the title is not supported by a protagonist, nor by a real script. It is the player, through the clues and in the first person, who has to put together the pieces of an intricate emerging plot whose pieces, scenario after scenario, magically fall into place in often very unexpected ways, building a story full of unexpected scene and implications. The most striking thing about the story of The Case of the Golden Idol is the consistency with which the hidden threads of the story intersect with each other without creating plot holes and other narrative imperfections, a very difficult goal to achieve for the Latvian study considered the absence of a traditional narrator. During the approximately 8 hours of gameplay that it took us to get to the end credits, only one small detail of the story clashed with everything else. Well, that single element then opened up in the main twist of the whole adventure, so we can't do anything but praise Ernests and Andrejs for the quality and harmony expressed by the narrative component of their debut title. Solve cases through words A look at the deductive process by which the crimes of The Case of the Golden Idol can be solved Another great virtue of The Case of the Golden Idol is that it offers truly out of the ordinary investigative gameplay, in which the clues are represented by the words that the player reveals by carefully exploring the game's scenarios. Basically, each case is divided into two distinct phases, the first which sees us engaged in the search for words within the setting, and the second in which we use the latter to reconstruct a diary that explains what happened to the victim. The true point and click soul of the title developed by the Klevins brothers is shown right in the first phase, because you need a keen eye and a lot of observation to find every clue, while missing even just one can result in the absence of a fundamental piece in the reconstruction of the crime. The game features a mode in which points of interest are constantly highlighted, but although we were forced to activate it on a couple of occasions during our adventure, the advice is to start by leaving it deactivated and then only resorting to it in case of difficulty. If the first junctures of the investigationfollow the classic dynamics of interactive adventures, it is the deductive phase that represents a big novelty in the investigative genre. The screen dedicated to reasoning varies from scenario to scenario, but generally involves compiling a diary with the words learned while exploring the setting, with the sole objective of finding out what happened to the victim. Each level, however, includes other specific sections, very useful for confirming the preliminary deductions before trying to solve the case. For example, the first crimes include a panel with portraits of the characters involved, which can be filled in by giving each of them a name. If the choices are correct, the words used are removed from the field of hypotheses, and in doing so it is easier to proceed step by step without launching into useless attempts. The story of The Case of the Golden Idol will come to span several years, following the rise of a dangerous cult The solution, in the Latvian study's game, is always hidden under the surface of the documentary evidence, and it never emerges clearly even when looking at the big picture. The real star of The Case of the Golden Idol is the pure and simple process of deduction, which often forces the investigator to proceed backwards by exclusion, since direct evidence capable of nailing the perpetrators to their crimes is often lacking. Precisely for this reason, the first levels will not be able to engage those accustomed to puzzles and riddles much, while the advanced stages of the story have managed to really put us in a crisis, even if we never had to resort to the suggestions that the game makes available to anyone finds himself blocked in the reconstruction of the case. The only flaw of the formula studied by the Klevins brothers is that with a limited number of spaces in the diary where to insert the words, when a piece is missing you can slyly proceed by attempts, without the game penalizing the practice in any way. For some, this will be a comfortable way out of more intricate situations, but we would have preferred a more purist approach to the matter. Another big detail on which it is important to warn you is that the title does not currently include any form of Italian localization and, since it is an experience focused on words and text comprehension, it could really prove difficult to adequately use The Case of the Golden Idol if you don't speak a word of English. The art direction of The Case of the Golden Idol is truly excellent Given the graphic style that the game adopts there is not much to say about its technical component, so we will occupy these lines to celebrate the very inspired art direction of The Case of the Golden Idol, which not only features exquisite pixel art enriched by a very particular drawing style, but which seasones everything with an iconic soundtrack that is really apt for the atmospheres of the title created by Color Gray Games. Indisputable values of Latvian production, which only increase the mark we have chosen to assign it even further.", "date": "2022-10-13", "grade": "8.5"}
