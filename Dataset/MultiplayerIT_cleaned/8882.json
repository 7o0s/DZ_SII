So here is that this Power Rangers Samurai, inspired by the nineteenth season which in our country is broadcast by the Boing digital channel and by Italia 1, does not arrive properly driven by a name capable of bringing hordes of teenagers to stores. And maybe it's for the best, given the quality of the product... Who starts well... That Power Rangers Samurai is a title made with a low budget can be understood immediately from the main menu, distinguished by a look that would have appeared dated 15 years ago and by an evident lack of content: you can only try your hand at the main adventure, tackle a useless mini-game or go to the options screen. By selecting the first item, things do not change for the better, indeed it is precisely from here that the decline of the Namco Bandai product becomes inexorable: it is possible to impersonate one of the five superheroes in tights, a pity that the Red Ranger has characteristics so superior to the others as to make the choice in his favor obligatory. Fortunately - or unfortunately - the game seems to care less about the strength and speed statistics of the various characters, since each of them behaves in the exact same way. Having overcome the disappointment for these evident ingenuity of development, we find ourselves in our hands an old-school scrolling fighting game, in the less happy meaning of the term: Power Rangers Samurai looks in all respects a title for the first PlayStation, with graphics and largely outdated gameplay that manages to not exploit an iota of the peculiarities of the Wii. It is necessarily played with the combination between Remote and Nunchuck, with the main keys responsible for attacking, jumping and executing a special shot that consumes a part of a special indicator with each use. A scarcity of input that would suggest an equal playful flatness, and in fact it is exactly like this: Power Rangers Samurai is a really boring and repetitive action game, with a zero level of challenge and a total lack of taste in terms of design . In essence, all you do is continue within the scenarios by killing harmless enemies who let themselves be overwhelmed by two number hits, arriving in an extremely linear way at the clash with an end-of-level boss who can promptly be knocked out by repeating the your Ranger's special attack. Then, as in the show, every bad guy turns into a giant being that our players have to face by joining forces and summoning their own colossal robot Megazord: it's a pity that the game liquidates these clashes between the titans with a subspecies of rhythm game in which you only have to move Remote and Nunchuck at the indicated moment to attack or defend, further reducing an already reduced fun factor due to the obvious defects of the product. Better to watch TV Seeing with what superficiality the fundamental aspects of the Power Rangers Samurai game structure have been created, it is not surprising to note that the same treatment has been applied to the side elements. The level design is spartan and repeats itself with an annoying cyclicity, the enemies are not very varied both in appearance and in behavior and show off an artificial intelligence that leaves much to be desired, while the multiplayer is limited to one action per two players which does nothing but double the boredom effect. Again, at certain times the user is asked to execute ideograms by moving the Remote in the indicated directions, an activity completely an end in itself which has the sole purpose of lengthening the broth of a title that wearily drags on from the very first bars, and that not for nothing lasts just a couple of hours. There is no consolation even for Power Rangers fans who might want to buy the product in the hope of experiencing a new adventure of their favorites: the story practically does not exist, and is narrated -very badly- by alternating short clips taken from the show with images static with text boxes that are anything but exciting or pretty to look at. The situation even worsens when it comes to graphics and sound, certainly capable of being among the worst things ever seen on the Wii, despite the fact that the Nintendo console is certainly not famous for its technological skills. Visually we arein front of a modest show to say the least, made up of angular and sufficiently animated polygonal models that move within extremely poorly maintained scenarios, all further debased by dull colors and washed-out textures. On the sound front there are few effects that are repeated continuously, accompanied by rock music of the lowest league and by a Z-series English dubbing. In short, nothing is really saved from this Power Rangers Samurai, a product so media that we are sure would be able to disappoint even the youngest and most ardent fan of the television series.
