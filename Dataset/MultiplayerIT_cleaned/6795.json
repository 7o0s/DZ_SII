Yet, despite the indisputable success of the Angry Birds franchise, a handful of birds and pigs are not enough to keep a giant of this kind afloat, as demonstrated by the 130 employees recently sent home after a not exactly profitable year. In an attempt to experiment with new paths not necessarily linked to its flagship intellectual property, the Finnish company has thus founded a publishing branch called Rovio LVL11, to allow small groups within the team to create original games and perhaps create new brands . Titled Retry and directed by Markus Kallio, the first free-to-play project under the new label isn't exactly based on a new idea, but despite taking strong inspiration from Flappy Bird, it manages to delve into its mechanics to set up a totally unique experience. With Retry, Rovio has created an experience where you try again and try again and try again Ready set try again As if the name of the game weren't already a strong hint, the developers have filled every menu and every screen with hints and messages that underline how heavily Retry relies on ~trial and error~. Once you start the first level, the feeling of being in front of a Flappy Bird clone is enormous: you try to pilot a 2D airplane through careful taps on the screen, trying to avoid obstacles along the way while struggling to maintain control . However, the feeling of deja vu lasts only a few moments, because unlike Dong Nguyen's game/phenomenon, Retry offers real levels, first simple and then gradually more complex, with a series of hangars that act as checkpoints, crossroads and secret roads to be found only through several attempts. If in Flappy Bird you can only move forward, influencing only the height of your avatar at most, in this case tapping on the screen boosts both upwards and forwards: this means that, by holding down on the screen, you he can perform in reckless loopholes, a technique that with a little practice allows you to reach certain areas or go back to collect objects. As mentioned, things get (much) more complex as the levels progress, and getting the coveted three stars at the end of the level becomes a real challenge for a few stubborn players. The scoring system is in fact based on the number of attempts used to reach the end of the scenario, and so you have to decide whether to try to finish the level in one breath or if you land in one of the hangars to save and start again. Particular credit should be given to Kallio and the dozen or so developers who worked on the game: despite the enormous level of challenge, Retry manages to be absolutely not frustrating, partly thanks to the instant restart every time you die, partly for a level design which, especially later on, offers more and more interesting solutions. There are even boss levels, extremely difficult and which will put a strain on the nerves of the most patient. Above all though, the control system and physics within the game require quite a bit of practice to fully understand, but they're never unfair to the player, and every time you die you feel like you've done it wrong. something. The detractors of the free-to-play model can then sleep peacefully. Retry uses a microtransaction system to be able to use the various hangars scattered throughout the levels, but alternatively players can spend the coins collected in the scenarios, or sit through a few seconds of advertising. In short, it is possible to continue playing and not pay without the experience becoming more frustrating. Exceptions are the bolts, which are more difficult to find normally but which allow you to unlock temporary upgrades and abilities for your aircraft, such as the ability to turn more easily, to resist shocks or to attract distant coins.", "date": "2014-10-31", "grade": "8.0"}
