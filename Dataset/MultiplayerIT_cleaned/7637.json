Surely not by the size of the textures or the quality of the three-dimensional models, otherwise Resident Evil 6 would be a masterpiece. A pig hanging from a crucifix. Slightly blasphemous. Just just Let's put it this way: if playing you find yourself walking crouched, trying not to make noise, even if you don't actually know the effects of noise on enemies, if you sip every step looking around every corner before moving, if you prefer to walk dark for fear that the light will attract some creature, even if it is not certain that there are creatures around, if each new place to cross puts an inexpressible anguish on you, a sense of oppression that can become so strong as to force you to let go of the controls for a few moments, if you spend a lot of time standing in the shadows without being able to move a step after hearing an ominous noise coming from who knows where, if at every safe haven you breathe a deep sigh of relief, as if you were a shipwreck survivors; in short, if all, or even just some, of the situations described above occur, then there is an excellent chance of being faced with a work that is keeping what it promises: frightening. Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is a perfect horror machine. The new title by Frictional Games and The Chinese Room (Dear Esther) picks up exactly where we left off the first Amnesia, i.e. from the dark, never so black and distressing, and from the desire to affirm all those qualities that had so bewitched thousands of gamers . We are not talking about the plot, which is completely different from that of The Dark Descent, but about a real conception of horror that has made school, bringing the genre back to the roots of survival horror while exploiting the first person. The Alternatives Never like in this period there are valid alternatives for lovers of horror games on PC. We limit ourselves to reporting three very recent ones. The first is the survival Outlast, released a few days before A Machine for Pigs and certainly worthy of being tried, even if less refined than the title of The Chinese Room. The game mechanics are very similar, with a helpless protagonist who must survive being hunted down in an asylum. The second title is the exploratory adventure Gone Home, a short and intense experience that has achieved great acclaim all over the world. Finally, let's also include Slender: The Arrival, which we didn't particularly like, but which is certainly indicative of a widespread trend in the contemporary horror genre. Shades of black As in the previous episode, the plot starts from an amnesia. The protagonist, a wealthy bourgeois who lives in Victorian England, wakes up in a kind of cage in the throes of severe dizziness. After recovering, freed by no one knows who, he sets off in search of his children, who have disappeared who knows where. It's night, and the immense mansion in which he lives seems possessed by forces that go beyond human comprehension. Don't worry, we won't go into too much detail about the story, because it's one of the strong points of the game. Paradoxically, we can't tell you too much about the first hours of the adventure, so as not to give you information that would risk ruining it for you. Just know that you will soon understand that there is something unspeakable behind the disappearance of the children and that the protagonist will find himself trapped inside an immense allegory that he himself helped to create. Also know that the authors have followed Lovecraft's lesson perfectly, only partially explaining what happens and leaving the supernatural on another level, as if human limitations prevented us from understanding what lies beyond the rational level. The story itself is told through very classic means: we go from the sheets left around by various characters, never present on the scene, to gramophones on which small dialogues are recorded, up to microsequences that take place at certain moments, in where the protagonist hears voices that remind him of events from the past. The use of the telephone is interesting, through which one speaks with a character whose identity will be discovered only much later in the adventure (when a couple of packs of diapers have been consumed). More than what happened in The Dark Descent, in A Machine for Pigs the scenario becomes an active element of the narrative. The construction of the various places and the progression with which one penetrates the mysteries they hide are managed with much more wisdom than that of the first chapter, just as their metaphorical impact on the general economy of the game is much stronger. The atmosphere is decidedly tetra Let's explain better. The castle of The Dark Descent was, in fact, just a castle: well designed, full of interesting places, but essentially a scenography. It's different for A Machine for Pigs. Without revealing too much, we can say that the individual places are part of an immense allegorical construction, which not only serves as a setting, but which also attempts to tell a model of society and the deviated mind of its architect. After all, nothing else could be expected from Dear Esther's father, Dan Pinchbeck, given that his first work was above all an environmental story, a long walk inside the depression of a human being carved in the places, before the texts. Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs puts tension at the heart of its gameplay and our review Darkness to darkness Some places are filled with creepy drawings and paintings From the gameplay point of view, however, the relationship with the predecessor is really very strong, so much so that we can talk more about some adjustments than real changes. Like that of The Dark Descent, the protagonist of A Machine for Pigs is basically helpless in the face of evil. Throughout the game there are no usable weapons and you are limited to holding an electric lantern, which unlike the oil one in the first episode does not need to be recharged to work. The ability to grab objects and carry them around while holding them, essential for solving puzzles, has remained unchanged. There is no shortage of levers and strange machines to activate, drawers to open and so on. In truth, there are never too complex puzzles to solve and the greatest difficulty is not getting killed by enemies (which we won't describe so as not to reveal some relevant details of the plot). Speaking of the graphic impact, beyond the thematic issues, it is easy to see how the dominant color is black. The few light sources present usually emit a dim light that barely outlines the places where you are. Even when walking outdoors, the atmosphere remains gloomy and oppressive. Be careful, because it's not just a stylistic quirk. The presence of absolute darkness forces you to take out the lantern to get some light and examine the scenarios, a pity that the light attracts the creatures that infest the areas like money attracts politicians. So, imagine yourself crouching in the shadows and hiding behind a crate. Written texts are the first vector of information to understand the plot In front of you there is only an immense darkness in which you cannot see anything. Instinct would like you to take out your flashlight to light the way, but the growing noise of inhuman footsteps around your hiding place terrifies you: what if by doing so I would attract my death? Here, maybe Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is better told through situations like this, than in the mere listing of its characteristics. Even the technological side, therefore, rather than showing off a power it doesn't have (it's not much better than that of The Dark Descent), chooses the path of functionality and narrative effectiveness, that is, it is bent to the needs of the story. As also happens for the soundtrack, made above all of very marked noises and sounds, such as those of running machines, sometimes used to cover the sounds of enemies and create an even more marked tension. The music, present in some situations, is always used to underline particular moments and never covers the action. Above all, it never becomes preponderant, a sign of a certain compositional wisdom that takes into account all the elements that make up a video game and not just its own.", "date": "2013-09-09", "grade": "9.1"}
