{"name": "Bum Simulator", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/bum-simulator-recensione.html", "text": "Some ideas are great on paper. Maybe they impress when you first meet them and make you think they have great potential. However, enthusiasm is often frustrated by a poor execution, in which the project finally demonstrates all its inconsistency and randomness, becoming a kind of ghost of what it could have been. In short, the effective gimmick should be followed by the ability to translate it into a valid experience. The Bum Simulator review is here to prove that quite the opposite is often the case. Pigeons are lethal weapons One of the first missions of Bum Simulator requires you to urinate against ten well-dressed passersby who crowd the small town where the game is set, called Bumsville, on behalf of a wealthy individual who wants to demonstrate his opulence, exploiting the poor for fun. The mission is assigned to us on a street corner for no one knows why. After poorly written dialogue a timer starts and the player has to go around looking for people in suits to wet them as required. Naturally doing so attracts the attention of the police, who try to stop us in a very clumsy way indeed. The mission ends with us on the run in search of a hiding place that will make us lose track, with the police demonstrating their bad artificial intelligence ignoring us within seconds and with the strange feeling of having done something that the game would have wanted to make us feel unbecoming and worthy of a chuckle, but that in the last resort it was simply a showcase of what doesn't work in the Ragged Games title, which thrives on these gimmicks without being able to make them organic to a cohesive and interesting experience. How do the homeless live? Asking for charity is an activity that quickly becomes boring In Bum Simulator you get drunk, you build a base that can look like a castle, you meet crazy characters like a clown with a hook for a hand, a pigeon woman or a rat man, you talk a lot with a cart of shopping full of rubbish that follows us wherever we go and that we can even drive by running over passers-by, signs are written to ask for charity, people are thrown into dumpsters, they are rummaged in them in search of food and pigeons are used as throwing weapons . At first each of these actions elicits a half smile, in memory of a carefree era in which video games were also excesses of the genre, now relegated to the independent scene, but on closer inspection it doesn't go much further, i.e. the gameplay appears fragmented in these sketches that end up becoming ends in themselves very soon, as well as clashing with the idea of simulating something. Of course, there is a simulation fund, with the player who is often forced to deal with hunger and thirst, but instead of being faced with a parody of the life of a homeless person, with a strong social criticism, as we thought and we hoped, we found ourselves playing an open world of the poor, where the whole story revolves around a war between gangs who want to take control of the city. We are none other than the leader of one of the gangs and we have to go around to recover pigeons (read extra weapons), to save affiliates, which can be used to defend our base from enemy raids, to recover materials and blueprints to build the base and to carry out missions that seem written at random, to finally destroy a bad multinational that it is not clear how it fits into the other dynamics told. When the real plot of the game emerges from the shadows, practically almost immediately, one begins to wonder why on the one hand some missions ask you to go around collecting some change from passersby all the same, while others put you in the shoes of a kind of super boss who has to manage territories and people, all seasoned with raised middle fingers, burps, farts and, of course, urine in rivers. It is as if the focus of Bum Simulator changed during development, but it was decided to bring together the initial ideas with those added in the running, creating a frankly indigestible mixture, in which, say, at a certain point it seems to be a survival is the time spent building and recycling materials. On balance, the things to do are few and very repetitive. Luckily it doesn't last long, given that you get to the end in about eight hours. It works little and badly Why did we find ourselves in a survival? And the combat system? Yes, our homeless man can also fight, engaging in fist fights and using pigeons as throwing weapons. Unfortunately doing so does not give any satisfaction: the enemies are stupid and to defeat them in the maggior most of the time it's enough to back away and throw punches, or throw pigeons when they try to hit us from a distance. The only cases in which we were put in difficulty were those in which we found ourselves surrounded by virtue of the design, but it was not difficult to learn how to get out of the way, given the low intelligence of the opponents. As the game continues, special techniques are also developed, which however only take effect the first few times they are used and which soon become routine, also because they do not have some level of depth. You press a key and things happen on the screen. That's all. Unfortunately Bum Simulator is also very deficient from a purely stylistic technical point of view, where somehow it could and should have been more daring. Despite the satirical intentions, the style chosen is that poor realism typical of videogame productions that gather resources almost everywhere, trying to put together something decent. At least we have a talking cart to argue with Bumsville is ugly, made up of anonymous buildings, a uniform population, unregulated traffic and beaches where there are only men sunbathing. The streets are bland and built up as a disorganized jumble, the environments are incoherent, with run-down areas beneath rich mansions and others that appear to have been built without any sense of architecture. The city is full of movement, but empty of life, so much so that you soon get tired of walking around looking for some activity to do or some place to see and you follow the missions by inertia. There are shops to visit to buy food and drinks, but that's really all there is to it, so much so that by the end of the game you really wonder why anyone would want to waste so much time.", "date": "2023-05-21", "grade": "4.0"}
