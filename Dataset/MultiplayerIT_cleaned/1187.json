Too bad that, as usual, this possibility is only offered to non-European users, who, for a change, seem to be the last wheel of the cart for ninety percent of Japanese software. But anyhow, despite this, while the second episode of what promises to be a new saga parallel to the primary one, if it can be defined as such, has already been delighting video game enthusiasts throughout Asia for some time now, the the first Resident Evil Outbreak arrives on the shelves of our stores in a version totally localized in Italian and, despite being devoid of the online game, as mentioned, it seems to have many arrows in its bow to reveal itself as a decent title worthy of your attention. But let's go in order. RE Oubreak is a long-term project conceived a few years ago by Capcom, immediately after having hijacked the original saga to Game Cube Initially conceived as a mega adventure with as many as 20 self-contained scenarios, with the network game component as a strongly characterizing element, for reasons of time (programming) and money (better to release four ~different~ games at full price than just one ), the project then turned into a sort of double game, adding an offline game mode that was increasingly taken into consideration by programmers as a valid alternative for all those users who for various reasons could not afford the game in net. Resident Evil Outbreak therefore catapults us into the midst of the events that characterized the entire original saga and which then led to the premature end of all its inhabitants. Ravaged by a terrifying disease that brings the dead back to life and transforms animals into bloodthirsty creatures hungry for human flesh, chaos reigns in Raccoon City. Eight ordinary citizens, including a security guard, a policeman and a journalist, are sitting at the tables of J's Bar when the contagion explodes outside in the streets. And here the real game begins. Escape from Hell The Capcom title can be defined in some ways as a ~mission~ adventure, five in all, united by a simple and linear plot that acts as a common thread, whose sole purpose is to save from a ~haunted~ area himself and his companions. You will have to impersonate one of the eight unfortunate patrons of the club, each of whom is equipped with their own skills and AIs that make them unique and that influence their behavior during the hottest phases of the adventure. In fact, at the beginning of each scenario, you will be given the opportunity to select one while the other two companions who will form your team of survivors will be automatically assigned to you by the CPU. This means that every time you decide to replay a ~mission~ you will be able to relive that experience by continuously varying your virtual alter-egos and their respective companions, facing the various scenarios with different approaches from the previous ones precisely due to the intrinsic characteristics of uniqueness and ability of the various Kevin and associates. Obviously, changing the character will change the adventure companions and also some aspects of the game, from the introduction to the ~in-game~ movies, to the very concept of gameplay since different characters mean different skills and different approaches to the adventure. The combinations between characters and situations are many and allow the Capcom title a certain replayability, an essential element for a game that is otherwise too short-lived. Each mission is self-conclusive and can be tackled, once the various scenarios have been unlocked, as you prefer. At the end of each of them you will be able to watch an ending and you will be assigned a score. This score takes into account many factors ranging from the objects collected to the so-called SP Items (Special File's), from the behavior held during the game phases towards companions or enemies to the number of areas explored. Thanks to these ~prizes~ you can then unlock dozens and dozens of secrets, which vary from CG movies to new costumes, from hidden characters to the splendid and rich gallery of artwork. In short, finishing a mission several times in REO is a must if you really want to complete the game 100% and savor every single detail to the fullest. A new way to play The strength in REO is undoubtedly the playability, understood as an ~innovative~ approach to adventure, at least for a survival horror, which is now almost entirely focused on cooperation.one of the various elements that make up the group of survivors .. Needless to underline how this element adds to the series and to the title in question a certain strategic component aimed at improving the gameplay and renewing it without however distorting too much the very concept of the Capcom masterpiece: fight if you want to survive. To communicate with your unfortunate cronies and give them (simple) orders, you can use the voice of the character you control, with all the limitations of the case. In fact, by moving the Right analog stick, your Pg will exclaim: ~Com'n~, ~Go~, ~Help Me~, ~Thanks~, while with the Square Button he will say generic phrases depending on the circumstances. Your companions, based on their character and the situation you are in, will or will not follow your orders. As mentioned earlier, each NPCs also have their own characteristics in the way they behave and react to danger and it is not said that they will run to your aid even if they should be within earshot. Just the personalized AI for each character means that the experience in REO will not turn out to be just a mere shoot and run. For example, if the Raccon City police officer Kevin will be very skilled and courageous in facing hordes of zombies with his gun, the grumpy Mark will be reluctant to accept orders and will tend to act alone, while the petite Yoko will try to avoid the clash and to transform for the occasion into a Solid Snake in a skirt in order to be able to hide from the eyes of the enemies. Lockers and beds are ideal for this. But the innovations introduced by Capcom do not end there. What happens if we unfortunately run out of ammunition for our weapons? Simple, you can defend yourself by sealing the doors with wooden planks and nails, or defend with your bare hands by kicking or shouldering your enemies to create a gap and attempt to escape. The contagion Another important addition then, is the infection of the characters. In fact, each of the members of the group is infected by the T-Virus and as you progress through the level, it will increase the stage of the infection until it leads to certain death. A tip: keep an eye on the blue indicator at the bottom right of the screen: it signals the progress of the T-Virus in your body. And look carefully among the objects scattered around the scenarios: among them a pill could be hidden that can slow down or block the spread of the infection in your body. Even if to be honest sometimes it turns out to be useless, since it doesn't take much to get the infection back (even simple contact with an enemy), which, as mentioned, will lead your virtual alter-ego to an atrocious end and at Game Over. Speaking of GO, the insipid save system of the game present in the Japanese version, which forced you from time to time to restart the whole scenario once killed, has fortunately been revised and corrected by the Capcom developers, who must have finally understood that the equation longevity equals frustration did not lead to positive results for the psyche of users. Having said that, in REO Pal it will now be possible to save in the old way of all the other titles in the saga and start over, in fact, to replay from the same point in which the game was saved whenever you want, even after turning off the console. No ~save point~ therefore, but real bailouts. Let's conclude our journey into the depths of Outbreak's gameplay by taking a brief look at the graphics and sound aspects. In addition to the introduction of a new 3D-like graphics engine to Resident Evil: Code Veronica, which alternates fixed shots with more mobile ones, it should be noted the presence of a lighting system managed in real time by the CPU and a whole series of effects, from the flames to the mist typical of cold environments, made with the usual mastery by Capcom graphics. All this aesthetic abundance does not seem to affect the fluidity of the animations that much, except in some rare cases or in the long loads between one level and another. The characters in general and the scenarios are very detailed. We are not faced with graphics at the same level as that of the illustrious ~older brothers~ seen on Gamecube, but it certainly appears very defined and well-finished. The music produced by Akihiko Matsumoto is worthy of a horror film, just as all the samplings concerning the various grunts, moans and noises emitted by the creatures and the general sound atmosphere that one breathes during the adventure is nightmarish. If you would like to be updated on Outbreak in the future, all you have to do is add this game to your favorites list. Comment Here in Europe it was one of the most awaited games of 2004, either because it has always been thereResident Evil series boasts many admirers in the old continent, either for the curiosity of reviewing a title of the series again on Ps2 and replaying it in its new videogame guise that has transformed it more into an MMOG, albeit offline, than into a survival. Despite the absence of the mode for online play, which in any case limits its potential a lot, Resident Evil Outbreak turned out to be a pleasant surprise. Necessarily far from the schemes of the classic adventure of the saga, REO is certainly a title able to offer a few hours of fun and a discreet involvement thanks to its ~multiform~ nature of the game. Revisiting some areas of Raccoon City, discovering new ones, escaping from the clutches of hungry zombies by camouflaging in their eyes, will surely delight all fans of the Capcom horror-game. For others, however, after an initial attraction, it could prove a little boring. Pros: Selector for 50/60Hz TVs. Localization in Italian. Quite replayable. Cons: No online play mode. Long uploads. Localization in our language a little too ~macaronic~. In the long run, redoing the same scenarios to unlock secrets is boring. Resident Evil: Outbreak walkthrough If you get stuck between one zombie and another we have prepared a complete walkthrough of the game, reserved for subscribers. The solution can be found at this address. Let's face it: do you think Raccoon City is or isn't it the most unlucky city that has ever existed in living memory? So unlucky that even our good Tanzen, notoriously not superstitious, would stay away from it. Raise your hand how many of you remember another town in the world that in the space of a few years has seen half of its inhabitants transformed into hideous creatures and the other half massacred by ravenous zombies, and which finally, to complete the work, was razed to the ground by an atomic bomb But at Capcom they must be a bit sadistic, and not caring about the eternal peace finally achieved by its poor citizens, they have seen fit to bring Raccon City back to light in all its hideous splendor by reviving it especially for us (and for their pockets), in a sort of prequel that has the task of making us see, through the eyes of the protagonists we will play, the tragic moments that characterized the last moments of life and the desperate flight for the survival of the inhabitants of the unfortunate city of Chris Redfield and company.", "date": "2004-10-14", "grade": null}
