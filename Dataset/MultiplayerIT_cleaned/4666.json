In our review of the PC version, while not elevating it to excellence, we praised Lego Worlds in many aspects: thousands of pieces available (practically every piece that actually exists reproduced to perfection), many different biomes to explore, a well-crafted quest system and useful for learning the many functions present and the possibility of playing with a friend in local multiplayer in split screen or online. On the other hand, the creative mode was not available from the beginning, the technical realization lacked a rather annoying camera and the multiplayer was limited (it still is today) to only 2 players. The Switch version, in addition to keeping all these features both good and bad, gives you the Sandbox mode of free construction (later introduced in the PC version) unlocked immediately. Are we then faced with a well-crafted Lego Worlds conversion to play on the sofa and on the go? Unfortunately not, and probably the guys at TT games should have waited some more time to optimize Lego Worlds in the best possible way. In this review, we will quickly remind you of the type of game and we will try to analyze all the problems present, some already known but conspicuously amplified, others completely new which are, unfortunately, unique to this version. Hours and hours and hours and hours of building in your pocket Let's start with the same speech made for the PC version and subsequently for all the other platforms for which the game was previously conceived: Lego Worlds is a fun game, suitable for everyone and potentially unlimited in its creative part. Its learning curve of the adventure mode makes it a game certainly suitable for a young audience who, by exploring the various ~lego-planets~ available and completing the mini-quests, will learn the use of the various tools for collecting objects, coloring, positioning bricks and so on, needed for later use in creation mode. On the other hand, an adult might probably want to abandon the adventure mode early in favor of the creative one, since the mini-quest system tends to get quite repetitive after a while and the missions are limited to little more than ~free a trapped character~ or ~bring an object X to a character Y by retrieving it from a character Z~. Just the adventure mode, which as we said is now available immediately, is suitable for all those who want to experience the thrill of having an infinite number of pieces to build in complete relaxation any object, construction or amenity that comes to mind, only limit: your imagination. In any case, we advise all players to start from the adventure mode to familiarize themselves with the controls and with the many (too many, perhaps) tools available, considering that the control system is the first of the Lego Worlds problems to highlight (the we had already noticed in the PC version playing with the pad but the keyboard-mouse combination had made it less evident). Let's start immediately by saying that to play in two split screens you will need a Pro Controller or two extra Joy-Con, so it is not possible to do it on the move with a single Switch. Having said that, let's talk about the default layout of the keys on the controller, since it is one of the least intuitive ever tried and it is not configurable in any way: if it is true that a game of this kind has many options and bringing them all back to the pad certainly does not few difficulties, some developers' choices are really questionable: one above all, the X key which with a tap equips the last tool used, brings out the radial menu for selecting the various tools by holding it down and, near a vehicle, makes get into the driver's seat. It will often happen that you have to put away the tool that came out instead of the radial menu or you have to move away from the vehicle if you want to carry out one of the actions just mentioned; the back keys are delegated to zoom in and zoom out while perhaps, as happens in Minecraft, they would have been more suitable as action keys. In short, we are not talking about an irreparable defect of the game (and by dint of playing you will get used to the keys positioned in a certain way) but the inclusion of the command legend at the bottom right of the screen that can be consulted at any time almost seems like a admission of guilt (~the commands are complicated but we keep reminding you of them~). Creaky Lego worlds If the sound sector has remained identical, and therefore of the highest quality, and if graphically Lego Worlds for Nintendo Switch maintains thebeautiful colors present in the other versions, we cannot say the same for the fluidity of the game which is the real Achilles heel of this version. Both in portable version and on the TV, Lego Worlds has noticeable frame drops especially in situations where you zoom in on the character and make the camera move by displaying animated objects such as a revolving door or a moving vehicle. The inaccuracy of the camera indoors was a problem already encountered in the PC version but, despite everything, even on a mid-range laptop the result was quite convincing and the framerate remained comfortably above 30fps; on Nintendo Switch we even went below 20 in some momentary situations. Another problem that will have to be resolved quickly are game crashes which are, unfortunately, frequent and occur when you go to reload a previously saved ~world~, in this case, we encountered two types of errors: a total freeze of the screen with only solution closing the software using the home button and a black screen with the option to restart the game. The developers, already questioned about these problems, said that one of the very first patches will fix both the dropped frames and the crashes, furthermore, they added that they are developing an ad hoc LAN system for Nintendo Switch users so that they can play comfortably with two or more consoles nearby without having to connect to the Internet. We really hope that the patches will correct everything and bring new content: at the moment, in the store you can find packages for sale for  3.99 with other scenarios and objects but the guys from TT games have announced that a new mode called Survivor will be included ( no details yet) and the construction tools will be improved by including a particular construction tool for houses called ~Planner~.
