{"name": "Shogun: Total War", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/shogun-total-war.html", "text": "The tactical map This will prove to be the main mode of the campaign, it is in fact from here that all tactical aspects of the game are managed. From here the economy can be managed through the application of taxes to the subjects: naturally a high level of taxes will produce dissatisfaction on the part of the population with the possibility of revolts. Also from the tactical map it is possible to manage espionage through the use of shinobi and the assassination of other generals and emissaries with the use of Ninjas. The assassination will not be controlled directly by you but will be handled entirely by the computer based on the experience level of your ninja. As soon as you choose to assassinate someone, a window will open with a movie in which you will see your man in action: if he is successful, you will witness the death of your target, otherwise you will see the end of your ninja. In addition to assassination and espionage you will also have to manage alliances with other factions. Everything is carried out by the emissary: just place him on top of an opposing Daimyo for him to enter into action and start the negotiations for alliances. Also from the tactical map you can manage the construction of buildings in the various provinces and the training of new units. The main building of the province is the castle which can be evolved to become a Citadel, the bigger your castle will be the more buildings you can build and you will have better chances of resisting a siege. In addition to the castle, you can build various Dojos in which to train your troops, armories, Buddhist temples or Christian churches and ports with which to trade with Portuguese and Dutch merchants who in exchange for gold will provide you with muskets and arquebuses. Finally you can control the disposition of the armies, whether to merge them together and attack or occupy the provinces. Let the battle begin.. As soon as you choose to attack an enemy province you will be asked if you want to manage the attack yourself or if the PC has to manage it. If you leave the task of managing the battle to the computer you will always remain on the strategic map and you will see the outcome of the battle on a window, if instead you opt to manage the combat directly (a choice that I recommend to everyone) you will access the real-time section of the game , where you will see your army deployed on a 3D map. When you attack you will have a time limit within which you will have to defeat your opponent. The real-time mode I must admit is truly spectacular, with high detail of the landscape and a very faithful representation of the armies. Seeing thousands of men moving under your command is truly gratifying. The armies are made up of samurai archers, armed with lethal bows to deal with the enemy from a distance (whose efficiency decreases considerably in case of rain or wind). In addition to the archers you will have several foot troops at your disposal, armed with swords and spears, among these there are the Yari Ashigaru, the Samurai and the fearsome warrior Monks. Then there are the mounted troops armed with arrows, swords and spears which prove deadly in assaults on the opposing army. As soon as the battle begins you can choose how to arrange the army, through a special menu in which to choose the most appropriate formation according to the situation, ranging from square to defensive formations to those of attack. The choice of how to deploy your troops in the field is of vital importance and can mean the total defeat or victory of your army. Of course if you choose to play at an easy level the choice turns out to be less important and if you have a sufficiently powerful army a frontal attack is almost always successful, things change instead if you choose to play at higher levels, in this case the strategic choices they are fundamental. In addition to the campaign you will be able to fight a historical battle in which you will be able to participate in some of the main battles that took place in Japan, all characterized by a remarkable historical reconstruction, or you can choose to create your own personalized battle in which you can choose the place to fight and the constitution of the your army and that of the opponent. Human Intelligence Vs Human Intelligence Last mode present, but not least, is the multiplayer one, in this mode you can choose whether to use a LAN or a serial connection or play via the Internet. If you choose to play via the Internet you can only use mente EA NET, a service made available by EA for multiplayer games. In this mode as soon as you enter EA NET you will find yourself in a chat room selection menu where you can choose which of the chat rooms to join or create a new one, once inside the chat you can create individual battles or take part in an existing one. You will have a limited number of Koku (the local currency of the time) with which to form your army, once all the players have formed their army the battle begins. Very interesting in the multiplayer mode is the presence of the ROLL OF HONOR (a kind of ladder n.d.Pucci) a ranking in which all the players who took part in the multiplayer battles are present. Pros and cons Let's now examine the strengths and weaknesses of this game. As far as playability is concerned, it must be said that it is always at the highest level; the sound is very well done with background music of Japanese origin and excellent effects. Hearing the screams of your men who launch the assault confused between the sound of the horses' hooves, that of the swords and the various noises of the surrounding environment helps to raise the level of realism of the scene. Another gem regarding the sound is the possibility of putting the speech of your troops in Japanese. A serious shortcoming was instead the lack of localization of the game by the Italian distributor, after having seen the first demos completely in Italian one would have expected a total translation of the game into our language, instead the CTO preferred to keep it with speech and English subtitles. Although the English versions are often better than the Italian localizations, this compromises the possibility of fully enjoying the game for those who do not know English perfectly. Pros and cons As regards the graphic aspect, the result of the tactical map is not bad even if moving a unit on top of another to attack it or to merge it together with another is sometimes difficult, moreover the conquered territories could have been better highlighted from various factions. In real-time mode the landscape is made in 3D with good attention to detail. Instead, all the units are two-dimensional sprites, which have proved to be an almost obligatory choice given that a battle can also contain several thousand units: if they had been made in polygonal form, the game would have been very heavy. If you zoom in on the units their definition drops quite a bit. Still talking about zoom, I personally would have preferred it to be possible to have a view in which a greater part of the map could be seen than the maximum allowed, so as to be able to control the movements of even a large army. The control interface turns out to be a bit tricky at first but after a bit of practice it is quite comfortable and allows you to do almost all operations even via mouse, the only thing I would have liked would have been the possibility of using the mouse wheel. Overall Shogun proves to be an excellent strategy and a good compromise between the various genres. If you are a lover of more action-oriented strategy games such as the various Tiberian Sun and Starcraft, perhaps Shogun is not the most suitable for you; if, on the other hand, you love to plan your clashes to the max, you are a strategy lover or you want something deeper then you can take Shogun with your eyes closed. Introduction The world of strategy has always been divided quite markedly between turn-based and real-time ones, the former more oriented towards pure planning while the latter are more action-oriented with a smaller strategic component. Shogun seems to be trying, and apparently succeeding quite well, to unify the two types of strategy: in fact, in the game's campaign you will have to face turn-based sections and others in real time. It must be said that Shogun is not the first strategist to attempt this approach. An illustrious predecessor was Centurion, released way back in 1990, which used the same approach with the difference that it was set in the Roman Empire. Shogun is the first chapter of the Total War series, an ambitious project by EA destined over time to cover different historical periods, and the next it seems will be Ancient Rome, even if it is not clear whether the imperial one or thisshe republican. We come now to Shogun. The game is set in 16th century Japan, in the Sengoku Jidai period, which literally translates as ~The Time of the Country at War~. In that era, in fact, despite being the Emperor at the head of the nation, Japan was divided into many provinces, each of which under the control of a Daimyo whose hope was to prevail over all the others to become the Shogun. To be exact, the Daimyo and related clans present in Shogun are seven, each with its own characteristics. Once the game has started we will find ourselves choosing whether to undertake the complete Campaign, take part in a historical battle, create a personalized battle or take part in a multiplayer battle. Let's take a look at Shogun's singleplayer. The main part is the complete Campaign mode in which the game gives its best, in fact this is the only mode in which there are turn-based and real-time parts. Once you have chosen the clan you belong to (which affects resources, means and strategies) you are introduced to the turn-based mode in which you can see the map of the whole of Japan from above.", "date": "2001-04-30", "grade": null}
