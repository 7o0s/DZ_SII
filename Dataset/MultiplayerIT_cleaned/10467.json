Criticized above all for its skimpy longevity, Star Wars: Tales From the Galaxy's Edge is a very fun and well done product released during the autumn of 2020, where the player is put in the role of a droid repairman who finds himself stranded on the planet Batuu, grappling with an evil gang of space bandits (the Guavian Death Gang) who are preventing him from finding two very important lost droids (they are R2-D2 and C-3BO!). Inspired by the Galaxy's Edge Area of the Disney parks, except for a few puzzles, Tales from the Galaxy is a game of little exploration and lots of shooting, as well as the only one that made us savor the atmosphere of the forgotten masterpiece Dark Forces after so many years. In controls it has never been a perfect game, nor is it now after installing the DLC, but between the iconic atmosphere and actually very nice graphics for a Quest without the support of a PC, you make it great . With no wires in the way you feel just like you're in some high tech Disney World attraction around the corner, and that's no small feat. Continue the battle! Graphically Tales From Galaxy's Edge is probably the best game available today on Quest and Last Call is no different The problem with the base game is that the best happened in the end. In those four hours of gameplay that you were given, you found everything from a system of upgrades to equipment and jetpacks that simply did not have time to express their potential. Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy's Quest - Last Call, with its other four hours or so of gameplay, makes sure that the initial vision is finally complete. More than finding who knows what novelty, a double closing of the circle awaits you in this DLC: narrative and gameplay. The game remains essentially the same: seven hours in total to get to the end of an action that brings home the result with more than dignity, a solid project that we can easily place among the highly recommended for those who buy an Oculus Quest. The return of Ady'Sun Zee The cast of the game is small, but each character has been given a care that is uncommon in a VR game Another aspect that has been enhanced are the ~Tales~ of the title, which don't have much to do with the protagonist's fights, but are worth a separate mode that will only be unlocked once a certain mission has been completed in the main game. In Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy's Edge - Last Call two more have been added, the first which very well closes the fascinating adventure of padawan Ady'Sun Zee which began in the base game, the second dedicated to the assassin droid IG-88 which she shines in inventiveness and is soon revealed to be the weakest of them all. These interactive stories don't last much, about half an hour each, however they represent a very tasty extra where the lore of the universe is explored in more depth and we are offered totally different challenges from those of the campaign. The spectacular training of Ady'Sun Zee which ends in Last Call is the only one who puts a lightsaber in our hands and we really don't understand why: it is the object that everyone wants to use and yet it is always used too little, as if we were not yet ready for such emotions. But this isn't just a problem with this game and ours was a generalized outburst... All doubts about Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy's are dispelled by the arrival of this DLC. The game can finally be said to be complete, a purchase that fills the belly and not the all too typical VR experience in the making, which makes you taste fantastic things and then slams the credits in your face cold like a killer. It remains a somewhat confused game in terms of shooter mechanics, but deep down in the universe created by George Lucas they have always shot a little randomly and that's exactly what you need to do to fully enjoy this title. However, the exploratory parts are no different: they are short but tasty, also thanks to graphics that immediately emerge among the best and sharpest ever seen on an Oculus Quest. Comment A decidedly familiar face from the Star Wars universe Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy's Edge - Last Call is a good add-on that finally delivers on all the good ideas only glimpsed in the base game. While it's still not enough to turn the project into the definitive Star Wars game, the improvement over the three installments of Vader Immortal is enormous.And. We remind you that to play Last Call (cost 9.99 Euros) the purchase of Tales From the Galaxy's Edge (full price 24.99 Euros) is required. Recommended yes, but without exaggerating.", "date": "2021-10-20", "grade": null}
