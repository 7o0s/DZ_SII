{"name": "Un colpo e via", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/164073-superhot-un-colpo-e-via.html", "text": "Minimalism The idea of SUPERHOT was born in August 2013. The prototype of what was not yet known would become a complete game, was created in a week of work on the occasion of the Game Jam ~7 Day First Person Shooter~. The developers did not imagine that it would get such a resonance as to end up in articles of the major world videogame magazines. The request of the players was so high and loud that they could not fail to fulfill it, so the SUPERHOT project finally became operational. The idea of a first-person shooter in which time is linked to the protagonist's movements convinced thousands of people, who poured into the subsequent Kickstarter campaign, opened to find the necessary funds for development. Also in this case the collection went beyond the wildest expectations and instead of the one hundred thousand dollars requested, more than two hundred and fifty thousand were obtained. In short, all that was missing was the game. After about two years of development, SUPERHOT is finally here. Let's try to understand what it offers, because it holds many surprises. We have reviewed SUPERHOT, the shooter in which the passage of time is linked to the protagonist DOS secrets Starting it, you find yourself in front of a menu that seems to come out of a title for MS-Dos. On the left are listed files and folders to explore (do it, because there's a lot of interesting extra material, including two minigames in ASCii graphics). Before starting with the actual shootings, you are involved in a chat which immediately clarifies how for the main campaign, the developers have focused on a highly meta-playful story. One of our contacts will advise us to download a new game, SUPERHOT, of which he provides us with the cracked executable (superhot.exe). The chat is interactive in its own way, because we will have to write our answers; better, we will have to pretend to answer. In fact, it will be enough to press random keys on the keyboard and in our text box the sentences preset by the developers will form which will continue the dialogue. Two dead enemies, but the third one is ready to shoot Downloaded the game we are ready to go into action. We will return later to the more strictly narrative part of SUPERHOT, which offers several interesting ideas, but we try to follow the order imposed by the gameplay in discovering the game elements. Started superhot.exe you find yourself in a white colored and highly stylized environment. It's not wrong to use the phrase ~minimalist, leaning towards the abstract~ to describe it. The objects are recognizable, as is the place as a whole, but there is nothing detailed or colorful, apart from the enemies, who are faceless red puppets. Strangely they are all still. If you've tried the prototype you already know what it means and that it's not a mistake: SUPERHOT's game time is frozen, i.e. it only flows when we move. In reality, in most cases it also advances by itself, but very slowly. The goal is pretty obvious: kill everyone using firearms (pistols, shotguns, assault rifles) or melee (maces or katanas). In some cases, even punches will do. The peculiarity compared to any other FPS is that here the action proceeds in jerks, alternating movement with observation. It is true that we are armed, but a single shot is enough for the adversaries to bring us down. So we have to move carefully and move in accordance with their position, dodging bullets and trying to never find ourselves surrounded. We have to use time to our advantage, literally. In some situations it seems to be playing chess, rather than a first person shooter. killstagram Dodging bullets is almost as fun as shooting them In the first level we easily kill all the opponents, who to our delight when they die explode into a thousand red fragments, losing their weapons. We are told nothing about who they are and the nature of what we are doing, questions that will be partially answered as the campaign progresses. With the next missions we are introduced to other game mechanics, which enrich the action. For example, we discover that we can jump (it's not as obvious as it seems, given the type of gameplay), that we can grab the weapons lost by the enemies on the fly, that we can throw our weapons at them to make them lose their grip on theirs, that we can use objects of the scenario (colored in black) in the same way and, finally, to be able to transfer our soul into the enemies themselves (useful in some situations to get out of the way). At the end of each level, what is the real catchphrase of the game starts: the action just performed is repeated at real speed, therefore without pauses or slowdowns, with sotto the writing SUPERHOT obsessively pronounced by a voice whose origin we do not know. It is not just an accessory phase, that is merely decorative, but a moment in which it is possible to save clips of what we have done, using a practical and fast editor, so as to be able to share them online on the social network killstagram.com (go there , there are already several, including some of ours). Will-o'-the-wisp But the time has come to go back to talking about history, trying to link it to the rest. After a handful of levels, the game takes us back to the DOS screen described in the previous paragraph. Our chat contact informs us that there is a new version of the game with more levels unlocked which cracked version already exists. The graphic style creates visually fascinating situations. Back to playing. The plot of SUPERHOT has two obvious characteristics: one we have already mentioned, i.e. the meta-narrative, while the other is not exactly an advantage, given that it appears specious compared to the gameplay. Let's try to explain ourselves better: the constant references to what is outside the game, with references that gradually become more disturbing, create a suspended atmosphere, which leads us to reflect on the nature of what we are doing, up to a final spot on, as phoned. The narrative techniques employed (chat, downloaded executables, system glitches with hidden messages, even returning to the desktop) do their job well, only that nothing we do has any connection with what is being told. Mind you that we are not talking about a logical link, of which we are frankly of little interest, but about the more decisive one with which the mechanics assume an effective role in the story. In this SUPERHOT it partially fails, and we arrive at the end as if we had taken a journey on two different trains: on one side the story and on the other the action. Both are interesting in their own way, but at some point it becomes clear that they can live independently, even without ever meeting. The real game To make clear the distance we are talking about, the additional contents that are unlocked after the end of the main campaign and which end up representing the true fulcrum of the whole experience. To put it very crudely: it's the additional modes that justify the price, because they're the only ones that magnify the time-manipulating mechanic. Fortunately, it is accessed very early, given that the narrative campaign, let's call it that, lasts less than two hours, and that's when SUPERHOT blossoms. Don't panic: they stay put until we move Basically these modes go to deepen all aspects of the gameplay. Thus we have the Endless mode, which asks you to kill as many opponents as possible without dying, with variations such as killing the largest number within a given time, or killing a certain number before the timer expires. Then come the challenges, twelve in total, which ask us, for example, to pass the levels by holding only the Katana, or to do it using only the transfer of the soul and so on. Between challenges and Endless mode, the hours of play multiply, because they are determined not only by the conclusion of the single challenge, but also by the pleasure one feels in improving one's results, almost as if it were a sports title. From a technical point of view SUPERHOT is the classic independent product that focuses entirely on style. It is made up of a series of essential graphic elements, represented in more symbolic than realistic forms, with particular attention to chromatisms. The models of the enemies are all the same, but they do their job, since conceptually the art direction seems to have wanted to aim at alienating the player; interpretation reinforced by the soundtrack, made of very repetitive sounds. Speaking of more practical matters, we were quite annoyed by some incorrect collision detections of shots on the bodies of enemies. In some cases we have seen the bullet pass through an opponent without doing anything to him, while in others an apparently missed shot has instead produced its lethal effects. Nothing tragic, all things considered, but overhauling the hitboxes wouldn't hurt at all.", "date": "2016-02-25", "grade": "8.8"}
