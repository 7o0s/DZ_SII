Play the course as you find it. If you can't do one or the other do what's right, but to do what's right you must know the Rules of Golf.~ And Electronic Arts undoubtedly knows about virtual golf: its PGA Tour series has a long history - even if not always noble - but the abrupt interruption after the failure of Rory McIlroy PGA TOUR and the expiry of the agreements with the famous US tour in 2018 they had made us suspect a perhaps definitive departure of the company from the game of golf. Fortunately this was not the case, and the technological innovations fielded by the developers made it possible to create an excellent compromise between a realistic rendering of an incredibly complex sport and the necessary playfulness that must be typical of its videogame ~conversion~. EA SPORTS PGA TOUR offers excellent reconstructions of all the most famous courses in the world - from Augusta National to The Old Course at St Andrews Links, passing through Pebble Beach - convincingly rendering the dynamics of the ball and proposing many different ways to try them out, both online and offline. If the performance of the professionals is perhaps the least prominent part of the work done by EA Sports, it is true that this does not affect the overall enjoyment of this experience, which chooses to reach the players in conjunction with the unmissable Masters in Augusta. We tell you in detail about our laps in the EA SPORTS PGA TOUR review. Return to Augusta National The technical work done for the reconstruction of the twenty-eight real fields present in EA SPORTS PGA TOUR is, in no uncertain terms, simply exceptional In this iteration of its franchise, EA has shown great attention to the reconstruction of the twenty-eight real fields available at the launch of the game (which, starting from April 4th, has benefited from a short period of early access). The choice of the Frostbite engine and the publication of EA SPORTS PGA TOUR only on current generation consoles and on PC have allowed the developers to devote themselves to what are, in all respects, the best videogame returns of the most famous fields in the world: through photogrammetry and with the aid of drones and helicopters, a level of care and realism has been reached that is simply unequaled in the history of videogame golf, with particular regard to the characteristics that make each course unique. For example, the ball race on the Augusta National greens - among the fastest on the planet, as enthusiasts well know - is totally different from what happens on other courses. A parenthesis: EA Sports knows very well that the possibility of playing on the Augusta field is the most requested feature in video games dedicated to the noblest of sports. Augusta National had made its videogame debut in Tiger Woods PGA Tour 12, after three years of tribulations from the EA Tiburon team who had dealt with its reconstruction: the management of the field had given its consent to the presence in the videogame on condition that the route performance was perfect. In the relaunch of the franchise, EA has once again secured the exclusive right to portray the iconic Georgian course, and the commitment to being the home of the Masters Tournament has paid off exceptionally well. Some moments of play on iconic courses like Augusta National or Pebble Beach are truly atmospheric These are the details that should distinguish a product which, also due to the certainly ~niche~ nature of the game of golf, is historically intended for an attentive and informed public. The dynamics of the ball has been reconstructed in a manic way thanks to the partnership between EA Sports and TrackMan. Born in Denmark as a radar to optimize the launch of grenades and projectiles, TrackMan was then ~converted~ to civilian use as a tool to measure the behavior of the golf club and the ball upon impact and during flight. This allowed the developers to consider a large number of parameters to build compelling behaviors for the EA SPORTS PGA TOUR virtual balls. A trained eye sees the difference, except for a certain difficulty in managing running shots, with truly unpredictable results. We report a not always happy choice of camera angle, which does not always allow you to correctly read the effects imprinted on the fly of the ball: this is perhaps the strongest criticism that we feel like making to the production as a whole. Lots of game modes EA SPORTS PGA TOUR offers numerous game modes, both online and offline, and extensive possibilities for customizing the difficulty and the gaming experience as a wholesso The title offers four offline and three online game modes. As for the former, we start from Quick Play, in which it is also possible to play in local multiplayer mode for up to four players: there are several possible variables (for example by choosing different rules) for hit and run games. The Career mode is more articulated, which introduces stimulating RPG elements with a skill tree and a level system that take advantage of the variety of possible shots in the game and build an interesting progression: not only do the stats increase, but as the number increases of shots available, proposed in an intelligent way during the game for the selection by the player (for example, it is never proposed to shoot a drive if you are on the green). The experience points level up our avatar, which can be generated via an editor that provides many possibilities (albeit preset) and allows you to create fairly refined characters, as well as allowing you to choose whether to start from an amateur golfer, a Korn Ferry Tour professional or a big shot of the PGA Tour. The idea of the Challenges mode is excellent, where you can retrace the exploits of a particular professional in the flesh in golf matches that have remained in the legend: a gem that demonstrates EA Sports' awareness of its target audience primary. Within this section we find the PGA Coach Skill Center, a great way to learn more about the various game mechanics, shot types and the game of golf in general. As for Tournaments, there are limited-time tournaments and the players' results are entered into a world ranking; Seasonal events on the pro golf calendar will change the tournaments offered. Moving on to the three online modes, Competitive offers matchmaking based on the level of the players, while Social has a more relaxed tone and does not feature rankings of any kind. Obviously, it is possible to organize online matches with friends via the Private Match option, which offers ample possibilities for customizing the gameplay and field lap settings. Career mode offers the option to start as an amateur golfer, Korn Ferry Tour pro, or established PGA Tour pro The matches are enhanced by commentators who give, on average, valid results: excellent performance by Frank Nobilo and very pleasant Notah Begay III - one of the very few Native Americans to have played on the PGA Tour - as teller (the figure following the professionals directly on the field and tells the shots live). Many pros available, from Scottie Scheffler (current number one in the world) to Xander Schauffele, without forgetting Nelly Korda and other professionals from the LPGA Tour. Incidentally, we found the inclusion of eight professionals from LIV Golf - the rival tour - rather curious of PGA - out of twenty-two available, but it is true that it would have been difficult to give up strong names such as Dustin Johnson, Bubba Watson, Ian Poulter and Brooks Koepka. An experience suitable for (any) golfer With twenty different strokes, EA SPORTS PGA TOUR offers ample possibilities to tackle the thirty courses present, all presented to the player in the right context The technologies are there, a wide choice of modalities as well, but what is the feeling of this virtual reproduction of the game of golf? The answer is: faithful, but playful the right way. While PGA Tour 2K21 invested the player more with simulation-like details, EA SPORTS PGA TOUR adopts a more simplified, but no less interesting approach. We have already mentioned the great variety of shots available and the realism with which they are offered to the player; we add a non-invasive interface, but full of useful information managed in a compact and elegant way (slopes, strength and direction of the wind...) and easy management of the strength of the shot and the effects to be imparted to the flight of the ball. However, the gameplay is highly customizable, and if you want you can adopt a more arcade approach, inserting a grid to facilitate the direction of the putt or increasing the power of the shots; on the other hand, you can also choose to decrease or remove the assistance provided by the game to seek a more faithful experience. It is a pity that, given the large investments to render the fields and the flight of the ball in a realistic way, the same effort has not been made in the reconstruction of the athletic movement of the swing. This also applies to the professionals present in the game: while noting the effort in ~connecting~ to each pro his favorite ball flight (high, medium or low; with a turn from left to right in fade or from right to left in draw) and to render, sometimes in maWhile the pre-stroke routine and the professional set-up are surprisingly faithful (this is the case of the unmistakable Bryson DeChambeau), the swings are surprisingly similar to each other, rather cumbersome and not responsive to real dynamics. It must be said that these are obvious considerations for those who watch and/or play golf, while they are less important aspects for those who are exclusively passionate about the video game version of this sport; however, it is fair to report them, in the hope that the developers direct more effort to motion capture in the future. Shots and commentary are both very accurate and give an excellent feeling to the overall gaming experience We point out the presence of microtransactions for exclusively cosmetic items in the game shop, where you can buy bags, sticks and other branded equipment from the most famous brands in this field, such as Srixon or Callaway. There are many possibilities for customizing the difficulty; there are also many accessibility options in terms of audio, graphics and gameplay. From a technical point of view, EA SPORTS PGA TOUR does not worry the PlayStation 5 hardware in the slightest, especially considering that the framerate is locked at 30 fps on consoles; the glance is excellent, while the audience in the field - as historically happens in all titles of this genre - does not have a performance that we would define as extraordinary.", "date": "2023-04-07", "grade": "8.5"}
