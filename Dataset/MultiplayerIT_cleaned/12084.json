{"name": "PeepTris", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/peeptris.html", "text": "PeepTris is nothing more than a new version of the ever-green Tetris, only that the developers have seen fit to create greater interest in the male audience by inserting beautiful naked girls as backgrounds. The aim is more than trivial, we will have to correctly arrange the bricks that fall from above, fitting them perfectly to occupy every corner of the screen. To advance through the levels, which are almost infinite, we'll have to fill an ever-increasing percentage of the screen with pieces. It is possible to play by choosing three different degrees of difficulty, we recommend the most difficult one to make the experience more satisfying and the challenge decidedly more interesting, since at the basic level PeepTris is really elementary. The girls will stimulate the player by taking off their clothes as they complete the levels, so watch out for the minimum completion percentage to be able to advance. To diversify their game from tetris, Herocraft have also included bonuses, which will help us complete every little nook and cranny of our mobile phone screen. These aids provide us with several possibilities: the first one fills two lines above the point where it falls, another is its exact opposite and erases them, the next one allows us to complete two columns, our favorite is definitely the one that falls through the filled blocks until he finds an empty space and fills it in. Still others miraculously allow you to occupy all the spaces around their point of explosion, ending with the one that fills the whole screen (but you will see it very rarely). Of the excellent anchors of lifeline, there is no denying. Technically the real show is the girls, the game itself certainly does not squeeze the hardware of our mobile phones. The sprites are well defined and very colorful, with very saturated colors. The control system assigns the rotation of the tetris pieces to key 2 and the control of the same to the classic directional cross. PeepTris although it provides an almost endless challenge becomes repetitive and boring in a short time, certainly the stimulus to see the girls completely naked is there, but it's not enough. For sure this latest Herocraft game is ideal for quick games without too many complications.
