{"name": "Peter Jackson's King Kong", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/peter-jacksons-king-kong-2.html", "text": "King Kong died for our sins My name is Carl Denham, I'm the best director in Hollywood and, even if my producers don't think like me, today I'm going to mark the history of cinema by making the most beautiful film of all time. When everything seemed to turn against me, I luckily came into possession of an ancient map representing Skull Island and, may history not say Carl Denham doesn't jump at the chance of a lifetime, I immediately looked for a ship to sail into the unknown and beyond. Rumors surrounding me have made it difficult for me to find a suitable actress for the lead role, but I was lucky enough to meet Ann just when it seemed my plan would fall through due to lack of time. Ann Darrow is the result of Hollywood these days, an out-of-work New York actress just waiting for the first chance to dive into it. Hollywood has never understood Ann's greatness, I have. The ship left New York with a small crew at 8 in the evening, shortly before departure Jack Driscoll, my screenwriter, also joined us. Everything will work out perfectly, I'm sure.[...]After several days of travel, the Venture almost collided with the endless cliffs of Skull Island and my heart sank: the perfect location, the actress perfect, the perfect director. We have just disembarked and our crew's boats split due to strong currents, I didn't see when this happened, I was too busy with the preliminary environmental shots. Here on the beach I'd like to shoot a couple of close-ups of Ann, they might come in handy: Scream Ann! Scream as if your life depended on it!~... And so King Kong begins for 72 years now, and this is where the adventure begins: on the beach, with Ann's screams and the dark response from the hinterland. A frontline adventure The character on which the story will revolve almost completely will be the screenwriter Jack Driscoll who, armed with luck, will have to take on the responsibility of bringing to safety the small crew of the Venture landed on the island. The sections entrusted to him will be completely structured in a subjective view and will concern tasks such as solving puzzles, covering his companions from enemy attacks and paving the way for the rest of the group by extricating himself from the dense vegetation. During his wanderings he will be temporarily joined by other members of the team who will be able to provide him with useful support: Hayes, first officer of the Venture, will be our reserve escort of weapons, when we find ourselves in difficulty due to lack of weapons it will simply be possible to talk to him to have the one he's currently holding delivered; Jimmy is the youngest of the group and also the only other user of a firearm, Ann will be useful for opening the doors (more than once she will leave alone climbing the walls courageously to go and unlock unreachable levers) and for treating the wounds of comrades; and finally Carl useful to get into trouble in situations that are humanly impossible to imagine, just to have thirty seconds of extra footage. As a preliminary setting to the game it will be possible to set the absence or presence of aids such as the viewfinder displayed on the screen and the inventory of owned objects. Depending on this choice, it will be possible to set one's own level of approach to the adventure, but some considerations must be made: first of all, inventory means the simple display of the weapon in use at the top right of the screen and the number of bullets left , therefore no management of items, potions, bullets, keys and so on, as it should be, we must remember at all times that we find ourselves on an island forgotten by God, following a makeshift landing and that as far as the fate may be favorable you will never find trees dripping with healing potions, the skill of the player will be in managing weapons and forces to move from one area to another; the second consideration concerns the viewfinder, although it may seem immediate to think of a 'simplified' version of the game with the viewfinder of the weapons clearly visible, it must be said instead that the mode that does not have it is a little simpler due to the system of game that quietly overlooks accuracy and accepts even those close enough to the target as winning shots. Returning to the island and its hostilities, although the lack of weapons is sometimes felt (without going into too much detail: going through the valley of the brontosaurs armed with a disposable pike can be frustrating at times) it undoubtedly gives the game a much more realistic air, effectively increasing the tension of the player who must pay more attention to strategies to sip every single colpo. The game is divided into chapters, each of these punctuated by a first short sequence in FMV which marks the path taken on the map (the graphic design closely resembles the one used for moving around in Indiana Jones, the film), and a second which retraces the highlights just experienced and sometimes anticipates those to come. Jack's journey within the island is defined a priori: it will never happen to find himself in front of an inextricable jungle and have to come out of it, the never acclaimed invisible walls guide the character and avoid him bad wanderings in unknown lands, it remains this is probably the only limitation to reality, a limitation on the other hand that is inevitable due to how the game is structured. the actual shortage of weapons leads the player to waste nothing A frontline adventure Along the way the player will have the opportunity to collect various weapons found in crates hanging from trees (parachuted from planes) or simply broken on the ground, when Jack picks up a weapon he will be forced to abandon the old one, this type of choice associated with the The actual shortage of weapons leads the player to waste nothing: more than once it will happen to find a chest on his way, temporarily abandon the ammunition and continue to look for animals to kill in order to completely run out of ammunition and then go back to the chest just passed to take the new load and start again. There will be various moments in which, once the ammunition is finished, it will be necessary to settle for the spades found along the way or simply the bones of dead animals extracted from the abandoned carcasses: as if to underline that the universe of King Kong is real and tangible the spades will be in number finished, if there are four leaning against a wall, only four can be taken; live in a different numerical universe instead the bones of animals that can be recovered in almost infinite number. Spades and bones will also play an important role in terms of puzzles: these can be set on fire to reveal secret passages, to light hearths or simply take down the most difficult enemies faster. The name is Kong, King Kong. Opposed to the figure of Jack Driscoll there will be Kong, the king of Skull Island. Kong is the second (and last) playable character during the adventure, his mission will be to chase and save Ann and fight against any enemy that will jeopardize his salvation. Kong will be played in the third person, with a control system that closely resembles that used for Prince of Persia: it will be possible to move by running along walls, climb trees and columns, jump and cling to branches to swing and jump again. The sections dedicated to Kong thrive on a constant dichotomy: on the one hand the task will be purely circus, or moving within a pre-established setting without falling or being too slow for the purpose of the mission; on the other hand, it will essentially be necessary to fight (big) hands against everything that moves and stands in front of us, Ann excluded. In the combat parts, the gorillon will have the possibility of performing different moves and countermoves, even if to be cynical everything could be resolved in a normal incoherent pressure of keys; things become different when you go from small enemies to bigger ones: V-Rex. Here a greater basic strategy will be needed to complete the fight and give Kong the possibility of executing one of the two final moves (a sort of animal-like fatality in which one takes the opponent by the jaws and opens him in two or hurls itself into orbit). The parts of the game where it is possible to use Kong, while representing the peak of enjoyment of the game, are undermined by two defects: excessive ease (as opposed to the rest of the game) and some evident stability problems in terms of frames (it will happen more than once the game slows down while performing your evolutions between walls and trees). Darwinism and the food chain. These are the two concepts behind the entire game strategy that can be implemented in King Kong, the real aspect towards which the game experience has turned weighs heavily on the life of Jack and his companions and so expedients are devised to avoid the direct clashes, to divert attention, not to waste bullets, to survive. One of the possibilities offered by the game is linked to the concept of the food chain: there are some non-dangerous animals on Skull Island that represent the last link in the chain, Jack will just have to stick one of them on his pike and throw it from theat the opposite side of the direction useful for him to move and distract the other animals present in the location; the carcasses of the larger animals will offer a succulent banquet to other smaller animals, leaving the protagonist's presence almost unnoticed. In the first encounter with the V-Rex, the only way to be able to distract him long enough to allow the others to escape, will be to shoot the pterodactyls flying above his head and thus offer a tribute of meat to the large dinosaur. The fittest survives said Darwin, but in King Kong cunning pays off. The fittest survives said Darwin, but in King Kong cunning pays off. Graphically speaking, King Kong looks like an excellent product, with attention to the smallest details to give the final result as similar as possible to the film and therefore to reality, and a series of graphic subtleties make it even more pleasant: the transparencies, the rendering of water, kong's fur, the incredible texture of the dinosaurs, the visual rendering of the characters who resemble their flesh-and-blood counterparts in appearance and gestures. Jade, the engine used for the game has been tested for years (beyond good and evil, Prince of Persia) and does its job perfectly without particular hesitations except -in some moments- in the sections with Kong and allows the game to scroll smoothly even in the most tangled moments, with enemies attacking from all sides. The game has been treated in many parts as if it were a film, carefully choosing cinematic cuts and cameras that increase the intensity of the moment experienced, these clips do not create elements of discontinuity with the rest, on the contrary they blend perfectly with the game sequences going to create a complete product from the point of view of direction and screenplay. Sound management is another strong point of King Kong: the game is spoken in practically every part of it, when you pick up a weapon Jack broods to himself on the number of clips left and the same thing every time he needs to reload ( hence the possibility of disabling the inventory, Jack gives the player all the information he needs), when we move away from the rest of the group we hear the distant voices of the others who call us to find out where we are going, when an npc needs help it is possible to understand from the depth of field in which point of the location it is. The music remains largely out of the game, letting the noises of the environment being visited allow the player to recognize signs of an enemy presence or not, and limiting themselves to underlining moments of particular intensity. Multi-platform box The Ps2, Pc, Xbox and Gamecube versions remain essentially very similar to each other. The only discriminating factors concern the decidedly superior graphics sector in the PC version, followed by Xbox and PS2 and with the cube version bringing up the rear, which denotes the usual video compression problems of poorly defined textures. For the rest, it should be noted that there is a limited edition version for pc and ps2 containing an extra dvd on the making of the game (with Perter Jackson in the middle, there was almost a bet) and a series of postcards depicting the characters. Comment Fun, anxious and exciting, these could be three useful aspects to describe what King Kong represents, a highly strategic and tragically realistic game (you understand that you really needed bullets at the same time you shoot the last one) implanted in a solid graphic sector and enriched by an excellent sound compartment. All in all, King Kong is affected by some problems: too easy in the gorilla sections, too short to complete and with some scattered slowdowns. However, King Kong ultimately remains a good game, probably one of the best tie-ins of recent years, and if the care placed in every single aspect of programming is even only partially a merit of Jackson then there is only to be hoped that total passion for video games. Pros: The strong realistic component forces the player to think before acting Excellent sound Intuitive and comfortable control system The beasts in the game seem real Cons: The sections with Kong, albeit fun, are too simple poor longevity some hesitation of the graphics engine The film industry has always been hand-in-hand with the video game industry, since time immemorial we remember more or less successful conversions of the most successful films in the cinema. The video game therefore intended not only as playful entertainment but also as an alternative advertising vehicle for a film. With the advent of new visual technologies, the cinema-video game union has tightened", "date": "2005-11-28", "grade": null}
