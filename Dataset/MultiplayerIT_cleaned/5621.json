{"name": "Non tagliare!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/165807-dirt-rally-non-tagliare.html", "text": "We can almost imagine the moment in which a small group of ~dissidents~ in Birmingham decided to carry out a small parallel project to the great serial releases of Codemasters. After the glories of Colin McRae, the English studio seemed too enmeshed in the excessive arcade of DiRT, in the seriality of an F1 which, in order to be released on time every year, must give up either contents or serious beta testing, in the all-encompassing nature of a GRID which, in order to to please many ends up displeasing everyone, and this situation was beginning to seriously weigh on the reputation of the once beloved team. This must have been the driving force that prompted Paul Coleman, who in life in addition to the video game designer is also a rally co-driver, to undertake DiRT Pulse, the code name by which DiRT Rally was known during development. Starting with a sincere and challenging driving model, building a game around it and submitting it all to the love of fans by taking advantage of Steam Early Access. Released in full version in December, DiRT Rally was a success on PC not only for sales, but above all for the luster it was able to restore to the brand. On consoles, fortunately, it's the same game. Are you ready to rule hell? Fresh off its success on PC, DiRT Rally comes to consoles, and it's the same awesome, exhilarating game! Yellow for simulation To affirm that DiRT Rally is not a raw simulation, it is not necessary to have been in a Subaru Impreza WRC launched at full speed between the icy hairpin bends of Montecarlo, but it is enough to have played the old Richard Burns Rally a bit. DiRT Rally, on the other hand, is simply the currently most successful incarnation of that ~simcade~ philosophy that Codemasters has been heralding to the world for years, which is potentially a very intelligent thing if you want to give players the idea of really taming a racing car from hundreds of horses without passing them through the necessary years of experience, and which, however, too often had resulted in a sterile and soulless compromise. The impression one gets while whizzing through the German countryside or over the Greek hills parched by the sun is that this time the team has started from the real behavior of the cars and then limited itself only to sweetening those aspects of driving that could be more frustrating: you can use a the accelerator a little more when exiting corners than in reality, before the car goes into a spin, there is a certain margin of error in using the countersteer and the handbrake definitely does not punish as much as it should for a its abuse, but everything was dosed by people who demonstrate their love and for the discipline, and for the players. We affirm that we started from extremely realistic models because everything can be seen, for example, in the physics of the car which responds as it should to the thousands of stresses to which it is subjected, and every slightest change to the set-up then has significant effects on driving, as happens when each parameter is governed by the right routine. You can feel the difference between a very fast but nervous Lancia Stratos that is phenomenal on asphalt and a more polite Fiat 131 Abarth, less flashy but much more manageable when facing the Swedish snow. And the surfaces themselves make for an extraordinarily varied and realistic feeling: the difference is stark not only between concrete and ice, but also between coarse gravel and thin gravel, which other games would consider a mere detail. Crawling on the Monegasque rocks is very different from brushing against a pile of snow, and the player has to get used to managing dozens of different situations, quickly passing from one approach to another within the same stage, even several times. Only one shots Said of the small and positive licenses that the driving model takes, everything else exudes pure realism. The differences between cars and between surfaces which we have already mentioned are enhanced with the use of a good steering wheel: in this case the force feedback gives very strong sensations, the adherence, or lack thereof, of the car to the road surface is clearly felt not only exalting the person wielding the peripheral, but also allowing him, such is the level of simulation in this sector, to combine touch with the eye - and hearing, as we will see - in driving as is rarely seen in a video game. A steering wheel which also has the clutch pedal as well as a lever to be used as a handbrake allows you to get rid of all the aids and take advantage of the definitive experience, which is obviously not advisable for those who use the joypad, but it must be said that the DualShock 4 behaves in a surprising way: sensitive and precise, suitably calibrated according to one's preferences, it allows remarkable performances andreturns convincing sensations. All this work is subordinated to only one thing - the satisfaction of the player. At the beginning you will struggle a lot, but DiRT Rally is the classic title that draws a silly smile on your sweaty face when you have managed to properly manage a difficult and infamous stretch, a blind curve 1 perhaps positioned after a straight with lots of jumping, with the tires struggling to gain grip on the gravel and the co-driver who gives you directions in a precise and not at all aseptic way, using simplified but complete jargon and helping to raise even more realism and involvement. And the beauty is that once you have passed this stretch you will realize that you have perfectly dosed the brake, accelerator, steering and you will not even know how you did it. You will have entered that trance phase in which not so much thoughts as senses are enslaved to a single intent, to be as fast as possible while avoiding damage as much as possible. Because here too DiRT Rally shows off a ruthless realism to say the least: not always excellent in its aesthetic rendering, the damage system is very well implemented for the consequences on driving. Often they don't compromise the race (but try to finish a stage without a tire or without lights in the night...) but they make themselves felt, and there are some that automatically lead to withdrawal. Not to mention that, the flashbacks gone, it is now possible to restart an event, and not even all of them, for example not those in which you compete online, only from the beginning and a limited number of times; and we happened to ride beautifully for a long non-repeating online event and make a stupid mistake a few turns from the finish by falling off a cliff. It should be frustrating, but it has only increased the esteem for the game and the desire to improve. Playstation 4 trophies A total of 48 Trophies awaits the best drivers: 37 Bronze, 8 Silver, 2 Gold and the inevitable Platinum. Most are those that are expected from such a game and are earned on the occasion of the first stage victory, a rally or a championship and when particular goals are achieved in one's career, but there are also those a little more singular: aware of having crafted an extremely demanding and very little merciful game, in Codemasters they have seen fit to reward even rollovers and fatal accidents. But be careful, you will only get the prize once, then it will only be tears and sweat. Bump, bump, curve 2, ecstasy In this infernal rally paradise, DiRT Rally throws us without compliments: there is a tutorial but it consists of a series of complete but not very useful videos to really get familiar with the dirt roads. In fact, a certain lack of modality is perhaps the main defect of the game, and a witness of its particular nature. You will participate in the events, both those proposed by the team and personalized, based on your ability: you start with an open championship, qualifying in the first three you will pass to the amateurs and so on up to the master category, and since the cars are divided into groups, depending of the decade of production and of the typology, if for example you pass the Amateur Championship with a car from the 80s you will not be able to participate again with one from the notorious Group B, which marked a legendary and fatal era of the discipline; a little more completeness and flexibility would not have hurt. By placing in a rally, you earn credits with which you can not only expand your garage, but also forage the team made up of a chief mechanic and up to 4 engineers, essential for both updates and repairs, to be carried out every two stages. And there are 6 rallies, Greece, Finland, Sweden, Germany, Wales and Montecarlo, each with its own characteristics, reproduced by satellite and therefore planimetrically faithful, we can imagine how Codemasters then took some liberties on the road to promote entertainment and gameplay: the result is excellent here too. Said of the presence of online events divided on a daily, weekly and monthly basis that compare your times with those of players from all over the world (but just one mistake and you're out), classic rallies are joined by Rallycross on closed circuits, the only discipline that sees you compete not against the clock but against other pilots (and the only one that therefore lends itself to online PvP) and the Hillclimb, the spectacular and very dangerous climb on the hairpin bends of Pikes Peak in Colorado reproduced in an extraordinarily faithful way. to which two groups of vehicles are dedicated. These are now in their fifties, seven new ones will also be introduced on PC to celebrate the console release; they may still seem smallhi but the care proposed in the reproduction of each one is painstaking, and not only in the behavior. Even graphically the cars are remarkable; if on very gifted PCs the old Ego Engine sparks, for the console versions the team has focused decisively on 60 frames per second, 1080p on PlayStation 4 and dynamics, from 900 to 1080, on Xbox One. We can do nothing but promote the choice with full marks. It's true, spending a lot of time, especially in the early hours, with the car stopped perhaps in front of a rock, one realizes that some textures aren't exactly state of the art, that the little men in the audience are modeled at random better and than many other small compromises, however the granitic fluidity makes the most of not only the show, but also the actual driving, allowing total control over the action. And when moving, you don't pay attention to certain details. Thanks to a rich modeling and certain spectacular effects (the sun's rays passing through a dense forest, the water from a puddle hitting the windshield giving you a few moments of absolute panic...) DiRT Rally reaches sublime moments: driving in the night is an intimate experience, with the rain it becomes even terrible. There is also a view from the cockpit that is among the best ever seen: the maniacal reproduction of some interiors is never an obstacle to a perfect understanding of the route. The picture is completed by a sound that is also exceptional, and also completely subservient to the gameplay: if we have already spoken of the navigator, the roar of the engines is exhilarating and perfect, but the climax is reached in some details such as the effect of the climbs or of the brakes especially in some models, and even of the different hints that the various noises of the car assume in the presence of particular damages. With experience you will even be able to understand from a certain noise what problem your racing car has and change driving accordingly: and if this is not a testimony to the value of DiRT Rally, we really don't know what to tell you anymore.", "date": "2016-03-29", "grade": "9.0"}
