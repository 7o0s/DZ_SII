{"name": "Zeno Clash II", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/118239-zeno-clash-2-una-pioggia-di-cazzotti.html", "text": "The first Zeno Clash was released in 2009. The then unknown ACE Team, a group of Chilean developers at their first work, gave the world of video games a little pearl full of creativity and innovative ideas, whose charm was concentrated on a system of deep combat and the decidedly original and out of the box graphic style, as well as the adult and captivating plot. If we want the same was repeated with the release of their second title, Rock of Ages, of a completely different kind (in the role of a sphere it was necessary to break through some strongholds) but always extremely sought after from an artistic point of view. Zeno Clash II starts again from the first chapter, but tries the path of free roaming instead of settling on the old linear level structure. The story picks up where we left off the good Ghat, protagonist of the first and also of this adventure, and begins with the alliance with Father Mother, the final boss of the original, born to be able to defeat the Golem, an apparently invincible enemy who would like to bring some ' of order in this barbaric and lawless world, where the population makes decisions by fighting each other. Unfortunately, it should be noted immediately that the narrative side is weaker than that of the first Zeno Clash and that, despite some twists, which we obviously won't tell you about so as not to anticipate anything, the plot is limited to being the classic saving of the situation. The choice to create a more open world has also rarefied the story, with not very incisive results that clash a little with the scenic beauty of the planet Zenozoik. In short, it almost seems that ACE Team wanted to sacrifice part of one of its strengths to try to experience a more captivating gameplay and honor the current market. We just have to take note of it and try to find out if it was worth it. Free from what? The first question to ask when renovating a video game is whether the process worked, or whether something was lost along the way. Zeno Clash was essentially a first-person fighting game that was certainly not penalized by the closed levels. Indeed, perhaps the underlying linearity that characterized it made it possible to enhance its virtues that resided elsewhere. Free roaming is a choice of field that involves great risks. In Zeno Clash II the maps are open and freely explorable. The player goes around to join yet another brawl, to look for some weapon, some skill totem and nothing else. The individual areas are only large links in a chain that doesn't have much to offer, except in terms of landscape composition, which we will discuss later. Honestly speaking, after playing for a while you don't really understand what it was for to break through linearity, given that the possible interactions with the elements scattered around the scenario are very limited and the fulcrum of the gameplay remains combat. Moreover, exploration is a bit penalized due to the bad map, really not very functional and inadequate for a similar title, given that it lacks any detailed information that can help the player wander around an open world without getting lost. In short, the stimuli for exploration are really poor and it doesn't matter to get a good weapon or find yet another shell full of supplies; so what matters above all is knowing how to throw punches and kicks as if there were no tomorrow. Feeling issues Fortunately ACE Team has not touched the combat system and, on the contrary, has worked a lot to improve it, making it more varied thanks to new combos and some lateral additions. As happened in the first Zeno Clash, also in this second chapter punching enemies gives great satisfaction (much more than using firearms). Combat is extremely physical and multifaceted. Ghat can strike in various ways with punches and kicks, charge attacks on the run, dodge opponents' moves with rapid movements, or parry their blows while trying to counterattack. There is no shortage of particularly satisfying grips (complete with a pile driver) and there is also a rich collection of melee weapons, especially useful against larger enemies (taking a gigantic hammer and shaking it against enemies gives its satisfaction). By exploring, Ghat gets the classic experience points by touching totems, which he can spend to improve himself. One of the features introduced in Zeno Clash II is charisma, which has a specific function in the game economy, because it opens up another novelty: allies. During his adventure, Ghat can hire some allies to help him in fights. Unfortunately, many of these, usually the best ones, will acceptor to follow him and help him only if you have an adequate level of charisma. Otherwise they will flatly refuse to lift a finger. In other cases, fortunately, the help will be contextual to the situation and will not be denied to us (for example, entering the prisons, almost at the beginning of the game, you can free a prisoner who will be happy to accompany us). Allies remain on the battlefield until they are out of energy, then disappear and return after healing. The umbrella on the sewing machine Technically Zeno Clash II is a joy to behold. Its strength certainly does not lie in the richness of the three-dimensional models or in who knows what ability to exploit modern graphics cards, but in the refinement of its scenographic elements, with the different areas that seem to come out of a surrealist painting (one perceives the love of graphic designer for painting). In general we can say that for the third time in its history, ACE Team has shown that something visually wonderful can be created without necessarily having to give the technology used a muscular connotation. Among the spiers of crazy buildings, which give cities a grim but soft look at the same time, and delicate but daring landscapes, populated by strange animals, Zeno Clash II is a journey into the impossible that makes it very well from a purely touristic point of view . Let's just hope that next time we manage to harmonize such visual richness with adequate free roaming mechanics. As a last note, we report that the game features a cooperative mode that allows you to go around brawling with another human player. As usual, playing with someone else increases the fun and, in this case, makes some of the limits we talked about in the body of the article more digestible.", "date": "2013-05-08", "grade": "6.8"}
