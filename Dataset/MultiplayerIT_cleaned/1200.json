{"name": "Terminator 3: The Redemption", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/terminator-3-the-redemption-2.html", "text": "Asta la vista amigo Since the first FMV, to be clear the one that introduces the player to the first mission, one can sense the willingness on the part of the developers to tell almost the same episodes of the last chapter of the trilogy, albeit adding some precious scenes. We will, in fact, be able to see how the T800 killed John Connor and how he was captured and reprogrammed by his wife and his team, topics just mentioned in the film. It won't be long, however, to hold the pad and be able to drive, for the umpteenth time, the metal 'terminator'. This Terminator 3: The Redemption immediately reveals itself as an old school action, mostly made up of fights without too many thoughts and car chases with few crossroads and lots of adrenaline. The first hours of the game are fun, above all for the feeling that is felt right from the start with a balanced and intuitive control system, and for that cheeky air derived from the destruction of everything in motion without too many thoughts. Then the curtain falls and the problems begin. The repetitiveness of the missions and the monotony will soon become the pivot of a game that always seems to have to take off, but never does. The same difficulty of the game starts from the beginning at rather high levels, also thanks to the impossibility of having any check point within the mission, it certainly does not help to increase the interest, becoming, at times, frustrating. The parts in which our cybernetic hero will have to contend on foot will mostly be characterized by attacking continuously going into danger, without having moves with which to dodge the blows and without ever being able to find a shelter to catch his breath. We will be able to hit rival cyborgs from a distance, with the help of a weapon in the hand, or manage hand-to-hand fights with headbutts and punches. It will also be possible to interact with some elements of the seabed, such as road signs or machine guns on the ground, with which to damage enemies more. The repetitiveness of the missions and the monotony will soon become the pivot of a game that always seems to have to take off, but never does. Asta la vista amigo The situations aboard a vehicle improve the situation, in which, in addition to having to shoot left and right, you will have to run away or chase depending on the mission. The feature in which the enemies, once run over, like good terminators all in one piece, go back up the slope of the car to attempt a last, desperate, offensive. On the other hand, the infrared viewer and the possibility of enhancing four statuses within a special menu are of little use: in theory they should increase the capabilities of one's alter ego, in practice, however, without fully succeeding. Technically this Terminator 3: The Redemption always manages to remain on discrete levels, with an overall reliable frame rate despite the frequent chaotic situations. Polygonal models of enemies and protagonist rather cared for in construction, a little less for texture. On the other hand, the settings are fluctuating, which will range from detailed to bare without too many in between. Some good particle and light effects embellish this Atari-branded title. On the sound front we find a soundtrack that travels in parallel with the counterpart heard in the film, and an Italian dubbing that is always up to par. Without making too much effort, given the previous ones, this Terminator 3: The Redemption presents itself to users as the best title dedicated to the Hollywood cyborg. Unfortunately it suffers from quite a few conceptual and manufacturing defects, but it must also be said that for a few hours it is able to entertain without having to activate the gray matter. Mostly recommended to fans of the saga and to those who want a few games without too many thoughts. For those who do not belong to these categories, a test ride before buying is highly recommended. Pros: Initially fun. Technically up to par. Correct control system. Cons: In the long run repetitive. At times frustrating. Action anchored in rather ancient game concepts. The cinema of the eighties. With a tear on your face you could almost say: ~What a good time.~ Those were the times of muscular men with catchphrases always in the barrel, the times in which we were often and willingly surprised, the times, needless to say, of important dualisms. It was precisely the era in which the audiences of fans were divided between supporters of Stallone and Schwarzenegger. Brawl stuff, not motes. While one was breaking the box office with yet another Rocky or Rambo as appropriate, the other was rolling up his sleeves to give him a hard time as much as possible. The pinnacle of Schwarzy's success was achieved by impersonating the legendary cyborg with a high AI and, at least in the first episode, the incessantand brutal attitude to destroy and kill. We are talking about the Terminator and, more specifically, a saga that entered history with the first two episodes, and for the original concept, and for the special effects that were avant-garde in those years. With the third, and so far last, recent episode, the saga has inevitably diminished, demonstrating how often the name is not enough to make a cult film. The same thing goes for the tie-ins dedicated to this celluloid production, which so far have never proved to be up to the task, bordering on one ugliness and another. Atari, after yet another disappointment with the official license of The Rise of The Machine, has decided to try again with Terminator 3: The Redemption.", "date": "2004-10-04", "grade": null}
