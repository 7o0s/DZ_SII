Titles that came out of nowhere or almost, perhaps with a modest technical sector, which however have turned into a cult phenomenon, conquering tens of millions of users and making their authors earn a lot of money. We are talking about a business model that no one can afford to ignore, in short, and which with the right ingredients has the potential to guarantee a solid source of revenue for a publisher, profits that perhaps can be reinvested in the production of traditional triple-A games. Bandai Namco has been experimenting in this sense for some time now, with truly fluctuating results. The idea of the Japanese house is quite clear: to take the structure of its most representative franchises and adapt it to a free to play context, thus providing gamers with an experience that is anything but improvised, but equipped with solid foundations, familiar mechanics and of a technical sector that lives up to expectations, which never hurts. With Tekken Revolution and Soul Calibur: Lost Swords this formula has unfortunately not returned the desired results, so now it's up to the developers of Project Aces to make their own attempt with Ace Combat Infinity. Ace Combat Infinity doesn't seem to have approached a delicate and controversial model like the F2P in the best way Stop for a moment at the automatic Downloaded the client for free from the PlayStation Store, Ace Combat Infinity offers for the moment only two modes: campaign and online cooperative. The campaign consists of five missions set in a fairly interesting political fiction scenario, in which the armies have suffered drastic cuts due to a meteor shower that has radically changed the global vision, however giving way to private military organizations to take over and threaten various nations with ruthless acts of force. You can choose between a ~simplified~ control system and the traditional one of the series (we had no doubts), and the gameplay is very recognizable from the very first moments, so much so that the short tutorial leaves some time for those who know already the series. The single player boasts a good variety of situations, in the sense that there is no slavish use of the exploration pattern that leads to a clash, with the arrival of any enemy reinforcements. Of course, the gimmicks of Assault Horizon are missing and the plot is only told through static screens and aseptic dialogues, but we appreciated the introduction of the planes with the laser search system, the flying fortress to be shot down, the mysterious and devastating explosions in the sky which force you to descend into a canyon and avoid its range in order not to suffer damage. The problem is that five missions are really too few (we completed them in about an hour) and the promise of the release of three more stages doesn't seem enough to fix it. Therefore, the online multiplayer mode remains, which however is limited to proposing cooperative missions set in the five locations of the campaign, in which two teams made up of four players are confronted with the same situation, trying to obtain a higher score than their opponents. A context in which it is difficult to be competitive when on the other side there are users with substantially better equipment than ours, acquired thanks to greater experience or the use of real money. Pay to win? Let's say that the concept is that. At least the scene seems well populated, matchmaking is relatively fast and we have not encountered any particular inconvenience in organizing and carrying out matches. Playstation 3 trophies There are fifteen Trophies contained in Ace Combat Infinity, and to obtain them you simply need to complete certain missions, earn a certain amount of experience (by leveling up) and do some practice with the online cooperative mode. Nothing particularly complicated, in short. At least on foot he will not leave us In addition to the consistency of the campaign and the multiplayer, we must naturally address the issue of the free to play model, which in the case of Ace Combat Infinity is questionable in many ways. In the game there are the traditional two currencies, credits and fuel: the former are used to unlock and upgrade planes and weapons from the point of view of a ~tree~ which, in the end, constitutes the real element of progression of the experience; the second, initially supplied in only three units, works instead as the classic ~action energy~ and is consumed every time we face a mission, in single player or online. Unfortunately, it takes four hours to recharge a unit of fuel, so who doesn't want to wait like thisjust to complete the story, he has two possibilities: buy a ticket for 14.99 euros, a price that we find clearly too high compared to the contents offered (even considering the three extra missions arriving right now); or take advantage of the challenges, a real boon that the developers were ~forced~ to insert following multiple not exactly enthusiastic feedback from early adopters and which, through the achievement of certain achievements, allow you to store additional fuel in abundance (only the first challenge releases twenty units!). The sensation is therefore of a product with a very rigid and unbalanced initial setting, which however has been considerably softened by the introduction of the achievements, and which therefore appears fragmentary and inconsistent. Also from a technical point of view, given that the detail and spectacularity of the aforementioned Assault Horizon are unfortunately only a memory: the graphics of Ace Combat Infinity are undoubtedly dated, as if the franchise had taken steps backwards rather than evolving, and does not contribute to nothing to the idea of a free-to-play that is beautiful to look at, with a visual quality comparable to that of the most famous productions.", "date": "2014-06-06", "grade": "6.0"}
