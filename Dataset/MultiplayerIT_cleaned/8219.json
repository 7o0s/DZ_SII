{"name": "Imbarco immediato", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/110241-funky-smugglers-imbarco-immediato.html", "text": "Drawing inspiration for a game from the hard job of the security officer at the airport gates may seem, at first sight, at least bizarre. Forced to rummage for hours in the privacy of passengers' luggage, always repeating the same gestures until exhaustion, airport security men and women are forced to live with a job as boring as it is essential for the safety of thousands of passengers. Sensational news reports, such as that of the security guard whose gun was not reported at the time of boarding, emphasize the few mistakes made by the employees but also point out how not always, despite the high technology available, identify a object prohibited on board is a simple operation. Funky Smugglers, perhaps for the first time in history, ironically shows us the point of view of the controllers at the gates, engaging us in a sort of reclamation of passengers in real time. Deposit all metal objects...and plungers! In a very particular context, Funky Smugglers therefore puts the player in the role of a security employee, committed to sifting through the numerous travelers ready to leave those who possess prohibited objects to take on board planes. Earlier we spoke of a very particular context: the chosen setting is in fact the result of a reference to the 70s, a sort of celebration with music and funky atmospheres typical of that period, totally useless for the purposes of the game itself but capable of returning a feeling of unique fun. This particular reference is obviously seen in the clothing of some of the passengers, decidedly ~hippies~ to stay on the subject, even if these details will soon no longer be noticed. The means by which to identify irregular objects is in fact a high-performance scanner, similar for those who know it to the one featured in the film Act of Strength with Arnold Schwarzenegger; the simple passage of the travelers will therefore allow them to be scanned up to the skeletons in real time. The intervention of the security, i.e. the player, is limited to touching all the objects marked in red and dragging them out of the scanner area. Each passenger can have more than one red object to remove but, which often creates very amusing situations, it can be located on any part of the body. Thus we will have wrenches in the pockets of distinguished gentlemen, Uzis in the purses of spry old ladies, plungers and poisonous spiders in hats and even cleavers stuck in the backs of long-haired black hippies! The score increases according to the number of ~bonds~ made, with better bonuses in case of ~combo~; with the same drag of the finger it is in fact possible to remove several red objects at the same time from several people, within 5 seconds of time. Funky Smugglers is a game without an end, in the sense that the embarkations will continue to the bitter end until the three available lives are exhausted; to lose one, it is sufficient to let a traveler pass with a forbidden object or to remove a legal one, marked in green. The trick found to give a minimum of variety to the context rather than to the action is to invent improbable categories of travelers to check each time, such as ~happy smokers heading to Amsterdam~ or ~tired dancers heading to So Paulo~ and so on in a succession of increasingly improbable categories. During the checks, radio-controlled helicopters will pass randomly with some bonuses attached, such as the always useful extra life, the time slow motion, the magnetizer (which with a single tap allows you to group all the red objects on the screen) and the time accelerator, which seems like a malus but actually favors collection because in the event of activation it will place the prohibited objects all at the same height, making them collect extremely easily and in half the time. Finally, a pinch of additional challenge is given by the objectives to be achieved and by the multiplayer fights, which take place not in real time but by registering online for one of the two teams available at the moment and trying to increase the global score to win game coins. Possible purchases consist of upgrades for the scanner but also more fun and frivolous extras, such as other categories of travelers and objects to check. The sympathy and pleasantness of the title is also due to the colorful graphic aspect, deliberately a bit excessive but perfectly suited to the chosen setting.", "date": "2012-10-30", "grade": "8.8"}
