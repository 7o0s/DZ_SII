This could already represent a good starting point for dedicating yourself to GrimJoggers, a nice little game for iOS that could help you vent your desire for revenge on the poor and unfortunate individuals who populate it, although the aim of the game is exactly the opposite of eliminating of sad runners. Given the explosion of ~running games~, so to speak, it was necessary to apply a fundamental variant to the structure that seems to fascinate iPhone users, etc. without stopping. from the release of Canabalt onwards (although the concept is even older) to be able to offer something truly competitive. So here's what 10tons LTD, the development team of the game in question, came up with: instead of a single protagonist, a constant element in the genre, the player finds himself in control of a row of 15 runners relentlessly speeding along suitably filled courses of pitfalls. The first in line reacts immediately to the control of the player, who simply touches the screen to make him jump and possibly touch it again for a double jump, while all the rest of the line follows exactly what the first runner did, however with variable effects in as the jumps and landings will take place in slightly different moments and positions, also given the configuration of the levels with platforms at different heights, parallel paths and, of course, a large number of deadly traps. It seems like a recent introduction but it is enough to radically change the structure of the gameplay. A crazy group ride The fundamental basis remains the same seen in similar products, with the inexorable and ever faster running from left to right within randomly generated levels and characterized by three different main settings plus an unlockable one, to tell the truth not exciting since graphic point of view, characterized by a 2D style that seems to come directly from the 90s of the bitmap, but without too much inspiration. On this juncture, we also put in a scrolling that is not exactly impeccable which tends to confuse ideas a little too much in the most agitated phases, also due to the small size and the relative camouflage of the obstacles. The fact of having to manage more runners, we said, represents a fundamental novelty: between cliffs, traps and obstacles various different characters are lost along the way - moreover in ways that often let themselves go somewhat in the splatter style, although strongly mitigated by the general ironic climate - but as long as at least one athlete remains in the race the match continues. Obviously, the points system takes into account how many individuals we still have alive and multiplies the score in the various checkpoints based on the size of the group, which represents an important additional element in view of the high score race which obviously underlies everything the game concept in question. It is therefore important to dose the pressure of the jump button trying not to disperse the group excessively along the variants of the route in order to better keep their progress under control, although progressive thinning is inevitable, also due to the random generation of the scenarios that often inserts obstacles in a way that is decidedly difficult to cross without losses. The result is a mechanism that seems less controllable than a normal endless running and more devoted to entropy, but certainly equipped with an edge over the by now many clones based on the simple concept of the endless run, moreover characterized by a black humor of background that can't help but elicit a few smiles, between cruel eliminations of stoic joggers and impassive reports from the coach at the end of the game on the amount of heat burned during the race.
