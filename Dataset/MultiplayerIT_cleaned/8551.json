An important phase for the dynamic project of Notch and his Mojang which, after landing on the iOS mobile platform, sees its creation heading towards a potential conquest of the thriving console market. All this passing through Microsoft's Live Arcade platform which has already proven to be suitable for hosting very high-profile independent projects. The development of this highly anticipated porting was a four-handed work between the aforementioned Mojang accompanied for the occasion by the guys from 4J Studios who have already made themselves the authors of numerous portings on XBLA, among the most recent the digital delivery versions of the old Rare masterpieces like the two Banjos and Perfect Dark. Already these premises betray how the corpulent Swedish game designer really points a lot on this project and on the goodness with which it was carried out in its realization, all that remains is to evaluate how these high expectations materialize pad in hand. Double the index In a certain sense, it is strange and at times difficult to find yourself evaluating Minecraft today, in May 2012, a good seven months after the official release of the now historic version 1.0 on PC when the project was already playable since December 2009. then to our review of the PC version and our exhaustive specials to get a broader picture of the genesis and evolution that has affected Minecraft in recent years. Minecraft is presented on consoles with a style that is perfectly faithful to the one that made it famous on millions of PCs all over the world. After all, the cubed universe painted with textures that wink at pixel-art with a more nostalgic flavor certainly didn't need to be rejuvenated and indeed, any attempt to modify this peculiar visual philosophy would have been frankly a useless distortion of one of the strengths that have made the fortune of this production. Remaining with a view to respecting continuity with the ~mother~ version, it has already been announced that, similarly to what happens on PC, alternative texture packs will be released in the future for the world and also skins for the characters so as to transport even on consoles that extreme ability to customize already appreciated elsewhere. Visual fidelity aside, what you immediately notice when trying this version for Xbox 360 is the perfection with which the controls have been adapted to the console pad. What could have been one of the major perplexities for users who have already experienced the gameplay of the game with mouse and keyboard can rest assured that they can play without any limitations even in front of the TV on the sofa. Basically, the two analog triggers of the pad perform here the same functions as the mouse keys used, that is, for the functions of using the object held in the hand and for collecting materials. Even the entire interface of the menus in the crafting section fits perfectly with the different needs of the controls, this version for Xbox 360 does not use the classic version but uses a 2x2 or 3x3 grid system where the materials needed to obtain a certain object appear and in the event that we do not have the adequate resources these will appear in red. Particularly useful in this system is how it is not necessary to place the individual materials in the right order to proceed with crafting, but forging takes place automatically if we have everything we need. This greatly facilitates and streamlines the entire operation, saving us a few too many laps in the inventory which is indeed perfectly navigable but come on, it cannot boast the same speed that can be obtained with a mouse as a pointer. Where are we? Another great peculiarity of the entire Minecraft project is the frequency with which even substantial updates are released, in compliance with the philosophy of constant evolution of game horizons. At the time of writing, version 1.2.5 was reached on PC in early April although this numbering is not true in representing the very numerous evolutionary steps that have gone through long sections of beta, alpha and backwards up to the embryonic classic which has brought it all to life. Embedding such design dynamism within a console environment, which as a closed and tightly controlled system offers less freedom to make constant changes, is certainly not easy. The version used as a console port is equivalent to Beta 1.6.6 which is already perfectly playable and able to offer a complete Minecraft experience but despiteand this Notch in his statements during the months from the announcement until today has repeatedly reiterated his intention to offer continuous free updates also for the newborn console version from the immediate future with respect to the official release. Obviously, only time will show us how concrete these noble intentions are, but it must be acknowledged that Mojang has the idea of not relegating the release of Minecraft on Xbox 360 to a secondary project at all. Equally important will be the success in terms of number of users who will devote themselves to this version, after all we are talking about a game which, if faced alone, loses much of its appeal and which, only thanks to an active user of all respect, it can be considered a success, also decreeing a longevity that feeds on itself with the continuous contribution of the community. Realistically speaking, it would not be reasonable to expect a huge success like the one achieved over the years on PC, with even more than five million copies sold, however the solidity on which this port is based offers all the potential for the realization of one of the greatest successes of the Live Arcade platform. With this in mind, the presence on the web of an official Minecraft wiki should be noted, which will certainly prove useful even for new console users. Xbox 360 goals Minecraft is part of the new Live Arcade course which is giving away 400 points. It must be said how the game is immediately quite generous in unlocking part of the 20 overall objectives, always contextualised to the creation of objects or materials, or to the killing of certain enemies. There are also three prizes for our avatar on Xbox Live. Find the differences In the version to be released on May 9th of Minecraft there are other small differences compared to the more mature PC version. What catches the eye the most is the possibility of playing local multiplayer for up to four players on the same console via split screen, a perfect solution to maximize the chances of enjoying the experience in company as the philosophy of the game itself suggests, while playing online via Xbox Live the number of players rises to eight. In Minecraft for Xbox 360 it is possible to start a game with free access online or closed with exclusive access by inviting friends, as on the PC component it is possible to decide the seed to determine the characteristics of the creation of the game world or leave this field empty for a random creation. In any case, the dimensions and, in particular, the insidious dungeons created always appear splendid just as already seen on the PC, obviously having in common the same generation routines of the various terrains. Also noteworthy is the unprecedented presence for the Xbox 360 version of an exhaustive tutorial mode, useful for explaining the basics of Minecraft gameplay and above all for accompanying the novice in building a shelter, essential for allowing the player to get through the night unharmed , during which the various enemies of the game manifest themselves. Another small difference is the endowment of a very useful map every time a new world is started. In the past, the developers have also announced support for the Kinect peripheral for accessory functions, in any case absolutely not essential for use, at launch, however, the famous Microsoft peripheral is not supported but will be included among the next, hopefully next, updates . A further confirmation of how much Mojang believes in the longevity of the project. Also unmissable on consoles is the highly appreciated musical accompaniment by Daniel Rosenfeld, known under the pseudonym of C418.", "date": "2012-05-07", "grade": "9.0"}
