{"name": "I veri eroi", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/110334-medal-of-honor-warfighter-i-veri-eroi.html", "text": "Two years ago Danger Close had managed, albeit in the wake of a ~classic~ gameplay, to leave its mark with a campaign that was rather original in terms of attitude and for the themes told. Nothing shocking of course, but the choice to stage the dramatic events of the operators of the special groups in Afghanistan grappling with failed missions almost always played in defense had cast a different look on the trite script of first-person shooters with a war background. In short, we became attached to the boys, empathy was triggered in their fight ~alone~ against the Taliban. A sort of ~band of brothers~ in a modern sauce. This year however Danger Close has decided to throw away the unity of time, place and action of the Afghan war theater to throw us into the more classic world tour in pursuit of the usual new Bin Laden, also throwing into the fray flashes of personal life of the protagonists to underline the attention and authenticity in telling the real American ~superheroes~. My wife do not break Nothing new then, and what emerges at the end is a hodgepodge of uninspired levels, with a continuous recourse to flashbacks that break even more the flow of the very weak plot, all made even more cloying by the long cutscenes filled with family dramas . Precisely the excessive fragmentation of the action, frayed between days, weeks and months before the little pyrotechnic finale, lets us understand little or nothing of the complex system of watertight compartments of the terrorist cell involved, with characters entering and leaving the scene as sudden deus ex machine. You are transported by the events in the role of the various operators involved, and those moments that should enhance the humanity of the protagonists such as family scenes or camaraderie remain in the background, practically eliminating their empathic function towards the player. In the approximately four and a half hours of gameplay that it takes to complete the campaign playing at a normal level, we visit hot spots such as Pakistan, Yemen, Sarajevo and Dubai in missions that can only be defined as exciting and well done to a small extent , for the rest we are faced with the seen and revised fair, all seasoned with a map design that cries out for revenge and that flattens the shootings in the saddest of shooting galleries with a low challenge rate. Levels such as the Pakistani one or that of the huge terrorist compound hidden in the mountains are undoubtedly the flagship of the production, with large spaces, breakneck racing and more generally shooter dynamics that enhance the excellent feedback of the firearms. But most of the events often take place indoors with a level design that for long stretches brings to mind the old Doom 3. Many corridors, blind corners and extreme linearity, all weighed down by an artificial intelligence of both the companions and of enemies at historic lows, with the opponents who remain undeterred in cover waiting for the explosion of a grenade, or better still, they expose a good part of their body to our lead, not counting the moments in which they launch themselves like perfect kamikazes towards us. This thing is paired (and we had already seen this in the first Medal of Honor) with the ability to appear out of the blue in previously reclaimed areas, perhaps making us boo! from around the corner like id Software's demonic zombies. Even our teammates are no different, they don't lack aim, but they often linger in continuing to hit cover, or worse still, they don't trigger the trigger for the next session. Not to mention that if we have unfortunately placed ourselves behind a low wall that the scripting has designated as theirs, they will ~slam~ us into the open, leaving us at the enemy's mercy. Zero adaptability to the evolution of the situation, poorly finished routines that seem to have benefited little from the substantial patch released on day one, and in parentheses warmly recommended by Danger Close itself (and who can't go online?). Wardrivers However, there are undoubtedly positive implementations. As previously written, the feedback from the weapons, their sound and visual performance is objectively an excellence of the game. The recoil is felt, all have peculiar characteristics and above all many of them are equipped with double optics to be changed on the fly depending on the situation. There are also some small touches of class, such as the smoke that comes out of the barrel and the sparks and flames caused by the bullets when they impact on hard surfaces. Medal of Honor: Warfighter is then equipped with a finally functional and not cumbersome cover system. Simply hold L2 to stick outyes from the covers both from the side and from the top. Too bad, however, that the corridor structure of many levels makes this feature all too effective, transforming the action into a sort of modern version of Time Crisis, without the worry of the shortage of bullets since we can constantly ask our distracted magazines brothers in Arms. To close the list of incomprehensible design choices we find the recurring moments in which we have to break down a door. In addition to being really numerous like a trivial and repetitive quick time event and placed without a real need, they push us to complete a sort of mini-game. The more headshots we land once we've broken in, the more breakthrough modes we'll get. We go from stock to crowbar, through rifle shots well placed on the hinges or different types of explosives. All without there being a real advantage in practice given that after throwing a stun grenade we will find the occupants of the room always surprised in the same way, even if we knocked shotgun shots first. Simply put, useless. But what makes the general mediocrity of the missions even more evident are the two car sections created for the occasion by Criterion. They are not simple sections in the car, but they involve us in really exciting escapes and chases, with good attention to the driving model and ~track design~. For intensity we are more in the parts of a Bourne or any 007 and even the English developers have also included a ~stealth~ section in which we must avoid the opposing pursuers by hiding when necessary. Real racing sections, therefore, which undoubtedly work and which ignite our dull attention but we wonder why, in addition to the strictly narrative connection, insert them in the context of an FPS. The best in the world To revive the production are the efforts that the guys from Danger Close have put into trying to create a multiplayer sector that tries to leave behind the heavy DICE legacy. The operation, net of the heavy bugs not corrected by the patch, is undoubtedly successful, but here too there are critical issues. Many had found the lack of personality of the first chapter of the reboot, this time the personal design choices are not lacking, but in the end Medal of Honor: Warfighter is located in that poorly defined area between Call of Duty and Battlefield. Of the first we find the frenzy and speed of firefights in medium-large maps, of the second there is the great attention to cooperative dynamics and team play. The most important introduction is undoubtedly that of the Fire Team, i.e. each player is linked to another, always visible through a green silhouette (which mocks the walls) and which in case of killing the partner can instantly bring him back to life if he kills whoever shot him. It is also possible to be reborn behind your partner's back. In short, continuous symbiosis, all with a view to a fruition that would like to be a tactical and reasoned thread, without forgetting that even between perfect strangers, a relationship of almost ~comradely trust~ is immediately established, enhancing the different types of chosen soldiers. In this sense, the introduction of real special operators undoubtedly works, each with their own uniform, weapons and special special skills. For example the US Stormtrooper Seal can unlock the grenade launcher and as a support action (aka the killstreak) can designate targets for mortar or even the more devastating cluster bombing. The Russian demolisher Speznatz can wear a ballistic helmet, entering the so-called Tank Stance, thanks to which he can take more hits, and use an automatic grenade launcher and call a small armed drone, while the American operator OGA (read CIA) can activate the infrared sensor to see enemies behind cover or in the dark for a few seconds, both the SAS machine gunner and the Korean sniper can then open the tripod to make aiming more stable and precise, while the scout can load enhanced bullets. In short, the possibilities of offense are not lacking, and above all in terms of customization we are at very high levels being able not only to replace the optics but also going to work fine on all the components of the weapon, such as the muzzle brake, the magazine or the castle, or that section of a firearm that contains all the operational parts. All these changes that significantly change the behavior of the ~iron~, all visually rendered by a complete panel at the top right. On a mission to hot spots Speaking of content, the number of mappe certainly doesn't make you cry out for a miracle, only eight, but they are characterized by a good level design, with a well-thought-out alternation of open spaces, defilements, indoor sections and long and clear shooting lines. The valley of Shogore or Sarajevo are a good example of this, even if generally one can feel the lack of a more driven visual customization of the various battlefields. The menu of the various game modes is satisfactory: in addition to the classic ones, undoubtedly the most appropriate ones and which most stimulate the cooperative drive of the game are Combat Missions, three objectives to be attacked/defended with decreasing return tickets and Hot Spots, where objectives are five and that are activated randomly during the long match with the map that is revealed slowly. Whoever wins at least three wins. To conclude the range of game modes peculiar to the title there is Home Run, with two teams that are divided between captivators and defenders in a really narrow space. The aim is to steal a flag and bring it to your starting point. There is no respawn, whoever dies has to wait for the end of the turn. No frenzy, no assault with white weapons. Without respawn everything becomes a sort of hide-and-seek among soldiers, trying to guess the point of arrival of the attackers to prepare a nice ambush. In short, very tactical, almost a sort of chess game. Unfortunately, not everything goes right. The probable hasty closure of the project that plagued the campaign despite the abundant patch is also reflected in the multiplayer. Speaking of mechanics, the number of hits needed to knock out an opponent seems really random. Perhaps everything will be linked to the ~real~ ballistics of the weapons, but it is not uncommon to hit an opponent on the head several times even from medium distance and not see him die. Secondly, the respawn system seemed inaccurate, or rather it seems not really knowing how to discern the level of danger at the time of ~reborn~ near the partner, leaving us decidedly in the open. But what damaged our test the most was the continuous respawn under or over the map, or worse still outside the invisible barriers, complete with a countdown that required us to return to the battlefield. We hope that Danger Close will remedy it as soon as possible since we have often been forced to get out of the vicious circle of false rebirths only by leaving the game. Ultimately, the multiplayer sector can be said to be undoubtedly successful, the cooperative attitude is clear, but despite all its biggest flaw lies in placing itself exactly in the middle between the two giants of the sector, only partially bringing peculiar characteristics that can make the difference , without forgetting a game offer which at the time of launch cannot be defined as very full-bodied. Playstation 3 trophies Medal of Honor: Warfighter rewards the player with 51 trophies, split across all game modes. The most obvious ones are obtained by completing the campaign, while to bring home the gold and silver trophies we have to perform particular actions or reach certain scores in multiplayer. In difficulty On a visual level, Medal of Honor: Warfighter suffers on consoles all the limits and compromises of the use of the overly performing Frostbite, falling into a low level of detail even in the foreground elements and in a general hodgepodge of textures from a long distance. all perhaps due to a rich polygonal modeling of the environments and a continuous use of light effects and well-made particles that weigh on the engine. Virtually absent then the environmental destruction, which here is limited to some covers and little else and granite frame rate, anchored to thirty frames per second. On PC the music changes, even if only slightly unfortunately. It is not enough to set the graphic possibilities to the maximum, even here the basic limits of the textures are perceptible, and undoubtedly place Medal of Honor: Warfighter well below Battlefield 3. The sampling of the sound of the weapons is excellent and, as usual, exciting theme of the game, but it is sad to note that bugs hit here too. More often than not, the sound effects tend to disappear, with the battlefield reverberating with a deafening silence, perhaps during a mortar salvo.", "date": "2012-10-26", "grade": "6.0"}
