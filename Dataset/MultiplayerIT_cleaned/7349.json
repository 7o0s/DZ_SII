After the splendid ideal trilogy that began with Might and Magic VI: The Mandate of Heaven, a great and unforgettable masterpiece of 1998, continued with For Blood and Honor and ended with Day of the Destroyer, many considered the new chapter of the historic series, which began in 1986 , as an opportunity to technically modernize it and bring it back in step with the times, both at a technological and structural level. Unfortunately it didn't happen that way. Of course, the new graphics engine was there, but in general the game was a half-disaster, also due to the end of funds which forced the developers not to take care of all aspects properly and to close it in a hurry. The critical and public failure was sensational, to the point that many spoke of the entire series as a grave. Indeed it has been so, at least until today. When Ubisoft acquired the brand, it began to exploit it with titles that had little or no relation to the originals of New World Computing: puzzle games, casual strategy games, action games and so on. Only the parallel Heroes of Might and Magic saga had kept its identity. Then something unexpected happened last year: Ubisoft announced Might and Magic X: Legacy. A new chapter of the historical series in development? Moreover, set up like the first episodes, that is, with the exploration of the world in first person, with movements one box at a time, ninety-degree rotations (Dungeon Master style, so to speak)? Incredible, but not too much, at least if you look around. In 2012 an independent team released a hugely successful game, Almost Human's Legend of Grimrock, capable of selling more than a million copies and catalyzing general interest. In the same period, some large fundraising campaigns on Kickstarter had brought the most hardcore role-playing games back to the industry's attention (forgive the simplification), making it clear that they can still count on a vast niche of enthusiasts willing to buy them. In short, Ubisoft's courage in offering a title like Legacy on the market is that of those who have understood that there are niches large enough to make it possible to invest in different and more courageous products than the usual pre-chewed blockbusters (which are not lacking in its catalog). Might and Magic X: Legacy marks the return of a historical series in a big way First steps While starting from Might and Magic I - V as a setting, the world in which this tenth chapter is set is that of Might and Magic: Heroes VI, from which it starts again in order not to lose continuity with the work done by Ubisoft on the brand. Thus the design of the enemies, armor, weapons, locations and so on, will surely be familiar to you if you have played any spin-off of the series in recent years. The plot is quite classic and sees the city of Karthal, located on the Agyn peninsula, on the verge of secession after the events narrated in the aforementioned Heroes VI. The player is called to create a party of four characters and find out what's going on, exploring cities, forests, caves, underground labyrinths and ancient temples in search of the truth. The creation of the characters requires choosing the race, class and ability of the four (in addition to the name), or it is possible to choose the standard party provided by the developers, which however takes away a certain taste from the adventure (forgive us for inevitably being lovers of every possible complication leading to greater involvement). The bravest will be able to rely on the random party generator, which however does not guarantee any possibility of initial planning. Once our heroes have been created, it is time to arrive in Sorpigal, the first city of the game, where we can talk to some characters about the events that are plaguing Agyn, about the various factions in the field and about various topics ranging from politics to jokes told by a strange boy outside a shop. As already mentioned, the movements take place by squares, with rotations of ninety degrees at a time. Unlike in other games like Skyrim, cities appear rather static. Not bad, given the different setting. To interact with people, shops and objects (such as barrels, chests, obelisks, levers and so on) you have to stand in front of them and press the space bar. Obviously we are not going to explain that in the shops you can buy or repair pieces of equipment, identify magical objects, buy potions, spells and various trinkets, or buy provisions that are used to camp (and to avoid that after each enemy the player resorts to sleep to fully recharge). Talking to everyone will serve not only to obtain information, but also missions to carry out. Some FrCharacters will offer to come with us for a price (usually a percentage of the gold found). For example, it will be immediately possible to hire a crusader and a cook. What are hireable characters for? Well, staying on the pair above, the crusader gives bonuses in finding traps and secret passages, while the cook makes rest more effective, giving a bonus that affects attack and defense. In general, each hireable character has its own skill. Let's fight with love After the first dungeon, full of spiders of various shapes, we leave the city to reach a lighthouse, where the clashes begin to get tougher. Exploring its surroundings we also came across a dungeon with a very powerful enemy who wiped us out. We can only deal with it much later, when the party has leveled up and is better equipped. However we begin to indicate some cornerstones of the gameplay: Might and Magic X: Legacy is difficult, very difficult. Even if you select the more affordable of the two available challenge levels, it won't be long before you get killed by some enemy. The fights take place in turns. Having entered an enemy's action area, it will be necessary to choose the actions of each party member (attack, defense, casting spells, use of objects and so on) and watch those of the enemies. If you expect some mercy you are wrong, because there is none. A little less than halfway through the game you come across very strong enemies that require planning and strategy to defeat. As you progress, things get even more complicated. In general, the clashes of Legacy can give great satisfaction to anyone looking for a complex but not heavy game system. Surely you can't go on thinking about eliminating anyone by pressing random keys. Each enemy has strengths and weaknesses. After killing someone, it is better to go and read the bestiary to find out all the details on how to maximize damage and how to defend yourself from its attacks. The offensive techniques available to us are the classics of the fantasy genre: melee weapons, long-range weapons and magic. From this point of view there is nothing original, with the characters' abilities governed by the classic stats that can be increased by leveling up. The game world Might and Magic X: Legacy excels in the design of the maps that compose it. As you may have guessed by reading, the game is divided into zones, some open, some closed. In general we can say that we will wander through a labyrinth of various dimensions that will offer a lot in terms of enemies and secrets to find, some quite subtle (there are even riddles whose answer must be written), others simpler, linked for example to the classic levers to pull or plates to press with the body. Compared to Grimrock, Legacy's dungeons are simpler and don't present as complex puzzles (something in the ending, but nothing that could block more than a few minutes), but it should be considered that the game map is immensely larger and the environments are more various and numerous. So it's quite logical to have favored smoother gameplay. After all, this also happened in the past precisely to underline the differences in focus of the different role-playing games. We also want to underline some radical choices that will greatly appeal to role players linked to the titles of the past. For example, there is the automatic map, but above it there are no objectives to be reached with arrows and various indicators that indicate the direction to follow. You have to explore by yourself and find what you need by following only general indications given in the dialogues. In reality, the design of the game map tends to create a certain linearity, with the different strength of the monsters which prevents you from accessing some areas ahead of time, but the trick works really well and you don't pay too much attention to it. In short, we follow the road dictated naturally, without feeling the oppressive weight of an invisible hand that guides us all the time. Years Technically Might and Magic X: Legacy isn't great. In fact, it's actually really bad. Paradoxically, the worst moments are those where the scenario widens and we find ourselves admiring wider landscapes: it is in these cases that the map divided into boxes shows all its limits, with an exaggerated pop-up of elements that appear and disappear after every movement, flat sections and highly visible enemies who stand still awaiting our arrival. For the same reason, the most beautiful areas end up being the closed ones, where many of the above flaws disappear and everything appears more natural. The enemies, on the other hand, are well done, as are the special effects of the spells. Ston the other hand, the frequent drops in framerate are unjustifiable. It's true that, given the game system, they don't affect the gameplay, but, given the general poverty of the graphics, they're really inexplicable. However, if you are among the players interested in a Dungeon Master clone, you will also be among those who pay little attention to the graphic aspect, so don't worry. Less glossable are the bugs, even if there is nothing tragic to report. Despite the months of public beta testing via early access, there are still some problems left to solve: we are talking about disappearing character portraits, some graphical glitches, a strange aura that appears around enemies and other annoying little things and nothing more. However, in twenty-five hours of play there has never been a return to the desktop and we haven't run into any blocking bugs, so we can be satisfied, especially if we compare the finished version with the first public beta released, which was really disastrous. Finally, we point out, since we know that you care particularly, that the game texts are completely translated into Italian.", "date": "2014-01-23", "grade": "8.5"}
