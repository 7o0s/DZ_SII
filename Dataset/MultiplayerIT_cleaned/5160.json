Atari's new management looks at the intellectual properties it has on hand and selects the best-selling ones to reboot. One of these can only be a RollerCoaster Tycoon, since we're talking about a series that has sold not hundreds of thousands, but millions of copies. Who to entrust it to? Frontier, the developer of RollerCoaster Tycoon 3, is excluded, as they are working on a direct competitor: Planet Coaster. Chris Sawyer Productions, the team that made the first two chapters, is not even to be considered, since it no longer exists. It was therefore decided to turn to an unknown team with no experience, Nvizzio Creations, which puts a lot of good will into it, but which evidently does not have the means and knowledge to carry out such a project. When RollerCoaster Tycoon World is released in the Early Access section of Steam it is March 30, 2016, coincidentally a few days after the launch of the Alpha version of Planet Coaster. The comparison is already merciless even then, although even the title of Frontier is largely incomplete. RollerCoaster World has a greater focus on the career mode, but is plagued by a disproportionate amount of bugs, some very serious and, above all, has a decidedly inferior editor. The parallel we are making between the two games is not secondary to understand why Atari's title is a complete disaster. The months go by, Frontier proves to be a serious and capable developer (it is no coincidence that it has a name like that of the veteran David Braben behind it) and, after the arrival on Steam and numerous updates that have gradually added game pieces, the release date: Planet Coaster will be available starting November 17, 2016. In the meantime, RollerCoaster Tycoon World has been lost a bit. it too has been updated several times, but never in such a way as to solve its critical issues. Moreover, Atari has greatly reduced communication by making it disappear from the radar. So imagine the surprise when the release date was suddenly announced: November 16, 2016. Yes, one day before Planet Coaster. We reviewed RollerCoaster Tycoon World. Unfortunately. What destroyed us inside? The Chaser Did Atari really think it could steal the public from Frontier's title with such a sad little trick? Probably yes, which reveals a lot about how projects are carried out there. In short, the historic brand RollerCoaster Tycoon found itself chasing a new intellectual property, Planet Coaster, trying to exploit its trail on several occasions. Do you think it's ridiculous? You probably haven't started the game. RollerCoaster Tycoon World is plagued by all sorts of problems and it is evident that it is an incomplete title. The first dramas occur with the tutorial, where you seriously risk getting stuck or not seeing your progress recorded due to bugs. At least for the introductory missions, which should serve to explain the game mechanics, couldn't we put infinite resources? The problem is above all how it is structured: invasive pop-up windows ask us to do some things and we have to find out how. Isn't that a tutorial? No explanation of the interface, not even a hint of what some choices entail. Nothing at all. Furthermore, the game is translated very badly into Italian, to the point that the tutorial texts ask us to use some functions by calling them in a certain way, when in reality the translation of the function in the interface is another. Some texts are not even translated, so to speak. Once the obstacle has been overcome, you can continue with the campaign, made up of thirty missions, including the tutorial ones, to be tackled sequentially. Every ten missions the geographical area changes: you start in a wooded area, then you move to a desert area and finally you find yourself on an island. The missions all have objectives to accomplish, such as building a few attractions, racking up money, or catering to a park-visiting personality for positive publicity. When you're done, you abandon what you've done and take on the next mission. The solution of continuity between the various missions is minimal and, even if overall there is more care than in Planet Coaster's career mode, the result is not exceptional. However, the real problems of the game are different and mainly concern the simulation of the park and the editor. Paranormal activities We leave the campaign and start the sandbox mode (note that there are no other modes). which allows you to freely build a park, even with limited resources. We build some roads, buy the first attractions, equip ourselvesstaffed and open to the public. Things seem to be going well, at least economically, but there's something not quite right: the park is small and, despite the presence of three cleaners and bins everywhere, it's very dirty. The streets are littered with litter and vomit. We hire more staff and build more bins. There is also a lot of dissatisfaction in the air. We click on one of the visitors. The guy is unhappy: he's hungry and has to go to the bathroom. Well, but he's right in front of a bathroom, which he dodges though. So bring it on... Calm and keep a cool head. Minutes go by, the new caretakers help clean up the park, which however remains dirty. As the size of the park grows, the situation deteriorates and we understand that there is a need for a lot of staff for maintenance and emergency management. The problem is that staff can only be hired by building specific buildings, but each building gives access to up to three workers! As the park expands, to have the right number of workers, literally dozens of houses have to be built, but the problems are never completely resolved. In short, managing a RollerCoaster Tycoon World park you will witness strange paranormal phenomena related to visitors and staff and you will never fully understand whether you are doing right or wrong. The only certain indicator is the economic one: if profits increase, then everything is going well, even if your streets are filthy, otherwise not. And the editor? If that misery isn't enough for you yet, then hold on tight because it's time for the editor. The comparison with Planet Coaster is merciless: the Frontier title allows you to create what you want, RollerCoaster Tycoon World does not. The editor has major limitations, it doesn't have the same level of customization and it has an interface that weighs down the work rather than favoring it. Do we want to use items that are at the bottom of one of the construction categories? Know that there are no shortcuts or filters and you always have to scroll through the whole list to get there. Convenient, right? We guarantee you that it is the minimum: much more serious is that there are problems connecting the roads, to the point that if you don't want to have headaches it is better to do them all straight, also by virtue of the positioning of attractions and buildings, which can be problematic if you have created a network that is too complex. All the automations seen in Planet Coaster here are a mirage. The roller coaster editor itself offers complications that greatly hinder the creation of tracks. With practice you can do something good, as shown by some downloadable online attractions, but you always feel crippled. Let's take an example: we used terraforming to pull up a hill and make a road pass through it, then we tried to build lampposts on it, but found that we couldn't do it the way we wanted and that in some places we couldn't place them. We didn't understand the reason and we weren't told, the fact is that we couldn't achieve what we wanted and we had to fall back on an alternative project, ie we exited the game and started Planet Coaster. The overall picture, already tragic in itself, gets worse if we consider the high number of bugs, with frequent returns to the desktop, the absence of some attractions promised in Early Access, such as transport in the park, and a mediocre graphic side, which does not it compares favorably with the title of Frontier: the attractions are less realistic, both in detail and in composition; the visitors have fewer animations and are more stylized, the decorative elements are bland and the lighting system is more basic, with a less convincing day/night cycle and poorly defined shadows. Let's also assume that the image appears too blurry, especially when zooming in to broaden the view of the park, and that the fluidity is not impeccable, even when exceeding sixty frames per second. In short, did you understand that you have to avoid it?", "date": "2016-11-21", "grade": "3.5"}
