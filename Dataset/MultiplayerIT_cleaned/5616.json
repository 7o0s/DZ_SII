Capcom's survival horror franchise created by Shinji Mikami, which recently celebrated its twentieth anniversary, has now become a planetary phenomenon that has long since crossed the border of the gaming market to become a global phenomenon stratified in various other entertainment sectors , between gadgets, novels, films and toys. A phenomenon that does not seem to know the word decline, despite the fact that several missteps are attributed to it with the last few chapters, which however have sold millions of copies all the same. And it is perhaps also for this reason that Capcom goes straight on its way and, waiting to offer the public a new episode, continues in its work of ~squeezing~ the franchise by re-proposing another of its old titles for the new generation consoles, namely Resident Evil 6. The game was in fact released in a remastered edition at 1080p on Xbox One and PlayStation 4, accompanied by all the downloadable content released after the original launch, by a couple of extra options present only in the edition PC and some exclusive costumes packed into 17.8 GB for download. Resident Evil 6 returns in a high definition special edition for next generation consoles Global threat Resident Evil 6 HD Remaster constitutes the most substantial episode of the series: it is divided into four campaigns, told through numerous corollary videos of the most important sequences, each of which sees seven different characters at work within a stratified but unique scenario from a narrative point of view. All the various events are in fact related to each other, and on more than one occasion the paths of the protagonists cross, offering multiple points of view of the same key event, until they converge towards a single ending. From this point of view, it should be emphasized that the choice to field the same events from multiple perspectives sometimes forces the user to replay entire sequences already dealt with previously, including those with the bosses. And this, for some, could be boring, as well as frustrating in those points in which it has been very difficult to overcome a certain obstacle. In any case, returning to the plot, the story takes place fifteen years after the Raccoon City incident and nine years after the collapse of the Umbrella Corporation, in a world where the black market of BOWs is booming, to the point of allowing their diffusion in the major conflicts of the world. In the United States, the background to what happened in Raccoon City, including the role played by the government in masking the tragedy, is about to be revealed by US President Adam Benford during an official visit to the University of Tall Oaks. But the campus suffers a bioterrorist attack and many of the students, professors and guests are infected with Virus C, a pathogen created by the survivors of Umbrella by combining the T and G viruses with Plagas recovered in Spain. The head of the White House himself becomes a victim, to the point of forcing his friend Leon Kennedy, who had accompanied him to the ceremony, and secret service agent Helena Harper, to kill him. Thus begins a long adventure which, as mentioned before, will lead the gamer around the world in the role of several characters, including conspiracies, espionage accusations and rather telephoned twists and turns, against the backdrop of the threat of the C Virus which will become global, transforming the inhabitants of some areas of the planet into mutants, zombies and monstrous creatures. Curiosity Resident Evil 6 HD Remaster abandons the old weapon modification in favor of a skill system that changes the characteristics of the characters. In fact, during the campaigns, hidden in the chests or after killing particularly difficult creatures, the game collects pawns of various values which represent the currency to be spent to increase the characteristics. The choice is very wide and involves all the key sectors of the gameplay: greater resistance to damage, more strength in close combat, more chances that enemies will drop ammunition, double ration of grass from the partner and much more. Piers face From the point of view of playability, apart from a sometimes badly positioned camera that creates some problems, the game is a good shooter focused on cooperation between two players, online or offline, in which each episode is substantially different from the other in setting and some mechanics. The one starring Leon Kennedy - Helena Harper is for example conceptually more similar to the first chapters of the saga, and in fact has many elements of the old episodes: the dark and silent corridors that often end at an angle and whereo sinister noises; the flashes that light up the environment, the environmental puzzles to solve, the zombies that appear almost out of nowhere in certain situations and the desperate escapes to avoid becoming their food. This is at least until you come across typically shooter or face-to-face sections with the enemy: there fighting game mechanics come into play that allow Leon to knock down the unfortunate creature with a Tekken kick. Thus, despite a special stamina bar that decreases rapidly to avoid abuses, the concept of survival horror goes in part to the blessing, pace of the initial premises, it being understood that overall this is the campaign that, as mentioned, succeeds better to remember, for situations and atmospheres, the past ones. In reality it is the one with Chris Redfield and Piers Nivans to push the accelerator on the typically third-person shooter dynamics. The former S.T.A.R.S. agent, who has long been an effective member of the B.S.A.A., finds himself in two different periods, first in Eastern Europe, and then in China, just when the town of Lanshiang suffers a terrorist attack. Together with his team, and in particular with his colleague Nivans, Chris has to deal with dozens of monsters and armed mutants, using all his soldier skills to survive the clashes, which are continuous and prolonged. In this sense, the combat system is confirmed as quite valid, although logically not at the level of that of other more recent third-person shooters. Characters can act in a variety of ways to avoid being hit and to strike, shooting at enemies' weak points and hitting them where the foci of infection are most visible on their bodies. It is also possible for them to perform instant kills or, at close range, quick counters. There are also alternative and choreographic game sequences, useful for breaking up the otherwise monotonous sequence of shootings a bit, and making some of the highlights of the adventure more exciting. Even more action is the third portion of the story, the one that involves the couple formed by Jake Muller, a former mercenary who hides a sensational secret, and by the revived Sherry Birkin of Resident Evil 2, now grown up and become a government agent. In their scenario there is not the action and puzzle-based exploration of Leon, nor the rain of fire and explosions of Chris, but a lot of melee combat characterized by a system designed to enhance the combat system. Jake, in fact, can also count on particular extra physical attacks, such as a real secondary weapon to be selected in the inventory. Here too the focus is that of the shooter, but the possibility of varying the attack dynamics more effectively, even if the idea of playing a Resident Evil is further removed from the player's mind, slightly smoothes out the repetitiveness of the shootings . By completing all three main campaigns it is possible to unlock the secret one relating to Ada Wong, through which it is possible to learn about other aspects related to the plot, with an important twist. This part of the game stands out largely for its typically stealth dynamics, in a context where you often have to act in the shadows to silently eliminate enemies and progress from area to area. The ~new~ edition To complete the offer there are also some particular multiplayer modes, such as Manhunt, through which it is possible to invade the games of other online players by playing the role of a zombie, or Mercenaries, a classic timed horde with the possibility of gain precious seconds by performing combos, counter-moves and destroying crystals, also available in the formerly exclusive PC version, which is enriched, among other things, by the presence of some of the characters from Left 4 Dead 2. In general, Resident Evil 6 HD Remaster it is a good adventurous shooter with some (few) survival horror elements, which however lets you play quite well, especially if you turn a blind eye to a camera that is not always positioned properly, a level design that is not always inspired and some shooting too many which makes some steps, as mentioned before, a bit repetitive. The four campaigns and their respective differences in terms of playability ensure variety, give a little liveliness to certain sessions of the interesting bosses and make the experience pleasant by an artificial intelligence that when playing alone simply does the homework, but well, also showing good aim and no pathfinding problems. Playing in two instead it is possible to plan the attacks in the best possible way and therefore exploit the peculiarities of the arsenal of ogni character greatly increasing the rate of fun. Then there are some junctures in which from two we pass to the coop to four, obviously scripted moments that represent turning points in the game and which dramatically amplify the choreography of some situations. On a technical level, Resident Evil 6 HD Remaster does not have a screaming graphic sector, but compared to the counterpart for the old generation consoles it limits itself to raising the resolution to 1080p for greater image sharpness, the frame rate to 60 frames to guarantee a good fluidity, and to integrate a handful of slightly more defined textures for the main characters. Everything else, on the other hand, has remained unchanged, with its strengths and weaknesses, even if the overall vision is all in all good, thanks to the very structure of some rooms or the arrangement of the lights, which help in some way to make it more pleasant scenarios often covered with poor quality textures, but often evocative and disturbing. On the other hand, nothing to object to on the polygonal modeling and animations of the protagonists, bosses, zombies and humanoid enemies, while we had some small perplexities for those of some more deformed creatures. Particularly successful then the interlude scenes, with a cinematic cut, and the numerous interactive sequences through the QTEs. The latter are numerous and sometimes therefore a little annoying due to their repetitiveness, but willy-nilly we end up tolerating them in the end. Instead, applause goes to the audio technicians for the excellent sound effects, for the good soundtrack and for the Italian dubbing, partly well acted, and in any case capable of making the gamer perceive the different personalities of the protagonists distinctly.", "date": "2016-03-31", "grade": "7.5"}
