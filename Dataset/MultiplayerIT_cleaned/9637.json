{"name": "Le isole di Antaloor", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/82429-two-worlds-ii-le-isole-di-antaloor.html", "text": "Tested version: PC and Xbox 360 The Two Worlds saga continues which, after a potentially explosive start but harassed by too many bugs and the inexperience of the development team, returns with a second chapter improved from every point of view. The main plot is quite robust and full of well-crafted dialogues, situations and flashbacks capable of intriguing the player. But we must immediately clarify that the possibility of making choices is limited to some missions, does not affect the game world and does not lead to multiple endings. The story of Two Worlds II is already written in the stars and we can only follow it trying to survive. However, the faction and guild missions are substantial and lead us to follow several self-contained storylines that reveal Antaloor and are obviously supported by texts, letters and stories. Some secondary plots intertwine with each other and are linked to the main one, while others are more classic and offer now classic elements such as assassination missions or the evergreen arena which is now a staple of Western RPGs. The acting is unfortunately limited by a poor set of facial animations and by models that are qualitatively fluctuating, downwards, both from an aesthetic point of view and in terms of movements. Thankfully the shots and the English dub are well done and support the mood very well. An archipelago of possibilities The main plot, which lasts about fifteen hours on normal difficulty, is just one element of a title capable of even offering a campaign dedicated to the cooperative which, in addition to guaranteeing an adequate level of difficulty for 8 coordinated players, allows you to discover other aspects related to the Two Worlds universe and the creatures that inhabit it. In short, the idea of the Reality Pump guys is evident and it is to create something capable of competing with the Elder Scroll saga, obviously trying to offer something more to fill the gap. Not surprisingly Two Worlds II offers tons of side quests ranging from killing, stealing, persuasion, to espionage. In some cases we will have to work for a cult, in other cases we will have to avoid the law and in extreme cases we may find ourselves fighting with a host of were-umbrellas. The total duration is estimated at around one hundred hours which obviously include the Village Mode, the cooperative campaign, the pvp, the arena, the dice games and the exploration of locations devoid of any interest. Someone will surely spend even more time in the multiplayer mode that allows 8 players to fight to prove who has the best template, but the combat system of Two Worlds II is not developed for a tight multiplayer and it is evident from the first game. A relevant element to point out is that little of the game time is spent on moving around. Although exploration is a key point in some areas, there are several teleporters that allow you to quickly go to and from the location reached. Unfortunately for us some less inhabited areas are almost devoid of teleporters but the title allows us to buy them, at a high price, and to place them in the points where we believe we have to return. In addition to teleportation, there are more fun and picturesque means of moving around which allow, among other things, to find the dozens of dungeons scattered around the game world. The first is the horse. A classic by now, just as the poor maneuverability of the beast in open world RPGs is a classic. The faithful quadruped, which remains planted where we leave it without moving a hair, is in any case very useful, it allows you to run without having to mind your stamina but only to not make the animal nervous by pushing it excessively. Unfortunately, in some areas it is practically impossible to find them while the Varn, or the canid bipeds that populate the third island of the Andaloor archipelago, have them in quantity. The other means of transport, on the other hand, is a real surprise. Two Worlds II is certainly not the first title to implement a boat but going upwind in a fantasy CRPG is really pleasant and allows you to explore some areas that are difficult to reach on foot. The archipelago where this chapter of the saga takes place is large, although certainly not immense, and offers different settings well contextualized by vegetation, colors, ambient sound and also background music. The finishing work is remarkable and while in the commercial towns people go bartering, complete with buyers who examine the goods on the stalls, in the small towns the inhabitants work, dig, clean. Obviously these animations have no real effect on the game world but still make it more alive and believable. There are also cities of a certain size, although I can't find themarchitecturally complex. The most particular is clearly inspired by Assassin's Creed complete with an Arabic melodic track, passable roofs and tons of citizens who dodge as we pass. Finally we come to the combat which is very varied and the animations, when compared to other RPGs of this genre, are quite good. Unfortunately the collisions are not as good and generate interpenetration, prevent us from delivering final blows and often make it difficult to understand which opponent we are hitting. And Two Worlds II does not give up another worm afflicting western RPGs. In fact, the jump is horrendous and climbing a slope, since as usual there is no animation for the climb, is a pain for the eyes. The good, the bad and the buggy Remaining in the field of bugs, we reiterate that Two Worlds II is undoubtedly more refined than the first chapter, but some problems remain such as monsters that disappear, the aforementioned collisions, some areas where the character gets stuck without being able to move anymore (fortunately that there is teleportation) and the anomalous sound of the jumping character. In fact, if it weren't bad enough, the jump is also spiced up with a sort of whinny with suction that could easily be used to give voice to a zombie equine. And we must also add that the monsters, sometimes so intelligent as to anticipate and follow us through myriads of tunnels, evidently do not disdain the consumption of hard drugs and go crazy quite often. It then becomes all too easy to outrun or exterminate them one by one by compromising whatever challenge the game may offer. Then there are errors of all kinds such as the ability that allows you to land humanoids but also works with some monsters and animals and various translation errors ranging from the word yes, translated with a no, to the word no, translated with a Yes. But the level playing field does not spare even the materials. Steel weapons disassembled give pieces of iron and from some iron weapons it is obviously possible to extract steel fragments. Impossible to understand whether it is the fault of whoever wrote the original texts or whoever translated them. In any case, those responsible have neither listened to the dialogues of Two Worlds II, nor tried the game. Yet, despite the numerous defects, the title does not spare surprises and touches of class that manage to balance the shortcomings. There is no shortage of missions with comedy, mature dialogue, sex, romance and jokes that demonstrate serious commitment. To top it all off we also find texts of all kinds ranging from Bethesda-style alchemical guides, to improbable poems and love letters which are obviously connected to important events in Antaloor or to missions we have faced or will face. And there is also room for lighter multiplayer modes such as gem hunting which, however limited, is still one more mode. Then there are some elements that directly affect the gameplay such as the possibility of resetting skills to have the points to spend again and that of earning skill points by using them. And it is also possible to improvise as a musician, as in Fable and in other titles, but in Two Worlds II the instruments can be played note by note with a Guitar Hero minigame (as seen in Fable 3, after all, ed.). The better the execution, the higher the offers from the audience. Finally, it is impossible not to mention the Village Mode which allows you to develop your own village in a sort of third-person management game complete with enemy attacks and commercial relationships with other builders. Unfortunately, the multiplayer possibilities of this mode are limited and the Village Mode cannot be integrated with the game world where it would have had greater value, but it remains an interesting experiment that clearly shows the potential of a management RPG. Xbox 360 goals Most of the objectives are related to the single player campaign and the multiplayer one and they are all easy to achieve since they are not related to the level of difficulty. Only sixty points, divided equally between PvP and Village Mode, come from multiplayer while all the others concern the completion of particular quests or the use of specific skills. An all-round hero The action of Two Worlds II revolves around a fully customizable character who can become a thief, a wizard, a warrior, an archer or a hybrid capable of combining seemingly different skills to create extremely effective mixed tactics. In short, the variety of combat of the Reality Pump RPG is out of the question even if to enjoy the action it is necessary to accept that, as happens in almost all three-dimensional free roaming, the collisions are disastrous and the animationsions are not dynamic and are identical both when hitting a monster, when the blow misses, and when the enemy parries the attack. Furthermore, the character automatically recovers health when he is out of combat and this detail, combined with the fact that it is practically impossible for the monsters to reach the fleeing hero, offers the opportunity, which many will not exploit but only out of stubbornness, to use the regeneration as a cheat. However between the power-up shrines, which fully heal the character, the lack of a dynamically scaling difficulty, and the downhill sprint, which allows the hero to travel at jet-like speeds, the chances of saving the skin are however too generous and make it almost impossible to die. But, as we said, the moves are numerous, fluid and well done. They range from the charged attack to break the opponent's parry up to the kick to make the enemy lose his balance and then finish him off if you hold a pointed weapon. Some skills, to be increased with the experience points earned from level to level, simply enhance the relative move while others allow you to increase the critical or the percentage of bringing special attacks seasoned with spectacular choreography. Unlike melee attacks, the archer's attacks are based more on magical effects. Arrows slowing down, multiple or capable of summoning a monster are the ingredients necessary to prevent an enemy from reaching us in close combat. The aiming system is less cumbersome than in the previous chapter and allows you to switch from automatic to manual aiming with the pressure of the left trigger. Unlike what happened in the first chapter, the arrows no longer aim directly at the enemy even in manual mode and it is now possible to shoot to the side of an enemy and therefore also hit moving targets by predicting their trajectory. But the most particular system concerns spells. In fact, spell cards are back, albeit with more applications than in the past. The combinations of elements and effects allow you to give any spell the ability to hit in an area or to enhance the effect of the element on which the spell is based. However, unlike the other specialties, magic requires a lot of points and it is practically necessary to acquire maximum experience in skills that increase mana and reduce the time needed to cast spells. Then there are the passive skills that increase defense, running, resistance and other characteristics such as robustness that are essential for increasing our character's ability to survive. And there are still others that allow you to avoid combat, such as stealth and assassination, to steal or open any lock with ease. The latter is often necessary to complete some missions and to access various dungeons, but it is possible to save some points by counterbalancing with a good dose of reflexes. In fact, to open the locks a minigame is activated where we have to align from two to six sections of a lock in a few seconds. The Two Worlds II arsenal Like many other titles Two Worlds II allows you to set different sets of equipment to be selected quickly with the d-pad. But in this case the three possible variants are a necessity rather than an option. In fact, the resistances and immunities of monsters force us to choose different types of weapons on which to spend skill points in order to have more than one type of attack to use against enemies. Once the equipment is selected, the special abilities paired with the keys on the pad change automatically and make the system quick and intuitive however complex. On the other hand, it is less easy to obtain the skills themselves and weapons powerful enough to make them useful. Few vendors have advanced skill books, which are needed to unlock skills and then be able to spend points on them, and quality weapons are even rarer. However, to obtain the most powerful weapons and armor, as expected, it is possible to undertake special quests which are obviously slow and long but guarantee us a nice prize at the end of the race. Everything is then articulated by a system that allows you to perfect weapons and armor using the materials obtained from the destruction of useless objects. And well-made weapons acquire recesses in which to insert various types of gems which include the addition of elemental damage, the increase in skills, the enhancement of defense, the increase in character characteristics and a much higher enhancement of the standard ones but which seals the object preventing further modifications. The gems are of various types and, spe", "date": "2010-11-18", "grade": "8.8"}
