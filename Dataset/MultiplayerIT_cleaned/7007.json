Maybe the title won't tell you much, but if you were the proud owner of the first Sony home console you may have nibbled it on one of those demo-discs that crowded the paper magazines of the time. It was 1997 when Psygnosis released a title with an isometric view on the PlayStation that made exploration, adventure and multiplayer on board vessels its strong point. We could bet with our eyes closed on how much the French of Henchmen Studio drew inspiration from the defunct overseas studio to make Monkey Pirates, the similarities are simply too many. More than five decades have passed and a game of this kind can no longer aspire to retail marketing, which is why Nintendo has well thought of grabbing yet another exclusive for the eShop and delivering a product designed exclusively for a offline multiplayer approach; a package of maps and modes capable of entertaining almost exclusively in a group, built in an absolutely dignified way that absolutely dominates a single player frame on which to defer effortlessly. Time to hoist the sails. Monkey Pirates is a good multiplayer title that does not hide, however, quite limited ambitions Stern or bow? Monkey Pirates presents itself immediately as a game devoted to local clashes: in fact, forget about fighting online as online is a completely absent feature. Just a sprinkling of instructions, a couple of tips on how to become ace naval battles and we are ready for the single player. Sore point: the single mode is nothing more than an extension of the tutorial enriched with objectives, which can be completed in half an hour as soon as you get the hang of it, the scores for the gold medals are in fact decidedly calibrated downwards. Four captains to choose from, four quick competitions linked to the peculiarities of each one that you will finish in a short time. Monkey Pirates will open only when you decide to surround yourself with friends: there are two macro-modes to analyze, to differentiate between the use or not of the Gamepad. Let's start with the most typical versus. With full compatibility for both Wiimote and Pro Controller, the game allows up to 4 players to compete simultaneously across nine maps, featuring ice storms, teleporters, volcanic explosions and moving islands. The level design manages to remove the specter of dj vu for a good period, thanks to a commitment by the team to guarantee unique environmental characteristics for each map and allow the captains to implement the strategies relating to the character and the selected upgrade. In fact, during the choice phase, it will also be necessary to equip one's alter ego with a skill that will help him during the session. Monkey Pirates offers three classic types of gameplay to color the games: ranging from the classic free-for-all clash to the Jolly Roger, similar to a ~Capture the Flag~, up to a banana hunt (remember that we are still talking about monkeys) in which applies the rule that when you die you leave everything to the one who killed us. A fast respawn and a directionality based on the wind rose guarantees - regardless of the type of rules chosen - a pleasant game flow, which we must inevitably get used to, but which once mastered will guarantee good hours in company. Online on eShop? With Nintendo's recent push to have independent titles exclusive to its digital delivery service, it's no longer a coincidence that a large proportion of the games that arrive on the eShop are deprived of online multiplayer. The ports of dated products recently analyzed may pass, but also seeing new and exclusive names devoid of any network functionality now seems increasingly to be a precise choice of the big N aimed solely at encouraging ~couch play~. Sea wolf In creating a title dedicated to multiplayer, Henchmen Studio could not fail to introduce enhancements. To enrich each session, weapons and armor will take care of your vessel, so as to provide all the necessary ingredients. We now finally come to the mode that tries to honor Wii U and its controller - called Sea King - which, taking a cue from everything that has been listed so far, adds a fifth player and makes him a sort of game master thanks to the Gamepad. Those who have possession of the second screen will have the objective of helping this or that captain to achieve their exclusive objectives, which they will choose as they are completed. So here is that the fifth player will have to prepare weapons, bananas and defensive upgrades to always keep the balance constant and get to have, at the end of the partita, the highest score of the clique. The modality has potential but it is not free from deficiencies that would have certainly made it the definitive one. First of all comes the impossibility of physically hindering the opponents with the use of atmospheric agents, traps and everything that would have made the sessions in five something active for everyone and not a mere compensation activity for those who use the Gamepad. If the level of skill is not equally distributed it will be very frequent - and frustrating - to notice how the Sea King's actions will never be able to counter the predominance of one or the other challenger. Another frankly inexplicable factor concerns the differentiation of the scores of the vessel captains with that of the Gamepad owner: in this way the team unknowingly lowers the bite and the fun of the master, who finds himself not only having to work twice as hard in evaluating each move to keep the forces in the field fair, but it can never be a real winner due to the double awarding track that irreparably lowers its charm. A great pity: the playful parenthesis of the Sea King could aspire to be a really interesting addition to the Wii U multiplayer universe, but as things are, we can only hope for a patch that greatly improves its characteristics. Small note on the technical and sound front: the cel shading game engine offers good sprites, bright colors and a clean visual system, a small reservation must however be made on the frame rate which sometimes drops in the face of excited situations. The audio, on the other hand, will not struggle to ideally take you on a ship for a stroll through the equatorial seas, thanks to a couple of simple but not tiring tracks, suitable for accompanying matches as background.", "date": "2014-07-15", "grade": "6.7"}
