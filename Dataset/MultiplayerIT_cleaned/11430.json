{"name": "Prehistoric Tribes", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/prehistoric-tribes.html", "text": "The experience gained so far by the various mobile development teams has confirmed that there are genres of video games that manage to make a lot of money in the mobile sector, from all points of view. The real-time strategists are certainly part of this group of products, since they offer reasoned action, characterized by times compatible with any device, even those equipped with mediocre control systems. We have already been able to appreciate excellent RTS both from a technical point of view and in terms of gameplay, therefore Prehistoric Tribes will face rather fierce competitors. The early stages of the game show us the end of the ice age, with a tribe of primitive men who finally come out of the cave where they had taken refuge and have to reorganize their lives. The first step is to build a village, inside which to place a kitchen, a warehouse and whatever else is needed above all to guarantee food and raw materials for everyone. It is clear that immediately after comes the defense of the group against the other tribes, especially the wilder ones: as in any real-time strategy game, we will be able to build ever more effective weapons for our men, with the fights taking place in the usual way, or by ordering the troops to collide with the opponents and observing the result of the clash. Generally it is the number that makes the difference, so we will have to be very careful in developing the tribe, in order to have a good number of people to deputize for the defense of the village. Following what is the classic setting for the genre, the various stages offer us increasingly complex tests, and completing them at a certain point translates into the possibility of expanding our territories, exploring the surrounding lands until our tribe is in absolute the most powerful and the most developed. There are basically two phases of the game: first you possibly deal with resource management and construction, then you move on to achieving the objectives. The control system sees the joystick assigned to control the pointer, with an inertial movement to make moving from one end of the screen to the other more agile. For the rest, you have to use the 5 key and the function keys, which open the interface necessary for the various actions that tribe members can perform. Technically, the game has its ups and downs. On the one hand we have a spot-on and effective design, with well-drawn characters and a good level of animation, on the other a poor optimization, which makes screen scrolling slow. The locations are colorful, quite full of well-made elements, designed in the same style used for the members of the tribe. In short, the THQ Wireless developers have done an excellent job artistically, but the slowness with which everything moves (the reference is to the QVGA resolution version) becomes immediately annoying and seriously undermines playability. The sound is average, with some music that leaves the time it finds. We have already mentioned the control system: extremely simple, it involves the use of the joystick and a few buttons, responds promptly to inputs and makes use of a legible and well-designed interface. PRO Simple and immediate Good number of things to do Well done graphics... AGAINST ...but everything moves too slowly No innovative elements Character management a bit confusing", "date": "2008-05-09", "grade": "S.V."}
