After going through three generations of home consoles (Nintendo 64, Gamecube and Wii), the series now passes on 3DS with the present here Paper Mario: Sticker Star, which has the arduous task of maintaining the high quality standards of its predecessors while continuing on the road to innovation: let's go and see if this is yet another success for the mustache... Magic stickers The story behind Paper Mario: Sticker Star faithfully follows the canons of the irreducible Nintendian narrative canvas: during a joyful party in the Mushroom Kingdom of which she is the godmother, Princess Peach is kidnapped by the usual Bowser, who also takes advantage of it to steal the legendary Comet Sticker and scatter its fragments across the world. In short, it is always the usual old story, which however served the Intelligent Systems designers solely as a launching pad to take off a narrative that finds its strength in the delicious humor that permeates every single step of Mario's adventure, with the contribution of an excellent Italian translation. Many of the dialogues and skits that flow on the screen are genuinely funny, and there is no shortage of authentic goodies reserved for the longest-standing fans, scattered here and there throughout the game in the name of successful self-quotation. And it's nice to see how the Japanese developers have maintained such a light-hearted attitude also as regards the graphics of the product, full of solutions that play with the fact that characters and settings are made of paper and cardboard: just mention the Koopas, who fold up like origami before retreating into their shell, or the blocks that split into six sheets when hit by Mario's head or hammer, and these are just the most mundane examples of an attention to detail that never ceases to amaze level after level. All while maintaining the typical style of the series substantially unchanged, for a game that aesthetically can be defined as a wonderful electronic transposition of one of those children's books with cardboard templates. The 3D effect Despite the use of ultra-two-dimensional characters, Paper Mario: Sticker Star looks marvelous on the 3D screen of the Nintendo laptop: indeed, it is precisely the mixture of flat elements inserted in three-dimensional scenarios that gives a further sensation of depth, emphasized by the frequent framing changes artfully inserted in the various stages. Although it is not one of those titles in which 3D becomes an integral part of the gaming experience, Paper Mario: Sticker Star is so beautiful to look at with the slider at its maximum that it will be difficult to be tempted to reduce its effect. Art Attack Speaking of gameplay, Paper Mario: Sticker Star continues on the path of experimentation that is typical of the series, having fun once again shifting the balance and obtaining a result that can hardly be included in a well-defined category. The backbone is that of the classic Mario titles, with the world map that allows access to the various levels divided by setting, each of which has the main objective of reaching the relative fragment of a comet. It is the way to get there which, however, changes radically compared to the platform routine to which the Italian plumber is usually used: the internships are therefore fundamentally based on the exploration of the scenario and on the resolution of various types of puzzles and puzzles, without forgetting the clashes with enemies that - unlike the last Super Paper Mario for Wii - return to being managed via a turn-based combat system. And it is here that the true peculiarity of the Nintendo product enters the scene in an overbearing way, namely the use of stickers, which can be collected around the world, bought in special shops or obtained as a prize. The game includes dozens of types of stickers, all associated with a certain action to be performed by Mario in battle, such as jumping, hammering, Fire Flower and so on: each sticker however works for single use, and once exhausted its effect disappears fromthe album that occupies the touchscreen and acts as a binder. The experience in Paper Mario: Sticker Star revolves entirely around this mechanism, to the point that the developers have decided to remove elements such as experience points, leveling up and more precisely to leave this aspect total room for maneuver . If we exclude the initial dismay at the loss of many of the features that had made the fortune of the series, the use of the stickers immediately becomes addictive, and their great diversity allows you to have quick access to many of Mario's abilities without having to wait to level up. The absence of experience points is somehow compensated by the even more protagonist role of gold coins, essential for buying new stickers and even for activating a slot machine in combat which allows you to perform multiple attacks during the same turn if you get the right combination. For the rest, the battles resume the typical mechanisms of the first episodes of the series, with the user who must have a good game in pressing the A button with the right timing in the attack or defense phase to increase the damage inflicted or limit the damage suffered . While they are undoubtedly fun, however, clashes with the normal enemies that you meet on your path end up too soon becoming an activity that may be preferable to avoid, given that the reward in terms of gold coins does not always justify the waste of one or more stickers: a balancing problem which, unfortunately, is not the only one to afflict the work of Intelligent Systems. Stubborn stickers In fact, considering the developer's pedigree and the extreme accessibility that Nintendo has decided to assign to all its products for years now, one is almost blown away by some design choices that seem more dictated by errors of evaluation than by a desire to reach out to hardcore gamers. To begin with, the game proves to be decidedly stingy with explanations on the various elements of the play structure, especially in the initial stages: certainly not an insurmountable obstacle for an experienced user, but which could force less accustomed players to spend too much time wondering what to do or where to go before stumbling upon a solution. But the real sore point concerns the too rigid way in which the puzzles have been managed, which practically all pass through Mario's new ability to ~cartify~: by entering this mode by pressing the Y key, you have the possibility to apply some stickers on the scenario, which will magically take shape once the work is finished. Intriguing premises which, however, are fundamentally betrayed by a system of watertight compartments that leaves no room for the player's inventiveness. Basically, most of the puzzles require the application of a specific sticker-object, or a sticker obtained from the discovery of three-dimensional elements scattered apparently at random around the world. Taps, vacuum cleaners, scissors, light bulbs, fans are just some of the things that Mario will collect on his journey, each of which has one and only one function in a given puzzle, often and willingly positioned somewhere else than the object in question . All this, combined with the aforementioned lack of guidance from the software, leads to finding yourself all too frequently in real dead ends, with puzzles that can be overcome only and exclusively by pasting a sticker in the right place which may be hidden in one of the stages already faced, and which can only be encountered by chance or after beating the game map inch by inch. A frustration that can be extended to the clashes with the various bosses, already characterized by dizzying increases in difficulty compared to normal enemies, and to defeat which it is often necessary to use a particular special sticker: also in this case , Paper Mario: Sticker Star does little or nothing to direct the user, forcing him to unfair trial and error sequences before understanding which sticker is suitable for the purpose. And I'm really sorry that Intelligent Systems ran into similar errors of evaluation, because the title didn't need any little means to lengthen the broth: even without counting the much time lost desperately looking for a solution to the current puzzle, the adventure it proves to be particularly full-bodied, and above all characterized by an excellent rhythm and levels that are never similar to each other. In short, beyond its obvious limitations, it is still a very enjoyable game, which manages to keep interest alive even if only thanks to its innate sympathy. Certainis that with a little more attention from the developers we would have been here talking about the title in even more flattering terms.", "date": "2012-11-23", "grade": "8.0"}
