During its development period, Tengami managed to gain the attention of critics and the public above all thanks to the originality of the graphic style adopted, based on the concept of animated books that each of us has probably got to know in childhood . Also out during the year on Wii U, PC and Mac, the title in question has however already reached the Apple App Store, with a universal version compatible with iPhone and iPad. Tengami is a warning: style must necessarily be accompanied by substance, otherwise... Paper world Tengami is essentially a point and click graphic adventure that is extremely traditional in its mechanics: basically it is a question of moving your character within the settings by solving the puzzles and enigmas that gradually appear in front of you. The strength, the cornerstone of Nyamyam's effort, as mentioned at the beginning, is undoubtedly to be found in the aesthetic component of the product: in a market where it seems almost impossible to still be able to find even partially new ideas, Tengami is on the contrary able to surprise and captivate from the very first moments, thanks to a fascinating and innovative graphic design. Basically, the work of the British team takes place entirely in a world made of paper, between the pages of an animated book (or pop-up book in English): these are that type of volume, for the most part - but not only - aimed at children, in which the particular folding of the sheets leads to the appearance of three-dimensional elements and structures, which appear almost by magic simply by turning the pages one after the other. Here each facade, turned by dragging your finger across the screen, is a new place to explore. However, Tengami is not a game for preschoolers, but on the contrary finds inspiration in the Japanese tradition, offering a glimpse of the feudal age, among large settings where unspoiled nature is often the master. The result is simple, stylized but extraordinarily evocative locations, colored in pastel shades and almost alienating for their intense sense of solitude. Nyamyam's fatigue is therefore undoubtedly a beautiful game to look at, even if there are some missteps that denote the limited resources available; above all the simplistic and unconvincing animations and the too basic effects sometimes resize the final result, which is still remarkable especially if appreciated on the generous screen size of an iPad. To complete the audiovisual component of Tengami finally contributes the soundtrack composed by David Wise, also ex of Rare, and recently returned to the limelight for his commitment in Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze for Wii U. Probably the oriental theme is not the environment more congenial for the esteemed English composer, but the pieces are nonetheless pleasant. Without history and without fear After reading so many nice words about Tengami, you're probably wondering about the reason for such a low rating. The answer is that, substantially, the work of the British team denotes an absolute and unforgivable imbalance in favor of the graphic component over the content one, with the result of placing the user in front of a game that is ultimately highly disappointing and hopelessly impalpable in the element more important. We can force ourselves to turn a blind eye to the brevity of the adventure, despite the premium price leaving a little bitterness in the mouth for the scant couple of hours needed to reach the conclusion. Less forgivable is the extraordinary paucity of the plot, practically non-existent except for a handful of lines of text and which gives no justification for the actions and the task assigned to the protagonist. The latter, a sort of samurai like so many others, shares the thickness of his characterization with that of the sheet of paper of which he is made. It is therefore natural that any form of empathy and connection between player and alter ego is irreparably compromised, considerably reducing the emotional charge on which Nyamyam evidently intended to rely. Although it is clear that the intention of the programmers was to develop the adventure on the ~unsaid~, on the reduction of the textual element in favor of the purely emotional one, the objective can be said to be very far from having been achieved. But what weighs most of all in Tengami's rejection is undoubtedly the paucity of the playful content itself:the development alternates between soporific and very slow walks with double taps and a handful of puzzles of difficulty that go from the incredibly banal to the inscrutable, creating cloying blocks in the fluidity of the progression. More generally, the key element of the card and the appearance of objects by turning the pages is almost always reduced to a simple aesthetic solution rather than an integral part of the gameplay on which to build interesting puzzles.", "date": "2014-02-21", "grade": "5.0"}
