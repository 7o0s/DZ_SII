{"name": "Super Mario 64 DS", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/super-mario-64-ds.html", "text": "The freshness of the past Beyond the doubts of the eve, there has always been an awareness of the indisputable value of the game in question. We are obviously talking about Super Mario 64, one of the greatest masterpieces in the history of videogames truly capable of revolutionizing an entire genre, and beyond. In fact, it was 1996 when the Nintendo 64 showed an authentic 3D world, a practically perfect analog stick control system and a game mechanic superior to anything else seen before then. And it was obviously a success, a huge success, capable of driving the sales of the console alone as the best of the killer apps. Finding yourself today, in 2004, still talking about the same game is already a sign of the enormous importance that this has had for the entire industry. But tying his name to the Nintendo DS is still a gamble: wouldn't it have been better to develop something really new and able to exploit, and not adapt to, the touch screen and the double screen? The answer is much less simple than one might think, and goes beyond a simple negative or positive sentence. Surely developing a title based on an existing game has allowed Nintendo to respect the console's debut date, which has not suffered any delay compared to forecasts and above all has anticipated the ~competitor~ PSP by a month and a half. In the same way, Super Mario 64 DS represents anything but a second-best choice, and on the contrary proves to be splendidly suited to sustain console sales by offering players a gaming experience that even after 8 years fully deserves to be. lived. All the more reason since this adaptation for Nintendo DS does not limit itself to perfectly following the original episode, but rather appears as an expanded and revised remake from several points of view. First of all, the programmers have chosen to support the Italian plumber with other protagonists starting with Yoshi, the green dinosaur who ideally acts as a common thread between the end of Super Mario 64 and the beginning of this Super Mario 64 DS. Yes, because it is at Yoshi's command that the adventure begins, allowing the player to take his first steps in the game and become familiar with the controls. Freeing Mario a little later, and then continuing with Wario and Luigi, this episode for DS actually gives the possibility to face any level with one of the 4 characters, with all that follows: each of them has in fact peculiar and unique characteristics and, although no goal is precluded to one or the other protagonist, the faculty of choosing who to play increases the freshness and variety of a title that is already exceptional in itself from this point of view. The news does not end here Obviously the presence of new characters also means new levels. In fact, Super Mario 64 DS increases the total number of stars to collect, which thus go from 120 to 150 to the delight of anyone who has already played the original. The new levels and the new locations have been splendidly added within the world dated 1996, to the point that it is practically impossible to notice their insertion ~a posteriori~: the implementation is in fact perfect, credible and plausible, without any flaws. On the contrary, from a graphic point of view the gap with the Nintendo 64 chapter is really marked, obviously in favor of the newborn DS. Confirming the excellent capabilities in managing 3D graphics, the new version immediately appears better, starting from a frame rate firmly anchored to 30 frames per second and totally free of any uncertainty. The definition of the image is also impeccable, with more defined textures and revised and strengthened polygonal models; the small size of the screen also does not weigh the lack of anti-aliasing at all, and the slight pop-up is not particularly annoying. But beyond the graphic aspect and the game structure, what made Super Mario 64 the masterpiece of gameplay that was revealed was undoubtedly the control system; the use of the analog stick represented the cornerstone, an essential and fundamental tool for having the feeling of really possessing a direct connection with one's digital alter-ego. In this sense, it was not uncommon to observe Nintendo 64 owners spending whole hours simply running and hopping around the castle, driven by the pure pleasure that was transmitted to them by the tricorned pad. Unfortunately, there is no analog stick on the Nintendo DS; the reason, we have already said, is certainly to be found in the attraction that this would have had in most games both dapart from the developers and the players, a factor that would have debased and overshadowed the much-advertised touch screen. And so on the newborn Nintendo console the possibility of choosing between two different control systems is offered; the first, completely inadequate, assigns movements to the directional cross, requiring the pressure of a key to be able to run. Unfortunately it is immediately evident, as if there was ever a need to underline it, that Mario's debut in the third dimension has always been conceived and developed around an analog type control. And digital is nowhere near acceptable as a stopgap solution. Here then takes over the touch screen, the protagonist of the second control system available. In this case, having absolutely put the stylus aside and inserted the thumb-strap, it is necessary to place your thumb on the touch-sensitive screen. That exact point will be considered, until the finger is lifted from the screen, as the neutral zone of a ~virtual~ analog stick: swiping the thumb in any direction will therefore be like tilting this stick, with consequent movement of the character used. After an initial sense of bewilderment, over time the familiarity with this new solution will gradually increase, to the point of allowing a good command of the movements and thus allowing one to move with agility within the three-dimensional world. But, let's say it with certainty, no one will ever be able to seriously say that they prefer this control method to that offered by the traditional analog stick: in fact, the lack of a ~physical~ stick devoid of all that sense of feedback that the touch screen cannot provide, in addition to necessarily being less precise and agile in responding to user directives. A good compromise then, but certainly not an ideal solution for this type of game. It's extra time But Super Mario 64 DS is not just a small treatise on how to adapt a ~traditional~ game to the potential of the Nintendo DS. On the contrary, the title in question provides a quantity of extras that make authentic use of the specific characteristics of the console and, while not representing key elements of the gaming experience, they contribute to giving this episode the identity of something more than a simple remake. First of all, the programmers had the time to insert a nice multiplayer mode, obviously via wireless connection, and moreover usable with a single game cartridge. Up to 4 players can participate: after having spent about a minute downloading the necessary data onto their consoles, they are offered the possibility of choosing 4 arenas in which to challenge each other in a race to see who collects the most stars. Obviously fair play is not contemplated, and so it is possible to steal the loot of the opponents with merciless punches and kicks. While offering its best with 3 or 4 users, and while certainly being limited, the multiplayer mode of Super Mario 64 DS manages to genuinely entertain, thus proving to be a perfectly apt addition. Continuing with the description of the extras present, one cannot fail to mention the thirty minigames present and obtainable by catching the rabbits scattered around the castle; these are small diversions from the main adventure, obviously capable of offering short and unprocessed experiences but really fun and capable of eliciting more than a few smiles. Furthermore, having been developed from scratch purely with the function of representing a welcome addition to the main gaming experience, they make full use of the touch screen making it truly fundamental within the proposed mechanics. In conclusion, we cannot fail to mention the sound component of this Super Mario 64 DS, which fully confirms the goodness of the new Nintendo console from this point of view. After a lifetime of deeming laptops unfit to present truly good sound experiences, it is truly a joy to hear what the DS has to offer with its excellent stereo sound quality. In detail, in the game in question everything that was present on the Nintendo 64 cartridge has been brilliantly transported, with the further addition of some effects and phrases spoken by the protagonists. The sound experience is truly immersive, clean, flawless and even capable of offering a credible virtual surround sound; from this point of view, in short, hats off. Comment Super Mario 64 DS is a very difficult title to evaluate. On the one hand, there is the slight sense of bitterness at Nintendo's decision to use a remake as a flagship title forthe launch of the DS, when maybe we would have preferred an original title and really developed around the peculiar characteristics of the new console. On the contrary, Super Mario 64 DS adapts to them, with absolutely exciting results in some aspects (graphics and sound), in others a little less convincing (control system). But on the other hand, simply turn on the Nintendo DS and hear the introductory song to be literally sucked into the world we loved so much on the Nintendo 64, and enjoy once again one of the simply most beautiful video games in history. A purchase therefore recommended to anyone, capable of genuinely entertaining in a way that only Nintendo is capable of offering. Pros Was a masterpiece 8 years ago, and still is today Amazing graphics and sound Great amount of extras and additions Cons Acceptable but not ideal control system Not very suitable for expressing the unique characteristics of the DS The arrival of the Nintendo DS has set the world community of gamers abuzz, thrilled by the promises of the Kyoto house regarding the innovations that the two-screen console would bring with it. But, it is self-evident, even revolutionary hardware can do little if it is not supported by software capable of expressing its potential. In light of these premises, the decision to choose a game more than 8 years old as the flagship title for the launch of the Nintendo DS left at least some perplexity.", "date": "2004-12-10", "grade": null}
