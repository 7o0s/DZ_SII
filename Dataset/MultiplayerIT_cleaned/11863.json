What an obvious way to start an article about comics and video games, you might say. But it's really the only expression that gives an idea of the impact Akira Toriyama's successful manga has had, especially after becoming a cartoon and embarking on that long road of dramatic fights, transformations and resurrections that made it even more popular and, positively or negatively, commercial. And how many authors later tried to imitate the exploits of Son Goku, yet there are a handful, perhaps fewer, of truly successful and loved serializations. Among these, there is undoubtedly Bleach. Born from the pencil of the extraordinary mangaka Tite Kubo, Bleach is a manga that met with immediate success both in Japan and in the rest of the world, thanks to the mature and detailed drawing style, and above all to the original, engaging plot full of bizarre characters and well characterized. Bleach has obviously spawned an animated series, feature films for the big screen, some mediocre video games especially in the PSP version. However, it was even Treasure who took care of the development of this first Bleach fighting game for Nintendo DS, which together with Sega filled that void in the Nintendo handheld toy library that beat'em-up fans at meetings had been complaining about for some time. And Bleach, in this sense, is anything but a simple filler. Modes for all tastes Bleach tells the story of Ichigo Kurosaki, a fifteen year old Japanese with the power to see the spirits of the dead. One fine day Ichigo finds himself in his own room none other than a Shinigami, a goddess of death named Rukia Kuchiki, hunting for an evil specter that threatens our protagonist's family: seriously injured, Rukia gives up her powers to Ichigo so that he can defeat the monster. Later, Ichigo finds himself having to work as a Shinigami instead of Rukia, who however is taken prisoner by his own fellow Shinigami and brought back to the spirit world, the Soul Society, to be tried as guilty of having given up his powers of god of death to a human. Ichigo, together with a heterogeneous group of friends and schoolmates, will penetrate the Soul Society to save Rukia: the Shinigami themselves will move against our heroes, for personal purposes or simple duty, while in the shadows a mysterious enemy orchestrates a terrifying plot to the detriment of the entire universe. Bleach's Story Mode is only the first of many single-player modes available in Bleach: it traces the first narrative arc of the series, precisely that of the Soul Society, from the point of view of each playable character. Through a series of static screens and written dialogues, the plot of the game unfolds, and as the various Story Modes are completed, others are unlocked, perhaps together with new characters to be used in combat. In addition to the very welcome Story Mode, a necessary Training Mode cannot be missing complete with a command list, and the much more canonical Arcade Mode which tests the player's skills with multiple difficulty levels and an excellent enemy AI. Furthermore, by completing the Arcade Mode, you get credits to spend in Kisuke Urahara's shop, essentially another game mode that allows you to unlock an infinite number of goodies that exponentially increase the longevity of the Sega cartridge including artwork of all kinds , options for listening to music, voices and sound effects, new colors for the various sprites and new combat zones, but also additional Single Player modes such as the evergreen Time Attack, a difficult Survival Mode and the intriguing Challenge Mode, which challenges the player to produce increasingly long and complex combinations of attacks for each character, not too dissimilar from the homonymous mode already seen in the now prehistoric Street Fighter EX. Treasure's most original idea was to introduce a sort of ~card game~ that affects the various fights. Modes for all tastes Naturally, as a fighting game Bleach does not fail to offer a multiplayer mode, and from this point of view the guys from Treasure have outdone themselves: by accessing Versus Mode you are faced with four game options. In fact, it is possible to organize personalized matches against the computer, challenge up to three friends simultaneously in possession of Bleach: The Blade of Fate cartridges or load the game into their DS, using a single cartridge but losing some frames of the animations and various effects visuals, an omission that doesn't really detract from the fun offered by the frenetic fights. The last multiplayer option concerns the possability to connect to the Internet and challenge opponents from all over the world: online support is excellent, with very little lag, and the community of Bleach players is very large, thanks to the reputation it enjoys in Japan and, by now, also in the West . Aces up my sleeve Bleach's combat system is decidedly original, while drawing inspiration from the great masterpieces of the genre, starting with Street Fighter and continuing with the noble products of the glorious SNK, such as The King of Fighters and Fatal Fury. In Bleach, to begin with, you can play up to four players at the same time, and for this reason Treasure has thought well of creating each stage on two floors: by pressing a button it is in fact possible to move across the seabed and continue fighting on a second floor of parallax. The various buttons on the Nintendo DS are used for three types of attack and blocking, and the various combinations of the buttons and the d-pad allow for a multitude of basic attack and movement maneuvers, such as the shunpo - which allows you to move close to the enemy instantly, counter-attacks, aerial shooting shots and more. Some of these fighting techniques deplete an indicator located at the bottom of the screen, which also allows you to launch the various special attacks of the enhanced version fighters. Furthermore, under the player's energy indicator, there is an additional bar that will fill up up to three times during the fight: as expected, this indicator allows you to launch the classic and devastating super-attacks. This mix of old and new ideas is supported by an element that Treasure has been able to manage with attention and care: the speed of the fights. Thanks to the numerous combos and the possibility of connecting each attack practically at will (a bit like in Guilty Gear) all it takes is a little practice to find yourself facing increasingly frenetic and pyrotechnic matches, without falling into a chaotic ~button-mashing ~: Bleach is in fact a decidedly technical and strategic fighting game. Treasure's most original idea was in fact to introduce a sort of ~card game~ and to make sure that this influenced the various fights. With the points earned in the other game modes, it is possible to purchase various ~cards~ at the Urahara's Shop depicting the numerous characters designed by Tite Kubo, assembling decks as desired, following a few simple rules. During the various games our cards will appear on the touch-screen and by touching them we will activate their abilities: there are cards that slow down the enemy or lower his defensive or offensive capabilities, there are cards that regenerate our vital or spiritual energy, or that even block the opponent's special techniques or his ability to block or jump. The use of the cards is totally optional, and the player is free to use them and take advantage of them, or not to activate them and rely only on his own ability: Bleach's combat system, especially in clashes with the computer, is decidedly well calibrated, and you never feel like you're being disadvantaged or overwhelmed by your opponent's cards. Incidentally, the touch-screen also performs another more particular task: in fact, it is possible to perform the various special attacks by touching their name on the screen; in this way players less accustomed to performing the very traditional rotations of the d-pad combined with pressing the keys will be able to limit themselves to pressing the touch-screen to fight, a decidedly ~casual~ solution that we found rather insignificant but certainly pleasant for the less technical . 2D never dies To achieve the lightning-fast and spectacular fights in Bleach, Treasure has opted for a traditional 2D, decidedly not skimping on the quality of the animations and sprites: each fighter in Bleach is detailed and has an excellent amount of animations, often accompanied by special effects of each genre that give life to the most powerful special moves. Some attacks (the notorious Bankai) are introduced by comic-like sequences and are often expressed in gigantic sprites that move around the screen: it is impossible not to be surprised by the fact that even with four sprites at the same time beating each other up, the slowdowns are almost non-existent and the frame-rate remains granite. A touch of class is also the dynamic camera that frames the combat arenas (generally very beautiful, like the forest, and only sometimes a little aseptic, like the atrium of Gotei 13, embellished however with a gem: Nanao in the background who throw cherry petals!) approaching and moving away as necessary to zoom in on the action according to the distance of the fighters. bmoreover, leach demonstrates exceptional care not only for the actual fights, but also for the various menus, for the artwork and for the very rich audio sector: starting with the introduction, with the song Ichirin no Hana by the group High and Mighty Color (third theme song of the Japanese animated series) perfectly reproduced, passing through the various musical tracks, essentially metal and rock, frenetic and decidedly suited to the style and speed of the fights. Seasons all the dubbing carried out by the same Japanese actors chosen for the animated edition of Bleach, of excellent workmanship, quite clear especially during the fights. In short, not that we expected less from Treasure, but this time they have definitely outdone themselves. Character Select Here is the list of selectable characters in Bleach: Ichigo Kurosaki, Renji Abarai, Kenpachi Zaraki, Ganju Shiba, Tosen Kaname, Kyoraku Shunsui, Yasutora ~Chad~ Sado, Sajin Komamura, Sajin Komamura (masked), Yoruichi Shihoin, Soifon, Rukia Kuchiki, Shigekuni Yamamoto Genryusai, Jushiro Ukitake, Byakuya Kuchiki, Orihime Inoue, Uryu Ishida, Yuri Kurotsuchi, Gin Ichimaru, Toshiro Hitsugaya, Momo Hinamori, Sosuke Aizen, Nemu Kurotsuchi, Hollow Ichigo, Kon, Bonnie, Yachiru Kusajishi, Tatsuki Arisawa. Comment Bleach isn't the best portable fighting game for DS because, effectively, there aren't any others available: the game signed by Sega and Treasure is a real gem, probably one of the best two-dimensional fighting games made for a portable or home console in recent years. The quality of every aspect of Bleach is very high: technically it is excellent both in terms of visuals and sound, the possibilities in single-player are numerous, it is even possible to play online in the versus mode which, moreover, allows you to challenge up to three players simultaneously, there are many extras to unlock and the roster has 28 selectable characters. The gameplay is very solid, frenetic and extremely technical, and the ~card-game~ component is interesting and well integrated into an already excellent combat system, which adopts a decidedly user-friendly optional mechanic for less competent players. There really are no reasons not to recommend Bleach to fighting game lovers, unless you viscerally hate the original series created by Tite Kubo which, in turn, is one of the best Japanese productions of its kind. Doing better on the Nintendo DS is going to be really tough. Pros Technically great Deep and fast-paced gameplay Extremely long-lived Cons Some combos and special moves aren't perfectly balanced", "date": "2007-11-05", "grade": null}
