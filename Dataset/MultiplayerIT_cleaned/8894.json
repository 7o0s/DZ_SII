And while the new Professor Layton lingers, the certainly not exciting toy library of Nintendo 3DS finds itself with a gap to fill in the puzzle-solving genre which, especially in recent years, it has become practically essential for any self-respecting portable console. In this case, it was Ubisoft who took advantage of the temporary absence of the famous Level 5 franchise to offer a puzzle adventure of its own that, at first glance, seemed anything but interesting. But as they say, appearances can be deceiving and something very special could be hiding behind what looks like a supermarket basket toy... The killer in me The pretext with which to submit the player more than a hundred quizzes and puzzles consists in a story set in the sixties, during the boom of a fictitious television show called The Incredible Puzzle Masters. In fact, at the beginning of the adventure we will be asked to provide some personal data and even a passport photo taken with the 3DS camera, because we will be the ones to participate in the next edition of the quiz show that is driving Hollywood crazy. This first installment serves as a real warm-up and each round offers a simple puzzle of increasing difficulty which, for better or worse, reveals to us the nature of the challenges we will face throughout the story: the latter really begins when an ex-college friend of ours, now in the FBI, asks us for help in solving the intricate case of a serial killer with a passion for quiz shows. And in fact the victims are the competitors of the show in which we are participating and each murder is accompanied by a riddle to be solved to obtain a new precious clue that could allow us to discover the identity of the killer and stop him. The plot of James Noir's Hollywood Crimes is all in all rather trivial but is told in an intriguing way and focuses heavily on the various secondary characters, characterizing them in a sufficiently ambiguous way to lead us to suspect each of them. Their stories and our adventure are told through more or less long cinematic sequences dubbed completely in Italian, interpreted by digitized sprites of flesh-and-blood actors, voluntarily animated in jerks to recall a decidedly retro and bizarre feeling, a choice underlined by the music typically sixties, even if not always convincing and often even too monotonous. The general quality of the narration is therefore discreet but its predictability and the frequent monotony of some dialogues, sometimes redundant, make the game digestible especially in small doses. The 3D effect Needless to say, the stereoscopic effect is barely exploited in James Noir's Hollywood Crimes: mostly it offers a depth effect, detaching the characters we will meet from the background, and sometimes it makes the analysis of a certain object a little more captivating. There are few quizzes based on the 3D effect and, paradoxically, they can be easily solved even with the slider set to minimum. This is Hollywood! The core of the game is obviously the puzzles, also because solving them is the only thing to do all the time: there are no moments of exploration in the Ubisoft game and the interaction with characters and scenarios is reduced to a minimum. The player is subjected to a flurry of numerous quizzes that characterize the evidence of the episodes of The Incredible Puzzle Masters or the cryptic clues that could lead us to the serial killer who is terrorizing Hollywood; even if it is not necessary to solve them all, this is still the only way to progress in the story and, of course, the difficulty of the various puzzles is completely subjective. In general, the quizzes offered in James Noir's Hollywood Crimes are above all logical or mathematical, but there is certainly no lack of variety and the one hundred and forty-one puzzles declared on the game packaging offer different challenges for each type of player, without ever reaching the qualitative peaks of the challenges proposed in the adventures of Professor Layton. The problem lies in the fluctuating objective difficulty of some puzzles that sometimes prove to be too easy or even too difficult: in the latter case we are met with an aid system that is actually excessively cryptic, almost as if it were an enigma in the enigma. However, the suggestions are limited in number and it can be frustrating to waste an opportunity pto receive a practically useless suggestion. In case you are unable to solve a puzzle, there is little you can do: the adventure for us will end there until a decisive stroke of genius. The linearity of the game structure, combined with the difficulty of some quizzes and the frequency with which they are submitted make the experience often heavy and marked in a not always homogeneous way.", "date": "2011-12-02", "grade": "6.8"}
