{"name": "Madden NFL 2003", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/madden-nfl-2003_a.html", "text": "Gameplay Once you get on the pitch, you immediately realize that things haven't changed much since previous editions. There is indeed some more movement and the AI of the CPU seems really improved, but we certainly cannot speak of a revolution. Before each action we are given the opportunity to select the formation and the scheme that we consider most appropriate, without any limitation (in the sense that we can also paradoxically decide to hit a field goal from 50 yards in a first down situation). For the more experienced, I would also like to point out the possibility of making the fake spike, really useful even if it is now abused in the NFL. Once the offensive scheme has been decided, you take control of the quarterback if you have chosen to pass or of the carrier in running plays. The control system is the classic one of games of the genre: each receiver is assigned a key on the joypad by pressing which the ball will be directed in his direction. In addition to choosing the receiver, the player is left with the decision on the type and power of the throw. As far as running games are concerned, the feints at our disposal are not very numerous, but all are actually useful. If the offensive part of the game is almost free from defects, in defense there is a big problem to report, even if it can be solved. When the CPU is about to pass, the camera does not change (as it happens when the player is in control of the QB) with the consequence of remaining too low to the ground and close to the opposing quarterback, preventing us from keeping an eye on the receivers outside opponents and, above all, our cornerbacks. While this flaw can be overcome by selecting the far chamber, it makes defensive play frustrating and intercepting or deflecting passes is more a matter of luck than skill. A pity, given the general quality of the title. Even in the management of the team off the pitch, the EA title is renewed without upheavals by introducing, in the ~Franchise~ mode, the possibility of hiring scouts to whom you can assign the most promising rookies but leaving the management of the roster and the draft almost unchanged, which however does not need no change. Graphics and Sound Graphically the game looks good, without making a miracle cry. The player models are a bit too ~fake~ compared to competing titles, and the animations, while being very good (splendid when the player blows off the helmet after a particularly hard contact) do not reach the level of NFL 2k3. The stadiums have improved compared to previous editions and the audience is slightly more realistic, even if not very clean. Even as regards the architectures, however, Madden does not hold the comparison with the two rivals (NFL Fever and NFL 2k3) resulting in any case more than discreet. However, the touches of class are not lacking; players get dirty and the weather changes (albeit rarely) dynamically during the course of the match. The textures are generally of good quality even if NFL Fever remains from another planet. EA promised a completely new comment, and in fact it is new for being new. New, however, does not mean better, but John Madden and Al Michaels do its duty. The effects from the pitch are, on the other hand, excellent, so much so that we almost feel the pain felt by the players on the pitch. The music is amazing. As we navigate the menus, a box in the upper right corner indicates the title, author and album of the piece we are listening to. Brilliant. Only note, the genre is all about rock (rather heavy) which goes very well with simulated sport but which is not very welcome to the black players of the league who continue to prefer Rap (ask for ~My name is Willie~ by ~Ogni maledetta Sunday would be too much?). Conclusions Despite its flaws, Madden NFL 2003 is still a great game, perhaps the best in some ways. The similarity with the previous version here is a minor flaw, given that this one has never been converted for the European market, and, waiting to know if NFL 2k3 will suffer the same fate or not, the EA sports game is a Recommended purchase for all fans of the genre. PROS: Longevity ensured by the many game modes; Customizable in every respect; Oscar soundtrack. CONS: Defensive game could be improved; There is nothing really innovative; Graphically inferior to the competition. Film Materials Presentation and features No presentation this time, or at least nothing that could be called aat presentation. In fact, upon starting the game, we are greeted by a few seconds of footage in which the most famous players (each time a different one, in random sequence) recite the EA sports motto ~It's in the game~. This slogan has never been more apt, since this year there is really everything in the game and, if something is missing, we can create it. The now usual possibility of creating players and teams is joined by the editors of schemes and formations, really complete and, of course, the characteristic album of ~Madden Cards~. These virtual figurines (some of which unlock teams, stadiums or cheats) are obtained by buying ~packages~ with the tokens that are earned by performing certain actions during matches (for example returning a kick for a TD) or by completing the numerous other modes of game. By selecting the ~game modes~ item (the menu, like the whole game, including the manual, is in English) we are, in fact, faced with a very large list of items. In order: Mini Camp, Francise, Tournament, 2-Minute Drill, Football 101, Practice and Situation (in which we can choose time and score from which to start). If the ~Franchise~, ~Tournament~ and ~Practice~ modes do not require further explanation, it is necessary to say a few words about the three ~real~ sub-games at our disposal. The ~Mini Camp~ is the real novelty. It is necessary to face, through four levels of difficulty, some exercises aimed at improving the skills of the (human) player in the various fundamentals. For example, we will be called to play running games with fake blockers, or try to intercept as many passes as possible in one minute. Completing these ~drills~ we are awarded a trophy in relation to our points with the classic subdivision of the medals (bronze, silver and gold) and, if we get the most precious metal, also a precious Madden Card. But that's not all; by passing the tests, situations are unlocked in which it is necessary to put into practice in ~real~ games what has been learned in the training camp. For example, by passing the Field Goals test we will find ourselves down by two points a few seconds from the end with the request to score (again in exchange for a Madden Card) the decisive free kick. The ~2-Minute Drill~ is a very fun mode in which you lead only the attack for two minutes trying to score as many points as possible. After a possible touchdown, the ball will be returned to its own 20 yards. Also in this case we can earn tokens useful for buying Madden Cards. ~Football 101~ is a real football school in which the strengths and weaknesses of the various offensive formations are explained to us and shown how some schemes should be executed. Schemes that we will then have to complete ourselves, obtaining, as usual, points to buy the stickers. In case of an irrepressible desire to play immediately, just select the ~Play Now~ item from the main menu.", "date": "2002-10-09", "grade": null}
