{"name": "Shadowrun Returns", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/121683-shadowrun-returns-il-grande-ritorno.html", "text": "Shadowrun Returns, the first of the big budget titles to emerge from Kickstarter, carries a great weight on his shoulders and evokes a question similar to the one that must have been whipped up in the brains of the scientists who invented the atomic bomb. Will crowdfunding save us or destroy us all? A single title certainly cannot answer this difficult question but, if successful, it can certainly act as a pillar for the future of bottom-up financing, a practice full of problems but capable of freeing developers from the dreaded influences of managers. The charm of cyberfantasy noire The setting of Shadowrun, a long-standing pen & paper role-playing game, mixes fantasy and cyberpunk, noir tones and horror, science fiction and ghost aspects. The races are typical of fantasy universes while the world draws strong inspiration from Blade Runner and, not surprisingly, has several points in common with the famous paper RPG Cyberpunk. This approach translates into a potentially infinite variety of situations but, on the other hand, the risk of slipping into ridicule is also very high. Luckily for us, Shadowrun Returns, a 3D/2D hybrid RPG with a three-quarter view based on the setting in question, was edited by the same creator of the paper RPG, Jordan Weisman, whose team, right from the first images, has proved to be able to create something concrete and convincing, at least from a visual point of view. Predictably this artistic goodness is confirmed in the final version of the title which gives us extremely well-finished two-dimensional backgrounds, a color palette capable of effectively blending futuristic neon with magic and dozens of portraits for our interlocutors which compensate for the lack of interlude scenes. A detail, the latter, which effectively summarizes the nature of the technical sector of the title, poor but very accurate. And the cure extends to the dialogues and the story that lead us into a whirlwind of corruption, smoky bars, drugs of all kinds, various types of loneliness, madness and sudden heroic deeds. We have no intention, here, of revealing details of the plot which begins in a decidedly original way and is immediately capable of involving us. But we can undoubtedly reveal that the pacing is spot on, the descriptions engaging, the wisecracks and the gory twists. Everything you would expect from a sci-fi noire with the addition of magic, zombies, spirits, the possibility of accessing the web and decidedly particular facial features for the genre. On the other hand, even if the ogres of Shadowrun Returns are not tribal beings but citizens of a futuristic Seattle, we are still talking about huge greenish beings, with all that derives from them in terms of personality and physical characteristics. Characteristics that, as in any self-respecting role-playing game, are influenced by race, affect skills and grant the characters a whole series of possibilities as in the case of the charisma that influences the dialogues by expanding the response possibilities through the acquisition of different forms of ~label~. A bit like in the movies, the ones in which the penniless protagonist learns to pretend to be a prince, we, even choosing to play the role of an outcast, can pretend to be refined corporates by weaving impossible relationships for a suburban waste. The first points to be distributed in the skills are granted to us in the character creation phase which includes a series of pre-built templates, from the magician to the shaman, but which also allows us to create a whole new class, mixing extremely different skills. In essence, even if an adept troll is the potentially most effective character in close combat, we can create a human, who has an innate bonus to charisma, still focusing on close combat and perhaps spice things up with a little of hacking. This setting obviously increases the variety of options granted to our avatar but, on the other hand, prevents specialization given that the points earned by proceeding in the adventure are distributed among the numerous skills and characteristics on which they depend. The level of the latter, in fact, must be higher than that of the skills for these to be raised. Freedom and limits of an ambitiously modest project As it should be in all RPGs worthy of this definition, in Shadowrun Returns the customization of the avatar is really free thanks to the implementation of a possibility that allows you to balance all the shortcomings of our character. Between one mission and another it is in fact possible to hire up to three paid mercenaries who will join us in the next mission. These are called runners, they arecome in different classes and have different skill sets to evaluate before spending the money necessary to hire them. The selection window, among other things, already indicates which is the possible NPC of the campaign that will be joined automatically, in order to allow us to fill the gaps in the party adequately. Mages are especially useful due to the ability to heal, debuff, buff, or area effect. Deckers, on the other hand, can hack into computer systems, while shamans are proficient in spiritual matters and conjurations. Then there are the riggers, who use drones, the adepts, who mix firearms and edged weapons, and the samurai who, despite the name, are lovers of large-caliber cannons. Runners are initially low-level such as weapons, implants, gadgets, and clothing. All elements that grow hand in hand with our character in order to keep the fights more or less balanced. The only element that escapes this controlled growth are the cybernetic implants that compensate for the poor customization of the clothing, limited to a single slot, and do not change over time. Unfortunately, getting them is all too simple since the campaign literally fills us with money, allowing us to buy practically everything. But there is a limitation and it concerns a secondary characteristic of the character called essence. Each system has an essence cost and this is low enough to considerably limit the possibilities for cybernetic customization. In addition, per point lost in this trait increases the cooldowns of spells by one. These can still be launched after the expiry of any standard cooldown, but in doing so our character suffers damage. From a role-playing point of view, in essence, there is enough to enjoy and even if the complexity of Shadowrun Returns is not up to the great exponents of the genre, it is sufficient to adequately support the combat and narrative sector. However, there are other sectors that we would have liked to see richer. The maps of Shadowrun Returns are static and practically devoid of animated elements apart from some broken neon that sadly flashes. And even the characters that populate the city are motionless, statues waiting for a possible script to tell them if it's time to move or to fight. Furthermore, the campaign developed by Harebrained Schemes almost completely lacks the exploratory element and is very limited in terms of interaction with the game world. In essence, Shadowrun Returns is not a perfect title and could prove disappointing for those who, in the past months, have hoped to be able to walk freely in a lively and dynamic cyberpunk environment. But that's not to say there isn't some good in the Harebrained Schemes RPG. The campaign is remote-controlled but it is also tight, full of dialogues, crossroads, detailed descriptions and twists. And all this is enhanced by the extravagant but believable and decidedly profound characters, by the extreme clothing and by a dark and apt soundtrack. Furthermore, we must not forget the editor, the highlight of the package, which despite being bound by some of the aforementioned limitations is intuitive and versatile and can be used to create adventures also equipped with exploration and greater interaction with the environment. The dialogues, in English, are not dubbed but are very accurate, witty, intriguing and full of alternative answers which, as we have already said, are unlocked depending on the oratorical skills of the characters. Furthermore, the addition of the network, although the game mechanics are not distorted in the matrix, is a distinctive trait that should not be overlooked. When the game is hard The turn-based combat system is structured very simply. Each character has a certain number of action points available. These can be consumed to activate abilities, ranging from spells to special strikes, or to move, with a visual indicator showing where your currently available action points can go. There are no resources such as mana and bullets are infinite even if the magazine empties and must be reloaded by spending an action point. During the action the characters can kneel and can take advantage of some covers to reduce the percentage of being hit by the opponents. But the cover system is very limited, reactive fire is limited to a single automatic counterattack, and there are no stealth options of any kind. The game strategy, essentially, is based on the calculation of the cooldowns of the skills, on the right choice of magical buffs and debuffs, on the use of medikits and resuscitation kits, on the choice of the type of grenade to use in a givensituation and on the specific combat skills of the characters who, as they level up, can inflict a greater number of critical hits or score entire bursts of machine guns whose overall damage balances the low accuracy rate. The tactical complexity, in essence, is there, even if it is certainly not comparable to that of a title like XCOM. And on the web, the virtual world where the most important information is hidden, things get even simpler. In this case, weapons and magazines don't even exist and the characters are all endowed with skills very similar to the spells of wizards and shamans. But we find an additional element capable of varying the situation in some way and that is time. A bar at the bottom of the screen grows gradually, more or less rapidly depending on the skill of the decker and the concealment skills it is equipped with, until countermeasures are activated. Initially the degree of challenge of the Shadowrun Returns fights is far too low and it is not essential to have a curator in the party. But when the main mission comes to life, after a macabre twist, equipment and companions become quite useful to avoid the infrequent but possible deaths. An occurrence that, of course, can also be avoided with the right use of skills. The burst is effective up close and can deal a lot of damage while at a distance it is preferable to use a aimed shot or, if the hit percentage with weapons is too low, use a spell or a grenade capable of lowering defense or aiming percentage of the enemy. Saving takes place automatically every time we change location. This choice is on the one hand comfortable and on the other problematic since it forces us to complete a scene before being able to leave the game. If nothing else, the save can be copied and it is good to remember this possibility when using the rewind option which allows you to retrieve a previous save but in doing so cancels all subsequent ones.
