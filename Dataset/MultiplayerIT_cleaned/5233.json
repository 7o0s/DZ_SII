Obviously, the launch of PlayStation VR was also accompanied by a good dose of scares, between the killer clowns of Until Dawn: Rush of Blood and the ravenous sharks of VR Worlds, but among all it is probably Here They Lie that demonstrates how the genre of horror can benefit from virtual reality. Too bad that, at the same time, it is also the game that most of all highlights the limits and problems of viewers. Here They Lie proved to be a generic PlayStation VR horror, not for the faint-hearted An unfortunate reality Developed by a team of veterans under the Tangentlemen label, Here They Lie is a cross walking simulator/horror game in the style of Outlast, in which you explore a desolate and surreal city while trying not to be discovered and overtaken by some mysterious creatures. Very vague and deliberately cryptic, the narrative behind the game takes shape through messages to be read and rare dialogues with characters, but it is once the anonymous and boring initial chapter is over that Here They Lie becomes disturbing and frightening. The adventure quickly becomes unpleasant and overwhelming, but sadly for the completely wrong reasons. In virtual reality, moving freely around the landscape is an experience for those with strong stomachs, and there's a reason why most games that accompany PlayStation VR see your avatar sitting or standing in the same position. It only takes a few minutes to feel trapped in a nightmare, too distracted by the growing sense of nausea to be able to concentrate on what is happening in the game. Several times we had to interrupt our test to catch our breath, and the developer's attempt to limit the motion sickness through the implementation of the ~stutter-turn~, a technique of those who develop in VR that allows you to use the right stick to jerk the camera 45. Too bad that in Here They Lie this transition is not immediate (as in Minecraft VR, for example) but takes place through long transitions, making the experience less intuitive and slower (which is no small matter when you try not to be seen or to run away from a monster). The artistic style, too much blur and the choice of colors (or rather, their absence), which make the game of Tangentlemen graphically more original, but with the result that on certain occasions it is difficult to distinguish the various elements does not help of the scenario. Obviously the sense of nausea varies from person to person, but it is known that the games in which you walk freely with the analog stick are the ones that put the user to the test. Furthermore, even excluding motion sickness from the equation, what remains is a rather anonymous horror experience with an uninspired setting, which from time to time cannot resist the temptation to indulge in some easy jump-scare. The flashlight quickly becomes a ball and chain, shutting down regularly and requiring the player to tilt the DualShock to direct the beam of light (which, nine times out of ten, never works as it should). It's a real shame, because in Here They Lie there is something good: having to physically lean forward to be able to peek around a corner in search of a monster is a simple but very engaging action, and on several occasions it is natural to crouch down to avoid being seen, which is absolutely unnecessary, considering how short-sighted and stupid the enemies are. However, the thing that remains most impressed in this world of clear Lovecraftian inspiration is represented by the creatures that populate it, bizarre humanoids who wear animal heads and behave in a repugnant and wild way. In a particular sequence of the game, these beings put us in front of a moral choice with very bloody implications, giving one of the (unfortunately few) memorable moments of the entire adventure.
