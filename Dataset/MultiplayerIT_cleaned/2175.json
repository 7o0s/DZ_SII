{"name": "Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rainbow-six-rogue-spear-2.html", "text": "Rescue the hostages and wipe out the Marranos! For those few who don't know, ~RS: RS~ mixes strategic elements with those of an action game in a very balanced way. In fact, each mission requires not only a long and careful analysis of the military tactics to be adopted, but also an accurate precision in the actions of pure blasting or hostage recovery. In short, ~aim well and make little mistakes~ will be a constant principle for the entire duration of each mission. These present objectives of the most varied nature, ranging from the defusing of explosive devices to the pure total destruction of some areas. It is important to add that there are some levels that require maximum action discretion (like Metal Gear Solid, to be clear) in order not to sound the alarm from the enemies; while in other situations only firepower is required, with people who understand heavy weapons... In fact, as in every self-respecting episode of the saga, even here it is necessary to choose who to send on a mission before this begins. This will prove to be essential for completing the objectives as each soldier has their own unique skills. In ~RS~ we find four types of men, namely: stormtroopers (skilled soldiers who can count on a medium type armament), demolishers (~massive~ people especially in terms of firepower), snipers (futile explanation) and scouts (magicians in the use of electronic equipment and in stealth). Unfortunately, the list of selectable soldiers is not unlimited, so as to force the player to treasure their fur so as not to find himself without men available before completing all the missions (fifteen in all located in different places around the world). Then, mastering all the controls will prove to be child's play in about ten minutes of play and, once this is done, you will be ready to enjoy a simple but complex title at the same time. A new Metal Gear Solid? It is true that a comparison with the aforementioned game appears a little risky, but it is useful to underline how the setting and the atmosphere that reigns in the Ubi Soft title are very reminiscent of the adventures experienced by Snake and company. Sure, you can't leave naughty magazines near enemy guards here to get their attention, though. However, the basic structure approaches Mr. Kojima's masterpiece, although in ~RS~ you will also have the opportunity to lead a squad with up to four soldiers. Furthermore, proceeding with the similarities, discretion and stealth in carrying out one's ~job~ are also important in the product in question. This is demonstrated by the excellent artificial intelligence algorithms of the enemies who are alerted if they hear noises or footsteps, and then investigate these anomalies. It is not uncommon to see terrorists who, hearing your footsteps from afar, inspect the area and then come back when they don't notice anything strange. For this it is necessary to proceed with the utmost caution and, why not, even lowered in order not to attract too much attention (or in the ear, in this case). The weapons available vary depending on the type of soldier selected. Among them we mention the legendary and classic Beretta 92 FS, a nice M4 machine gun and an M9, a devastating shotgun and two different types of grenades, one blinding and another explosive. How not to mention, then, the very precise sniper rifle supplied exclusively to snipers (excellent for long-range targets). In short, there are many elements present in the title created by Red Storm Ent., and they all contribute to deepening the playful experience at the highest levels. And the technical profile? Aesthetically speaking ~RS~ offers nothing particularly exciting. The whole graphic sector carries out its work without giving or taking anything away from the average. What is certain is that both the settings and the characters appear a little too small. A closer view certainly wouldn't have hurt. The character design stands at mediocre levels, while slightly greater care has been dedicated to the backdrops. Let's be clear, a 32-bit like the GBA could give much more in technical terms, it all lies in the realization and in the care placed by the programmers who, in this case, should have worked harder. This does not mean that ~RS~ is bad to see, on the contrary! It's nice but also quite dated. That's all. Fortunately, the definition does its job well and it never happens to get confused in the presence of multiple characters on the screen. The animations were well done, just look at the ~cautious~ walk with which the members of dIn the Rainbow Six special team they proceed through the various locations. The sound sector of the game deserves a separate discussion, which hides a great job behind it. In fact, the soundtrack appears compelling from the first start screen, abandoning us in some moments of the game to give the right atmosphere. Sound effects like gunshots, explosions etc. they are quite good as well as the speech of the characters which is very understandable (even if with a dictionary of only five-six words ...). So this ~RS~ represents a very entertaining title capable of giving GBA owners hours and hours of exasperated fun. Fifteen missions with three different levels of difficulty and a cooperative mode for up to four players skyrocket the longevity of the Ubi Soft product. And if you are a fan of the genre and do not make graphics a raison d'tre, this turns out to be an excellent purchase. Pros: Simple to play. Fun and complex. Challenging in the right way. Cons: Graphically not excellent. It all looks a little smaller. A long saga By now Rainbow Six we all know it, from the oldest episode to the most recent one. A series that has its roots several years ago but which is renewed on various consoles with each new appointment with the evil terrorists of the moment. This chapter, also released on Psone and PC, represents the first (at least for now) incarnation on the small 32-bit portable jewel. Needless to say, aficionados of the series will be thrilled, especially those who, fortunately, own a GameBoy Advance. And they do well! Because this cartridge represents what is defined as a beautiful videogame product. Below you can read the reasons for this statement.", "date": "2002-04-08", "grade": null}
