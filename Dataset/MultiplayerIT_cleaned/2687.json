The cold of Kaldheim will take care of opening the dances, but during the year we could remind you that we will finally see the much hoped-for meeting between Magic: The Gathering and Dungeons & Dragons. After a large number of hours spent on the new set (also thanks to the recent Streamer Event which guaranteed us 24 hours of early access) we are ready to offer you our final judgment in the Magic: The Gathering Arena - Kaldheim review. Two floors and a philosophy Kaldheim is not a twist. So don't expect the same explosive effect that Zendikar created four months ago, because the new set is an expansion in continuity that wants to cement in the players what good the known plan for explorations has brought into the game. We won't beat around the bush, Modal Double-Faced Cards (CBMs) have turned out to be what we predicted, which is a great watershed in fans, but at the same time a very important revolution in approaches to Magic. The cold plan of Kaldheim, which we have had the opportunity to tell you about in a dedicated special, will accompany you through Norse myths and legends, making you feel at home among new mechanics and welcome returns. Let's start from the CBMs: the cycle of the ~Passage~ earths is finally concluded and all the pairings of colors are now available as rare earths. What makes the difference, however, are the introductions of CBM creature/equipment and creature/planeswalker. These cards are already dominating the meta in some top tier decks (5c God for example, or Boros Equip) and see play in different situations outside the creation of ad hoc decks. As we have told you on several occasions, having this kind of choice and layering of approaches in the deck building phase is clearly the strong point of Modal Double-Faced Cards, a quality that can really make the difference. Despite the massive return of Giants and Elves in the Kaldheim set, it is the Sagas and Polymorphs that have found the greatest consensus among enthusiasts. After our tests we feel like saying that in fact it is these last two returns that have the highest impact in-game. Unlike what we saw in Theros, Kaldheim Sagas are cards that have a greater influence in the game. Some of them are even able to be used as a finisher in round four or five. As for the Polymorph cards and the Changeling keyword, by themselves they make you understand how they are very useful cards at present, being able to see play in almost 90% of Tribal or Party decks, decks that in the early days are dominating the rankings. Instead, what has left us rather perplexed is the scarce (currently) usefulness of the new keywords: Predict and Boast. These mechanics enter the synergies of the best current decks little and only in rare cases are they exploited properly. Before the official release of the set we were very curious about how they could influence the strategic choices of the players, but today we believe that these mechanics are the real Achilles heel of Kaldheim. The possibility of activating effects after an attack and paying a negligible mana cost to plan the use of a card in subsequent turns have not, to date, been able to create the disruptive effect that was expected in the public. A feast for the eyes and for the game However, Magic is not just strategies and keywords. Magic is also collecting and beauty, art and vanity. Kaldheim in our view fully embodies this spirit, as has not been seen for years. The care and quality with which the images have been created are truly jaw-dropping. What is surprising is not the style, but the precision with which the details represent some of the myths, legends and even clichs of Norse culture. We've had the opportunity to take a close look at all the alternative Showcase Art awaiting players and can confirm that the work done equals the incredible Throne of Eldraine set linked to fairy tales. As we said before, however, it is the combination of these two sides: strategy and beauty that make Magic the longest-running card game so far. It is precisely for this reason that speaking of cards we cannot fail to mention those which for us are the spearheads of this expansion. Let's start with ~Sigrid, Favorite of the Gods~, an excellent white card that has protection from God creature cards. Still in the white theme, Boros Equip decks cannot do without ~Runesmith Champion~, a card that will allow you once you enter on the field to take a rune equipment from the library or fromgraveyard and put it into your hand. Moving on to the blue cards we find ~Evocator of Cyclones~, or the very strong removal of the Giant Izzet Tribe decks, with which to return all the non-land permanents, wizards and giants in his possession on the battlefield to the opponent's hand. Impossible not to mention the red card ~Deceit of Tibalt~ a two-cost Instant that allows you to do very nasty things including summoning Ugin in the second round and winning the game (there is already talk of a possible ban). Finally two cards that are really dominating the scene: ~Tyvar Kell~ and ~Koma, Serpent of the Cosmos~ with the Elf Planeswalker who is stealing the show with his presence in the Golgari Tribe Elven decks and Koma who as a good alter ego of Jormungandr a once it enters the field within the 5c deck, God definitively closes the game, as it cannot be countered and creates a 3/3 snake token each turn.", "date": "2021-02-01", "grade": "8.3"}
