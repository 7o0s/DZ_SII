{"name": "Meteos: Disney Magic - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/meteos-disney-magic-recensione.html", "text": "Take one of the first puzzle games released for the Nintendo DS, that Meteos from Q Entertainment by the polymath Tetsuya Mitzuguchi. Add to that a handful of characters from the Disney world, which always guarantee their good appeal. Shake everything together and leave it to rest for a couple of years. The result? But Meteos: Disney Magic, of course! I'll play you but... From a technical point of view, the work done by programmers can be considered largely valid; the use of colors is perfect, and the Disney style has been well transported within the game. Without a doubt, more could have been done with regard to the rather limited and static animations, but evidently it was preferred to limit the use of cartridges with greater memory and therefore more expensive. On the other hand, the musical pieces are very well done and perfect to accompany the action without distracting. On the other hand, the absence of an online multiplayer mode disappoints; if, in fact, as far as games with friends via ad-hoc network are concerned, there is everything one could ask for, the two years that have passed since the first Meteos would certainly have made it possible to fill this gap, especially given that in the meantime the infrastructure of the Nintendo portable she has matured and grown. And it would have been a particularly useful addition to give new luster to a gameplay that frankly cannot be considered among those attributable to the Olympus of puzzle games. Already two years ago Meteos was a more than enjoyable title but difficult to define excellent, and which in direct comparison with Lumines by Mitzuguchi himself appeared as the ~younger brother~. Today the situation has not changed, and indeed in the meantime the market has churned out a series of puzzles on the DS itself which have made the situation much more competitive than in the past. Comment Meteos: Disney Magic is fortunately a product different enough from the original to avoid the uncomfortable label of ~commercial operation~. The changes to the game mechanics have in fact given birth to a variation of the concept that is at least as valid as the original, and the Disney setting appears to be spot on and well mixed with the gameplay. That said, the absence of an online multiplayer mode and more generally the impossibility of placing Meteos among the masterpieces of the genre place Disney Magic among the more than good but not unmissable puzzle games. Pros Spot on gameplay changes Good graphics Disney magic is there Cons Meteos wasn't and isn't a masterpiece No online multiplayer Limited animations Mickey Mouse Puzzle League In reality, things are a little different from how we have simplistically described them above; Meteos Disney Magic is fortunately not a mere commercial operation dedicated to exploiting the characters created by the most famous designer in the world, but on the contrary it also brings with it a revision of the original mechanics of the game, with more than noticeable differences. Obviously the concept has remained intact; also in this case it is basically a question of grouping groups of at least 3 identical blocks, to thus see them transform into rockets and disappear towards the top of the screen. From level to level the factor of the force of gravity, more or less marked, must also be considered, which constitutes an obstacle for the happy departure of the above blocks; in such cases it is necessary to create other combinations, to ensure greater thrust and thus achieve one's goal. But let's move on to the innovations introduced by this version: firstly, now the console must be held vertically, like a book, in the way that now seems to be gaining more and more ground within the software park of the Nintendo portable console. The increased usable screen area has allowed for larger block sizes, thus making it less easy to make accuracy errors in this regard. Compared to the futuristic plot adopted with the first Meteos, in Disney Magic everything revolves around some of the most famous stories of the American multinational: Toy Story, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh, the Lion King, Lilo & Stitch, The Little Mermaid, the Pirates of the Caribbean and Cinderella. Unlike the original, in which the challenge was continuously against opponents controlled by the CPU, in this case it was preferred to put this solution into the background, more often adopting the achievement of certain set objectives as a target. And while the action takes place on one screen, simple animations and images of the selected cartoon scroll on the other, then visible in the appropriate gallery once unlocked. But the most significant difference of this new edition certainly lies in the unprecedented possibility of moving the blocks not only vertically, but also horizontally (I am the expertfashion remains faithful to tradition). A choice that significantly changes the gameplay, giving Meteos Disney Magic a more than sufficient personality and such as to allow it to detach itself from the idea of a simple ~Meteos with Mickey Mouse~ that many had made on the eve. It must be said that, although this variation may annoy the most ardent fans of the original, the result is more than satisfactory; the gameplay is not distorted, but rather acquires greater depth. And it's not about making the title easier and therefore accessible to a younger target... we assure you that, at high difficulty levels, Disney Magic can make even the most experienced players sweat the famous seven shirts.", "date": "2007-07-05", "grade": null}
