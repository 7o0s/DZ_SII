With his label Cat in a Box Games he had already published two games on the App Store entitled Blue Defense and Blue Attack, united by simple but effective graphics and very frenetic mechanics: however, if in both the aim was to shoot like hell to defend his planet or destroy that of the opposite faction, the author has decided to completely change the series with a third chapter entitled Red Conquest. The new game for iPhone and iPod Touch is not a shooter at all, but a hard and pure RTS, which since its announcement had set itself the goal of satisfying the most hardcore players and fans of strategy games, thanks to an extremely versatile interface. Within the storyline, the chapter takes its place exactly between the two previous titles, acting as a bridge and resuming the interminable battle between the blue and red forces, without sparing however some twists. It is immediately clear how much attention has been paid to the narrative component, since each level of the two available campaigns is introduced by particularly fascinating cutscenes, although the absence of dialogue and excessive ambiguity makes it rather difficult to fully understand the plot , and only later, when the armies are well deployed, the player will be able to contextualize the continuous battles. When the game is hard... If we set aside the psychological fairy tale that forms the backdrop to the actual game, what remains, however, is a very successful attempt to offer iPhone and iPod Touch users a complex and articulated strategic experience. In a rather classic way, each level is based on the continuous collection of resources and arrangement of your battle units and, although the latter are limited in number, they are more than sufficient to plan non-trivial strategies. In addition to the inevitable mothership, capable of creating units and accumulating resources, there are in fact small spy probes, useful for keeping an eye on enemies within the fog of war, the non-visible part of the map; everything is completed by cargo-scavengers, who collect resources in the scenario, and by two more or less slow and more or less fast battle units. However, accompanying casual users by the hand does not seem to have been one of the developer's priorities: those who are not practical enough with RTS end up finding themselves in decidedly difficulty, moving each single unit in an awkward and disorganized way. The secret, and the most hardcore players will be happy about this, lies in the use of macros and in the deployment of one's forces in formation. Through a complicated grid of icons and buttons, it is possible to set or save particular arrangements, ranging from moving in line to surrounding the enemy, up to defending one's weakest units by gathering them in the center of one's army. Moving from one menu to another is initially quite cumbersome, and a little practice is required to be able to activate the strategy capable of neutralizing an enemy attack in a few moments. Another reason why the use of predefined formations is recommended lies in the bad manual management of each ship: in fact, it may happen that one of these is unable to reach a certain point because it is blocked, even only partially, by an ally or an enemy. In addition to three different single-player modes, the author has implemented an excellent multiplayer option, playable both locally and online, and which allows a considerable degree of customization; it is in fact possible to divide into teams, select your own faction or challenge up to seven friends in matches of various types, while the few bugs that afflicted online matches have been corrected with the latest update.
