The Italian plumber appeared as an umpire in Tennis and Punch-Out!! for NES, waved the flag in F-1 Race for Game Boy and tried his hand at golf for the first time in NES Open Tournament Golf, together with his brother Luigi: it was 1991. Shortly after he and his friends created the first, true spin-off of the series: the classic Super Mario Kart for SNES. And then again ~conventional~ sports: tennis, golf, baseball, soccer, basketball and so on, up to the recent Olympic Games for the SEGA crossover. Well, the popularity of Mario and his friends is once again put at the service of sports disciplines, but this time Square Enix takes care of it with Mario Sports Mix, a party game for four players (but also featuring online multiplayer) that includes volleyball , basketball, hockey, dodgeball and a series of nice variants for the delight of young and old. The characters included in the game are twelve, and they differ from each other on the basis of values such as power, speed and technique: Mario, Luigi and Yoshi are the most versatile, suitable for a large number of situations; Peach, Daisy and Waluigi instead stand out for their technique, which allows them on more than one occasion to perform insidious maneuvers; Wario, Donkey Kong and Bowser are clearly the powerful ones, capable of throwing blows that are difficult to counter; Finally, Diddy Kong, Bowser Junior and Toad are the fast characters, an important feature when you find yourself chasing the trajectory of a ball. Keep it simple As a good party game, Mario Sports Mix focuses on a simple and immediate control system, which not surprisingly often sees the assignment of the same actions to the movements of the Wii-mote: you have to shake the controller upwards to lift the ball, shake it down to hit her. There is a clear correlation between what happens on the screen and the position of the Wii-mote, which makes the experience even more accessible. In volleyball, for example, the advanced control scheme requires that we make the jump manually, by pressing the A button, while the rest of the actions are performed by shaking the controller and moving the Nunchuk analog stick. And so the dynamics that characterize each game are more or less these: service (Wii-mote up to lift the ball, down to hit it), bagher (Wii-mote up), lift (Wii- mote up) and dunk (A-Button to jump, then Wii-mote down). Using the analog stick it is possible to determine the trajectory of the ball, while jumping in front of the net in the defensive phase with the right timing results in an effective block that returns the attack to the sender. Each character has a bar which, once filled, allows him to perform a characteristic special move, which obviously changes according to the sporting discipline. During volleyball matches, for example, Wario can throw a smoke bomb into the opponent's half of the field and thus dunk the ball without noticing its trajectory. Similarly Toad causes two large mushrooms to sprout from the ground that stun opponents long enough to prevent them from implementing a defensive maneuver. Basketball works in a similar way: the A button is used to pass the ball to your partner or steal it from an opponent, while the vertical shake of the Wii-mote triggers the jump shot or dunk. Dodgeball, not very well known here, turns out to be perhaps the weakest discipline: each character has an energy bar that must be reset to eliminate him, and this result is obtained by hitting him with the ball without being able to to grab her. The ~grab~ is performed by pressing the A and B buttons simultaneously, but the precision of this maneuver leaves something to be desired. Finally there is hockey, both on ice and on land, where the dynamics of contrast between the members of the two teams can lead to real fights, while the goal finish must necessarily be calibrated in order to catch the goalkeeper out of position . Mario Sports Mix may not be a perfect party game, but it comes close enough Who doesn't play together... The Square Enix title was designed to be played in four, and it is in the multiplayer dimension that it manages to express itself at its best. Playing alone is in fact rather limiting, given the enemy AI is not always up to par, especially in tournaments. To reinforce this concept, each sport has been combined with a minigame (accessible from Party mode) for four people: ~Pippin is hungry!~ is the one combined with basketball, and sees us catching fruit on the fly and then throwing them suspended towards a huge carnivorous plant; ~Bagher-Music~, based on volleyball, is a sort of musical minigame which, to the sound of the most beautiful classic Mario tunes sees you teaming up with other players in a series of rhythmic bouts; ~Scansamania~ has to do with dodgeball: there are four cannons shooting bombs, and we have to dodge them, while trying to ensure that our opponents are hit instead; ~Hockey barrels~, finally, turns out to be the least brilliant minigame, with players having to push their opponents to make them fall off an ice platform. The presence of an online multiplayer mode enriches undoubtedly the offer of Mario Sports Mix: alone or in pairs with a friend, we can in fact challenge opponents from all over the world in the sport we prefer.The matchmaking proved to be inexplicably fast, and the game completely lag-free : an excellent result! In conclusion, graphics and sound have always proved to be up to the task: some characters manage to be really funny, the design in general is well done, there is an abundance of very colorful scenarios and the music that accompanies the action draw on classic Nintendo themes.", "date": "2011-02-07", "grade": "8.0"}
