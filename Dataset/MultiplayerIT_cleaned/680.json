Shrek Superslam is a free-for-all fighting game, with the fights taking place in arenas full of blunt objects that can be used as weapons and elements of the interactable scenario, or in most cases simply available to be destroyed but also to be thrown at opponents or usable as ladders and various platforms to get to an elevated position during the clashes. There are 20 selectable characters and they include all the protagonists of the two Shrek films plus various extras, while the arenas are made up of 16 locations, taken from the film's settings, such as the Gingerbread house, Donkey's castle or the shop of Geppetto. The game dynamic is along the lines of the Super Smash Bros series, or, perhaps even more similarly, of Power Stone, but there are no energy bars for the characters, only a ~Mazzate Indicator~ (quoting verbatim from the booklet of 'instructions) which fills up, in fact, as you strike left and right, making it possible, once filled, to perform the special move characteristic of each character. This ~Attacco Mazzata~ proves to be essential in determining the winner, since whoever manages to perform it several times in the two minutes of the match will win the victory. To facilitate the attack power and the consequent filling of the Gauge, various elements of the scenography and some weapons that will appear from time to time in the arena will be usable during the battles. Orc barrel! Since there is no particular purpose beyond the filling of the Club Meter and the use of special moves, it follows that the game, in its main mode, is limited to simply being a brawl without great strategic components, with the victory it mostly comes by hitting the controller keys with blows and perhaps trying to carry out the various characteristic combos of each player. To increase the game variety, other modes intervene, namely the ~Mega Challenge~ in single-player, which consists in tackling about fifty mini-games always based on the fight but aimed at particular purposes (this is the mode that allows you to unlock new characters and locations) and the ~King of the Hill~ in multiplayer, in which the winner is whoever manages to stay on top of a snowy mountain for the longest time resisting the attacks of other players. A breeze It is clear that we are dealing with a game designed for a rather young audience, and as such it should be judged, just as it appears evident that Shrek Superslam takes on meaning only if taken into consideration for its multiplayer applications, given the scarce consistency of the single game (the story mode is easily finished in less than an hour) and the low level of challenge that characterizes it (artificial intelligence is at an all-time low). However, this Activision product still manages to be an average good fighting game, even if it does not reach the playability levels of a Super Smash Bros. The technical realization, on the whole, is satisfactory, with the polygonal models of the characters well made and equipped with a characterization very similar to that of the cinematic counterparts in terms of appearance and animations (it is hilarious to see, for example, Donkey trotting with his typical gait from one side of the screen to the other). Even the settings in which the game takes place are made with a fair amount of care, although without an abundance of special effects and graphic virtuosity. In general, the game manages to fully capture the spirit of the crazy world of Shrek, thus assuming some characteristic features that elevate it somewhat from general mediocrity. It is clear that we are dealing with a game designed for a rather young audience, and as such it should be judged A breeze The musical accompaniment is also taken directly from the repertoire of the two Dreamworks films, while the sound effects are in the norm of the genre, in perfect Bud Spencer-style brawl. A good technical sector is not matched by great care in the control system, given that the action on the screen often becomes excessively chaotic and one gets the impression that the commands given arrive late and with little precision, making any strategy impossible of combat despite implementing combined attacks and defensive moves. A cross-platform ogre Shrek Superslam is available for Xbox, PlayStation 2 and Gamecube. There are no particular variations in the various versions, the game looks practically identical on each console. Some minimal improvement in cosmetics can be seen in the Xbox version, generally cleaner graphically and equippedof brighter colors. Comment Shrek Superslam is an excellent party game dedicated to the very young, and as such the fun increases with the number of participants. In single player it will hardly last more than a few afternoons (the time to unlock all the hidden characters and bonuses), but in two or, better, in three or four it will be able to guarantee several hours of joy to the sound of digital blows, ideal for children's birthday parties. Having said that, it is not explained why the game is cataloged ~12+~ by the Pegi system, given that the violence present can be equated to that of an episode of Tom and Jerry and the game structure is clearly dedicated to an audience of all the ages. From a technical point of view, it is a well-made product, with graphics and sound that are at satisfactory levels, but the playability is affected by a lack of precision in the response to the commands, which makes the action in the games chaotic and at times incomprehensible. hectic game phases. Ultimately, the game is recommended for very young people and/or Shrek fans. Pros The crazy world of Shrek at the touch of a joypad Good technical realization Hilarious cutscenes Cons In single player it offers nothing Inaccurate controls Excessively chaotic and at times not very fluid Once upon a time... Predictably, the story behind the game is simply an excuse to justify some sort of fighting game with the characters of Shrek. Being a spin-off, Shrek Superslam goes beyond the plot of the two Dreamworks films, except obviously borrowing characters and sets. However, by choosing the story mode we will be able to witness hilarious unpublished skits that are a prelude to the various fights that we will have to face. But let's go in order: Shrek, Fiona, Puss in Boots, Pinocchio and Gingerbread go one evening to Donkey's castle, where he lives with his wife Drago and their hybrid children. The small creatures half dragon and half quadruped of burden are meanwhile engaged in destroying the house, without wanting to go to sleep, until Shrek amazes everyone by proposing the good old foolproof method: bedtime stories. Since the special book is promptly pulverized by the flames of the little children, the only possibility left for our heroes is to invent a new story for each character in turn, a story that mysteriously always ends with blows...", "date": "2005-12-21", "grade": null}
