{"name": "Two Point Hospital", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/two-point-hospital-recensione.html", "text": "Two Point Hospital is asking us to build and operate a hospital, serving the health care needs of the people of Two Point County. In reality, there are more than one hospitals to be built and they are distributed in the various areas of the county according to a logic of progressive difficulty and gradual unlocking of the game features. The management genre has always had a dual nature: on the one hand there is the constructive side, which requires the player to create the theme park / factory / hospital / hell (or whatever you want), placing structures and infrastructures on it a map. On the other hand there is the economic simulation, with the player having to balance the business costs with the revenues, in order to balance the accounts and make the business profitable, on pain of bankruptcy. Normally, the challenge offered by the genre is determined by the economic model, which the more accurate it is, the more it sets precise limits on the player in the construction phase, imposing rational choices that take into account the various simulated factors. In recent years, however, management software has undergone what we could call ~randomization~: the economic simulation has lost strength, while the sandbox side has gained more and more space, to the point of having had titles such as Planet Coaster or Jurassic World: Evolution in which The challenge is essentially non-existent and parks can be built without any criteria, because they will never go passive anyway. Game mechanics Two Point Hospital sits somewhere in between the two tendencies, trying to remind the player what it means to run something, but without burdening him too much with economic crashes or sudden bankruptcies. As we said, the game does not offer a single territory on which to build, but several, not all accessible immediately, which must be unlocked by increasing the value of the previous hospitals to obtain stars (from one to three, in perfect mobile style). Hospitals must be built within designated areas, which vary according to the difficulty level of the map. For example, the first, which serves as a tutorial, requires you to manage a restricted map, with a low influx of patients, and without the possibility of buying other lots to expand it; while, to give another example, building a city hospital will require the purchase of many lots to increase the healthcare offer, so as to dispose of the enormous influx of patients more easily. From this point of view, the title of Two Point Studios, formed by ex-Bullfrog, the studio that created Theme Hospital and invented the genre with Theme Park, is impeccable and offers an impeccable sense of progression, well managed also in terms of construction of the individual rooms. The first things to do are to set up a reception, to refer patients, and a room for the general practitioner, who will perform the first diagnoses, but this is really the minimum; it will soon be necessary to equip itself with diagnostic rooms, wards for admitting patients and treatment rooms, without forgetting bathrooms, staff rooms, treatment rooms for various diseases and other advanced structures, such as rooms for holding specialization of the staff or that of marketing, the latter to be used to improve the reputation of the structure or to attract specific patients, sometimes linked to the objectives required to obtain the coveted stars. Obviously a hospital cannot function without staff. In Two Point Hospital, four categories of workers can be hired: doctors and nurses, who deal with the health side (diagnosis and therapy); the assistants, i.e. the employees who deal with the reception of patients, sales in the various kiosks, marketing and, in general, all the administrative functions of the hospital; finally there are the attendants, who keep the structure clean, improve the machinery, carry out maintenance and hunt ghosts (spirits of patients who died due to wrong treatments or ineffective therapies). Each worker can have anywhere from none to five specializations, depending on his or her level, with more that can be acquired through master classes. Obviously specific jobs require adequate skills: for example, a doctor must be specialized in psychology to be a psychiatrist, just as a janitor must be trained in mechanics to improve machinery. It should be emphasized that at the beginning you don't have all the rooms: some will have to be unlocked together with the new hospitals, while others will have to be researched and then improved. The construction dynamics are very simple: the rooms are designed with a tile system, while the objects can only be positioned where they do not intersect with the walls,with other objects or with the doors, in order to guarantee their functioning. Each room has a minimum size, due to the obligatory objects it must contain, but can be expanded to increase the prestige and with it the value of the entire hospital. Apart from the basic ones, each room can be decorated with different objects, some available immediately, others to be unlocked by spending points that accumulate by overcoming the assigned objectives (which we will talk about again). Don't worry, because there are no microtransactions (even if a few more items wouldn't have hurt). Decorating rooms serves to increase their prestige and, in some cases, to improve their functionality. For example, placing bookshelves in the graduate rooms increases the speed of learning. Gameplay What would a hospital be without its patients? Healthcare is a huge business and at Two Point Hospital there is never a shortage of patients and illnesses. For example, there are people who have found light bulbs instead of a head, or others who are affected by ~clownitis~, that is, they go around all day dressed as clowns. There are also many who feel like Freddie Mercury, or others who are full of parasites. As you may have understood, Two Point Hospital has really light-hearted tones, as indeed Theme Hospital had them. Despite this, the game requires patients to follow a fairly realistic process to recover: first they must rely on the opinion of the general practitioner, then, if required, they must carry out tests (analysis and so on). Only when the diagnosis is clear can specific therapy be started (although sometimes the analyzes do not give 100% certain results). Here, if you like, the actual management part begins, which as we said is not penalizing as in the classic management systems, but still manages to give some satisfaction. Let's say that the goal is the classic one of balancing supply and demand, avoiding inconvenience to patients: in this way we don't need to hire unnecessary staff, but at the same time we can't skimp on certain services. For example, the lines of general practitioners tend to get congested easily, so you have to build more rooms, perhaps placing benches outside to seat waiting patients. In some territories it may be useful to build even more rooms of the same type to respond to different needs. For example, in a mountain resort full of vacationers, fractures will abound, while the university hospital will need to be equipped with more rooms for training courses to guarantee postgraduates a complete training course. In general, it is really difficult for costs to become excessive, even in the face of ~cheerful~ initial investments, so to speak. After all, the individual therapies cost an eye (especially the surgical ones, which are unlocked towards the end of the game) and can be monetized in various ways, by selling newspapers, building coin ops or food and drink vending machines, therefore the sources of income they never fail. In short, to go into the red you really have to make some serious mistakes, hiring staff even when they are not needed, raising salaries without criteria, asking for useless loans or building rooms without there being a demand for that type of treatment. This impoverishes the gameplay a bit, which in some ways is very calm, in the sense that you never feel the urgency to intervene in some way to fix critical situations, perhaps because you were wrong to build or due to sudden emergencies. The last three hospitals certainly offer greater complexity, but nothing comparable to the classics of the genre, such as the aforementioned Theme of Bullfrog, or to Afterlife (to give another example), where the management also imposed its logic on the construction. In Two Point Hospital, patients are influenced by very few factors: apart from illnesses, they can leave the hospital out of boredom (waiting too long) or because basic services such as bathrooms are missing. Factors such as hygiene, the beauty of the hospital, the positioning of the rooms, their size and so on, seem irrelevant or, at least, are so easy to deal with that one hardly notices their presence. Some of these emerge especially when linked to objectives assigned by staff members or by the game. For example, in the event of a visit from the health inspector, it is advisable to let him find everything clean, while a VIP is better off showing a well-decorated environment, if you want good publicity. Speaking of objectives, there are three types: those of the scenario, which determine the assignment of the stars (eg to increase the value of the hospital, cure a certain number of patients, research some therapies and so on); challenges themde of the staff, who, for example, can ask us to create a highly prestigious rest room; institutional objectives, such as the aforementioned visits by politicians and VIPs, but also the need to respond to some emergencies (treat a total number of patients with a specific disease due to the closure of another hospital). Unfortunately, there is no real sandbox mode, even if the last hospitals are so big that you can literally indulge yourself. Technique and problems Technically Two Point Hospital is a successful title, obviously in relation to the genre to which it belongs. Patients and staff are very varied and, when they crowd the hospital, they create a colorful mix, also enriched by the many animations they are equipped with (nice those of the various therapies). The general fluidity of the title proved to be excellent, even at maximum detail, but there were some small problems. For example, when the hospital is full of people, selecting one to follow them we experienced sharp drops in framerate. On the other hand, we encountered very few glitches and bugs: only on one occasion did a character get stuck and not respond to our commands. We fired him and hired a more willing colleague. The style of the menus and summary screens (the ones that allow you to keep track of the progress of the hospital and employees) is also sought after, all clearly legible, despite being full of useful information. Personnel management is less successful, which tends towards entropy, with doctors who start doing the work of other doctors or nurses who leave their jobs to do who knows what. In a small hospital it is not a big problem, given that reassigning all the numbers by hand is a fairly fast operation, but when you have many lots to manage, with dozens of doctors and nurses, doing everything by hand becomes impossible and you leave the 'anarchy is rampant (there are practically no economic repercussions anyway).", "date": "2018-08-30", "grade": "8.0"}
