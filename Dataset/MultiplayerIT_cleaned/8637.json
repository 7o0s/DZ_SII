The first episode of Final Freeway responded precisely to a need: frenetic and fast arcade racer, characterized by an excellent tilt control system, the game allowed all owners of iPhone, iPad and Android terminals to try their hand at an experience clearly inspired to that of the classic OutRun. On the occasion of the sequel, Final Freeway 2R, however, we wanted to do something more, in this case to add to the basic system, effective and well optimized even on older generation iOS devices, a series of contents capable of giving depth to the gameplay and make the racing dynamics more varied. Three characters with peculiar abilities in terms of impact resistance and road holding are therefore introduced: Jess, balanced; Rico, strong but tending to drift; Kate, petite but precise. Each of them allows us to tackle the race in a different way, a factor which, together with the selection of the level of difficulty (which affects the time available to us to reach each checkpoint), substantially increases the replayability of the title. And speaking of replayability, the typical crossroads of OutRun have also been added in Final Freeway 2R, which in this specific case will allow us to dart through fourteen suggestive scenarios and to witness, if we are good enough, three finals once crossed the last finish line. Curved brushstrokes The numerous innovations introduced by oyatsukai.com for this second episode of Final Freeway add body and contour to an experience that is already highly enjoyable, especially due to the excellent integrated tilt control system. From the options screen it is possible to modify the controls in many ways, but in reality the default configuration is immediately revealed to be extremely reactive and precise, with the inclination of the device that dictates the curves and even allows us to close overtaking inches from other cars. Remaining on the gameplay, in addition to the characters that can be selected at the start and at the crossroads, there are now also some ~duels~ that we will have to face by challenging the driver on duty, irrelevant from the point of view of merely overcoming the checkpoints (well, unless the opponent can't get you to hit a post) but with obvious consequences as regards the final score and the eight achievements linked to the Game Center. A lot of work has also been done in terms of graphics and sound: the first was entrusted to pixel artist Giuseppe Longo, who designed characters, faces and vehicles with a style that closely resembles the era of 16-bit systems; the second enjoys the musical accompaniment of three songs created by Simone Cicconi, able to add further involvement and charge to the action. The engine that moves everything can once again boast record-breaking performance, given the speed and fluidity with which it manages to scale the strictly two-dimensional objects in the background, guaranteeing a sensation of incredible speed.", "date": "2012-03-28", "grade": "8.0"}
