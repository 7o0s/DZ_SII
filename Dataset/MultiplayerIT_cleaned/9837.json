We are talking about 1337 Game Design and their Dark Nebula, a product whose gameplay is entirely based on the simple management of a metal sphere in an inertial context, in which it is the iPhone (or iPod), via the accelerometer integrated, to play the role of tilting plane. To play, therefore, all you need to do is hold your Apple device in your hand and tilt it in various directions so that the sphere moves accordingly, with the aim of completing the pre-established path in the shortest possible time, avoiding traps and chasms. The first episode of the series introduced these concepts and little else, in truth, placing itself as a valid but short-lived pastime. Well, with Dark Nebula - Episode Two things change substantially: the number of stages has risen to nineteen, with an increasing degree of difficulty, while the already brilliant technical sector has been enhanced (especially from the point of view of the variety of scenarios ) and numerous ideas have been added that greatly increase the depth of the experience. Roll or slide? First, a clarification: beyond what we saw in the first Dark Nebula, in this second episode the object we have the task of controlling, albeit indirectly, is not a sphere but a sort of ~disc~. which, however, slides on the surfaces in an extremely similar way to the rotational movement of a marble. A purely visual matter, however: the feeling is that of managing a steel ball, with all due respect to the ~plot~ (yes, there is also a plot: take a look at the valuable introductory CG sequence... ) and of the graphic sector, the latter further refined and now truly rich in style and elegance. The scenarios, protagonists of most of the modifications, always flow smoothly and without uncertainties, but above all they offer environments that are well differentiated by type and color, which break the monotony of the exclusively metallic backgrounds seen previously. In this second episode we move inside forests, ruined cities and even ~alternative~ dimensions in which all the elements take on an almost psychedelic connotation. But let's get back to the game. It was difficult to imagine the introduction of so many novelties in the gameplay, after all we are still talking about a sphere (disc?) that rotates on an inclined surface; yet the action is anything but repetitive, with the environment full of traps and snares that go well beyond the ~trampolines~ and abysses (both already seen), presenting, for example, switches of different colors that must be destroyed to continue along the path, or even enemies and end-of-level bosses! This time our disk can even fight, passing over sensors that cover it with an ~orbiting energy~ capable of destroying objects of the same color. It goes without saying that this element, together with the colors (green, red and blue), will characterize the bulk of the ~puzzles~ that we will find ourselves facing. The ultimate goal of the game remains to complete each stage in the shortest possible time, and in this regard there is no shortage of global and local leaderboards to compare one's performance with that of friends. Episode Two's control system boasts extraordinary precision, enhanced by the possibility of calibrating the accelerometer at any time to adapt to our position.
