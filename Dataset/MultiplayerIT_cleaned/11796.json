{"name": "Heroes of Mana - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/heroes-of-mana-recensione.html", "text": "Evidently, the hopes of the fans of the Seiken Densetsu series, to see a new chapter set according to the traditional canons of the Japanese RPG, are destined to remain frustrated, at least for the moment. Square Enix has in fact decided to take advantage of the brand to explore new videogame areas, while remaining anchored to the reference universe of the first trilogy (considering Final Fantasy Adventure as the first chapter of the series), churning out titles that have little to do with the structure typical of the JRPG, a setting that the more traditionalist enthusiasts would certainly prefer. Thus, after the particular Children of Mana, a reinterpretation of the series towards the increasingly widespread genre of the dungeon crawler with support for multiplayer, which has garnered conflicting opinions between the public and critics, here comes this Heroes of Mana, an even more marked deviation and far from the original concept. The idea is decidedly particular: to transform the game into a real-time strategy game, using the typical creatures of the Mana universe as combat units, as well as having a plot rightfully inserted in the Mana Tree saga. Attention, this is not a typical Japanese-style strategy game, strictly turn-based as tradition dictates, but a real RTS, directly mediated by the distant world of PCs: like Command and Conquer, just to give an idea of how much this product is far from the memory of the adventures lived with Seiken Densetsu, in the glorious era of 16 bit. Leaving aside comments guided by the nostalgic recollection of the good old days, it can be said that the idea is also valid, well structured but implemented, in various respects, without being able to make the most of its potential. A world in conflict When Square Enix presented its new program ~The Mana Project~ to the public, aimed at bringing back the Seiken Densetsu / Secret of Mana brand, few could have ever thought of a digression into the world of RTS. However, this is not a botched and inconsistent project, on the contrary: the setting and plot are well placed within the reference universe, and the events are narrated with the usual care to which the publisher has accustomed us. Likewise, the characters are rather characteristic and charming, trying in every way to find a compromise between the RPG roots of the game (with consequent emphasis on interpersonal relationships, feelings and political plots), and the classic impersonality all devoted to gameplay of real-time strategy games for PC. The result is an interesting hybrid, with a non-trivial story. The events see protagonists a handful of mercenaries originating from Pedda, a region of the world in which the story takes place. It all starts with a normal reconnaissance mission that our people have to carry out on the border with the kingdom of Ferolia, inhabited by the Beastmen, humanoid creatures but with animalistic characteristics, obviously considered inferior beings by normal humans (and here things look a bit like ' as seen in Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, among others). The patrol is aboard the Nightswan, an aircraft that will play a key role throughout the game. A hiccup forces the group to make an emergency landing right in the middle of foreign territory, where they will have to fight to try to get back. But things, as Square Enix always teaches us, are not so simple: their mission actually had as its secret purpose (of which the mercenaries themselves were unaware) the invasion of Ferolia by Pedda, who led by a unscrupulous general shows unheard-of ferocity towards his adversaries, demonstrating his will to put all the continents on fire until he conquers the world. From this moment on, the classic upheaval of the value system on which the protagonists relied takes place, with the need to fight against their own countrymen and ally themselves with those who seemed to be enemies, in truth much more courageous and correct than one could think. RTS or RPG? The game is clearly divided into levels, which unites it to both RTS and turn-based strategy in the style of Final Fantasy Tactics. These levels are represented by battles, which will take place within the various locations in which we will find ourselves acting during the course of the plot, always introduced by a phase of dialogue between the characters which constitutes the solid narrative fabric of the game. To tell the truth, the dialogues are even too present, given that in addition to introducing each battle with long sessions, they are often inserted even during the most active game phases, breaking the rhythm with long disquisitions that often fail tothrilling that much (even without considering the long and exhaustive tutorial that weaves all the first levels of the game). Having come to the point, beyond all the rhetorical trappings of a Japanese RPG, what we are faced with is a real RTS, which can be managed entirely through the touch screen. Heroes of Mana is, in fact, one of the first demonstrations that the real-time strategy genre, hitherto the prerogative of PCs, can be successfully transposed to the Nintendo DS, by virtue of the interface very similar to that via mouse. The battles take place within more or less vast game areas, made in 3D, structured as an invisible grid in which distances, heights and terrain bends can all be part of the battle strategy, within which the characters made in 2D. The movement system of the characters represents one of the major defects of Heroes of Mana: by selecting the arrival point with the stylus, the units will not follow the shortest path to reach it, but on the basis of incomprehensible algorithms they are forced to follow the most free (from both enemies and allies) to get there. This sometimes determines kilometric detours along absurd and often dangerous routes, with the constant concern that some units suddenly find themselves in the opponent's field, and the need to keep them all constantly under control. Similarly, in several cases the units get stuck, not being able to pass together from the same terrain square, blocking completely, or they are unable to frame the designated target because this has moved along trajectories that they are inexplicably unable to follow. With the stylus all possible orders are given, which in practice are reduced to three: movement, attack, collection of resources. The peculiarity of this strategy is that it is based on the collection of materials and on the ~evocation~ of units, while remaining tied to the classic structure of the Japanese turn-based strategy, with the protagonists present on the front line on the battlefield, leaders of the small army from build. Another connection with normal RPGs is the possibility of changing the equipment of the main characters, thus changing their main statistics, even if it is a decidedly marginal element, compared to what happens in more traditional role-playing games. Multiplayer Like any self-respecting real-time strategy game, Heroes of Mana allows you to play multiplayer against a friend/enemy. However, it is necessary to play in LAN and with two cartridges, as neither game-sharing nor online play via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection is allowed. In multiplayer you obviously gain in terms of involvement and challenge, as always happens, but the mode is marred by the impossibility of establishing handicaps and balances necessary for a balanced game. The possibility of using equipment and units derived directly from the single-player campaign therefore forces us to play with an opponent who is exactly at our level, in order not to incur excessive imbalances that heavily undermine a faction's chances of victory. Let's arm ourselves and go The game dynamics are therefore typical of RTS: discovery of the territory, collection of resources and construction of the army. A unique feature of Heroes of Mana is the fact that you don't have to build a base with all the related structures, since this role is performed entirely by the Nightswan, the team's transport aircraft. This can represent a useful simplification of the game structure, but conversely it entails a significant reduction in the possibility of organizing the base, and in the amount of infrastructure present: a simplification that fans of the genre will certainly find excessive. Inside the ship it is therefore possible to arrange the various ~factories~ capable of summoning the units, which are found here divided into some main types: collection creatures (~gatherers~), ground combat, air combat, long range or heavy attack, plus other special units with different functions. Through a relationship of forces in the ~rock-paper-scissors~ style, each unit has its own favorite ~prey~ and its own weak point which in turn makes it the elective victim of other types of creature, thus making the forces balanced in the field and forcing the player to vary the composition of his army, adding simple but effective strategic elements. At the beginning of each fight, the objectives are set (~eliminate all enemies~ or ~reach a certain point~, for example) and the conditions for defeat, after which we start with the usual dingame friend: discovery of the territory with reconnaissance units, in order to find the resources necessary for the formation of troops (mana and fruit trees, in this particular interpretation), army construction and battle against enemies. Each action is implemented simply with a touch of the stylus, which takes on different meanings depending on the context, and with the selection of the various options from the pop-up menus. Super deformed RTS The technical realization settles on the usual good standards that Square Enix has accustomed us to on Nintendo DS. While not representing the publisher's best product among the latest releases, the graphics of Heroes of Mana are more than satisfactory: complex 3D scenarios are displayed in isometric, with the ability to rotate the view in the four different angles, so you can have always in total control of the situation. The characters and units are instead made in 2D, with the typical ~deformed~ Japanese style. The contrast with the style of the scenario here is perhaps more marked than in other cases, and in general there seems to be a lack of that underlying coherence that amalgamated all the settings and characters of Final Fantasy Tactics Advance so well, to give an example close to the world of Nintendo laptops . The same design of enemies and units lacks a captivating characterization, but the choice is probably dictated by the need to resume models and creatures from the tradition of Seiken Densetsu (many of these are in fact the ~monsters~ encountered in the dungeons of the previous RPG). Accustomed to leading powerful troops towards the enemy, as happens in normal RTS, at first we are disconcerted in moving funny animals around the battlefield, but everything fits into the general atmosphere of the series, capable of bringing the ~cuteness~ of the Mana Project also within a real-time strategy game. The beautiful artwork used for the portraits of the characters and the menus, together with the full motion video animations in full anime style are part of that typical care for the presentation of the product that is easily found among Square Enix games. As for the audio, the music present is numerous and varied, although in general it does not differ much in quality, albeit with some particularly engaging epic peaks. Comment If the words ~of Mana~ in the title have led you to think of a big return of the old RPG by Koichi Ishii on Nintendo DS, the approach to this game will be a disappointment. Heroes of Mana, however, is an interesting experiment, unfortunately half-successful: the organization from RTS, although very simplified compared to other exponents of the genre, works quite well and the technical realization convinces, from an aesthetic point of view. However, the problems lie in the more practical aspects: the bland pace is weighed down by the excessive presence of dialogues (really too many for an RTS), the unit movement system is evidently badly constructed, needs to be redone and finally the plot fails to involve as much as that of other strategic (non-real-time) that this game would like to refer to. Finally, the multiplayer mode is undermined by the difficulty in creating balanced matches between players. Heroes of Mana represents a confirmation of the possibilities of RTS on Nintendo DS, but also the awareness of the brand's shift to a marginal series, used for videogame experiments that so far lack the brilliance necessary to make them absolute must-haves. Pros: Touch control comfortable and intuitive screen Good technical realization Very original, compared to the other chapters of the series Cons: A.I. and troop movement Too bland and uninvolving pace Multiplayer with big balancing problems", "date": "2007-11-26", "grade": null}
