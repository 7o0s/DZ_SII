[VIDEO=320.300.c.s]https://www.multiplayer.it/streaming/sims2stream.wmv[/VIDEO] THE VIDEO ARTICLES OF MULTIPLAYER.IT The video articles of Multiplayer.it are our way of inaugurating a new season of editorial production of Multiplayer.it, dedicated to Premium Gold subscribers (link), which will complement and enrich (not replace) the classic one, made up of text and images static. Now the family of video articles has achieved its recognized status and the new milestone is before your eyes: live video from the game and the editor's voice (and face) commenting on the moving images. From today on we will try to increasingly guarantee this new form of communication that we believe is more modern, suitable for the medium in which we move and now within everyone's reach thanks to the enormous diffusion that ADSL has had in the last twelve months. Here is the list of video articles published so far: Far Cry video review (free) Captain's video (Live from Los Angeles) #1 (free) Xbox, Allegro andante (Live from Los Angeles) #2 (free) It's time for the DS ( Live from Los Angeles) #3 (free) Me Gabe & Doug (Live from Los Angeles) #4 (free) Last Stop (Live from Los Angeles) #5 (free) Video preview of Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault (E3 2004 release ) (Premium Gold Exclusive) TopE3 2004: The Most Beautiful Girls of the Los Angeles Fair (Premium Gold Exclusive) Driv3r Video Review (Premium Gold Exclusive) Burnout 3 Video Preview (Free) Lord of the Rings: Battle for Middle Earth Video Preview ( Premium Gold exclusive) Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault Video Preview (EGN 2004 release) (Premium Gold exclusive) World of Warcraft Video Preview (Premium Gold exclusive)", "date": "2004-09-17", "grade": null}
