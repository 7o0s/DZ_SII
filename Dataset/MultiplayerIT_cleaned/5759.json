In a certain sense, it is a perfect metaphor for the trend that Tite Kubo's work has taken in recent years. While the animated series has been suspended indefinitely with the embarrassing Fullbringer saga, the manga continues with the very long final arc: a constant repetition of shnen clichs and stereotypes in which fighters with extraordinary powers unleash their secret techniques only to discover that the opponent has an unlikely trick up his sleeve to turn the tables. When all seems lost, however, a new power-up or a last-minute ally reverses the parties, so that the final boss's subordinates are cannon fodder to buy time and publish a few more volumes. Long gone are the days when Ichigo was trying to save Rukia before she was executed and we were playing Treasure's excellent fighting games for Nintendo DS: after the last cheap musou, Soul Resurreccin, we were afraid we wouldn't play anything else before the end of the manga. Here's why KLab Global's ~gacha~ really surprised us... Unbelievable, but true: Brave Souls is one of the best video game tie-ins inspired by Bleach We are the story Bleach: Brave Souls plays like a fairly traditional hack'n'slash. Once the very long download and installation process is over, we can face a bunch of training stages to learn the control system and the basics of the game: needless to say, we are guided by the very strict Rukia, and our default character will be always Ichigo Kurosaki. For the uninitiated, Bleach tells the story of a teenager able to see ghosts who, due to a series of unfortunate events, finds himself practicing the profession of shinigami: in practice, the fifteen-year-old Ichigo becomes a god of death Japanese, armed with his faithful zanpakuto sword. The story mode of Brave Souls retraces the most important moments of the saga, dividing it into dozens and dozens of more or less short stages that lend themselves to quick and occasional games. The dialogues between the characters - all in English - contextualize the events effectively, even if a little too summary, and the narration is accompanied by good quality illustrations and cutscenes. There is a small difference, however, compared to the original unfolding of the story: from the beginning we will be able to ~summon~ allies with which to form a team. The game gives us one at random practically immediately, after which we will get the others by completing the stages or by spending the Spirit Orbs that we have earned in the various game modes. This means that already in the first stages we could go hunting for Hollows together with Byakuya Kuchiki or Toshiro Hitsugaya even if, at the time, Ichigo didn't even know them. The screenplay obviously doesn't take these paradoxes into account and behaves as if those supporting actors weren't even there, but we can select them at any time by touching their portraits. Each character is characterized by a power level expressed in stars, from one to five: here the ~gacha~ nature of Brave Souls emerges, assisted by a decidedly rich cast of ~collectable~ characters. The player can try their luck one character at a time or buy packs that guarantee at least one high quality character, however it is not possible to ~evolve~ them but only level them up, enhance their stats through the Soul Tree and equip them. The collection of characters is not really an end in itself, since each of them has field or passive skills that allow you to build teams of three characters with a pinch of strategy, also because each fighter is associated with a natural element that could be more or less effective when facing certain enemies. In short, the variety is decidedly surprising both in terms of fighting styles - some characters are more effective from a distance, for example - and in terms of the devastating special attacks that trigger short animated skits. Towards the Soul Society and beyond Playing Bleach: Brave Souls is relatively simple. The interface employs the typical virtual 'joypad' setup, with attack icons tapping in the bottom right corner and the character automatically targeting the closest targets. Ideally, you should touch the screen with your left thumb to move the character, but the control system, however reactive, is initially quite uncomfortable, especially when you want to dodge: a rapido swipe ~teleports~ our character in the desired direction, but it is not exactly a practical maneuver even when the enemies flash red, signaling us the best time to dodge. Alternatively, you can select the automatic control system and let the game do everything by itself: it is undoubtedly convenient when you want to ~farm~ a little stage without committing yourself, but in reality the fluidity of the animations, the variety of attacks and the ringing of combos make the active gameplay decidedly satisfying. It is also thanks to the technical realization: if the soundtrack leaves something to be desired, repetitive as it is, from the point of view of the graphics we are certainly faced with a good product, which has also been optimized even for older devices. The developer KLab Global has employed a spot-on cel shading to create characters and settings in a colorful super deformed style which at first may be a bit disorienting, but which is all the more pleasant. Too bad only for the very long loading that precede each stage or menu, making the obligatory navigation of the various screens a bit frustrating. Bleach: Brave Souls, in fact, while not practically leveraging the inevitable microtransactions, overwhelms the player with currencies and prizes to be collected by accessing various windows. Between gold coins, Spirit Orbs, tickets and friend points, the first few minutes can be quite disorienting. Which, however, says a lot about the possibilities that the game offers in terms of content: beyond the story mode, in fact, you can try your hand at a series of special missions, perhaps by pursuing the daily and weekly secondary objectives, or they can tackle a handful of stages in asynchronous or real-time co-op alongside other players. Brave Souls also offers a PvP mode which, however, takes its time, given that it is totally automatic: the player simply composes a team and throws it against that of other players, hoping to defeat them.", "date": "2016-01-22", "grade": "7.8"}
