It's a lonely chase, reconfiguring public spaces in imaginative ways.~ Just like parkour, skating requires a mindset, patience and body awareness that not everyone has, but which appeals to everyone at the same time. To be able to communicate the excitement and fascination of what YouTube makes seem like only a masochistic activity practiced by crazy people, you have to be part of that underworld. Being a skater. And Roll7, the London-based development team that with the first OlliOlli has shown that a great skateboarding game can be made without resorting to the 3D structure of a Tony Hawk or the sandbox setting of a Skate is made up of skaters. Just over a year after the successful debut of the original on PlayStation Vita, the English group is back on Sony consoles with a sequel that is a gigantic more of the same, but which expands and improves the formula just like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 did with its predecessor. Manual control The novelty that first catches the eye undoubtedly concerns the aesthetic aspect of OlliOlli 2. In behind the scenes The Making of Olliwood, the art director Manuel Harari explains how the intention was to abandon pixel art but still keep an old-school feeling. For this we were inspired by old classics such as Another World and Prince of Persia, working heavily on the animations, backdrops and colors of all vector graphics. From the different levels of parallax to your avatar's shirt waving in the wind, the game is full of little touches of style. The end result makes the first OlliOlli feel like a crude prototype, and makes the experience not only more elegant, but also more appealing to a wider audience. For the occasion, Roll7 has also updated its iPod playlist, putting together a soundtrack composed of a large number of excellent pieces by independent artists such as Mike Slott and Ital Tek. However, if the graphic and sound update is the most evident, it is not necessarily the most important one, and from this point of view it is impossible not to draw a parallel with the first two Tony Hawk's. Just like in the Neversoft series, the addition of manuals enriches the experience exponentially, making the game incredibly faster, more dynamic and more fun. For those who are completely ignorant of skateboarding terms, manuals are nothing more than the equivalent of wheelies on bikes, for example putting weight on the tail to get the front wheels off the ground. Within the game this means being able to finally carry on the combos even between one grind and another. Where previously you were forced to land at certain points and interrupt the multiplier, now you can even finish the entire level, from start to finish, with one long combo. The addition of the manuals not only cancels the dead times, but also adds an interesting risk factor: continuing to use manuals and increasing the multiplier means being able to accumulate more points at the end of the combo, but obviously if the landing fails you are sent to the air all the work done up to that moment. OlliOlli 2 takes the successful formula of the original and expands it with a spectacular trick! Between maneuvers and new roads Basically, OlliOlli 2 proposes exactly that mix of Canabalt and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater that made Roll7's fortune last year. Once again it's a scrolling arcade, from left to right, where you can chain ever more complex and varied acrobatics. However, the manuals are not the only change in terms of gameplay compared to the first OlliOlli. The trick list has been enriched with some new maneuvers to memorize, it is possible to perform reverts (180 rotations) on landing, combine reverts and manuals or make changes on the grind to take the multiplier to the stars. Once again it is difficult to establish whether you play better on PlayStation Vita or on PlayStation 4: the larger and more stable stick of the DualShock 4 ensures greater grip and safety in performing the various tricks, but the smaller one of PlayStation Vita allows you to be faster , especially in the more complex inputs that require several rotations. Andreas Yiannikaris joining the development team as lead game designer has literally opened new paths in the game: some levels now have ramps that can be used to jump higher and access alternative paths, wherehidden little secrets or simply more railings and objects to grind on (ergo, more points). In one of the scenarios there are even parallel tracks with obstacles along the way, thus forcing you to switch from one to another by jumping with the right timing. Who played the first OlliOlli will find in this case the same and identical structure, with 50 normal levels and another 50 more difficult; each of these has small objectives to complete, and only once all the missions in both modes are completed, the good old RAD option is unlocked, in which only perfect grinds and landings are allowed. Just like the first chapter, OlliOlli 2 is anything but a simple game for beginners. In the first few minutes you lose all the time, you always fall and almost wear out the automatic restart button. Then, suddenly, a switch clicks in the player's head and finally the fingers move with the right timing, transforming an almost frustrating experience into an increasingly fun challenge.", "date": "2015-03-09", "grade": "8.5"}
