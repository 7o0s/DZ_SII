They are those games which, from Dear Esther onwards, exploiting the graphic and immersive potential of the engines created (not always but often) for the most spectacular shooters on the square, however, offer an experience far removed from the frenzy of an action. Without real gameplay elements, intimist, with an atmosphere of their own, these products are often the medium used by small teams without much financial capacity, but who have a story to tell and want those who use them to immerse themselves completely . Released six months ago for PC and now reproposed on consoles, The Park is not exactly the son of a minor team: the Norwegians Funcom have earned their place in the sun over the years with products such as The Longest Journey or the interesting The Secret World , MMORPG of which the title in question is a direct child, but it is no coincidence that they have decided to turn to this particular genre, not expensive in monetary terms, to offer us this disturbing and intense journey. The sui generis, immersive and disturbing experience of The Park arrives on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One! Everyone happens to lose something Anyone who has played The Secret World will surely know Atlantic Island Park, the amusement park built by industrialist Nathaniel Winter on Solomon Island, which of course is located in Maine, home to all the horror stories of this world since he gave the birthplace of Stephen King. And those who know Atlantic Island Park also know that the idea of going around it alone isn't exactly the best one that can come to mind, although the game opens on a certainly melancholic note and atmosphere, but which does not bode well extraordinary: we are at sunset, the Park has just closed and Lorraine, a young woman who spent the day there with her son Callum (the Park is the child's favorite place), would like to leave to go home, but she can't, because Callum can't finds her teddy bear anymore. While he goes to ask the caretaker if by chance he is among the lost objects, Callum however escapes from the car and quickly enters the fenced area. ~Don't worry, everyone loses something~: the kind caretaker opens the gates of the Park so that Lorraine can recover her urchin, and it doesn't seem like a difficult undertaking. But going up the escalators the atmosphere changes: darkness falls too suddenly, suddenly what was a simple melancholy atmosphere turns into something much more sinister. There is no time to get lost in reflections, however: Callum is running towards one of the attractions, a journey on swan-shaped boats where the story of Hansel and Gretel is told... Thus begins the exploration, what a true exploration not is: in Lorraine's ~arsenal~ there is only the possibility of walking, running and calling her child, an action which, in the vicinity of an object with which one can interact, highlights it thus allowing us to know exactly where to go. Not that you can get lost in the Park: the path is totally guided, there are only a couple of crossroads which, however, do not change the order of things, and the same objects to interact with certainly do not prefigure the foundations of an adventure, in how much only one (but it is really impossible to miss it) is necessary at a certain point to move forward, the others are all pieces of torn letters, newspaper articles and brochures thanks to which we will reconstruct the history of the Park, of Solomon Island and of the protagonist, a bit of an effort since the font sizes used are strangely small. The only diversions to the guided structure are the attractions, because at least initially it is not necessary to take a tour, and in any case, even here the interaction is reduced to looking around. However, you will have understood that everything in The Park is aimed at immersion, at the discovery of secrets and hidden ~things~, so why deprive yourself of emotion? Playstation 4 trophies Given the short duration of the experience, it is not surprising that The Park offers only 14 Trophies, just as it is not surprising that there is not even a Platinum to accompany the 11 Bronzes, 2 Silvers and only Gold present. After all, it is really difficult not to get them all simply by playing to the end, except perhaps one of the two Silvers which requires a minimum of inventiveness. Mind monsters Abandoned the idea of traditional interactivity (Lorraine can't even fight with whoever comes in front of her at a certain point, her life is never endangered and this tends to reduce intensity for those who don't get in tune with the offered experience), you can face the journey that The Park offers with the right mentality: a sort of film seen from the eyes of the protagonist, a horror in the middleIt is between the supernatural and the psychological that grants very little to the canonical jumps on the chair, and rather focuses on creating a constant atmosphere of unease, especially when we discover that perhaps the evil entities that populate the Park are not Lorraine's only enemies. .. The very reduced gameplay elements are for this: reading the letters scattered here and there, one gradually gets a clearer idea of the history of that place; constantly looking around while walking or on an attraction, you can see elements that certainly don't give life to a new game dynamic, but deeply mark the experience. Every now and then a scripted monologue from Lorraine gives us a new hint about her personality and her story, but above all what should be a gameplay mechanic, the possibility of calling Callum, soon becomes a way to establish a connection with the protagonist. Accomplices a high-level writing and a dubbing (only in English, as well as subtitles and texts remained in English) that we do not hesitate to define phenomenal, thanks precisely to those which, if evaluated from a traditional game point of view, would be defects , the short - a couple of hours at most - experience offered by The Park becomes very intense, engaging, alienating, up to the culmination of a truly masterful last part, in which we discover the very heavy underlying theme and all the horror at the end some accounts already seen enough reveals its role only as a support to much more real issues that we don't want to anticipate, but which leave us seriously banned, in a good way. In all of this, an almost entirely impeccable sound component stands out: devoid of a real soundtrack, The Park makes distorted sounds, soft voices and disturbing effects one of the main channels of communication with the player, in addition to the beautiful dubbing we have already mentioned and which leads us to discover all the facets of Lorraine's personality. Even graphically we are on good levels, although technical defects should be mentioned such as textures that are not always impeccable, some areas with very bare details, characters that seem vaguely fake and above all an irritating pop-up phenomenon, omnipresent in the many open areas and which tends to give annoyance at the fundamental suspension of disbelief. But, as with everything else, the graphics are also functional to the atmosphere, and in this sense the art design fully hits the target. The basic material certainly helps: clowns, mascots and amusement parks have entered the imagination of a certain type of horror for years now, but the Funcom designers deserve credit for having used them in an excellent way, without indulging in violence and gore, remaining surprisingly subtle at times but only to upset the player/viewer/protagonist in the most subtle way possible.", "date": "2016-05-04", "grade": "7.5"}
