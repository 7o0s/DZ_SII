Yet, the way in which the war is told could change, and it is no coincidence that crude and macabre representations of war conflicts are sometimes accompanied by lighter, satirical, tacky or even comical ones. What films like Starship Troopers and Tropic Thunder have done in cinemas, Tiny Troopers tries to replicate it on the App Store through an experience between action and strategy designed specifically for tactile devices. The new mobile game by the Finnish group Kukouri Entertainment is clearly inspired by the historic Cannon Fodder for the Amiga, but tries to paint an even more caricatured, parodic and cartoonish war scenario, in order to give the user the impression of having fun with small toy soldiers on a mock battlefield. A tragicomic war As already mentioned, Tiny Troopers looks extremely familiar to anyone who has played a chapter of Cannon Fodder. Through a bird's eye view, the player finds himself in command of a team of small soldiers with funny faces and ridiculous voices: there is no way to manage them individually, and simple taps on the screen move them all in one certain location. Similarly, tapping on opposing soldiers, bunkers or enemy tanks you can open fire for a few seconds, deciding whether to move sideways to avoid being hit or to stay still to fire more precise shots. The developers must recognize the attempt to add as much meat to the fire: each level is quite varied and ranges from rescuing hostages to escorting a group of journalists, passing through assault missions towards structures or vehicles. Whether it's defusing bombs, eliminating enemies or collecting dog tags, the player always earns a handful of Command Points, the currency used to buy upgrades and reinforcements both before and during each level. Here too there is a fair amount of items and power-ups, some of which can be unlocked as you progress through the main campaign: from medkits to grenades, from air support to details on the map, while a list of specialists allows you to support to your medics, sappers or sniper team. However, the fact that each of these has a fairly high cost and a limited duration pushes the player to use them only in the levels where greater firepower is really needed. In a very similar way to Cannon Fodder, each character of the team has a unique name and can rise in rank as he faces the various missions, but once killed he can no longer be used and is replaced by a new soldier. Let me be clear, Kukouri fails, if he ever really tried, to create a minimum bond between the player and his troops, and in a short time the displeasure of having to start over from lower-ranking soldiers also vanishes. Not offering much tactical freedom, Tiny Troopers is clearly designed for a casual audience looking for a light and fun experience, but the simple control system ends up making everything really superficial: in fact, in the game there is no space for cover or stealth actions and, since it even lacks an automatic fire system, the only useful approach to the player is simply moving left and right, avoiding bullets and continuing to repeatedly tap opponents. As if that weren't enough, the bad pathfinding of the characters also leads to some unintentional errors, such as killing a civilian in the vicinity or stepping on a bomb in a minefield, while occasionally it happens that one's soldiers stop in the middle to the battlefield for no apparent reason. All defects that, at least in part, can be corrected with future updates, also because where the game gives its best is in the ability to mix a funny and clearly cartoon style with some crude touches typical of war: the cries of the little soldiers , the pools of blood scattered across the battlefield or even the agonizing cry for help from dying enemies. The result is as funny as it is macabre, and in our opinion the Finnish developer could have marked his hand even more on the black humor that characterizes the game.", "date": "2012-07-06", "grade": "7.5"}
