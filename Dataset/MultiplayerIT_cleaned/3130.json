For those in the orbit of the ~antas~, the historic company with headquarters in Wakefield will probably be remembered for masterpieces of a now remote past such as Alien Breed and Project-X, which have been joined over the years by the incredible Worms. A franchise that has become a bit the emblem of the entire Team17 production, in which entertainment has always been one of the aspects held in greatest consideration. Not only for games developed directly within the company, but also for those made by others and published by Team17. The list of games that came on the market under this brand has become particularly rich in recent years, finding fertile ground with titles such as The Escapists, Yooka-Laylee and Overcooked. Precisely the latter seems to have been the source of inspiration for Moving Out, a game developed by SMG Studio and Devm Games: from the crazy stoves of Ghost Town Games we pass in this case to the life of a moving company, maintaining the collaborative dynamics and cartoonish style. After emptying offices, haunted houses and carrying washing machines on your back fording a river, here's our verdict on Moving Out! Mode: the party game we needed? In times of forced home confinement like the ones we are experiencing, the arrival of a new party game can be seen as a lifeline to spend some time playing in company. From this point of view, Moving Out looks particularly good, allowing a maximum number of four players to participate, choosing their avatar from a series of initial characters to which are added those unlocked by progressing with the levels. The short introductory video that explains how to become a Furniture Arrangement & Relocation Technician (abbreviated F.A.R.T., i.e. fart) immediately sets the tone of Moving Out clear, which presents itself as a moving simulator intending to take itself as little as possible seriously. Picking up clients around the town of Packmore, our goal is to complete the load of our moving van, earning a bronze, silver, or gold rating based on the time taken. Particularly welcome is the introduction of secondary objectives, which adds a pinch of replayability to each level going beyond the simple improvement of the score obtained. With an eye towards the youngest, or in any case towards the less accustomed to having a controller in hand , Moving Out also offers a simplified mode, thanks to which, for example, it is possible to extend the evaluation times to ensure that the experience can be enjoyed with an extra pinch of relaxation. Especially for those who intend to play in the company of children, this is a not insignificant possibility. If you wish, you can of course also enjoy the product alone, bearing in mind however that like all titles of its genre, Moving Out gives its best when there are at least two people in front of the screen. Gameplay: Dedicated to family play As mentioned, the game experience of Moving Out gives the impression of having been designed by the developers with the youngest players in mind from the outset. The dynamics are in fact far from the peaks of complexity reached in some cases by Overcooked, thus allowing for softer and more relaxed game sessions to be created, for the benefit of games played in the family. As we said, the objective of each level is to take away the highlighted furniture, loading it into the available space inside the van of the Smooth Moves company. In the case of canned goods and other light material, the movement can be performed by a single player, while when it comes to moving sofas, refrigerators or other particularly heavy elements, it is necessary to resort to the help of another person. This is in fact the only truly collaborative aspect of Moving Out, for which no major coordination efforts are therefore required in the team that takes part in the move. Continuing in the comparison with Overcooked, compared to the latter the division of tasks is practically nil and we find ourselves speaking much more rarely with the other players, interacting with them only in moments when you need help to pass through a door with an L-shaped sofa. Physics inevitably has its influence on the dynamics of Moving Out, especially when it comes to carrying around bulky objects or having to arrange everything in the small space of the van. Passed the first stages of apprenticeshipforget the game adds a few more elements, for example putting us to work in haunted places or to deal with other environmental disturbances, with the aim of slightly varying what would otherwise be a moving activity back and forth rather monotonous. By switching between the various levels it is also possible to unlock some of the more arcade-like ones, thus adding a bit of diversion. Graphics and sound: jokes at full force Far from wanting to take itself seriously, Moving Out presents itself to the eyes with a cartoony style, accompanied by dialogues between the protagonists who go on to the sound of various puns. The same characters are all worth seeing: those with more normal features are joined by others of various types, among which we find, for example, one that has a toaster-shaped head that shoots toasted slices around, a unicorn that leaves a rainbow trail, and so on. The incentive to unlock and try out all the characters is undoubtedly felt, also thanks to the attention to detail that the developers have placed in their creation. As for the levels, we also appreciated in this case the presence of numerous elements inside and outside the houses that we find ourselves emptying. However, it must be said that despite the efforts to diversify the settings in the long run the impression of having to do with things already seen remains latent. Without infamy and without praise the sound, accompanied by the inevitable series of musical tunes which however do not they will get into your head like those of Overcooked knew how to do.", "date": "2020-04-23", "grade": "6.8"}
