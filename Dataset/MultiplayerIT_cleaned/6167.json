After a couple of months we are ready to tell you what we think, always maintaining the will to wipe out humanity and all its resources. Where? In the review of Destroy All Humans! 2 Reprobed, of course! The Cosmic Cold War Destroy All Humans! 2 Reprobed: a Disco Volante is forever Destroy All Humans! 2 Reprobed is set ten years after the events of the first chapter. Crypto-137, the Furon who conquered the Earth amidst a thousand follies and vicissitudes is now dead. In its place we find the next clone who, enjoying the conquests of his ~older brother~, was even able to take office in the White House and become President of the United States by taking the form of us humans. Bad luck has it that the Russian Motherland has discovered the deception and has launched the offensive against the aliens by destroying the orbiting mothership. Our mentor, unable to save himself in the attack, poured his consciousness into digital form, thus warning us of Russia's imminent destruction. Over the course of thirty missions and five different macro zones to explore, Destroy All Humans! 2 Reprobed implements the usual follies born from the minds of the Pandemic kids more than fifteen years ago. A moment in the history of the medium in which it was simple and profitable to experiment, to launch sequels after a year and less expensive to collide with the cornerstones of today's multimillion-dollar productions. Obviously forget the possibility of being faced with a new, revolutionary or even revolutionized game on the basis of the original. There is no shortage of optimizations already experienced a couple of years ago, but the experience remains just as crazy and with a narrative arc that was already more cohesive and interesting at the time, capable as it is of mixing madness and historical reinterpretation with a very strong hint of Hollywood B-Movie. Lucky formula Destroy All Humans! 2 Reprobed: the Jetpack won't let you fly for hours, but it's useful for taking advantage of the verticality of some maps Between San Francisco, England, the Motherland and even a lunar station, Destroy All Humans! 2 Reprobed does not spare itself in variety, while always remaining anchored to its action shooter structure with open maps, albeit quite contained. The control system, the management of the nine weapons present and the exploration have remained the same as two years ago, with the difference that this second chapter tends to insert more secondary tasks into the equation. Precisely for this reason, combined with the question of the challenges to be completed from mission to mission, the game could keep you glued for a handful of hours more than the original, while still maintaining longevity around fifteen / twenty hours if you want to complete more or less everything what the game allows.Obviously there is the possibility of facing the adventure in coop, even split screen, so as to be able to double the laughter and the funny situations that arise. Everything always with a view to turning anything or creature upside down in front of us. Destroy All Humans! 2 Reprobed: the conquest of planet Earth, again Wandering around the maps it will, as always, be possible to interact with the unfortunate human beings by brutally killing them with their own guns - some borrowed from the first chapter, while others totally the preserve of this sequel - as well as taking their appearance, reading their thoughts and thus ending even to blow his head off by harvesting cerebral cortex. Crypto-138 will then be able to spend the experience acquired to upgrade his weapons and powers without necessarily having to return to his Disco Volante this time. surreal button mashing where instead of fists it will be possible to blow up every single destructible element, so as to increase the level of alert and make the human assault forces more and more aggressive. Although these are sections of the game that totally exclude the gray matter from the game equation, it cannot be denied that everything works today as it did fifteen years ago, offering moments of hilarity that few other series have been able to generate over the years. Successful remake? Destroy All Humans! 2 Reprobed: Blowing brains is always fun We also come to the technical part, certainly important for a remake. Destroy All Humans! 2 hardly detaches itself from the remake of the first chapter of a couple of ayears ago. On the contrary, it confirms the goodness of the work done on the game, aware of its far from stellar budget and capable of optimizing the best with a simple but successful art design. The passage between the 60s and 70s modifies the chromatic palette and general aesthetics of the reproduction of our world, placing us within Cold War sensations which, all in all, are also very successful and consistent with the playful nature and above the lines of the saga itself. We would have liked a little more care in the menu and navigation of the same, as well as a refinement and more variations of the human models around, but it is also true that it is pure cannon fodder, therefore it would be a tinsel that is anything but fundamental. The discourse on artificial intelligence is different. Unfortunately, nothing has been improved on this aspect, even going so far as to amplify the feeling of being faced with an artificial difficulty in some moments, which makes the final stages of the adventure much more difficult just for the sake of it. In this, the boss fights are emblematic, which sometimes become frustrating due to the duration and repetitiveness of some mechanics, but nothing that then manages to ruin the total experience given by the rest of the adventure.", "date": "2022-09-05", "grade": "7.5"}
