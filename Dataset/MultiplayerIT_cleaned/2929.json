The orphans of the old FIFA Street have thus found themselves again with the possibility of trying their hand at spectacular tricks on the pitches of suburbs, which we were also able to do while preparing for the Street Power Football review. Developed by Gamajun Games under the supervision of SFL Interactive and published by Maximum Games, the title we are dealing with in this article is in fact dedicated to street football, imagined by the Brno-based team through different modalities, with the presence of some known from the real street football environment to embellish them. Can all this be enough to make Street Power Football a true spiritual sequel to FIFA Street? Let's go find out. The offline and online modes Street Power Football presents a good choice in terms of modes, at least from a numerical point of view. It obviously starts from the Street Power Match, a classic street football match that can be played from a minimum of one against one to a maximum of three against three. The goal is to score more goals than the opposing team, also relying on the use of consumables and superpowers introduced by the developers to add some spice to the game. For example, it is possible to increase the running speed of the controlled player, to cause opponents to be electrified upon contact with the ball, and so on. Then we find the Freestyle mode, which makes Street Power Football a bit similar to music games: by choosing from a list of tricks available to our character, the goal is to complete all the steps in time with the pressure of the keys on the controllers. In the case of the Trickshot mode we must instead draw the trajectory of a set piece to hit the targets shown within the level we are facing, obviously going to increase with the difficulty as we advance. In both cases regarding the modalities listed above, the main problem concerns a certain monotony in the dynamics of the game, which inevitably leads the player to prefer the others present in Street Power Football. The preparation of shots in Trickshot mode also sometimes suffers from some problems in the proposed framing, even if it is possible to move the angle to the right and left to try to extricate the view from the obstacles present in the level. Continuing with the list of methods we find the so-called Panna. It's a fun match played one-on-one inside a small cage, where the first player to reach five points wins. The latter can be scored by scoring into the opponent's goal or by tunneling into the other person. To do this you need to have the right amount of energy to activate a special mode, in which a challenge to a series of quick time events decides the winner. The peculiarity of the Panna mode consists in the fact that a tunnel scored allows you to get two points, while scoring a goal is worth only one. Together with Street Power Match, Panna is undoubtedly the funniest mode among those proposed by Street Power Football. There is also a career mode called Become the King, in which the real-life athlete Sean Garnier guides us through a mix of the modes listed so far to become the best in the street football scene.Finally, by playing online there is also the Elimination mode , turn in one-on-one mode in a unique door. Each team is made up of three people, two of whom are on the bench, with the possibility of eliminating the opponent on the pitch by scoring a goal in the only goal present. The gameplay Going into the gameplay of Street Power Football in a little more detail, as regards the Freestyle and Trickshot modes, there is nothing more to add than what was said in the previous paragraph. It is obviously worth dwelling on the gaming experience offered by Street Power Match, within which the control system undoubtedly faces a more demanding test than Panna and Elimination. The list of commands includes the possibility of shooting, also giving a possible spin to the ball (with quite inaccurate results), or making high or low passes to which to connect phases of ball possession, in which to look for the spin shot against the opponents . When, on the other hand, we find ourselves defending, we can put ourselves in a covering position or look for direct contrast with the ball carrier in order to take the ball away from him. In both cases we have to say that the gaming experience turned out to be more woody than qmuch we hoped. Too much, for a game like Street Power Football which by its nature should instead give a sense of fluidity and immediacy once you take the field. There's obviously a lot of satisfaction when you pull off a series of moves, although we have to say that CPU-controlled teams don't seem to be able to give you any particular headaches once you get the hang of their way of ~thinking.~ ~. Graphics and sound In stylistic terms Street Power Football is presented in a rather pleasant way, offering cel shading graphics with a character design tending to deformed that manages to fully convey the freshness that is missing in the gameplay. Part of the problems of the latter are dictated by the presence of not very fluid animations, which inevitably end up preventing the game from being able to scroll in the best way. In addition to the presence of some well-known faces from the street football scene, Street Power Football also allows us to customize the players by accessing the appropriate shop where you can buy various types of cosmetics with the game's internal currency. Speaking of aesthetics, in our opinion the fields present in Street Power Football are appreciable: the game takes us around the whole world, from a setting in Rome that closely resembles the Colosseum up to the favelas of Rio , passing through London, Tokyo and other places quite cared for in their particularities. The soundtrack is good and perfectly integrated, also composed of some fairly well-known commercial songs. As for the Italian translation, while appreciating its presence, we cannot help but notice some inaccuracies which in the worst cases leave the player a little confused for a few moments.", "date": "2020-08-31", "grade": "5.0"}
