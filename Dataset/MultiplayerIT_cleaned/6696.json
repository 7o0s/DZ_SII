Wars and Battles is, hold on tight, a war strategy focused on historical battles of the past, a genre that in the last couple of years has seen some interesting exponents appear on the App Store, such as Battle Academy 2 or the games by Shenandoah Studio (Battle of Bulge and Drive on Moscow above all). Turning a blind eye to the questionable name, Wars and Battles nonetheless proved to be an interesting alternative for wargame enthusiasts to hexagonal maps, with an enormous attention to detail partly marred by some contradictions in the game system. Wars and Battles is a turn-based strategy with an anonymous title but with interesting ideas From Napoleon to D-Day While the current campaign is entirely focused on the 1944 Normandy landings, starting on D-Day and ending with Operation Tractable at the Battle of Falaise, Wars and Battles is much more than your usual WWII strategy game. The ambitious goal of the authors is in fact to develop over time a platform which, through missions based on the same game engine, recreate some battles and war campaigns salient through different places and different historical periods. Once the application has started, it is already possible to see what the next steps planned by the developers will be for the coming months: they range from the Market Garden operation to the Korean war of 1950, from the Kippur war of October 1973 to the battle of the three emperors of the early 1800s, up to the battle of Gettysbrug in the American Civil War. From this point of view, the French developer's project promises to be among the most interesting in the eyes of a history buff with a passion for strategy. The currently available campaign provides an enormous amount of information and background on the events and protagonists of 1944, with detailed historical and technical descriptions of each unit and battle. Kermorio's attention to detail is then evident when you start the first game, between an interface that is both rich and functional, and the ability to switch from a 3D setting at any time, with small animated three-dimensional models satisfactorily, to a 2D view, where the same attention has been paid to the icons that distinguish the various types of units. The strategic map itself is actually represented on a table full of military instruments, a pleasant but absolutely useless detail unlike the possibility of being able to freely rotate and zoom in on the battlefield with your fingers. With a dozen playable scenarios on both the Axis and Allied sides, an enemy artificial intelligence up to par and support for asynchronous multiplayer between two players, Wars and Battles is certainly one of the richest and most successful wargames of this year. The game mechanics do little to depart from the tradition of the genre: with a limited number of action points available, the user must move his units in the hex grid, flank the enemy forces and pay attention to variables such as the type of terrain , the weather conditions, the weaknesses of your units and the reinforcements arriving. Overall we are faced with a fun strategy game and, especially after the first introductory levels, deep enough to offer an interesting level of challenge. If anything, the problem is understanding where the game is placed in the market and what kind of audience it is aimed at: the war system of Wars and Battles is in fact sufficiently complex to require reading a relatively short manual, but not deep and articulated enough to interest the discerning fans of the genre. In fact, the resolution of battles is based almost entirely on the concentration of units and on the ability to find the right strategy to outnumber the enemies. It is undoubtedly a simplistic solution that greatly reduces the impact that the other variables can have on the outcome of each clash, but at the same time it seems to depend on the ~encyclopedic~ nature of Wars and Battles itself. Having simplified the game mechanics will allow developers to reuse the same battle system with the other historical campaigns that will arrive with the next updates, without confusing users with completely different balances and rules.", "date": "2014-12-08", "grade": "7.8"}
