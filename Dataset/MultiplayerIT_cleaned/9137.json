{"name": "All in?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/91637-runespell-overture-all-in.html", "text": "The game is available for download via Steam We are in the midst of an alternate Middle Ages where battles are not fought in the name of religion but in an attempt to keep strange demonic creatures and the growing spread of uncontrollable magic at bay. The player plays the role of a Changeling, a faceless supernatural being, afflicted by a strange amnesia and arrived on Earth for reasons unknown and not easily investigated. The story told in Runespell: Overture is grafted onto this slender narrative canvas, a rosewater role-playing game grafted onto a card game structure double-bounded to the rules of poker. But let's try to explain in detail what we can expect from this title available exclusively on PC, through the Steam platform at a price of 8.99. Card game? Leaving the brief atmospheric introduction behind, the game shows up immediately showing on the screen the map of the area that can be visited divided into various boxes. Our alter ego can move on it in total freedom with the only two exceptions represented by any camps and obviously by enemies. Let's start from the latter and from the fights that then represent the fulcrum of the entire gaming experience of Runespell: Overture. Once the battle has started, the navigation screen will give way to a sort of game table complete with cards arranged like a solitaire. In each turn, the two challengers will have three actions available: from moving cards, to attacking, to using special abilities. The ultimate goal is to ~assemble~ five cards, essential to carry out the attack and ~shoot~ them at the opponent. The amount of damage that will be done will depend on the cards stacked according to the rules of poker with some very small exceptions taken from Yahtzee, a game of dice. The mechanism is therefore extremely intuitive but at the same time it brings great tactical depth as a dowry since it will be necessary to manage not only one's own cards but also those of the opponent in some way as it is possible to steal his to link them to one's own with a single limit: it will be It is possible to interact only with those single face-ups, not with those face down or already mounted on other cards. Managing your three action points trying to get the best score, but at the same time being careful not to let your opponent do it by stealing his best cards requires great attention and tactical acumen. As if that weren't enough, there are also special cards. In addition to the life points, in fact, the two challengers gain anger as a result of the attacks made and those suffered and this can be spent within one's turn to activate some skills equipped before the clash. These are special attacks capable of causing even quite substantial damage based on various schools of magic, shields of various types to defend oneself or reduce the damage caused by enemy assaults and again, spells of healing, buffs or debuffs up to cards that increase the number of action points of the current round. All these variables add up to the strategic depth of the fighting and the result is quite satisfactory, especially in the short and medium term. However, when the campaign begins to approach the end (depending on your skill with the cards it will take you between 7 and 10 hours of play) the underlying repetitiveness of the gameplay becomes increasingly evident, which practically always offers the same challenge rate. In fact, we do not notice great evolutions in the tactics adopted by the opponents whether it is the wolf encountered on the street or the ultra-armored giant knight and the difficulty tends to pour entirely into the strength of the special cards used by the challenger and above all in his life points. Frustration is consequently always around the corner because very often you can't make enough full houses and four-of-a-kind to counter an opponent who has 60-70 life points more than your avatar. However, it must be recognized that there is practically no penalty for a lost fight: it will immediately be possible to repeat it or escape from it without any consequences. At the same time it would certainly have benefited from the variety of the proposed gameplay to implement more particular special abilities capable, for example, of modifying the cards on the table or blocking certain scores or offering clashes based on rules other than simply reducing the opponent's life points to zero. Role playing game? Outside of the combat phase, what distinguishes the gameplay of Runespell: Overture, as already mentioned, is a slight RPG flavoror. Inside the small villages that delimit the most important areas of the game map we will in fact be able to dialogue with a handful of non-player characters to discover something more about our past and the threat that haunts us and obviously accept some rather simplistic quests. In fact, it is always and only a question of facing certain enemies and at most looting some objects. Within these safe zones it is also possible to trade special cards. In fact, the latter, in addition to belonging to different categories, must be recharged by spending the silver that is earned from the clashes since their use in battle consumes the available activations. The only exception is represented by the allies that are earned in pivotal moments of the plot: they are in all respects special cards but their use is unlimited. Before moving quickly to the technical aspect, it is necessary to highlight a further defect of the game, undoubtedly the biggest one: the total absence of any multiplayer mode. Although Runespell: Overture is ultimately a complex and in-depth card game, there is no possibility to challenge a human opponent, neither on your computer, much less online. It even lacks the skirmish option or some form of quick battle with the artificial intelligence. The online component resolves itself into a couple of really basic rankings. Graphically, the game is of excellent workmanship even if of course this aspect is limited to numerous static screens or almost all, however, all drawn with a pleasant stretch and the short interlude sequences of the story. The only 3D animations concern the characters who collide during the battle who, at the moment of the attack, move to the top of the screen to give each other a thrashing. In this case some graphic effects also come into play, especially relating to magic, basic but never subdued. The design of the interfaces is also minimal but functional, even if we feel we criticize the choice not to insert any undo or cancel key to repeat the last action performed. In fact, more than a few times it has happened to us too quickly to place the card on the wrong column, invalidating scores under construction. On the other hand, the accompanying symphonic music is excellent, which does not shine in quantity but offers catchy and pleasant themes. In terms of localization, it is essential to point out that the game is entirely in English, including written texts.", "date": "2011-08-05", "grade": "6.8"}
