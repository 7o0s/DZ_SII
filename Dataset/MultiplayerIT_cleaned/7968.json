A project by the English team that is quite peculiar to say the least, which more than anything else assumes the connotations of a real challenge: how to adapt such a rich and complex interface to a system of touch control? And, above all, for what type of user? Questions we will try to answer in the Total War: Medieval 2 review. The game Total War: Medieval 2 shows all its age starting from the cutscenes In the review of Medieval II: Total War, sixteen years ago, our Simone Tagliaferri defined the experience developed by Creative Assembly ~a real drug~, the best episode of Total War up to that moment and, in general , an extraordinary product. A lot of time has passed and the SEGA series has clearly evolved, but the value of that production is still felt today. From the start screen, you can choose to try your hand at the Grand Campaign, which forms the core of the experience, or opt for the tutorial, the custom battle, the quick battle or the historic battle, the latter a scenario mode that brings certain situations to the screen, setting objectives to achieve in order to achieve victory. These are the same options as in the original version, and as in the original version we will be able to choose between five initial factions (Spanish, French, Moors, Holy Roman Empire and Venetians) and then unlock several others upon completion of the campaign, therefore after having conquered a variable number of territories depending on the difficulty that we are going to set. During the turn we will be able to manage the cities in our possession in various ways or to automate their economy, using special units such as merchants, diplomats and spies in order to extend our influence, sign agreements and alliances, as well as discover the real military strength available to the neighboring kingdoms that we eventually wish to conquer. Total War: Medieval 2, the diplomatic interactions screen Once we have produced enough troops, we will be able to move them by land or sea around the map, which includes medieval Europe in its entirety as well as a small portion of Africa and Asia, and come into conflict with wandering armies or settlements, in this last case giving rise to sieges lasting more or less long depending on the opponent's defensive capabilities. Real-time battles can be automated, but it would be a shame: it is one of the most interesting aspects of the experience, in which move portions of the army within the scenario and indicate specific targets to attack, with the possibility of carrying out highly effective special manoeuvres, capable of overturning the tide of a battle that perhaps on paper saw us heavily disadvantaged. The mobile version Total War: Medieval 2, a real-time battle We tested Total War: Medieval 2 on the iPhone 12 Pro and on the second generation iPad Pro, using the touch commands or the mouse and keyboard combo, supported by the game in order to offer an experience as similar as possible to the original PC one . There are no graphic adjustments: the system selects the qualitative presets according to the power of the device we are using. Well, the response is quite clear: on smartphones it is really difficult to navigate the interface, despite some simplifications introduced by Feral Interactive , and the combat phases turn out to be absolutely unplayable: the units are too small, especially the enemy ones, and the touch controls immediately appear imprecise and confusing, completely unsuitable for interpreting quick inputs and changes. Total War: Medieval 2, a glimpse of the map The situation improves markedly on tablets, although in this specific case the hardware of a not so young iPad Pro forces only 30 fps, lower graphic definition and longer loading between shifts. The larger screen allows you to at least get to grips with the controls, and while a frustrating cumbersomeness persists, the situation can be handled reasonably well. The best solution, inevitably, is one in which you place the device on a surface thanks to a smart cover and is played using a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard, thus obtaining an experience substantially identical to the original one; which, however, also prompts us to reflect on the meaning of a conversionof the genre and why it would be appropriate to spend  14.99 to play Total War: Medieval 2 exactly as we would on a PC. Graphics and sound Total War: Medievil 2, a combat sequence Net of the small tweaks made to try to simplify the complex system of icons, commands and options at least a little bit, the graphics of Total War: Medieval 2 inevitably appear dated. Let's talk about the rest of a game released in 2006, which at the time amazed for the amount of characters on the screen at the same time during battles, but today it stands out more than anything else for the still rather heavy interface and completely unsuitable for an experience mobile, for the old-fashioned polygonal models, the completely empty scenarios, the woody animations and a few too many problems with the shader streaming. An entirely similar speech can be made for the sound, characterized by a dubbing in Italian made in a period in which very few were made and we relied on somewhat improvised interpreters. So most of the voices actually belong to foreign localizers, while in theory there should still be (but we didn't catch them, dammit) some famous recordings that include errors and curses, which inexplicably ended up in the final version of the game.", "date": "2022-04-13", "grade": "7.0"}
