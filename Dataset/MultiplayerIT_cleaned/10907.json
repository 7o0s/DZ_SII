{"name": "World of Goo - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/world-of-goo-recensione.html", "text": "The last few months have been quite lucky with regard to titles produced by independent developers and appearing on the online services of our dear home consoles; names such as Braid, but also Castle Crashers, PixelJunk Monsters and others have demonstrated not only the dignity of productions of this type distributed via digital delivery, but also that they can often offer a higher quality level than many titles with a higher reputation, appeal and budget. And if by chance someone was still skeptical of this statement, a few hours spent playing this World of Goo would undoubtedly be enough to sweep away any remaining reserves in this regard. A world of balls World of Goo is a splendid puzzle game created for Pc, Mac and WiiWare by 2D Boy, a small software house that with its first effort has really created an authentic cult phenomenon in the world of video games. As often happens in these cases, the underlying concept is incredibly simple and immediate; it is about managing a handful of Goo balls which, if approached, tend to join together through elastic and flexible bonds. From this point on, the imagination of the programmers has literally taken flight by applying this foundation to a number of levels in which a different objective is assigned from time to time, within different settings that actively affect the mechanics. Not only for the application of physics and gravity, a fundamental aspect that constitutes the keystone of the entire experience, but also for the presence of additional elements ranging from balloons with which to reach inaccessible areas to monsters from which to escape, passing through an infinite number of further declinations. Almost all stages have the objective of transporting a minimum number of Goo balls up to a kind of tube capable of sucking them up and collecting them in a special container. But every single level is a discovery, a challenge to be faced in a different way from the previous one; and every time you are simply amazed at the creativity and inspiration that has blessed World of Goo and its creators. The control takes place in a very intuitive way with only the Wiimote, which manages a pointer that allows interaction with the various balls. But the simplicity and immediacy of the gameplay should not mislead: World of Goo is a product with an increasing level of challenge, so sweet and gradual but intended to engage every player. We were talking about the application of physics, a fundamental component in the gameplay studied by 2D Boy; for example, building a tower of Goo to reach a tube positioned a few meters high requires that this can enjoy a solid base and balanced development, so as not to collapse on itself. Obviously this is just one of the many applications of the concept, which is truly capable of surprising and exalting in each of the 48 levels divided into the 5 chapters present. Creativity to the rescue A variety that is guaranteed not only by the amount of challenges proposed, but also by the different types of Goo balls you will have to deal with, each with different characteristics; the black ones for example cannot be moved once placed, unlike the green ones. Whites have no solidity and hang like drops of water, yellows can stick to vertical surfaces and so on. But beyond any further description, World of Goo is simply a brilliant product, a fresh puzzle game capable of triggering the infamous spring of ~one more game and then I'll stop~. We were talking about the control over the Wii, positive as is generally the adaptation for what is in fact the only console version available, alongside those for PC and Mac. In some respects the Nintendo console seems to be the environment ideal for the product, above all thanks to the aforementioned Wiimote which fits perfectly, guaranteeing precision and speed. A few notes could be made on the reduced reactivity in moving the camera, especially on the occasion of the wider levels, but you soon get used to it. While World of Goo doesn't have any online multiplayer modes, there is an option to play the levels locally on the same console for up to 4 players. An exhilarating cooperation in which simply more players instead of one face the same levels, with a truly excellent result. As for the graphic aspect, the effort of 2D Boy is one of those titles that focus more on style than on pure technique; and in the face of such a personality, one certainly cannot blame the US graphics. In some ways you can perceive the flavor of the works dthe Tim Burtons in The Nightmare Before Christmas or The Corpse Bride, with melancholy atmospheres, often gloomy settings and strong contrasts between dark and colorful hues. The soundtrack is also superb, never banal or excessively invasive. Comment World of Goo is many things together: the best title currently available on WiiWare (and not only), a fantastic puzzle game, a mature and adult product in the Nintendo console playroom, an incredible example of the quality of independent productions, and so on and so forth put more. Our hope is simply that the public wants to reward the courage and originality of the 2D Boy team's effort by spending the 1500 points required for the purchase, so that the talent of the American software house can find further expressions for the joy of all gamers . Pros One of the best puzzle games of recent years Unique and spot on style Great local multiplayer Against Some small limits of control via Wiimote Pretty short", "date": "2009-01-26", "grade": null}
