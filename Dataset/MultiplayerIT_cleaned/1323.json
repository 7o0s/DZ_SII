{"name": "Syberia II", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/syberia-ii-2.html", "text": "Destination: Syberia Anyone who hasn't played the first episode of Syberia won't struggle to get attached to the nice trio and has nothing to fear: from the main menu you can access a brief summary of the game, accompanied by splendid videos and a narrator. However, it would be a crime to ignore the first episode, it would mean losing part of that magical sense of tension and expectation skillfully created by the authors around the myth of Syberia, it would be a bit like seeing a detective story from the second half, that's it! Our dispassionate advice is therefore to buy both titles, because they deserve, and enjoy a more complete gaming experience. Destination: Syberia Even just mentioning the plot, we risk spoiling the fun: we will limit ourselves to describing Syberia II as a long journey dotted with fascinating scenarios and not without obstacles and twists. We will visit Romansbourg, a Russian town which represents the last outpost of civilization before the Great North, we will discover a Yoykol village lost in the ice and perhaps we will finally reach the legendary land of the mammoths. If in Syberia reality and fantasy merged, to evoke the image of a Europe of other times, imbued with evocative atmospheres and populated by surreal characters, Syberia II really offers a world apart: boundless expanses of snow, which we know to be north of Russia but of which we have no other coordinates, where we come across unreal situations and characters absolutely out of time. Indeed, we could conclude that Hans, Kate and Oscar's trip is actually a journey back in time: they gradually move away from civilization, with its rhythms and its strict rules (now represented only by Kate's law firm, which persists in tracking it down) to venture into the past of a primitive and mysterious population, even going back to the mammoths! In the first half of the game, development is slow and fairly predictable, until the story takes an unexpected turn. There are also genuinely funny situations, such as the daring escape from the Romansbourg monastery aboard a very unorthodox ~medium~ or the lively exchanges of opinion between Kate and Oscar in times of crisis! However, the taste is in the journey itself, the aim is to enrich yourself with experiences along the way and this is exactly what happens to Kate following Hans on the journey of a lifetime, chasing a childhood dream that she soon learns to share. There is an oriental saying which, in its disarming simplicity, fits perfectly with the spirit of Syberia: ~The day you stop travelling, you will have arrived~ . Adventure below zero As anticipated by the developers themselves, the game mechanics don't present any big surprises: we are always faced with the most dazzling reinterpretation of the traditional point and click adventure. The menus and inventory have kept their original layout and feature the usual touches of class, small animations in the unmistakable style of Hans Voralberg's creations  with the difference that they are now partially covered by ice, matching the ~climate~ of the game. In the interface we will also find Kate's cell phone, which this time however will have less weight in the economy of the adventure: it will be used exclusively to solve some puzzles and, since our heroine has now cut all ties with the past, it will not represent plus his New York ties. Adventure below zero Again, the solution follows a linear storyline, with well-integrated puzzles but mostly faced in a set order. Those who complained about the relative simplicity of the puzzles in Syberia will be happy to know that the level of variety and general difficulty has risen significantly: although the game remains affordable even for beginners, it often happens that you get stuck and have to rack your brains to continue, because you don't understand the mechanics of a puzzle or because you missed an essential detail. The occasions in which we will find ourselves grappling with puzzles based on the functioning of bizarre machines, preponderant in the first Syberia, will be less frequent: here there are more numerous ones based on inventory and dialogue, but there will be some fairly original puzzles that will see Kate engaged in the activities more varied, from salmon fishing to free-climbing! In short, this adventure really offers a perfect cocktail, perhaps even more convincing than its first incarnation, maintaining a constant balance between exploration and dialogue, logic and ~action~. Snow on our screens I magsGreat progress has been made on the technical and artistic front, an area in which the first Syberia had already reached very high levels: right from the opening screens, it is difficult not to be captivated by the magical atmosphere of the settings and not to be dumbfounded by the realism with which snowy landscapes and their atmospheric effects are represented. The two-dimensional backdrops are once again distinguished by the extraordinary wealth of details: the water of the streams animated by a thousand reflections, the cracks in the walls, the grain in the wooden planks... Furthermore, as promised, more animations and ~extras~ in the backgrounds, to liven them up and give them greater depth: the streets are much more populated and the silence of the snowy woods is broken by the sudden flight of flocks of birds, the howling of wolves, the rapid movements of squirrels on the trees or the sudden collapse of snowdrifts from branches. In the first hours of the game, you will also enjoy walking in the snow to admire the footprints left by Kate or stepping on the ice sheets to hear them creak and you will not miss the opportunity to pass over every puddle you find, to upset its surface and see its reflection image of the protagonist! The enhancement of the graphics engine has allowed the implementation of dynamic effects and suggestive plays of light and shadow. The 3D models of the characters are larger, more detailed and animated more naturally (you can even see the breath coming out of their mouths and condensing in the cold). The cutscenes, always exciting and generously long, keep faith with the high quality standard that Syberia had already accustomed us to, with even more daring cinematic shots and greater attention to facial animations. Snow on our screens Valuable and ultra-realistic sound effects further enrich the game settings: if you enjoy them with a good surround system, you'll find yourself truly immersed in the icy and muffled air of the snowy northern woods. The soundtrack is worthy of the best expectations of the fans of the first episode, who will surely recognize the memorable main theme adapted to the new proposed atmospheres. The splendid music that punctuates the exploits of Kate and her companions, embellished with epic echoes and suggestive choruses, cannot be defined as a simple background: they help to give life and depth to the adventure itself. It is also worth dwelling on the first-rate localization offered by Jinglebell which, as in the first Syberia, will give our local players the opportunity to savor Sokal's work in all its splendor... indeed, after having tested both the French and English versions, we confess that we have found some even more amusing and convincing dialogue in Italian, thanks to the superlative interpretations of the voice actors! Concluding comment Once again, Microds and Benot Sokal have been able to demonstrate how to develop a game that is technically admirable and at the same time supported by valid and original content. A direct comparison with the first episode of Syberia is obligatory: the spirit has remained unchanged but the differences are there and appear evident not only from an aesthetic point of view, improved with the help of new technologies, but also within certain limits for the nature of the puzzles, the setting and the story. While on the one hand the first Syberia was able to count on a slightly more compelling and articulated plot, this second episode has artistic maturity and a wiser balance between the ingredients on its side. Playing it will be a fulfilling experience for anyone who enjoyed the first chapter, but it is possible that someone will come to the conclusion that they would have preferred to see the story of Syberia actually ~closed~ with Kate's run to Aralbad station, towards that mechanical train and the mirage of a new life of unpredictable adventures, without the need to see Hans's dream come true or not. In short, if you expect to rate Syberia II solely on its predecessor and normally judge an adventure primarily by the originality of the story, replace the score below with an 8.5, but we think it would be outrageous not to award the undisputed artistic and qualitative value of this product, because technically it has no rivals. In fact, it remains a classy title, well above the average of the genre... even if ironically overshadowed by the ghost of itself, or by its first unforgettable incarnation! Pros: High-impact graphics and sound Original settings Various and well-integrated puzzles Cons: The plot lacks a bit of bite Softfre (only) compared to the first Syberia Destination: Syberia If the first Syberia focused on the search for a missing person, the sole heir of the Voralberg toy factory, the second puts us on the trail of the legendary place that gave its name to the series itself: an island lost in the mists of time or maybe it never even existed. The protagonists, this time, are large spaces - something rather unusual in the genre of graphic adventures, whose settings are generally confined to closed and rather limited spaces. The heroes of this adventure, which we already know, are by no means conventional. Hans Voralberg is a brilliant inventor, but a dramatic accident marked his childhood and it is precisely in a childhood dream that he took refuge: even though he is now advanced in age, he wants at all costs to see the mammoths... and the fact that have been extinct for centuries doesn't bother him in the least. Kate Walker is a New York lawyer who lands in Valadilne in search of Hans, armed with cynicism and practical sense, and then leaves again full of doubts and converted into a dreamer: after chasing the lively old man across half of Europe in the first Syberia, she remains so fascinated by his works and his fearless spirit to decide to join him in this endeavor, while continuing to wonder if he is crazy or if everyone else is! Oscar is Hans's most sophisticated creation: an automaton with human features, irreducibly meticulous and hilariously formal, designed to accompany the inventor on his journey aboard a fabulous mechanical train.", "date": "2004-05-03", "grade": null}
