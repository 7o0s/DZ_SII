Three new operators and a new map add to the existing content by revolutionizing the way you play and bringing more variety to the roster. Almost two weeks after the launch, the time has come to sum up to understand if Ubisoft is moving in the right direction or if there may have been some stumbling blocks. Tower The new setting is probably the one with the best panorama ever seen on Rainbow Six: Siege. Sure, with the frenzy of the action and the desire to run towards the objectives, we often don't focus on admiring the outlines of the game areas, but in this case it's worth pausing to observe the city below. Tower, this is the unoriginal name of the map, actually draws inspiration from the Namsan Tower in Seoul from which, however, it then completely detaches itself both in terms of external design and location. While the Namsan Tower is positioned on a lush hill, Tower stands among houses and buildings, completely changing the appearance of the exterior with infinite windows and substantially modifying all the interiors as well. Let's even say that inspiration is just a ~political~ matter to remind us that this expansion will take us to Asia, but the rest has very little to do with reality. Of course it doesn't matter, given that Tower manages to offer a completely new gaming experience compared to what has been seen up to now, above all thanks to excellent verticality and shooting lines that often go beyond the usual sightings from the corridor to move into clashes between the ceiling and flooring. The elevator shaft has become emblematic, a huge area that crosses all three floors of the tower and which gives access to every single level. Tower is quite possibly one of the best maps ever, thanks to a great extension, great variety and excellent destructibility. In short, Ubisoft seems to have really worked hard to create these DLCs that continue to bring new players and keep alive a title that is running really fast. The over 25 million players, on the other hand, certainly cannot be a fortuitous case and if the next seasons are able to maintain the levels of the previous ones we could find ourselves talking about Rainbow Six: Siege for a very long time to come. The Chinese fury of blind eyes Siege's goal is to arrive over the years to have a hundred operators to choose from, perhaps with bans and picks for attack and defense like the most recent MOBAs and a variable meta dictated precisely by the choices of the players in the pre-game. This idea, this long-term vision of Ubisoft production, works as a springboard to make players feel confident in their time investment and it is a philosophy that has always paid off in today's market. Things are going well and the support is massive and constant and the only difficulty in inserting new soldiers will be the need to find every time gadgets and weapons that not only sufficiently diversify them from the already existing ones, but also allow them to have an immediate impact on the gameplay in order to completely overhaul tactics and strategies. It is apparently a simple matter but in reality very difficult to put into practice given that he still has to deal with a very demanding professional circuit and a casual audience that seeks to have fun on a completely different range of abilities and needs. With White Noise the goal is achieved as this update aims to completely review the defensive mechanics related to the positioning and use of surveillance cameras, as well as the use of drones for scouting. Dokkaebi has the ability to steal the cell phones of downed operators and infiltrate the system, thus using robotic eyes to spy on the positioning of the defenders. What's even more interesting is that, in case of success, the defending team will be completely blind and will have to base their attention only on noises, being unable to predict in any way where the assault will come from. Another peculiarity of Dokkaebi, which always plays on the element of disturbance and surprise, is the possibility of making the opposing operators ring their cell phones, thus making them more easily identifiable. In practice, however, we have seen in the game exploit this mechanic also to set up interesting traps, with an operator left active and used as a baitfrom their comrades. It will be interesting in the coming weeks to see the evolution of the gameplay around these mechanics. For her part, Zofia is a much more ignorant and aggressive character and the concussion grenades she is equipped with are extremely useful, especially for the final assault in the manned rooms. He's the classic operator for solo players, for those who love explosions, who love being in the front row taking bullets in the face and who don't like walking quietly through the corridors. Seriously, Zofia has one of the most powerful skills in the entire game and is capable, once per game, of reanimating autonomously. You don't know how many times we have caught defenders unprepared who thought they had shot us down and instead found our M762 ready to fire. The tactic is obviously risky since you'll come back to life with only one hit point, but it's an interesting gimmick. The last operator, which we have seen chosen a few times during our games, is Vigil, a defender who, once again plays with cameras and drones, this time however hiding from view. The cooldown of his ability is quite long but the time in which Vigil can remain in this condition of partial invisibility is also very long, extremely useful in case there are medium-skilled players on the other team. The main problem of this operator in the ranked is that few use drones to scout in the rooms or observe from the cameras, making his special abilities essentially superfluous to see his actual ability it will be necessary to follow the next tournaments, perhaps even the finals of the Italian ESL Championship which will be held on the weekend of 16 and 17 December in Turin.", "date": "2017-12-14", "grade": "8.0"}
