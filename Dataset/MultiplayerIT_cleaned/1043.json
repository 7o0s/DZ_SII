{"name": "La Grande Guerra", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/la-grande-guerra.html", "text": "Requirements Buka Entertainment makes it known that the minimum requirements to run LGG are quite low. We are talking about: Pentium 3 at 500 Mhz, 256 Mb Ram, 3D Video Card with at least 16Mb, at least 600 Mb free on Hard Disk and Windows 98/Me/2000/Xp. Comment Ultimately, even with some reservations and some traces of bitterness in the mouth, I would recommend this ~The Great War~ to all fans of Imperium and Age of Empires given the good realization. The graphics won't make you scream at the miracle but the balanced and never too cumbersome action will give you several hours of fun. The audio is well studied during the real game while as regards the music, personally as a musician, I found them out of place ... I don't know ... too carefree and cheerful for such a raw topic as the First War World. For the rest, the game deserves attention and even more merit if we consider that with its excellent multiplayer, LGG dramatically increases its longevity. Pros: Low price Good technical realization Cons: Soundtrack not adequate Graphics not exciting All friends ... all happy Well, if not friends, at least allies. Oh yes, in LGG it is possible to forge alliances in the most classic of warfare styles and it is also one of the important aspects of the game. You will be allowed to form the most disparate alliances (it doesn't matter if in real history these would have been more than unlikely) by satisfying two basic requirements: agreement and duration. Let me explain: to forge an alliance it will be mandatory that both parties agree, so no secret plans and shadow maneuvers by momentarily siding on one side and stabbing your friend in the back at the right moment. The duration, on the other hand, is relative to the possibility that one of the allies, following his own motivations, decides to show hostility (but always openly), which will cause the alliance pact to immediately lapse. Troops and units Like any good RTS, even in LGG there will be different units to create, recruit, command and possibly make victorious. Here we will have to deal with: - Infantry - Cavalry - Artillery - Armored Vehicles - Aviation - Navy Yes, you read that right: we will therefore be able to command planes and ships! Not just the usual little ant-men who, on our orders, get killed without batting an eye. In LGG we will be participants and protagonists of epic naval battles (the graphic rendering of the water disappointed me a bit) and aerial bombardments. In addition to these clearly military units there will be the so-called ~workers~ or civilian units employed to develop the economy and keep our structures in good working order. Let's think, for example, of an aerial bombardment at our expense. Well, workers will be put in place and will rebuild the buildings that have been torn down and will repair the damaged ones. Every story has a beginning... It all began on June 28, 1914. An assassination. And the world plunged into one of the darkest times ever. Now the fate of that world is in your hands. With these premises, Buka Entertainment takes us back ninety years to those days when the outbreak of the First World War changed the history of our continent forever. La Grande Guerra (from now LGG) is a pleasant real-time strategy game which, to the detriment of less than excellent graphics and less exciting packaging, has several good features on its side that make it fun. Once the package is opened which, as already mentioned, does not shine in terms of design and ~consistency~ we find, in addition to the game disc, a booklet of about twenty pages which, to tell the truth, I found rather useless given that in the game there is an excellent tutorial that will will guide you step by step in discovering the different game mechanisms and the ~features~ that you will find further on. After installing LGG you will find a menu, graphically pleasing even if I personally found it not very comfortable and intuitive due to some basic options hidden at first glance. LGG can be tackled in three main modes: Campaign, Missions and Random Maps. By selecting -Campaign- we will be able to choose to face one of the following military campaigns: -Austro-Hungarian Campaign -British Campaign -French Campaign -German Campaign -Russian Campaign In addition to these very specifics, there is also a training campaign that will lead you to become more familiar with the logic of warfare. Each campaign includes about 10-11 missions for a total of 51 different scenarios plus the two missions in the training campaign. By selecting -Missions- instead you can play single missions without necessarily following a historical-logical thread. Finally selecting - Random Maps - it will be possible to create your own scenarios or let the PC do it based on anyand directives that we will impose on them. LGG is, as already mentioned, a real-time strategy game where in addition to having to command military troops, we will have to manage economic and civilian resources in order to obtain victory. These range from oil rigs to sawmills and gold, iron and coal mines. Peculiarities of this LGG are the fights that are characterized by a certain spectacularity since they will see (according to Buka... I would have some doubts about it...) over 10,000 units on each side. Even without reaching these considerable figures, the clashes are realistic while remaining quite clear in the eyes of the player. Speaking of functionality, I must say that the LGG interface is very complete and excellent, it's not very invasive: let's just say that after a few hours of playing you won't notice it anymore and it will almost seem like it's gone. Building management has some really interesting features like upgrades. These are features that can be implemented and improved with the push of a button and are tied to certain types of buildings. The interesting thing is how they will act in our favor. In fact, the Improvements do not only affect military units but also those that are civilian structures. This will translate into better management of resources by the towns and population and even to a cultural superiority of the towns we have conquered. Interesting right? The graphics are undoubtedly clear even if not in the least comparable to what we see on our monitors lately... Buka Entertainment has opted for a classic isometric view that is not too realistic as a rendering of the color palette. Especially the yield of water I found under tone.", "date": "2005-02-09", "grade": null}
