Miyamoto summons Aonuma and asks him to create a The Legend of Zelda that is immediately identifiable as a killer-application; no problem, this is also what the artisan skill of the fu EAD 3 is for. The man from Honshu knows it, he is committed and delivers what is requested. Then time passes, the installment of the laptop on duty rises more or less dizzyingly, fresh blood is needed to remind the new recruits that the legend exists and does not miss a beat: a second episode is therefore realized but a little different from the usual, with less consolidated, more experimental ideas. Do you like it as a summary of a decade? With the Game Boy Advance the opposite happened: first the ports, then that masterpiece by Minish Cap. The era of the Nintendo DS, on the other hand, was exactly as described above and history never gets bored repeating itself: Tri Force Heroes is a product unexpected in its identity so markedly spin-off, but predictable on everything else. At this point you will have already run down, wondering ~how is it possible that ...~. Well, it is possible and it is absolutely a good thing that it is. The vote is too cold and raw a mask to show how grateful we are to Kyoto for having finally decided, after decades, to grace us with a unique, fresh, innovative and potentially amazing chapter of the franchise. It is that what is proposed does not fully support the weight of the brand, but that is another matter. Fast, immediate and devoted to multiplayer: Tri Force Heroes will be fun in company, a little less alone! Elves on the catwalk We dismiss the technical aspect immediately: splendid. The engine of A Link Between Worlds has been refined and enriched, sometimes - given the curve of the frames - even too much, but that's okay, thumbs up. Let's slow down on the story, but only to confirm that from the very first moment the not exactly committed matrix reveals itself in all its strength: no kidnappings, this time the wicked witch stole the dress from the princess and, in a kingdom like this so fashionable, how can you tolerate? The ~minor~ team has been visibly enriched by young designers who over the years have been able to dilute the aura of sacredness typical of the home console department, to replace it with the very light and cheerful vision that has now conquered the portable parenthesis. Subjective tastes, children of moods in turn derived from age and the weight of nostalgia: frankly, after understanding the unique nature of the title, it didn't bother us that much to run in search of materials and see Link change his costume. He didn't even exalt us, to be honest; Eiji dear, a nice return even on a laptop to the hard and pure epic quests of the past, right? We knew it, now you know it too: one of the distinctive elements of the title is the emphasis placed on the mechanics of collecting materials to create costumes, wear them and obtain gameplay advantages. We'll be back, for now just know that the village is no longer part of an open world but a humble and simple hub from which to adventure. Three is better than one Unfortunately, it is highly probable that very few of you have ever played or even seen Four Swords. Too bad, really: it would be much easier to explain the three-player multiplayer mechanics implemented in Tri Force Heroes, full of different levels of reading which a little experience with the Nintendo GameCube chapter would have helped to decipher. Also difficult to evaluate, in reality, as paradoxically there are also three user experiences: single, local and online multiplayer. The hope is that you have at least a couple of friends with 3DS with whom to experience the title because Nintendo, much more than in Four Swords, has opted for an approach clearly and indisputably devoted to multiplayer. If you are lone wolves or simply unlucky in not meeting the above condition well, Tri Force Heroes will be a good, enjoyable product for you, perfect in controls and also fairly long-lived, but not very galvanizing. For the first time in the series, progress is compartmentalized, with eight game worlds (selectable) made up of four sub-sections (selectable), in turn formed by four sequential levels (therefore non-selectable). Controlling one Link at a time is a choice that blends with the level design and with the structure entrusted to three pre-established objects provided to complete the sub-section, an option that in the long run demonstrates all its limitations. In the middle of the game it will not be rare to almost give a damn about the two clones to do as much as possible on their own and then go back to using them, but only and exclusively because they have the object necessary for advancement. The mechanics seeThe strategy of making the characters rise like a tower works at the beginning but gradually loses variety, useful for increasing the bite of the bosses a little but without overdoing it: the result - excluding a couple of slightly more demanding moments - is a rather easy main adventure and therefore not memorable, also by virtue of its fast and immediate essence. But in multiplayer? 3D effect Given the beauty of the engine used, the 3D effect adds that quid to color an already rich visual offer with depth, but on a playful level, parallax has long since abandoned any wishful thinking. Legend in pieces The soul of Tri Force Heroes, needless to say, lies in multiplayer sessions with friends. Not even too much online, given that the only way to communicate is through pre-established gestures; we mean just with people around. The possession of a copy is enough to have the respective two travel companions download the software (but there must be two... one alone is not enough) and it must be said that everything changes, for the better. The ~hit and run~ system adapts perfectly to the remnants of free time and even when the main plot is complete, the team has managed to fill each section with three other secondary missions for their own sake, but certainly very challenging and fun. Timed, precision, skill: it is precisely in these external stages that the title gives its best, multiplying the longevity but above all the challenge. Nice idea, exactly the one found - going back to the second paragraph - which gives meaning to the costumes, characterized by unique peculiarities and advantages, absolutely superfluous for the standard quest but designed precisely to complete the extras. And if for each normal mission you could count on a collectible item as a reward, the secondary ones raise the bar with much rarer materials. The consequence? You get there on your own: it will be necessary to repeat the same operations often to obtain some ingredients and it goes without saying that the practice will not be exactly the most innovative. To flavor the most peripheral part of the dish, Nintendo has inserted a bit of PvP to make an offer even more substantial overall that is very appreciable at a playful level but can be criticized for inspiration and level design, sometimes really too alluring towards casual.", "date": "2015-10-21", "grade": "7.5"}
