The point is simple: that game, for all its problems, captured the setting's dark allure to a great degree, combining its modern complexity with a perfect mix of gameplay, humor and well-crafted narrative, which sadly failed in almost any other subsequent product placed in the same world. With the passage of the license to Paradox, fans expected more rosy developments, but they had to face one disappointment after another, until reaching the current sad situation in which it has come to settle for products that are consistently between mediocre and depressing. In this limbo, where the hope of a product worthy of the aforementioned intellectual property seems increasingly distant, Nacon has slipped in and has decided to bring a faint light to the landscape with a curious graphic adventure built around a progression close to that of RPGs. Vampire the Masquerade: Swansong, this is the name of the game, had even managed to capture us during the first test, demonstrating a fair passion from the team for the universe created by White Wolf, and apparently sufficient skills to handle it properly. Too bad that, after completing it, our optimism had to deal with the reality of the facts: Swansong certainly does not have the characteristics necessary to bring the World of Darkness back to the center of modern gaming, and many of our hopes have been shattered by a not exactly careful management of the elements of the work. That said, this curious adventure offers at least some healthy bread for those who love the original Pen & Paper RPG, and could be a good sign for the future. Let's see why, in our review of Vampire the Masquerade: Swansong. Fiction: The swan that danced between the clans Vampire Swansong: Emem definitely knows how to dress for a party Although it has been defined as a narrative RPG, Swansong is in all respects a three-dimensional graphic adventure with multiple choices, whose campaign is structured around three different protagonists. Understandably, in a similar title the narrative is the fulcrum of the experience and in this case the Big Bad Wolf have decided to tie it inextricably to the world of darkness, making sure that all the events were somehow linked to the organization known as the Camarilla (whose job is to hide the true nature of vampires from humans, to allow the lords of the night to exercise their power behind the scenes). At the center of each event is Hazel Iversen, prince of the Camarilla and the driving force behind the events, given that your alter egos are all her subordinates engaged in extricating themselves from its political web: an ancient Ventrue named Galeb, known for his loyalty to the cause and coldness in ~dirty work~; Emem, a gorgeous Toreador in charge of some of Boston's busiest clubs; and finally Leysha, a Malkavian to whom madness - a characteristic of the clan she belongs to - has given us very useful premonitions. The use of a triptych of protagonists is not, however, a gimmick capable of emulating other titles with similar characteristics (such as a Detroit , to give an easy example), but an almost natural way to best outline a stratified universe like that of Vampire: playing the role of characters belonging to completely different clans is a fabulous starting point for offering atypical perspectives and various levels of reading the plot, or even just to insert fundamental information on the narrative background naturally into the campaign. There is only one small headache: the characterization of the protagonists has unfortunately left us a little bitter in the mouth. Vampire Swansong: Be careful with your choices during the dialogues. Wasting resources can have serious consequences We don't want to say that Galeb, Leysha and Emem are terrible characters, mind you, but considering their role and everyone's possibilities we sincerely believe that they represent a fair waste of potential. Galeb is a cold performer with few facets, Emem often acts too childish and impulsive for a powerful vampire capable of dominating a city's nightlife, and Leysha has significant ups and downs in the way she is portrayed despite personal circumstances undoubtedly more fascinating than those of the other two. Overall it often seems to be a fair characterizationcomparable to that of a pen & paper RPG game group not particularly accustomed to high-level interpretations, and you will understand that this is certainly not a compliment. It is therefore the main plot that saves the shack, remaining at least quite compelling for most of the duration, also due to some good twists and forks capable of leading to significant changes in progression. In any case, don't expect perfection even in this area: certain moments are clearly less ~flowing~ than others, to the point of seeming almost artificially drawn out for long; there are some significant inconsistencies; at least a couple of scenes made us turn up our noses at their lack of logic (not to mention absurdity), and the ending could offer much more. Swansong also has a tendency to overwhelm the player with data and exposure in some moments, an appreciable thing for those who love the World of Darkness and want to analyze every single element of it, but not so pleasant for those who just want to enjoy a storyline written with criterion. Gameplay: identity lost, variety found Vampire Swansong: Galeb isn't afraid to get his hands dirty In short, overall the narrative is only decent, due to the multiple reservations described above. The really curious thing, however, is Swansong's ability to surprise more with its gameplay than with the sudden turns of the plot, given that the work of Big Bad Wolf mechanically transforms more times than we would have thought plausible. To clarify, already at the base the game contains non-marginal RPG elements: real statistics to be leveled by obtaining experience from chapter to chapter, and whose values offer additional options during the often important dialogues to obtain positive developments. Everything is managed as a sort of gamebook with investigative phases spent mostly collecting information and clues, rather intuitive puzzles to solve - generally valid, with some annoying stumbling blocks - and comparisons with variable risks, which if failed sometimes lead to worrying events or significant loss of experience and information. Nothing particularly innovative so far, and in such parts of the adventure the advancement is mostly a matter of logic and careful use of one's resources, since most of the actions require the use of blood (to make the most of the vampiric powers) or willpower (to improve success rates in dialogues). Yet Swansong often shuffles the cards with moments in which the individual powers of the protagonists have to be exploited to face sections that are far from the ~classic~ investigative ones. They range from a linear and rose-water version of Hitman where it is necessary to use Leysha's invisibility and ability to take the form of others to advance, to movement puzzles that exploit Emem's speed to achieve certain zones, even up to stealth moments with markedly different mechanics from what we have seen up to that moment. In practice, to keep the experience fresh, the developers have not been afraid to insert everything that crosses their mind into the game, even going so far as to modify the underlying systems. Vampire Swansong: in the world of darkness there is certainly no shortage of blood In all sincerity? We didn't mind the idea. It is true that in doing so the campaign becomes a little more chaotic than expected and loses its personality, yet overall these variations on the theme make it very difficult to get bored, despite the fact that they are fairly ~rough~ sections. Let's say that, although the lack of resources of the team at the reins is evident, the attempt by Big Bad Wolf to distinguish their creature from the competition seemed mostly positive to us, and overall it made us appreciate the experience more, instead of ruin it. On the other hand, the implementation of replayability was less successful, given that the chapters can be tackled again once completed, but the dialogues can only be partially skipped (during the first play, it is also impossible to speed them up or cut them) and various actions have prolonged consequences, which force in some ways to redo entire sections from scratch by tackling the most difficult events to overcome as soon as possible. In other words, if it had not yet been understood, we are faced with a video game clearly made with passion for the universe to which it belongs, but not supported by as many means and expertise, for a final result that manages to entertain overall despite often lacking the target. The technical sector suffers from the same curse: stylistically Swansong is not bad and worthily captures the look of the world of darkness, however it disfigures if comparedto the works of much more competent teams, due to not particularly detailed polygonal models and limited animations (which in particular contribute negatively in giving personality to the protagonists). On the other hand, the dubbings are valid, which seemed to us to be generally of an excellent level apart from a handful of slightly too caricatured voices.", "date": "2022-05-25", "grade": "6.8"}
