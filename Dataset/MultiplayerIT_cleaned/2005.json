{"name": "Quantum RedShift", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/quantum-redshift_b.html", "text": "History We are 100 years from here in the future.there is a world tournament that pits 16 of the sport's greatest riders in 16 huge circuits around the world. Up for grabs, in addition to a large cash reward, is glory ... the desire to be the fastest. Therefore, in each race there will be a direct confrontation between the player and the landlord ... introduced in a similar way to Dead or Alive which in fact tries to spice up an already fiery race. Gameplay Quantum Redshift proposes the gameplay of Wipeout from which it draws many ideas. Perhaps this is its greatest flaw ... or lack of originality. However, I must admit that Quantum creates a new standard with which the Psygnosys title will necessarily have to deal with. In fact, the gameplay, although not distorted, has actually been made new. It's always about winning by finishing first on each circuit, but each spaceship has its own weapons and characteristics that distinguish it from all the others. In fact, each will have holographic weapons, different aerodynamics, and structures that will allow it to be able to race on every circuit but specifically designed to excel on the pilot's home circuit. This means that the landlord will in any case be the most advantaged opponent ... the man to beat. There are basically 3 racing modes: Tournament: In this mode you must win every race that is part of every single competition (5 in all...from the Novice to the one at the limit of human possibilities) in order to access the next competition. In these, as well as the speed (the last mode sets the average speed at 900Mph without having the turbo activated!!) the artificial intelligence of the pilots also varies. Time Attack: This is simply about beating yourself. Breaking the lap record will become the main challenge after completing the Tournament mode. At each completed lap, to help the player, the ghost of the next lap will automatically start, this can then be saved and reused. Quick Race: For those who want to get familiar with the controls, this is the right mode. We get straight to the pointyou choose the character, you choose the circuit (at the beginning only 6 tracks out of the 16 available) and you run.Stop. The Tracks The game features 16 different tracks spread over eight different environments with various types of terrain, forests, snow, sand and of course water. Among the futuristic circuits stand out: Silver Rock Canyon, a former national park in New Mexico; Kalau Wastelands, a former nuclear testing site in Siberia; Fuusoku City, a new metropolis in Japan; Solar City, a cosmopolitan city that is sometimes referred to as ~Hong Kong Down Under~; Brackenstowe Vale, a course for water specialists located in the legendary Lake District; Draco Island, an active volcano in the Pacific Ocean. The Spaceships: As already announced, there are in fact 16 different spaceships ... each for each selectable character (including secrets). Each ship is built to excel on the home circuit and is also equipped with personal holographic weapons. According to the Software House producing the game, there are over 100 different weapons in the game ranging from energy waves up to atomic weapons with devastating effects. With the money earned from victories it will be possible to buy new weapons, armaments, shields and boost reserves. Very customizable therefore .. contrary to what happened for wipeout. Scattered along the path you will find the famous Powerups, containers of weapons, shields or turbos depending on the color you choose. The turbo effect is devastatingan acceleration that actually dilates the screen giving you the idea of a truly supersonic speed!!! Personages: Taken directly from Microsoft sources: Players will be able to choose one of sixteen characters including: Tara Vivas, a former pop revelation, absolutely wild; Prince Yuri Galitz, a wealthy Russian who claims to be the last Romanov heir; and Kumiko Nikaido, the daughter of one of the most famous racers of all time. Each of the 16 runners has his own spacecraft, a privileged circuit and weapons. Intense storylines that develop throughout the game through cutscenes and animations ranging from the description of ~political adversaries~ to that of ~distant loves~. It will therefore be normal to choose your favorite driver since in fact there is an excellent characterization of the characters: each has its own personality, its own charm and its own mission to accomplish.Graphically speaking Here we come to another strong point of Quantum RedShift. Quantum is a real godsend: Bump Mapping, finally exploited pixel shading, reflection effects, lensFlareall at 60Hz and at a frame rate that doesn't collapse even if you hit it with a blow. Forget about any glitches that could be generated by such graphicsthere is no clipping or pop up here.and what is most extraordinary is that the speed of the game is nothing short of stratospheric. At the Novice level it is already difficult to control the ship if the turbo is turned on ... imagine in the last level when the speed will be quintupled !! Then there are the touches of class ... the snow that once touched nebulizes as well as the sand ... the water droplets that remain on the screen after immersion in water ... I could stay here and praise the graphics of this game all infinite Audio The audio sector of Wipeout has always been very accurate ... how could Quantum Redshift disappoint in this respect? The game takes full advantage of the 5.1 positional audio that the XBox is equipped with. The songs present are well suited to the futuristic climate of which the game is impregnated. Never intrusive techno (I'm speaking as a Metalhead so try to understand its importance) but also the soundtrack that can be customized with the tracks saved on the hard disc of our XBox. Couldn't ask for more... Very welcome additions The game supports up to 4 players on screen at the same time. The detail is lowered as logical but still remains acceptable and still fast. To my knowledge the game will not support XBox Live! But I'm not so sure anymore. The game also contains 3 demos, one of which is non-interactive: Blixx. The other 2 titles are NFLFever2003 and Rally Sport Championship. There are 4 selectable languages: Italian, English, French and German. There are 9 secret characters to unlock by winning tournaments. With them the cars and tracks will be unlocked to be able to face them in the Quick Race as well Conclusions I was very passionate about the gamemuch more than what Wipeout did at the time. The graphics are extraordinary, the audio as well ... the only flaw in the originality of the title ... however negligible factor given that on XBox it is the only representative of the genre. A must. Pros: amazing graphics good sound well-characterized characters customizable vehicles cons: little originality Materials Image gallery Preview 4 Movies Quantum RedShift Quite a few years have passed since the release of a game that at the time created a genre of its own, I'm talking about that Psygnosis Wipeout that made so much talk about Playstation. In fact, before then the future-racing genre had never been tackled with that spirit of speed and shamelessness that Wipeout embodied. Wipeout was more than a game, a philosophy a new way of understanding future racing Microsoft, following the whole story linked to the Psygnosis title, certainly did not miss the opportunity to create an exclusive title for its console that followed the wave impact of future-racinga comparison with Wipeout is a mustand nobody should be shocked if the Microsoft title emerges victorious from this incredible clash.", "date": "2002-09-26", "grade": null}
