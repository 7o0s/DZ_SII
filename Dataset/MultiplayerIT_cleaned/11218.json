{"name": "Too Human - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/too-human-recensione.html", "text": "The Baldur Saga Too Human proves to be a production of a certain weight especially seeing the care placed in the construction of the background and the screenplay. Anyone who has played Eternal Darkness or The Twin Snakes will have noticed the distinctive quality applied by Silicon Knights in the ~writing~ of the game and in packaging a product strongly based on narration while remaining firmly action. The setting takes up various characters and elements from the Scandinavian mythological tradition, leaving names and actantial roles intact and inserting everything into a futuristic world in which runic magic merges with cybernetics, and humanity finds itself fighting against machine armies. We find here Yggdrasil, the Tree of Life, an open door to the cyberspace populated by the Norn (female figures who symbolize the past, present and future, responsible for fate), and all the classic names of the Scandinavian sagas. The protagonist is Baldur, an ~Aesir~, or a warrior deity dedicated to the protection of humanity, who resides together with his other equals (including Thor and Heimdall, just to name two known names) in Asgard, and guides humanity in a fight against machines, a conflict dating back to an ancient era that tears the world apart; soon, however, it will be the usual Loki (the evil deity in the myth) who will prove to be the real threat. The plot is told through interesting cut-scenes that are inserted directly into the game phases, based on the same graphics engine. Given the majestic setting and the grandeur of the reference universe (Nordic mythology, in fact) it would probably have been appropriate to offer more possibilities for further study of the history of the characters and the relationships that distinguish them. Too Human, on the other hand, does not seem to want to exploit too much the solid foundation offered by the chosen background, and minimizes the dialogues and cutscenes: it's a shame, because given the complexity of the story and the quality of the dialogues (excellently dubbed in Italian), showing something more about the plot would have been appropriate. Probably, since this is the first episode of a trilogy, the developers wanted to reduce the narration to a minimum by moving it to the next episodes, which can be clearly seen from the sudden surge that the story undergoes right at the end, a sort of ~cliffhanger~ which however leaves the 'bitter in the mouth, thinking about how long we'll have to wait to know what's next. Stickmashers The gameplay of Too Human is based on two basic elements: the fights, purely action, and a complex system of equipment and evolution of the character, which marginally brings it closer to the world of RPGs. The main node of the action consists in fighting against waves of enemies who attack in overwhelming numbers, hitting them with short-range weapons (swords, hammers and clubs of various shapes) or fire, also allowing a combined use of these in a similar way to what has Devil May Cry used to us. The control system is perhaps the most original feature present in Too Human: instead of relying on the usual key combinations, it is based on the use of the two analog sticks. The left, as usual, is dedicated to the movement of the character (framed in third person) on the screen, while each input of the right corresponds to a blow in the direction given. Although it is not free from flaws, this system is decidedly intuitive and satisfying, especially during the most agitated situations, where with short touches of the analog we see spectacular clashes with the protagonist who is projected from one enemy to another, hitting them and throwing them air ringing combo in industrial quantities. The control system is perhaps the most original feature present in Too Human Stickmashers With the combined use of both sticks, special moves are performed, while the use of firearms is assigned to the classic triggers, which control the main and secondary weapons. The execution of combos determines the loading of an indicator which, once filled, allows the release of various powers, depending on the choices made in the management of special abilities. Although the control system and the combat mechanics are all in all well functioning, however, everything is mortified by the lack of variety of enemies and the monotony of their attack patterns, which leaves very little room for a more strategic approach (to which the role-playing component), conforming to the standards of a common button masher (stick masher in this case). Other defects are represented by some inconsistencies occurring in the response to commands (which often cause you to suffer blows, elosing precious energy), in the tightest melees, and by a strange management of long-range weapons, with an automatic targeting system that does not allow you to precisely select the targets to hit, and it is a big problem when you have to do for example with explosive enemies, to be eliminated before they get close. Hack and Loot The ~role-playing~ component, which perhaps should have characterized this game as an original hybrid, is actually quite limited. There is indeed a complex management of the character, on which it is possible to spend a lot of time, but in the test of facts little changes in the approach to the clashes, except the aesthetics of the weapons and armor. A first choice of field takes place at the beginning of the game, when you are asked to select the character class from the five available, each corresponding to the classic figures ranging from berserker to ~magician~, with various intermediate steps. As the experience level increases, skill points are assigned, to be spent on various powers, selected from a tree diagram with which we can decide on which characteristics to focus on in Baldur's evolution, a system similar to that of Diablo, to make the idea. Apart from a rather scarce amount of spells and special powers (basically three: the summoning of the Spider as a support unit, the battlecry that temporarily modifies the stats and the sentient weapon that attacks enemies autonomously), the stats of the character to be above all influenced by the choices made here, but this does not bring much change in the combat system, which remains mostly based on the choice of which weapon to use and on the short or long range attack. The game, on the other hand, will certainly satisfy lovers of easy ~loot~ and objects: large quantities of weapons, armor and runes are dispensed with each game, with vast possibilities for customizing the fighter. In addition to the fact that they are present in large quantities (each with its own stats) each weapon and every minimum component of the armor has special powers, or contains slots in which you can insert runes corresponding to various characteristics that affect the stats general, so the possibilities are really many for fans of statistics. The scenarios of the game are all very pleasant and evocative, made with care, and fall within what can be defined as a convincing artistic direction, which also involves the characters and areas of Asgard, the base of the Aesir. The graphics, in essence, are at good levels: although it definitely does not represent the most advanced point of the current Xbox 360 production, it would be unfair not to consider it as a positive element, despite the impossibility of freely managing the camera (it can only be ~ callback) sometimes makes the action a little confusing and prevents you from fully enjoying the settings, and you may notice occasional engine slowdowns in the phases most loaded with characters. If anything, the problem is the design of the levels, given that the structures and sets are necessarily monotonous when most of the time you are limited to running through huge and deserted streets waiting for the next, predictable wave of enemies. The lack of variety in situations is probably the weakest point of the product. The rare puzzles are all placed within the cyberspace of the Norns, a parallel dimension which is accessed through wells of light, and in which it is possible to use special powers (not usable in the real plane) to solve simple puzzles that allow you to continue all inside the levels (a solution similar to the one seen in the old Soul Reaver). The lack of variety in situations is probably the weakest point of the product However, even these alternative areas are bare, and the situations they present us with are so elementary that they are unable to raise the level of interest too much. Another difficult to understand choice is the absence of Game Over, given that when energy is completely lost, a beautiful Valkyrie descends from the sky, but instead of taking us back to Valhalla, once its ascent is complete, it re-downloads Baldur a few meters before the place in which he fell, without practically causing us to suffer any loss (except for some damage to the equipment, however repairable). In practice, nothing prevents us from taking the entire game lightly, strengthened by the fact that we can subject the poor protagonist to countless deaths and resurrections. Returning to the technical sector, we note the excellent purely cinematographic sound accompaniment, with orchestral music that emergesttoline the salient moments of the story and those in which the action becomes more pressing. As already mentioned, the dialogues spoken and dubbed in Italian are excellent. The multiplayer The online multiplayer mode allows you to tackle the various levels of the game in the company of another player, thus skipping all the cut-scenes and narrative sections. In the heart of the action, the inclusion of a battle partner is well appreciated, effectively multiplying the dynamism of the fights. Here too, we find fertile ground for loot hunters, with the possibility of finding unpublished treasures and exchanging items between users. There are two main flaws in this mode: first of all, being forced to play only in pairs, where the five classes available would have allowed the creation of solid parties to be launched in online battles. The other problem is that the game calibrates the strength of the enemies based on the level of the player with the most experience, making it necessary to create couples that are as balanced as possible. Comment It is necessary to set aside the grandiose idea that we could have made of Too Human before approaching it and taking it for a simple action game with some RPG influence, to appreciate it, accepting it for what it is, without too many pretensions. In fact, despite several problems, the game manages to offer good things: the control system makes the fights fun and spectacular (despite the defects encountered), while the deep customization that can be carried out on the character and equipment (in addition to the ease with which these are given during the game) can provide raw material in abundance to those who are passionate about the management component of role-playing games. Above all, the imposing scenography built by the Silicon Knights stands out, a true distinctive element of a game that otherwise would have had very little originality. Too bad for the fundamental monotony that rages for the (approximately) 15 hours of campaign play and for the numerous technical and structural imperfections with which the game is dotted. Perhaps, instead of diluting a good script as much as possible in a trilogy that arrived decidedly late on the market, for a game conceptually linked to a few years ago, it would have been preferable to concentrate everything in a single title in order to at least raise the pace of the action and reduce downtime. Pros Excellent setting and characters Intuitive and enjoyable combat system Plenty of material for equipment and stats enthusiasts Cons Too repetitive Story too diluted Poor implementation of special skills Camera and auto-aim problems Xbox 360 goals Too Human contains 50 unlockable achievements for 1000 Gamerpoints. Achievements are achieved by continuing in the story and reaching particular requirements such as experience levels, activation of special abilities, particular performances in combat or collected items. By concluding the game with a moderate effort it is possible to easily unlock about half of the total prize pool, to go further it is certainly necessary to return to the game several times after having concluded it, and concentrate on certain objectives.", "date": "2008-09-04", "grade": null}
