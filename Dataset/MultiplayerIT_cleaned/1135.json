Is it a way to convince us to treat our speck of space dust better, or is it just the usual clich? Already the opening cinematic gives us an idea of the complexity of the Nexus plot. It starts with a simple question: ~Who is Richard Cromwell?~ [C] Marcus Cromwell, the protagonist of Nexus, who answers the first question of the introduction You pass the aliens, you pass who want to wipe out all sentient races from the universe, but does this seem like the way to reduce a planet? Another image from the introduction: There's no such thing. some difference in quality; with those of the game, indeed, perhaps they are even better [/C] The story of the future of humanity starts from the answer. Richard Cromwell was the first man to be born in outer space, in 2033. A short time later a conflict broke out known as the war of Artificial Intelligences which brought down the economy of the entire globe. When it was over, Richard, as a symbol of cohesion between the earth and its space colonies, signed the treaty banning AI from the planet when he was only 10 years old. Years later a wormhole was discovered (a fold in space that leads to another point in the universe) and after a decade a colonization mission was organized, Noah's Ark (but what a fantasy ...) led by Cromwell himself, but nothing more was heard of the ship. Richard Cromwell, however, is also the father of the protagonist of this story: Marcus Cromwell. Marcus joined the Earth fleet to follow in his father's footsteps, but he did so at the worst of times, when the colonies began declaring themselves independent of Earth. Towards the end of this new Civil War, Marcus's ship was hit and he was forced into a cryogenic pod for a decade before he was found. While under ice, Earth had lost the war, and its influence was now limited only to the Moon. Beyond, multiple guilds reigned. In a world short of capable commanders, Macus accepted a leadership position with one of the closest corporations to Earth, and thus began what in the history books will be called the Jupiter Incident. A good start, it must be said, considering that usually the plot in this genre of games is not always treated as much as it should. But that's nothing, as the story progresses it becomes more and more complicated: we will find a ship equipped with alien AI, we will go through the wormhole and find out what happened to Noah's Ark and we will meet alien races, and this is just the tip of the story. iceberg. All distributed in continuous films and dialogues between one mission and another. The quality of the movies is also excellent, not only the sequences involving the spaceships and which are therefore performed using the game engine, but also the few in which the characters are present. The same can be said for the dialogues, definitely above all expectations (at least in the English version). Jokes and teasing alternate with the information necessary to complete the missions, and help us get to know the characters better; the one in which Sweetwater refers to the ship's AI as ~bucket of bolts~ due to its electric appearance is exceptional. [C] Cat fight! Marcus will need to often quell the bickering between the two... Well, this sentence could stand next to Rutger Hauer's monologue in Blade Runner without looking bad Extract from Marcus Cromwell's private diary: It will be; also an outstanding commander, but with women, he's the best. a real disaster... (there's another excerpt in the gallery, don't miss it!) [/C] The practical handbook of the good commander A captain's duties aren't limited to just curbing bickering among the fairer sex of the crew. He is responsible for the lives of the people on board the ships he commands, not to mention the direct and indirect effects of a failure in the economy of a war. In addition to having to analyze situations and decide on the best strategy to adopt in a very short time, we must be able to give orders clearly and unequivocally. The command interface helps us enormously in this. Simple and linear, the few lines of explanation that appear when a new option becomes usable for the first time are enough to fully understand how it works. Our ships are shown on the left, everything else (other ships, objects and nav points) on the right, and the commands below. When you issue an order then just right click on the target and you're done. The risk of making a mistake is almost nil. Furthermore, each ship can be micro-managed, defining which systems to use, the targets for each individual weapon on board and how to favor the use of energy. This in principle, because in reality a couple of errors seriously affect the playability. The first is undoubtedly the total lack of independent movement. We move in three dimensions in space, so to define a direction we need to interact with all three axes. It follows that the mouse (which uses only two axes) is not suitable for handling this type of movement, and monitors are not able to represent it (the cursor is always and in any case in 2D). In Homeworld, the problem was solved by breaking down the movement into two planes, one horizontal and the other vertical, and switching between them simply by holding down a button. In Nexus all this does not exist: the possibility of defining a point in space is completely missing. The only way to move is to have any object active in the direction you want to go, point it as a target and give the command ~move towards~. In the same way there is also the reciprocal ~run away from~ which makes us move away from the target. So to move effectively you have to constantly bounce with ~go~ and ~run away~ the relation to the targets on the map. Obviously this makes infiltration missions (the so-called stealth missions) difficult and sometimes frustrating, but also the battle tactic itself suffers given the difficulty, or sometimes the real impossibility of engaging the enemy from the side in which it is considered more vulnerable. Apparently less important, but more frequent, therefore in the end still annoying, the rigidity of the system that controls the attitude of the ships. There are four different settings, and each corresponds to a certain behavior (aggressive, defensive, stealthy) of the ship, but also to a difference between the systems that are used. But this goes against the micromanagement of weapons and systems, as each seeks to overlap the other. When you activate a general command (go, attack, use artillery) all micromanagement is eliminated and you return to the basic settings of the attitude; similarly if you activate or deactivate a system, the general order is canceled. This conflict is especially annoying when you consider that, if the two systems cooperated rather than collided, control of each ship during direct combat would be exceptional. Instead in this way we find ourselves in situations such as for example the escape, in which we would like to keep all the defensive systems on; the faster engines, however, are part of the offensive attitude, which instead has the defense systems off; on the contrary, if you customize the systems, the ship remains stationary like a cod to take the enemy broadsides. You will understand that in this way you always have to sacrifice something in the most agitated situations and you cannot take full advantage of the on-board equipment. Technically speaking Nexus is really technically well done. The Black Sun Engine is light enough to be able to run comfortably even on machines with a few years on the back, even if to enjoy Nexus in full detail it is good to have a PC with no more than a generation behind it. Graphically we stand at very high levels in all parts of the game. The ships are detailed, but still simple, to confirm the principle of military essentiality and functionality that permeates all aspects of Nexus. When an enemy ship's system is targeted, the engine takes this into account, and energy weapons are concentrated only against that single point of the hull, while, as it should be, when the enemy is facing in the opposite direction, gunners won't fire because they won't be able to visualize it. The same thing happens when a ship manages to get the cover of another vehicle or an asteroid. Other small details, such as the vibration of the screen when the camera is positioned in the wake of the engines of a spaceship, contribute to creating the right feeling with the game. Perhaps the lights of the explosions are a bit excessive, to the point of making all the mockery white even at a great distance; however, when dealing with weapons called Pulsar Missile and Big Bang Missile it is the least you can expect. The only comment can be made on the maneuvering system, which occasionally gets a little confused, too often exceeding with tight turns that waste a lot of time. <i>In conclusionfusion</i> Surely you will have been surprised by seeing the final grade. After so many lines filled with praise just a 7? Nexus is a nice game, it must be said, pleasant and well done, and the plot involves to the point of going late at night just to see how it goes on. The fact of being able to re-equip the spaceships only between one mission and another and in a limited way is logical (no one can know in detail what they will face). But then why such a low rating? Nexus is all about tactics, both in battle and infiltration, and position is the key to any victory. The history books are full of examples of encounters in which the position factor heavily influenced the course of the fight, and it is logical to think that this will also have value in space. So the impossibility of directing ships at will is a very serious shortcoming! Equally serious is the ongoing conflict between the ship's attitude management system and systems micromanagement, which drastically reduces the effectiveness of many of the expensively installed systems, and consequently also the ships' performance controlled by the player. The usual alibi that in multiplayer the defects are balanced in this case does not apply, because they directly damage the effectiveness of the game in its own sector. These two shortcomings are extremely serious for an RTT, without them in fact Nexus would have deserved a 9 without any effort, perhaps even something more. In any case, however, Nexus: The Jupiter Incident remains an excellent game, which succeeds in the difficult task of inaugurating a new genre, therefore recommended at least to all those who have already appreciated Homeworld, even if only for the wonderful plot and excellent graphics . Pros: Completely succeeds in the goal of giving birth to a new genre Varied, detailed and captivating storyline Excellent graphics engine Huge number of cutscenes and spoken dialogues of exceptional quality Personal diary of the commander which allows you to know his point of view on events and characters and further improves the feel of the game Cons: Movement based only on objects on the map (you can't direct ships at will) Conflict between ship attitude and system micromanagement RTT extension New genre, new acronym. Direct evolution of the RTS (Real Time Strategic), the RTTs (Real Time Tactical) are born. Where's the difference? Simple, as commanders of a space task force, our job is to carry out the tasks entrusted to us, not to supervise every single operation of a flying city. Let's face it: the idea of the mothership of the Homeworld saga (the most successful 3D space RTS) is nice, but it's a bit excessive (without taking anything away from Homeworld)... Normally, in the face of danger, one sends a military task force that has to manage on its own, without the ~Dolce Forno~ that churns out new means to flesh out the ranks, or a team of scientists who invents everything they may need on the spot. The idea behind the RTTs probably came from the old space simulators, only that the player does not play the role of the intrepid pilot, but those of the cunning and experienced commander of a battleship, with all that goes with it. Without the possibility of building new ships from scratch, the ability to analyze the situation and decide how best to use the means that the fleet has assigned us becomes fundamental. This is in fact the idea of Nexus  The Jupiter Incident: to eliminate all the production and development part and focus only on the battle tactics.", "date": "2004-11-18", "grade": null}
