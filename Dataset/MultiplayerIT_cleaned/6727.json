{"name": "Gira la ruota", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/141274-twisty-hollow-gira-la-ruota.html", "text": "The charming town of Twisty Hollow has been in great trouble since an evil bear proclaimed himself mayor and began to limit commercial activities by churning out many new laws, each more absurd than the last. The inhabitants do not give up, however, and decide to organize their work using a special circular device that allows them to meet the needs of any customer, whether it's a grumpy big man looking for bacon, a man of business interested in buying diamonds or even a beaver who would love to bite into a succulent tree trunk. Starting from the narrative pretext we have just mentioned, Twisty Hollow presents itself as a different puzzle game from the usual, original in its mechanics and very pleasant graphic style, which in some situations recalls that of the talented Italian cartoonist Daw and is accompanied by a soundtrack fitting and fun. The game does not contain in-app purchases and therefore offers a free and complete experience at the final price of 2.69 euros, without waiting or upgrades to be paid separately; but above all it manages to keep its gameplay varied thanks to the introduction of various ~handicaps~, new enemies, customers who get angry easily (leaving the flames of their anger to take their place, at least until we send someone to put them out) and even bosses , with a view to a campaign made up of fifty increasingly complex levels, arranged in four different areas. Twisty Hollow is a fun and quite original puzzle game with lots of levels and a nice style To each his own Entirely based on the touch screen, the mechanics behind Twisty Hollow are quite simple. Our goal in each stage is to satisfy the requests of those approaching the ~wheel~, producing food or special objects by acting on the three rings that make it up. In the innermost ring there are some characters, each specialized in the creation of a good, while in the second and third rings there are respectively tools (a knife, a fishing rod, a pickaxe) and ~ingredients~ (a pig , a sheep, a rough stone or a lure). To create bacon, for example, you have to align the butcher with the knife and the pig, then touch it so that it leaves towards the outer area of the circle and precisely produces the bacon, to be delivered to the customer who has asked for it without forgetting, then , to collect the money he left behind. The more customers are served, the more money is earned, filling an indicator with the traditional stars that will express the goodness of the work done. As we progress through the levels, as mentioned, elements are introduced that make things more difficult, such as blocked circles or annoying creatures, and all the more reason we need to quickly identify the matches to ensure that our characters produce what is asked of them, delivering it as soon as possible to avoid the wrath of a dissatisfied user. The action is a bit repetitive in the early stages, but already with the transition to the second area things get more lively and the gameplay meshes great. It's just a pity that the movement of the wheel is less fluid than one would have expected from a product of this type, which translates into a globally less pleasant and precise experience.", "date": "2014-11-26", "grade": "8.0"}
