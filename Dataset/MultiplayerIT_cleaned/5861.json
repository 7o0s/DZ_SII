Not so much because their new creature will appeal to old and new fans, nor because Paper Jam Bros represents the pinnacle of their inventiveness. Could it be the superfine quality of the playful fabric with which the adventure is dressed? little fire. The reality is that we are facing what today we can courageously point to as the most correct cross-over that the history of saga crossings remembers. The way in which the Mario&Luigi franchise unites with the cellulose of Paper Mario is that amalgam that only the crme de la crme of Japanese role-playing can knead with so much taste and irony. Class is not water, they said; in fact, it is no coincidence that in this second party of wonders - a crime to see them work only on laptops - several Squaresoft members of the past are now stationary, first of the class precisely that Mizuno who so warmed the hearts of JRPG fans of the 90s . Well done to him, yes, but well done to everyone: humble, never over the top, silent but concrete creators, still able today to make people play, entertain and exalt - all right, in the end we fell for it - even those who strip Mario & Luigi ever since that historic, unforgettable Game Boy Advance episode. Long, very long life to AlphaDream. A cross-over between Mario & Luigi and Paper Mario? Bet won 100%! 3D effect Given the technical beauty, turning on 3D will bring the world designed by AlphaDream even more to life. If 3D doesn't bother you or you have a New Nintendo 3DS, bring up the slide and enjoy the show. Level up We believe that the element that made us most attached to the plot was the extreme sincerity of Paper Jam Bros. What we hope you will soon have in your hands is a product that does not hide its matryoshka nature: out of Mario & Luigi, inside Paper Mario. A book opens by chance and the adventure starts from there: it is the world of paper that enters the polygonal one, almost a guest constantly placed at the center but never really the protagonist. The way in which the two schools blend together is splendid, as is the question of principle - or pride? - which seems to make the team whisper ~yes, it's a cross-over... but the heart is and remains ours~. To make it clear: the DNA is absolutely from Mario & Luigi and could not be better; we do not want the talented Intelligent Systems guys, but the comparison between this and the previous Paper Mario is merciless. AlphaDream has not only mastered its own ecosystem, but it is spreading its sails and gaining ground even in that ocean of paper that they never was. Jokes, atmosphere, verbal fights between the absolutely hilarious split characters that lead to skits of a taste from the past. We laughed, still today, after four episodes on each side: it takes skill and a lot of passion, there's little you can do. It is that continuous, sketchy dualism that pushes the protagonists and supporting actors to divide the scene with great balance, accompanying an averagely long-lived adventure along the standards of the previous episodes. If we were to find a flea in all this idyllic setting we would point the finger at the difficulty: either for an intelligent but still generous recovery point management, you will have to work hard to be defeated in the battles of the scenario. The boss speech raises the bar a little higher, but overall the challenge level is never too high. Lots to do The fact is that AlphaDream has grown a lot and playing you will be there, smiling, realizing how much effort has been made to color your progress with new things. The entry curve into the gameplay structure is sweet, gradual, seemingly almost trivial; for the first few sessions, everything will seem already seen, enriched by the presence in the paper Mario team but still largely within the backyard. It is here that the team's creative prolificacy takes center stage: not only does the level design suggest from the beginning the presence of skills and moves that will be unlocked as you progress, reinvigorating the now well-known back-tracking prevailing in the franchise, but it is the combat system itself to grow and evolve. The presence of a third member of the party adds playful impulses to the clashes, overcoming the two-way combinations between the brothers and introducing three-way moves, real mini-games in their own right. Which, among other things, you will be encouraged to use since the title adopts a system of disguised objectives: a long list of conditions which, if met, give you points to spend on elite equipment. Not a new but always appreciable gimmick, useful to actively lead you not to fossilize on the same move. There's more: at some point in the game, a system will be added to itsupport ema in the form of cards. Limited, almost a quality filler, yet we appreciated it, one of those rare cases in which the presence enriches but does not dirty: considering that you will spend a good piece of adventure in battle, you might as well make it as interesting as possible. They must have felt the same way. Toad Hunt! You may have already seen them in the trailers: we are talking about the Big Models, a sort of Mushroom Kingdom-style mech on which to fight. Said like this, it would seem the most epic thing ever seen in a Mario episode, yet trust us if we tell you how many small elements, even if not properly investigated, necessarily create a much more satisfying overall picture. The sessions with these extra-large models are part of the plot, obligatory, but not boring for that: nothing transcendental, yet the proposal is not suffocating, oppressive. The revival of these scenes is quite rare, continuing the work of balancing and alternating them with unique and uniquely characterized sections of gameplay. And yet, that's not all: this wouldn't be an episode of Mario without Toads to save and in fact the tender mushrooms will be the fulcrum of a whole series of fun mini-games in which to hunt them down. Yet another fresh addition but which is inserted with the right frequency, without exaggerating, cleverly alternating the gameplay offer and mixing it in the best way. This is the secret that Paper Jam Bros. does not share with Sticker Star: the ability not to bore, not to be taken for granted. A great value, but sometimes capable of clashing with a certain superficiality of some potentially much more explorable situations, left just nibbled instead. We couldn't expect much more, after all we are talking about playful mini-grafts within a product that is already portable in itself. A beautiful world In short, if you haven't figured it out yet, Mario & Luigi: Paper Jam Bros is a work that flows very well, fluidly, without a hitch. To complete the cake, the team opted to insert an external area where to propose specific challenges: stronger bosses to redo, record points with three-way attacks and more. Material for completionists, a bit like that end-game stimulus that, looking from above, teases and makes you angry during the standard advancement. It is a must, at least in closing, to spend some words on the technical and audio sector, once again as proof of how investments, if done well, bring precisely that benefit to tinge the whole package with quality. A name that speaks for itself: Yoko Shimomura. She is the composer and listening to the tracks we could not have any doubts: fitting music, well inserted into the contexts and made special by that creative flair that made Shimomura a star of the Japanese videogame musical firmament. We support a first-rate visual picture, finally able to do technical justice to a franchise for too long out of the spotlight of the masses, delighted by a character design that draws from the Intelligent Systems tradition and stubbornly merges it into the polygonal world. This is exactly the return of AlphaDream that we wanted.", "date": "2015-11-30", "grade": "9.0"}
