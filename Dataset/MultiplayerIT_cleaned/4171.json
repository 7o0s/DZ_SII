To go back to Limbo's release day, in fact, you need to go back to 2010: in the summer of the World Cup in South Africa and the vuvuzela, Limbo arrived on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC, in strict chronological order . The years that separate us from the first time we played Limbo are therefore eight, many in real life but practically an eternity considering the world of technology. A period of time that for a videogame involves the risk of having aged too much and of no longer being modern, but this is not the case with Limbo: picking it up to play it on the Nintendo console, the sensations you have are in fact identical to those try it in 2010. The effort of the Danish team is still more enjoyable than ever, which is why we do not wait for the final comment of the review to recommend Limbo to those who own Nintendo Switch and have not yet had the opportunity to play it so far. Story and gameplay: in search of the lost sister Counting the reviews of Limbo here on Multiplayer.it it is possible to identify three of them: that of the initial version for Xbox 360, that for Xbox One and the mobile one for iPhone. There are therefore several ways to refresh the history and dynamics of Limbo in more depth, so here we limit ourselves only to making a brief mention of what awaits those who play this title on Nintendo Switch for the first time. The plot of Limbo sees us engaged in the role of an unnamed boy who awakened in a forest from which the title of the game derives. In this place, the protagonist sets out in search of his sister, encountering difficulties along the way mainly represented by creatures and traps intending for some obscure reason to make him a party. The dynamics of Limbo are the classic ones of two-dimensional platformers, for which the Nintendo school was indicated as a source of inspiration at the time of Limbo's release: after so many years, it makes you smile a little to see this game come back right on a platform made by the Japanese company. Returning to the gameplay of Limbo, our character can run and jump, if necessary using some of the elements present in the scenario to solve puzzles. Except in rare cases, the latter do not offer a particular level of difficulty in terms of reasoning, but it is good to know that Limbo rests its foundations on old-school ~trial end error~ mechanics: it is therefore necessary to have a certain amount of patience to overcome the most difficult points, seeing death as a step to be taken to advance in the game and not as a failure. However, the presence of automatic checkpoints guarantees the possibility of resuming one's path from a reasonable point, without having to retrace entire levels before returning to the point of one's death. The conversion for Nintendo Switch Having made the due presentation for those unfamiliar with Limbo, let's see how this game behaves on Nintendo Switch. Playdead's debut effort fits perfectly in all its aspects with the characteristics of the console, to the point that it almost seems designed for it. The possibility of playing on a normal television at home is obviously one of the options available to the player, but in our opinion it is instead in the mobile configuration of the Nintendo Switch that Limbo manages to give its best. To understand the reasons, we need to take a look at the style given by Playdead to Limbo, a game with a unique atmosphere built on the presence of shadows (including the protagonist) that move on a screen where the image is made up of gray tones , without resorting to dialogue or other elements. A minimal experience, capable of generating a certain level of anguish in the player, corroborated by the bloody deaths that enemies and traps can reserve for our character. Lying in bed in the dark of your room therefore seems to us to be the best way to get fully involved in Limbo, enjoying the audio effects inserted by the developers with a pair of headphones but above all its soundtrack. By choice of design, the latter is never intrusive, but by sharpening the ear it becomes easy to understand how it contributes in a decisive way to making sure that the player does not feel at ease as he goes on in Limbo. Also in terms of quality of the conversion we have not found any defects: on Nintendo Switch everything works completely as usualtrue, remaining anchored at sixty frames per second without dips. No bugs have been received, confirming the quality work done on this new version of Limbo.", "date": "2018-07-05", "grade": "9.0"}
