{"name": "Nights: Journey of Dreams - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nights-journey-of-dreams-recensione.html", "text": "True to the past With this incarnation of Nights, the programmers evidently wanted to create a project based on fidelity and continuity, probably with the fear of annoying the fans of the Saturn edition or simply dictated by faith in the quality of a product capable of withstanding the test of time . And so also in this case, the plot revolves around two little boys - Will and Helen - who for different reasons are sucked into their own dreams; and it is in this fantastic world that they meet Nights, the androgynous hero and protagonist of the adventure. The development of the plot, we tell you right away, is the most banal, sugary and sincerely cloying that has appeared on the screens of the successful Nintendo console; being able to resist the dialogues and cutscenes represents a true test of strength that only the toughest-skinned players will be able to endure. For this we prefer to set aside this aspect, going directly to the actual game. For those who have not had the pleasure of playing the progenitor, it is enough to know that the essence of Nights lay in a simple but truly rewarding gameplay; in a nutshell it was a question of ~flying~ within a 3D world, but on a purely two-dimensional plane, from one end of the levels to the other, trying to get a good score by collecting blue spheres, passing through rings, eliminating enemies and making evolutions. Despite being compatible with the classic Saturn digital cross pad, the Sonic Team title was an opportunity for Sega to launch its first analog controller, which in this specific case was capable of giving greater depth to the overall experience. Similarly for its return, Nights offers a dual control scheme; the first, traditional, linked to the use of wiimote and nunchuk exactly as if it were a classic pad (and it is no coincidence that the Classic Controller or Gamecube pad can also be used in this sense). The second most innovative, leverages only the remote control using an on-screen cursor, which basically represents the point that the protagonist is called to follow in his movements. Unfortunately this last solution soon turns out to be so inaccurate and reactive as to lead to no possibility of returning to the alternative choice, which however - it must be said - does not offer any type of exploitation of the specific capabilities of the wiimote. Too many Nights for me We were talking about the programmers' desire to remain faithful to the original; and in fact in Journey of Dreams there are sections of levels in flight, just like in the beloved chapter for Saturn, which offer an experience practically identical to the one dated 1996. And, confirming its goodness, the latter still represent today the highlight of this Wii edition, guaranteeing a perfect balance between exploration, rhythm, challenge and pure fun. The boss fights also deserve applause, since they offer valid variations on the theme and enjoy particularly successful level design in practically every occasion. It is therefore a pity that the team responsible for the project wanted to expand and diversify the gameplay by adding a series of sections ranging from the descent on the rapids aboard a Nights-shaped dinghy (!!!), to puzzles of various kinds, to platform sections in which you take control of one of the two children and so on. Virtually none of these variations can be called successful, due to a series of defects that frankly call into serious question the capabilities of Sega and the Sonic Team today. A general lack of optimization and cleanliness is felt in every step, especially on the occasion of the aforementioned platform sections, really insipid and which suffer from wooden controls, an all-time low physics and a camera unable to follow the action worthily. More generally, it seems that the more than 10 years that have passed since the first episode have not been used to meditate on a real evolution of the franchise; Journey of Dreams rather appears as a product made in haste, with little passion, ~smart~ enough to attract the nostalgics of the Saturn era but unable to convey the same sensations, except in some rare situations. The multiplayer component offers some satisfaction, provided you avoid the battle mode and immediately switch to the flying race, which allows you to challenge an opponent on a good number of tracks and turns out to be quite fun. On the other hand, the My Dream section is negligible, a kind of Tamagotchi in which to raise the creatures collected during the main adventure; even its integration with the weather channel doesn't make a mode more interesting than aseems decidedly out of context. As for the technical component instead, Nights: Journey of Dreams manages to defend itself more than discreetly thanks to the artistic and stylistic direction borrowed from the progenitor; the polygons used are certainly not a record number, and the character models represent a weak point, but on the contrary the settings are really evocative, colorful and well done almost on all occasions. The musical accompaniment, as well as the sound effects, are very apt. Comment Nights: Journey of Dreams is frankly not the sequel we would have expected. Of the splendid episode dated 1996 it has in fact maintained the in-flight sections, the style and the atmosphere, and in fact through these aspects it is possible to appreciate the most valuable components of this chapter for Wii. But almost everything else, that is, what new has been added compared to the original concept, appears of a quality that is not up to par and helps to water down the gaming experience. Finally, a general lack of cleaning and optimization in various aspects of the gameplay closes the picture of a largely sufficient sequel, but which struggles to justify the more than 10 years that have passed since the chapter for Saturn and which confirms the distance between ~that~ Sega and the current one .
