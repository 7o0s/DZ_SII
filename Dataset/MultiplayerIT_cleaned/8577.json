So it was thanks to Electronic Arts who, moreover, for this edition, wisely decided to develop an expansion of FIFA 12 instead of a game in its own right as happened four years ago and for the version dedicated to the World Cup, at a cost of 19.99 euros on PlayStation 3 and 1800 Microsoft Points obviously on Xbox 360. However, lovers of low costs should not rejoice too much, where for example UEFA EURO 2008 brought various changes to graphics and gameplay, marking for many the most important trend reversal of the series towards the much acclaimed simulation today, UEFA EURO 2012 leaves practically intact these two aspects, focusing on the proposed contents. Once FIFA 12 has been launched (updated to version 1.04) and this DLC has been downloaded, a new item appears in the options menu, which allows access to the section dedicated to the upcoming European football championships. Official logos, graphics and music are all there, including the stadiums and of course the national teams that have participated since the qualifying rounds played in 2010 and 2011, for a complete package dedicated to all those eagerly awaiting this event. We were talking about content and of course the possibility of playing the European championship both online and offline, as well as friendlies and penalties with all the aforementioned logos, could not be missing; in addition there is the challenges section, a sort of ~scenarios~ based on real matches that must be completed starting from disadvantageous conditions as already seen several times in the past, but which will also be updated during the European competition and allow to earn points for the EA Sports Football Club. However, the real fortunes of this expansion are entrusted to the mode called Expedition, a real novelty that puts the player in charge of a new team made up of perfect and scarce strangers, with the exception of the only real player (or FIFA 12 virtual pro) who you can choose during creation. Playstation 3 trophies UEFA EURO 2012 offers ten new trophies, of which seven gold and three silver. Obtaining them is linked to winning the European Championship both offline and online, winning against every team in Expedition mode, collecting every piece of the Mosaic and so on; get ready for many hours of play to collect them all. Conquering Europe We have created Balotelli FC, which started from the European slums in a special qualifying group, within which you must first challenge a low-level first formation, such as the Faroe Islands, to then unlock the possibility of playing against other more European formations. competitive, even on other days, through roads that are literally unlocked from one's position to that of the opposing team. The nice thing is that the first time you win a game against the designated team you get a ~gift~ of a player in the stands instead of one to discard (but can be rejected), the second time a substitute and finally the third time a titular, also unlocking some pieces of a mosaic that is added among the collectibles. To obtain at least one strong starter for each national team present, it will therefore be necessary to play a minimum of 54 for 3 games, a value that can grow if it becomes the player's intention to earn every single element offered by the game or if he is not lucky in receiving the player in his own role liking: certainly a good element in the longevity evaluation phase. The idea behind Expedition is therefore very nice and there is a strong sense of progression on paper, however its balance would need to be reviewed because the progression itself is too slow and especially at the beginning it is not a little difficult to play again with a poor team after having already played so much with the original title. After all, as already mentioned, the gameplay remains that of FIFA 12, with its many advantages, such as tactical defense and full control over the players, and its defects, such as the presence of few fouls and not exactly memorable goalkeepers. In the light of these assessments, the main ~problem~ of UEFA EURO 2012 remains the price, 19.99 plus the need for the original game places this expansion a bit out of the market even compared to the rest of the stand-alone titles on PSN and XBLA. Its contents will certainly be appreciated by the most ardent fans of the game, not to mention the official license which, although not at the level of the World Cup or Champions League, has its effect, contenutes which, however, do not offer a decisive break with those already present in FIFA 12, whose players months after its release are more oriented towards online play than anything else.", "date": "2012-04-24", "grade": null}
