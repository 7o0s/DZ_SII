{"name": "Transistor", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/132137-transistor-quando-tutto-cambia-nulla-cambia.html", "text": "The rise of independent developers has now gone out of fashion and not for negative judgments of merit: now they are a reality especially on PC, but also with regard to the PlayStation platforms, Sony has shown its willingness to give space to titles published independently and created by small groups of people, who can often experience more and better than colleagues with large budgets. Precisely for this reason it is necessary to judge their productions without having (too many) special eyes, the market is saturated and there is no shortage of top-level exponents. With these due premises, the twelve that make up Supergiant Games created in 2011 that little pearl corresponding to the name of Bastion, which we have played on several occasions, always with a particular taste. Transistor wants to represent an evolution of the original idea and coincides with the desire to self-publish on PC and PlayStation 4, the platform we used to review the game. The setting moves into a digital world that recalls a mix between cyberpunk and a dystopian future dominated by technology: the citizens of Cloudbank can change the weather or order a pizza using special terminals, even buildings and entire sections can be created or unmade by robotic units called Process. A rather surreal thing, if you like, which sees the Orchestral as strong opponents, a group of people who want to give dignity to the process and stop these continuous changes. When everything changes, nothing changes and, as often happens in these situations, the end justifies the means, at the cost of reaping victims for what is seen as a supreme good. Transistor is the new work of the same creators of Bastion, but this time they have not exceeded start You are Red, an extremely famous singer in the Goldwalk district, who one evening suffers an attack and loses his voice, but manages to escape death thanks to the sacrifice of a dear friend of his, pierced by a very powerful sword and with particular powers. His name is Transistor and he has the ability to trap the soul of deceased people; thanks to the latest events, she remains next to the main protagonist, but she also becomes the target of the Orchestrals, who want her back to complete their goals. Here the game begins: a story of revenge that explores the relationship between the protagonist and Transistor, with a touch of romanticism and a political message that appears several times within the digital streets of Cloudbank. The developers have played a lot with computer science and programming, both from a visual point of view and as regards the actual names: with each level advancement or meeting with key characters in the story, Transistor is able to assimilate new functions, which have nomenclature very dear to those who program for hobby or passion, such as Breach or Get. Each function can be associated as a main attack to the DualShock 4 front buttons; alternatively, inserted as an upgrade (through special slots, to be unlocked) for other functions or as a passive skill; obviously the effects change based on the positioning and you need to experiment to obtain the most effective solutions. Each function uses a certain amount of memory and can only be installed in a Transistor if there is enough on the stack; Needless to say, it can be expanded by leveling up. A few notes on the interface. The skill bar is almost always visible in the bottom center, which has led the developers to place subtitles at the top of the screen. A choice that can be criticized because it leads to constantly raising the head and because in any case the icons of the enhancement functions are barely visible and unclear; at this point it would have been better to place the skills at the bottom right with the classic cross shape, and restore the subtitles in their common and ideal position. The same cumbersomeness is found when using the access points present within the Cloudbank to change the functions: we would have liked fewer steps rather than always having to exit and re-enter the dedicated menus, also because by changing the combinations it is possible to go deeper (unblocking pieces of biography) the story of the characters linked to each of them. Net of these criticisms, the upgrade system allows you to experiment with different solutions based on your style of play and the most effective results; the combat is in fact the real flagship of this production, because it alternates isometric clashes in real time, as already mentioned, with a sort of preventive planning in turns, necessary for the more demanding opponents because they attack cconsistently the main protagonist. Therefore, when the R2 key is pressed, time is interrupted and a time bar appears at the top: any action by Red consumes a portion of time, and until exhaustion it is possible to plan a series of moves in succession while the enemies remain (more or less) helpless. Once the effects of each attack have been assimilated, there is never the risk of interrupting the action too much, but rather this double system adds depth and fun, making combat one of the most successful elements of Transistor. There is no default difficulty setting, but as the level increases, you gain access to an increasing number of limiters, cells that empower your opponents and introduce penalties, but which in exchange allow you to gain more experience after each fight completed successfully. Playstation 4 trophies Transistor offers thirty trophies plus platinum, which is not common for downloadable titles, linked to the completion of the story, the unlocking of all features, limiters and biographies of the characters, the challenges. Getting them all is not a big problem, just finish the game twice and the most difficult ones are represented by some advanced challenges, which require complete mastery of the Transistor combat system. Return The available functions reach sixteen, and range between those related to more effective attacks from behind, the increase in power or defense, the possibility of attacking even in the planning reload phase, and so on; combining them, for example, you can become invisible while releasing rays that damage enemies, increase the number of rebounds of explosion grenades, create your own copy while fleeing from your opponent. There is no shortage of points of contact and deja vu with Bastion: the narrative voice different in form but not in substance, the backdoors in the levels that represent the challenges for each of the game's characteristics, the limiters that mimic the functionality of the idols to modify the difficulty to your liking. Where Transistor differs is in the narrative evolution, even more linear and mature, and in the decidedly more structured, complex and enjoyable combat. From an artistic point of view, the work done by Supergiant Games is excellent, the main protagonist and all the characters are drawn with a more pleasant and mature trait than in Bastion; the aesthetic softness of the setting blends with bright but not aggressive colours; the result is really nice to look at, and the style adopted has an out of the ordinary personality. The 1080p resolution adds clarity to the image, and the 60 frames per second makes it nice on the go; only on a couple of occasions did we notice some uncertainty, when there was a zoom that widened the field of view. In fights, the graphics engine does not flinch, even if there is a good visual confusion following the combined attacks, when it is not easy to understand what is happening. The title is dubbed in English with Transistor's voice identical to that of Bastion, only more metallic, while the subtitles are also available in Italian; the soundtrack and Ashley Barrett's voice add a further level of atmosphere to the production and complete a technical package on which only fine words can be spent. What's wrong with Transistor, then? The story, despite being told well thanks also to the quality of the dubbing and the technical sector, is quite confusing in the first few bars and takes the upper hand too much in the final part. The ending is full of meaning but several supporting actors are sketched and the whole is quite linear, without twists and turns that could have been enhanced even by the style adopted. Furthermore, beyond the fights, the gameplay shows unexpressed potential and is reduced to moving from one point to another even with discreet backtracking: right in the initial stages, the use of the Turn() planning bar provides a small environmental puzzle in the which two devices must be activated ~simultaneously~; we got excited thinking about the possibilities of having several puzzles that exploit this feature, and instead we found none, the game is purely composed of fights to break up an exploration in turn at the service of the narrative. We completed Transistor in about four hours; it is possible to play the classic new game + (called Recursion) which allows you to maintain all the skills and level of Red, as well as complete the aspects of the plot left unfinished. Even with the addition of the challenges the content is not enough to justifycompletely irate the price of 20, which these days is absolutely ~premium~ for productions of this kind.", "date": "2014-05-22", "grade": "7.9"}
