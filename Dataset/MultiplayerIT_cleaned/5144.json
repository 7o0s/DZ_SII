The skill test earned him entry into the DedSec of San Francisco, a group determined to reveal to the world the shady business of the ruthless multinational which, using ctOS 2.0, usually registers people, spying on their preferences for commercial purposes and even guide their political choices. With a view to a new and colorful crew, made up of very particular people, Marcus therefore dedicates himself to completing missions of various kinds around the Bay Area, with the ultimate aim of getting the group a sufficient number of followers to share the computing power needed to hack the enemy's servers and publicly expose their misdeeds. This is the incipit of Watch Dogs 2, the new action adventure developed by Ubisoft, which arrives on PC two weeks after its release on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. A wait well rewarded? Let's find out together. Watch Dogs 2 is splendid to see on PC, thanks to a well-done conversion and a rich sandbox Less obscure but richer Watch Dogs 2 distances itself from the first episode of the series in various respects, given that the protagonists and the scenario completely change; but it is in particular the tone of the plot that surprises: Aiden Pearce was acting out of revenge against those who had caused his granddaughter's death and was using technology as a mere tool for his own ends, while Marcus wants to destroy Blume more on principle, although the aggressive profiling used by the company is earned an unjust conviction a few years earlier. The assumptions change, the general atmosphere changes and, we can say, the narrative doesn't benefit much from it, although this time the supporting actors enjoy a much more successful characterization, especially the mysterious and crazy Wrench. However, the shortcomings from the point of view of history are compensated by a map twice the size of the original Chicago, which includes not only the city of San Francisco but also areas such as Marin, Oakland, Civic and Silicon Valley; and more multifaceted and interesting gameplay mechanisms, especially thanks to the introduction of drones, which significantly increase the strategic rate of the action. The approach is actually not far from that of the first Watch Dogs, but the things to do and see have increased. The secondary missions are particularly convincing, thanks to a design that has nothing to envy to the main quests, indeed often harbingers of fascinating experiments. Skills and growth The probability of completing missions in Watch Dogs 2 goes hand in hand with the growth of our character, who can unlock new skills through a rich tree, using the experience points earned on the field to get more immediate hacking of any type of vehicle, improve your combat skills, add functionality to hack enemy phones and even activate security protocols or give false tips to gangs to quickly get rid of an uncomfortable target. The plot, as mentioned, does not take off and even on PC there is an annoying leveling audio busted of the dialogues during some cutscenes (especially the first ones), but the abundance of all the rest and the solidity of the system, which arises as the natural evolution of the first chapter, they certainly turn a blind eye to these shortcomings. In short, the vast amount of vehicles that we can ~borrow~ on the streets of the city, the discreet arsenal and the many easter eggs paint the picture of an engaging and exciting experience, designed more for a stealth approach than for head-on collisions (in fact the gunplay is not astounding, on the contrary), and in this sense decidedly successful. The guards who patrol the ~prohibited areas~ are in fact quite cunning, they quickly call for reinforcements and tend to surround us strong in the fact that the state of alert will not return until after a few minutes. Resisting their blows is practically impossible and there are no upgrades that can harden our skin, so we will have to take care of planning very well, especially using the drones we mentioned earlier, to activate environmental traps and silently knock out enemies, one at a time. The dynamic multiplayer Unlike the console version, which initially had problems in this regard, on PC the dynamic multiplayer of Watch Dogs 2 works immediately and without problems. The approach chosen by the developers is interesting, as they have included a series of activities that fit together in a transparent waynte with the single player action, signaling us missions that we can complete in cooperation with other users or targets that we must try to hack before they leave our position. There is also a more structured mode, ~Bounty Hunter~: a sort of frenetic one-on-all in which the wanted man must flee from other players and the police. The PC version We are by now well used to the delay of Ubisoft titles on PC compared to consoles, so we have sympathetically welcomed the news that the game would have landed on the Windows platform on November 29th instead of the 15th. Of course, we are talking about a franchise that has a very particular story, given the obvious downgrade to which they subjected the first chapter to cope with the cross-platform release. The surprise was therefore great when, having launched the title at 4K and with all the effects at their maximum, we found ourselves playing the early stages of the campaign at about forty frames per second; all the more reason because the test configuration is certainly not the best solution to easily manage Ultra HD content. The mystery was then revealed when, having completed Marcus' ~test by fire~ at the Blume headquarters, we looked out over the huge open world of the Bay Area, accusing in that case quite evident drops in fluidity, given the richness of the setting and the resulting load on the GPU. However, the excellent initial sensation remained, as at the resolution of 4096 x 2160 pixels the gaming experience on PC with a not even overclocked GTX 1070 is slightly lower than what is available on PlayStation 4 Pro, net of the substantial difference in terms of detail and effect. So it's true, we often descend into the terrain of 20-25 frames per second, especially in the more populated areas of the map and during changes of direction by car, but the vertical synchrony maintains consistency in the scrolling of the frames and therefore one does not feel a severe jerky sensation. The reasons behind this ~weight~ are to be found not only in the very high number of pixels on the screen, but also and above all in the presence of an additional pack of high-resolution textures weighing 6 GB (it is possible to choose whether to download it or not, in any case), designed especially for 4K, and in the possibility of activating a series of extra details. The options are actually very numerous and allow you to adjust the experience according to the configuration we have: ranging from the aforementioned resolution to vertical synchrony, from supersampling to the field of view, passing through geometry, extra details, terrain, vegetation, textures, texture filters, shadows, headlight shadows, water, reflections, screen space reflections, fog, depth of field, motion blur and bloom. Added to this are the options relating to antialiasing, with the possibility of selecting the temporal one for a lower load but excellent results, perhaps in combination with the graceful FXAA for NVIDIA cards. Precisely, many fine adjustments that draw the picture of a conversion made with some care, whose limits in terms of performance depend almost entirely on the greater visual quality compared to the console edition, which appears evident when observing the sharpness of surfaces and projections on the ground. So let's get back down to earth: to play on the test PC with a frame rate approaching 60 frames per second, you need to opt for 1440p and perhaps lower the quality of the shadows slightly. It is a pity that there is not, in practice, an ultra combination capable of ensuring granite fluidity, but this happens due to the substantial difference between the situations in which we move on foot, which are handled with agility even at 4K, and those in which we take a car and launch ourselves into a furious chase, sequences that are obviously more demanding from a computational point of view. However, we would like to say that the work done by Ubisoft for the PC version of Watch Dogs 2 is commendable, especially when compared with the previous experiences of the French company, and considering that further refinements could further improve the situation.", "date": "2016-12-01", "grade": "8.5"}
