{"name": "Golf Club Wasteland", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/golf-club-wasteland-recensione.html", "text": "The Earth is in ruins. Human beings have made it completely unlivable and have moved en masse to a new planet, Mars, under the supervision of a multinational company called not too casually Tesla. Over the years the super rich of the red planet have started returning to the carcass of their old world to play golf. Already the image of someone who fights boredom by throwing balls into the hole on the corpse of his house, where billions of people have died, has something disturbing, but, as we will see in the review of Golf Club Wasteland, it is not satisfied with offering a mannered cynicism and manages to do much more: to tell the collapse of humanity. Game mechanics The game atmosphere is really melancholy The game mechanics of Golf Club Wasteland are very simple and follow those of many similar titles (thought of Golf on Mars, just to name a few): the protagonist, a pot-bellied astronaut of whom we initially know nothing, must hit the ball with his golf club by making the hole in as few shots as possible. The action is framed horizontally, with the hole being shown by an initial pan and then becoming freely viewable. Of course our unnamed golfer will always be where the ball is positioned and, after each shot, will fly with his jetpack to reach it. To shoot just hold down the left mouse button and drag it to decide the strength and direction of the shot. The stronger the shot, the more inaccuracy it increases, represented by the flickering of the interface. That's all. There are no clubs to swap or other internal factors to consider, such as golfer characteristics. In short, we are faced with a very simple title to play, at least from the side of the controls. To be complicated, often very complicated, are the holes, which soon reveal one of the hidden nature of Golf Club Wasteland: that of a real puzzle game. Apart from the first courses, which are quite linear, the following ones represent challenges that have little to do with golf and a lot to do with observing and controlling the ball, once you understand where to send it. In fact, the player is often not only called to make a hole, but also to find the best route to reach it, between platforms to exploit with millimeter shots, ramps to avoid, elevators to catch on the fly, buildings to climb, buttons to press, balconies to climb, little animals that steal the ball to avoid and many other amenities, which often make it a real feat to reach the end of the course in the shots established for par. In any case, it is possible to play without a maximum number of shots, in a sort of narrative mode in which, if necessary, it is also possible to skip the holes that are causing us too much difficulty. narrative side The Earth is in ruins To be honest as a golf game Golf Club Wasteland is not very successful. Indeed, it often becomes really frustrating, yet at a certain point it begins to exert an almost hypnotic charm on the player, who ends up letting himself be carried away by his deep melancholy and by the narrative crescendo managed with great skill. The involvement is so much that continuing to play golf becomes an excuse to continue following the story. We try to explain ourselves better. The title of Demagog Studio combines three different narrative techniques. The first is the purely environmental one: we are playing golf on a completely ruined planet, where buildings and infrastructures, once the glory of our species, have become silent tombstones that warn against the madness that has led those who could afford it. From this point of view, the developers have done a great job to make the game world decadent and desolate, creating a very strong natural contrast with the activity we are carrying out (playing golf, in case you missed it). If they had limited themselves to this gimmick, however, they would have made the experience quite poor, holding back on that petty cynicism we were talking about above. Our golfer is completely alone Here comes the second narrative idea: the protagonist listens all the time to a Martian radio, called Radio Nostalgia From Mars, which tells the life of humans on the red planet. The radio broadcasts, which are made up of interviews, musical pieces, government announcements, live testimonies, memories of the Earth and appeals to the population, make the atmosphere of the game even more pregnant, giving us the background of what happened and filling the paths of ghosts (metaphorically speaking), evoked by the voices of people millions of kilometers away. So let's listen to the wordsof the survivors and we imagine we are playing between what were their homes, their places of work, the places where they went on vacation. We listen to the propaganda of the power that controls Mars, which tries to hide the problems that oppress the colonies behind sinister rhetoric. We listen to the nostalgia of humans for a planet that no longer exists and on which they have left everything they held most dear. Everyone has lost some affection, without exception. And we play golf. Here comes the third narrative technique, which if you like is also the one that leads to the most surprising result. Small events happen during the holes, linked to a mysterious and unidentified narrative voice, to which the game initially does not seem to give much weight. Some holes are very intricate Gradually however, these become more and more frequent and begin to reveal the identity of our character, making him evolve and giving him strong motivations. At the beginning of the game it is inevitable to perceive him as a kind of embodiment of the cynicism of power. After all, who wouldn't consider inhuman an individual who chose to pay a lot of money to play a wealthy sport like golf on the remains of his old world? Yet never as in this case are we faced with a smoke screen raised to distract us, which is thinned hole after hole, revealing in the clumsy avatar that we are controlling an unexpected humanity. Slowly the three narratives merge, with the environmental story and the radio broadcasts that make up its story, whose threads are knotted again after the end of the game, with the release of a diary in which images and words finally explain who he is the golfer and why he is there. The color palette used is excellent Faced with the truth, everything we have seen and done takes on a different, higher and deeper meaning than the initial expectations created by the game itself. It is here that it also becomes possible to re-read the sporting side of the title, with the holes that end up taking on a very different function from the one they have in other golf games: they don't have to challenge the player to see who gets the best score, but they have to slow him down to allow the story to flow naturally. Too simple holes would have prevented such an accurate environmental description and would have forced cuts in radio transmissions. By making them very intricate the developers wanted to buy time, i.e. make sure that in the first game players don't rush towards the end missing large chunks of what the game has to say. It was certainly a risky choice, but it cannot be said that it did not pay off in terms of overall experience.", "date": "2021-09-03", "grade": "8.5"}
