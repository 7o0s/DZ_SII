{"name": "Puzzle Quest 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/puzzle-quest-3-recensione-del-nuovo-ibrido-tra-puzzle-e-rpg.html", "text": "About fifteen years ago, Infinite Interactive had a brilliant idea: why not try to mix the classic match-three puzzle mechanic with fantasy RPG? Thus was born the first chapter of a series which then had considerable success, finally arriving at this latest evolution which we examine in the review of Puzzle Quest 3. As often happens, increasing success is not exactly matched by a general improvement of the game, which on the contrary, it followed a somewhat uncertain parable with the progressive fading of the originality that characterized the progenitor and the establishment of a sort of canon sealed by the birth of a real franchise complete with a licensed cross-over. The brilliance of Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords got a bit lost over the years, after the excellent Puzzle Quest 2, then tarnished in a series of darker digressions such as Magic: The Gathering Puzzle Quest and Marvel Puzzle Quest. In the meantime, along the way it met the inevitable free-to-play mechanics and from this fusion it is easy to understand immediately what could have come out and why this third official chapter cannot be considered up to the first two. the gameplay works well as usual: there is always that physiological attraction towards the association of colored gems that seems to be inherent in some way with the human psyche and how much this merges with typical RPG progression elements is further enhanced . The ingenious basic idea remains valid and is confirmed as pleasant as always, moreover framed in an even more accurate technical realization and with various additional details, but the excellent general picture is soiled by the typical deteriorating tendencies of free-to-play that push the grinding, to expectations and finally to in-app purchases, to unbalance everything. It's a shame because Puzzle Quest 3 is packaged well, with nice 3D graphics and interesting characterization, but the changes made to gameplay and progression feel more like an involution than anything else. Puzzle hit fights Puzzle Quest 3, a screenshot of a fight Puzzle Quest 3 is basically a linear role-playing game based on fighting and collecting loot, also characterized by a certain narrative basis and the presence of quests and sub-quests to complete. After choosing your character from among five available classes, each with its own particular statistics and abilities (assassin, necromancer, paladin, berserker and shaman), you set off to discover the world by facing fights and interlude phases with dialogues between the characters . The gameplay is essentially divided between puzzle-based clashes and the management of the protagonist, which requires immersion in various menus for the upgrading and evolution of equipment, statistics and skills. The puzzle takes place on a 5x7 grid occupied by colored gems and skulls that can be associated by shape and color starting from 3, but greater quantities of elements can be aligned by increasing the power of the attacks: by putting the skulls together, physical blows are made, while the gems are elemental blows that also charge magical attacks, to be launched at the right moment. In the background, we see the turn-based battle with the enemies, which obviously takes place according to the progress of the puzzle. Puzzle Quest 3, one. intermission scene with dialogue between the characters It is possible to make several combinations together in the same turn and one of the novelties of this third chapter is the presence of a timer which requires you to perform the associations within a few seconds, slightly increasing the pace of the game and the need to act with timing and precision. Another variation in the puzzle mechanics is noted, in this case decidedly less positive: the opponent does not share, as in the previous chapters, the same grid that we use. This means that the gem association only applies to us, while the enemy is limited to attacking on a standard linear basis, taking away an important tactical element from the gameplay. In the previous chapters we had in fact to be careful not to provide advantages to the opponent in moving the gems and to exploit every possible combination more carefully during our turn, transforming the clash into a real chess game, which was completely suppressed in Puzzle Quest 3. RPG and character management Puzzle Quest 3 character select screen Beyond the puzzle phase of the fight, the rest of the time is spent on character management, which occupies a large part of the game and is also the one on which the most critical elements relate, linked to the free-to-play mechanisms. In addition to'level increase of the character and the conquest of weapons, armor and magic, obtaining materials and specific stones you can make upgrades and evolutions for each of these categories. Considering that the possibility of defeating an enemy largely depends on the value achieved by the player in terms of character level and equipment, it is clear how progression is inextricably linked to the evolution mechanisms of these elements, not to mention PvP ( however minor element) which can easily lead to a pay to win. All the significant rewards, from weapons to materials for the upgrade, are obtained above all through the chests at the end of the battles, but to open them it is necessary to use rare keys, spend gems or send minions to complete missions. The first two ways essentially fall into microtransactions, because they are only rarely obtained by playing and can instead be easily purchased with real money, while the third is the ~free~ way, but it also requires very long waits. Another problem is the fact that only some chests can be kept to be opened later, with further slots only being purchased through VIP membership. It is easy to see in all of this a complex mechanism aimed at spending money in some way, between VIP access and micro-transactions necessary to cut the long waits.", "date": "2022-03-10", "grade": "6.8"}
