{"name": "Wasteland 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wasteland-3-recensione.html", "text": "Cruel and ruthless like the eternal winter that seems to have hit Colorado, but at the same time cleaned up of those aspects that made the second chapter cumbersome, Wasteland 3 is a game that doesn't waste time with introductions and immediately catapults us into the heart of the adventure. He conquered us effortlessly, with a new setting that manages to expertly mix the desolation of a post-apocalyptic world with a nature ready to take back what belongs to it. Above all, however, it hit the mark with such a grotesque atmosphere (you will see blood and entrails almost everywhere) yet at the same time able to leave us constantly alert, because when desperation speaks first you never know how a conversation: of the series, one hand on the hat to salute and one on the butt of the gun to be sure. What everyone wondered on seeing this change of scenery was what prompted the Rangers to leave Arizona to enter a territory that was even more hostile and dangerous than theirs already was. It is soon said. The enemy of my enemy The Rangers defeated the Cochise artificial intelligence but the price was high: survival is getting more and more difficult and the only hope seems to come from Colorado, to be precise from the Patriarch. We know little about this man at the beginning, except that he needs the assistance of the Rangers to resolve some conflicts aimed at destabilizing his leadership on the territory. In return, he will offer Arizona everything it needs not to succumb. It is a one-way situation, where the Rangers have no say in whether to accept or not, so a convoy leaves for Colorado Springs but the situation escalates while crossing a frozen lake. Surprisingly decimated by one of the many hostile factions in the area, very few of them manage to get to the other side alive and meet the Patriarch: obviously, we are among them. Unlike the previous one, Wasteland 3 allows us at the beginning of the game to create not one but two characters, or choose pre-existing models. We chose the first option and after giving life to our Rangers (an assault soldier inclined towards leadership and a medical sniper who however acts as a lone wolf, just because we like opposites) we reached the Patriarch in what would have been our future base of operations. Here we were given a summary of the ~political~ situation, if the chaos that reigns in Colorado can be defined as such, and after once again accepting to offer him the requested help, we were left free to explore not only Colorado Springs - on whose borders our headquarters is located - but the whole surrounding area. All kinds of dangers await us here, warring factions for which we are only one more obstacle, terrifying creatures modified by radiation and of course robots. There's something for everyone as we try to survive in a hostile land torn apart by an internal struggle between the Patriarch and his own children. The perfect storm Frost, wind and thunder are some of the problems that afflict Colorado, trapped in an eternal winter, but there are also areas with a medium or high rate of radioactivity that make exploration impossible at least until our faithful crawler (Kodiak) does not will be well equipped. Even so, however, the degree of initial exploration remains very extensive, with secondary missions that reveal themselves depending on the area in which we are driving, surprise attacks, new areas and so on; it is even possible to find itinerant peddlers, who will disappear after talking to them and then reappear elsewhere.As always happens in RPGs, we prioritized everything except the main mission, getting involved in a dense network of side tasks that they seemed to never end, linking up with each other on the basis of the approach we decided to have with them: although in fact in Colorado the most desired option is to let the weapons speak the language first, we immediately understood that in Wasteland 3 it is preferable to act more using your head. There are many, many situations in which diplomacy is essential to get out of it in the best possible way, forging alliances that may even turn out to be temporary but in that moment they manage to give us a few more minutes of life, avoiding our bones from mixing with all those whose Colorado is already dotted. This brings us straight to team building. One hand washes the other As any RPG knows, it's impossible to create a character who can do everything and not abbia faults, because in trying to do so he would come out weakened even on what should be his strengths. For this Wasteland 3 offers us seven characters, five of which are Rangers while the last two are support characters that we can recruit from the various NPCs in the game - provided we can get their help. Once again, we can decide whether to create them ad hoc or choose from a preset variety: regardless of what you want to do, it is essential to create a team that is as homogeneous as possible, able to cover their respective weaknesses because the obstacles are many and different from each other . In the same mission you may need an excellent burglar, an artificer and also a tough nut to crack who knows how to put anyone who tries to be the right bully in their place because they have a bigger weapon than ours. The beauty of Wasteland 3 is exactly this , the unpredictability that awaits us around every corner and the variety of solutions with which to overcome an obstacle. True, sometimes we are left with no choice but to put our hands on weapons, but beyond a healthy level up why always risk your life when you can go through the back door and still get results? Therefore, focusing on creating characters that are similar but at the same time different from each other is part of the fun. Above all, it is essential to distribute the armaments (and consequently the skills) in such a way that, put together, the team is efficient with every type of weapon available but above all does not find itself having multiple elements that use the same type: resources they are something precious in Colorado, especially with regard to ammunition which has a significant cost, to vary means to survive longer. Finally, an added value is given by the modifications to weapons and armor, therefore having one or two experts in this sense helps to rebalance the clashes as far as possible. At a purely role-playing level, the structure has remained almost the same as in the previous chapter, just a few value merged here and there and logistical clarifications to make the game more immediate: we therefore find the standard attributes, skills and perks - the latter active or passive, some of which are exclusive and obtainable in game by performing certain actions. In short, those who were familiar with Wasteland 2 will once again feel at home, made even more comfortable by a much more immediate use, also as regards the inventory, now bottomless and shared by the whole team. A panacea, especially if you are shameless looters like us and you pocket everything, even socks that now have a life of their own, just to resell. Combat system While it has mellowed in some respects, Wasteland 3 is still unforgiving even on normal difficulty. As far as the combat system is concerned, forget the single timeline within which the individual units were interspersed on the basis of their initiatives: this time everything takes place in two single shifts, ally and enemy, which allow for better organization of the battle and better use intelligent of the surrounding space thanks to the covers, as XCOM teaches. The maneuvers are therefore more elaborate, giving rise to clashes that can last even half an hour if the opponents are many and particularly fierce. While being slightly more permissive than the previous one, it will not be uncommon to find yourself in fights which, in spite of equal level, or even a slight advantage in this sense on our part, end in total defeat: the enemies are often better equipped than us, more resilient, stronger, more everything. In this sense, we sometimes turn up our noses a little because missions ~with the green light~ (i.e. those for which the conditions are totally in our favour) have in any case given us the facing opponents capable of exterminating almost the entire team. It's part of Colorado's unpredictability and danger, no doubt, but given how difficult it is to find good gear as long as you don't put yourself at risk often, there is sometimes the feeling that Wasteland 3 is overly forbidding - this in one mode where friendly fire is disabled, we don't imagine the carnage on more demanding difficulties. Beyond this, direct confrontation always remains the last solution because there are many ways to circumvent it and come back to it later; or, as happens when traveling in the outside world, solving any ambushes without a hit while we are heading towards the objective of a mission. RPG to the core Between exploration and fights to the death, very large space is obviously given to the so-called chiacchiera: there is a lot of talk in Wasteland 3 (those who do not speak English well could find themselves in difficulty) and potential catastrophes are often avoided thanks to diplomacy. Spending skill points to become smarter, pimps, nerds, or even just people you shouldn't mess with sometimes proves more essential than improving yourself in combat: why draw your gun when you can use your tongue? This is not always synonymous with success, even when the required conditions are met, since as we said the game thrives on unpredictable characters who, despite everything, could decide to face us head on but even so the game can be worth the candle: in fact it is not to exclude that our words have negative effects on the enemies, inflicting them with altered states at the beginning of the fight and therefore putting us in an immediate advantageous position. Needless to say, since it is an RPG the ramifications of the dialogues are many and each can lead to different outcomes, not only in the immediate but also in the long term: we have come across a few times in situations where our previous actions spoke for us and we were judged on the basis of them. Overall, how we choose to act toward the people of Colorado will grow our reputation and, with it, recognition by the people. Some may have heard of us and be inclined to listen to us, others more hostile for the same reason may want to flee without a fight - and it really happened, an exhilarating situation if we consider that our team was on the brink at that moment of the collapse and would not have sustained a further clash. What makes everything better are the dialogues and in this sense we see that Microsoft's money has done very well for the production: there is no character equal to the others and everyone we talk to, even if we don't have to remember the names because they are several, leaves behind a particular memory either for the cadence, for the way of addressing or small but fundamental details that make this portion of Colorado a varied and always pleasant environment to discover, despite death waiting around every corner. Home Sweet Home The development of the character from an intellectual point of view, which as you may have understood can be declined in various ways, is especially useful for facing those conversations useful for recruiting an exclusive character within the team. It's not just about fighters but essential resources for expanding the base: in fact, if our headquarters can function with the most basic divisions (armoury, infirmary, logistics, garage and prisons), recruiting new characters can either give support to the sections just mentioned or even open new ones and expand the structure. For example, why deprive yourself of the pleasure of a bar to get drunk after a mission? New areas may even mean new squad members to recruit, as some may only reveal themselves after meeting certain - and unknown - conditions. Above all, after giving them a chance in this ~extended family~ it is not excluded that they can teach us a unique skill that we would not get in other ways. In short, the base is an essential element in Wasteland 3 both from a practical point of view (improvements of the Kodiak, free treatments and so on) and from a logistical point of view regarding the improvement of our own characters. Each new location we explore could hide a self an NPC to recruit for headquarters, motivating us even more in both exploration and in the intellectual development of our own characters so they can convince them to join us. Technical details The first impact with Wasteland is precisely from a graphic point of view: enormous strides have been made compared to the previous one, despite some small imperfections here and there due to the Unity engine, for example fluctuating textures, models that are not always up to par and sometimes the animations themselves do not convince. Despite everything, we're still talking about an RPG with an isometric view, so it's the composition as a whole that counts and Wasteland 3 in this sense is a small moving picture; decadent and post apocalyptic but still a picture, with particle effects that make everything even more beautiful and small solutions such as the breath of the wind capable of giving life to everything. In some cases, during the dialogues, the camera moves to offer us a Fallout-style close-up, something that has never been seen before in the series and we welcome it with pleasure. Saying it almost seems like a betrayal of the previous two titles but Colorado captured us much more than Arizona did, in part", "date": "2020-08-26", "grade": "8.8"}
