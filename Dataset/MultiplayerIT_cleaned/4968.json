{"name": "Harvestella", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/harvestella-recensione.html", "text": "In this 2022, Harvestella represents a bit the new course of Square Enix in terms of publisher of apparently minor titles, but in reality absolutely prominent in terms of gameplay. If it is true that the Japanese giant includes intellectual properties of great weight in the videogame panorama, it is also correct to state that an endless series of products with a more modest media value live under the same umbrella, albeit characterized by a real and pulsating soul. Harvestella stands as a further link in a chain that is rather simple to read: Square Enix is profoundly differentiating its production, entrusting to software that we could define as ~Single-A~ the task of representing the many talents who coexist, perhaps tarnished by the media, within the famous ~Home of JRPGs~. We are faced with a farming simulation JRPG, one of those category joints that rely on experienced authors to blend genres without betraying their central core. Let's see if Square-Enix has succeeded in the attempt in our review of Harvestella. Amnesiacs and aliens in armour The character design of Harvestella is inspired, with faces well drawn and able to keep hooked in their development The narrative incipit is certainly not the most original, but it serves as an introduction: our protagonist, created with a very spartan editor, wakes up in a village with no memory, in the middle of a phenomenon known as Quietus, which happens between the seasons and kills everything in its path. It doesn't take much to reach the first village, where you can get to know the characters you chat with in the early parts of the adventure and discover that the meteorite that crashed nearby was carrying a being in armour, known as Omen, reputed to be evil and responsible of the Quietus by the villagers. The Omen will turn out to be a girl from the future, also with a poor memory, but determined to find out how the crystal near the village called Seaslight has to do with her personal history. The beginning of Harvestella is certainly very, very JRPG, rather slow in its execution, with a particularly cadenced rhythm, seasoned with frequent narrative stops (such as often going to sleep). The story takes a while to get going: consider that we counted 5 hours just to reach the first semi-boss, in what is the first - rather simple - dungeon of the plot and still the feeling was of being in the middle of a long tutorials. Probably, you will discover all that the game has to offer not before about ten hours, a much longer period than the average. The time spent, however, has a non-trivial implication: the seraphic calm of the narrative allows us to deepen and breathe the rather peculiar atmosphere of Harvestella, in a stylistic mix between Bravely Default and Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles. The reference to fairy tales is palpable, thanks to a delicate palette, to fairy-tale environments and bedtime story situations, however constantly soiled by the awareness of a background malaise of the setting given precisely by the Quietus. The rarefied air is present in the villages and cities, in the dungeons, in the external world (not open world) that connects the environments, all marked by the passage of time that regulates some routines of the characters and the need, late at night, to go to sleep. That of Harvestella is a plot that sinks into a set of elements attributable to today's environmental theme, respect for diversity and pollution, with a cast of characters that are certainly not among the most charismatic ever, but capable of accompanying with ease in a world that it does not shy away from its own mystery. Walking around the field The simulation part of Harvestella has its limits, but the satisfaction of seeing carrots and onions grow is always nice If we wanted to divide Harvestella into parts, the farm simulator one is certainly the largest: the basic logic is that commanding the main character costs effort and to recover energy you have to eat, filling your stomach. In the event that we are unable to feed ourselves, we will have to give up running, dodging and many other beautiful, quite fundamental things. Why, however, deprive yourself of the pleasure of cultivating your own field in the headquarters, in a beautiful forest, with land to plow and sow and ponds to fish? The core of Harvestella's more simulative gameplay is in the constant dedication towards planting, selling the crop, searching for more important seeds, stockpiling fish, timber, metals and so on. Not to mention all the part more properly linked to the creation, be it of dishes in the kitchen, tools or other. Harvestella offers a worldor exterior that acts more as a bridge between settings than really explorable structures We are not talking about complex gameplay, yet rewarding in its simplistic essence and aimed at keeping us standing in the dungeons. Despite a slow start here too, it will be moving forward that the sense of progress in this part will prove to be fun. There will come a point where you will take possession of a fairy book, a kind of huge to-do list to get rewards and constantly improve your money factory and become a farming machine. Of course, don't expect anything particularly complex: the simulation part is an addendum to the JRPG component, something more with which to entertain, relax and get money and products out of it to advance in the main part, the real role-playing game. Harvestella, on the other hand, does not shine in the part relating to the simulation of life in the villages: the characters are very static in the same places and the feeling is that of the typical JRPG in which everyone is waiting for us exactly where they have always been, without giving that idea of a moving village . On the other hand, the friendship system is nice, thanks to which you can deepen your ties with specific quests and have access to peculiar objects and stat increases. Rudiments of combat A fight of Harvestella The other part is that of JRPG action, in which to venture into battle scenarios with visible enemies, real-time combat, skills and shortcuts. Again, Harvestella presents a dish with the ingredients you expect, but their development and management is rather streamlined, as well as not too layered. Apart from an often somewhat anonymous flow of fights, it is the structure of the dungeons that knows a bit of what has already been seen, drawing liberally from a list of JRPG clichs that seem to want to speak to those who have played few of them. A system of Jobs and skills intervenes to differentiate the builds, trying to mess up the cards with elemental weaknesses and special moves. Attention, everything also works, the important thing is to approach it knowing that the density of the offer is that. Square-Enix has opted for a soft approach, almost as if to fill the combat system with a sweet and muffled air, corroborated by the usual mechanism for upgrading weapons and building a team controlled by artificial intelligence. It almost makes you smile, knowing which publisher is, to see the rather short extension of the trees of each Job, once again a symptom of a publisher's desire to speak to the less experienced, perhaps less accustomed to action JRPGs. A glimpse of Harvestella In each dungeon you can expect to have to teleport back to the beginning and then to sleep, as it is unlikely that you can do it in a single day of play: therefore it becomes more of a hunt for the shortcut, in a landscape that still manages to remain dignified on the artistic profile. Speaking of technique, it is evident that the offer is in line with a smaller production: models, textures, resolution, framerate are all average elements, they do not shine but they are not disturbing either. Of course, it is legitimate to expect much more from Nintendo Switch, now almost used as an excuse than as a console to be exploited. In portable mode as in fixed, the resolution is unfortunately rather low, with an evident difference in detail between the interface and the game that makes some scenes a bit blurry. Considering that the animations are certainly nothing complex and that the artificial intelligence does not have who knows what advanced management, we simply believe that it would have taken a little more time to optimize everything. Thumbs up instead for the soundtrack, well packaged and inspired on the wings of a dreamy atmosphere, in line with the feeling of Harvestella, so expertly straddling fairy tale and reality.", "date": "2022-11-08", "grade": "7.2"}
