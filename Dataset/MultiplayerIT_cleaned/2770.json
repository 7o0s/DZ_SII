The remastered version of the brilliant progenitor shows us how Keita Takashi's idea is now destined for immortality, thanks to a delightful ~lowpoly~ graphic design and a gameplay that simply works and will work forever, provided that the porting of the turn is up to the original idea. Let's find out together, through our review of Katamari Damacy Reroll, if even in this case things went as imagined, expected and hoped for. Nannaaa, nananananananna Katamari Damacy! Beautiful Damacy Katamari Damacy is now one step away from becoming a classic, and classics are not discussed. You can't, for example, make fun of the indestructible Pac-Man, the legendary Space Invaders, just as you can't criticize the first Tetris on Game Boy. In a certain sense, it would be like changing the punctuation of the Promessi Sposi, questioning Leopardi for the metrics of his sorrowful poems. What do you want to criticize about Katamari Damacy? What do you want to say to a game, a game in the truest sense of the word that before anything else, even before entertaining, even manages to make you feel good? Nothing, here's the answer: you can't tell him anything. Because Katamari, and consequently also this Katamari Damacy Reroll, has a unique quality: it is therapeutic. In this game, for those who don't know yet, a sphere called katamari is rolled, and it is a magical sphere capable of sticking to itself the objects it touches; the more he collects, the bigger he gets, and the bigger he gets, the more he can stick bigger ones. We therefore start with small elements, such as nails, pawns, cards, pencils; we proceed with cats, fences, balls, irons; and we end up even attacking the different continents of Planet Earth with the katamari. The clearest passages take place between one level and another, but the intermediate ones take place in the same level, transmitting to the player a sense of progression from which real enjoyment is drawn. Attacking smaller objects is also satisfying, but it is when you become old enough to start collecting elements that initially seemed fixed, belonging to the seabed, seeing them break up as they attach to the katamari piece by piece, that the body and head will fill with joy and messianic satisfaction. Time and diameter The challenge proposed by Katamari Damacy Reroll is the simplest: the goal will always be to grow the katamari up to the objective size that will be communicated to us at the beginning of the level by the King of the Cosmos himself. Naturally, we will have to achieve this greatness within a limited time, otherwise it would be too easy, right? After all, in Keita Takashi's game there are no real enemies, just some obstacles such as a cat that will push us nearby, and other elements that could quickly throw us towards a wall, a step, or an object that is too heavy to abruptly interrupt our run making us lose some of those that we will have previously accumulated. The only malus that can be incurred is precisely the loss of objects, which will also be equivalent to a loss of diameter which is the indicator that interests us the most: the one which, once the time has elapsed, decrees the player's victory or defeat Sayonara Rolling Star After all, losing or winning matters little in Katamari Damacy Reroll. Of course, it serves to unlock all the levels present, and aiming for the High-Score in creating the largest katamari possible is very fun, but this is one of those games that you end up loading on the fly also because you deeply need it. Katamary Damacy is an experience that lightens the soul, that lifts a s*** day, that colors the afternoon greyness. It achieves this with its blocky, full-color world, delightful main characters, and awkward, minimally animated Earthlings. But above all Katamari Damacy always makes you smile thanks to her music. This game's soundtrack isn't just a good soundtrack, it's one of those very rare emotional compilations that works perfectly even out of the game. These very different songs, ranging between swing and rock & roll, the most bewitching jpop and the most enthralling bossa, survive the system clash to blend perfectly with the original gameplay, and with this visual aspect that works as an antithesis, instead of in cohesion. Experience thus becomes an orchestra, the pad transforms into a grand master's baton that defines times and rises. Thus the masterpiece Katamari Damacy is completed. The King of the Cosmos It would also be sacrilegious to forget about Kat's plotamary Damacy Reroll. It all stems from the evening revelry of the King of the Cosmos who, after having exaggerated with whatever one can exaggerate, on his way home makes such a mess that he destroys all the stars. With an authoritarian attitude, the Divine unloads the problem and solution on the shoulders of his son: ~here is your katamari, collect objects and we will be able to rebuild the celestial vault!~. Thus begins the journey of this tiny, adorable, asexual creature, in perfect contrast to the soaring father figure with a shining ~package~ and on which sooner or later your gaze will end, even if perhaps you will not admit it. The user will control this little son grappling with the katamari, and not the katamari itself. It is important to specify this because the commands will simulate the prince's little hands intent on pushing, pulling and moving this strange sticky ball through the levels. An analog for each little hand: to roll the ball forward we will have to press both analogs forward, while to make it turn on itself we will have to move one lever forward and one backward. Don't worry, it's much easier to do than to understand it from a written description. We Love Katamari Each conquered area will allow the prince to collect enough matter to create a star, and star after star an entire constellation. Difficult? No, it is not, in fact in the following games a lot has been done to offer a more concrete challenge, as well as a more conspicuous longevity. Katamari Damacy Reroll can be completed in a couple of intense days, but as already mentioned, one always returns with gusto even if only to let oneself be carried away by its intrinsic happiness, or more concretely to beat some previous records. Because although the game is on the average easy, understanding how to move in these small three-dimensional open worlds in order to find gradually more voluminous objects, without wasting time coming across objects that we will not be able to attach to the katamari yet, requires exercise and a good orientation skills. The goodness of the gameplay is testified by the fact that you get better at Katamari Damacy by playing, and not by proceeding at random, growth which will consequently be reflected in the final score. Defects? The cult classic status makes it really difficult to criticize the game itself, but as a restoration operation we would have much preferred, rather than a remastered of the progenitor, a compilation capable of offering at least three of the three best games in the series, including this one of course. That would have been an unmissable offer, while at the moment we have to ~settle~ only for a masterpiece.", "date": "2020-11-25", "grade": "9.0"}
