With more options, more characters, more modes and more scenarios, the title of the French software house seems destined to outclass its inspirer in all respects: let's see if this is really the case. Not only tennis In terms of raw numbers, there is no doubt how Racket Sports Party literally makes the tennis section of Wii Sports eat dust, but it could not be otherwise since we are talking about a product completely focused on this single game mechanic. It is therefore a question of holding the Remote just as if it were a racket and moving the arm to simulate hitting the ball, with the movement of the character on the screen which is entirely managed automatically, if one excludes the possibility of approaching the net by holding down the A key. The Ubisoft title offers the beauty of 5 different sports to tackle, all related to the discipline of Roger Feder and associates: in addition to the classic tennis, we therefore find badminton (the badminton, for the uninitiated), table tennis , squash and beach tennis. It must be said immediately that not all specialties are at the same level, and indeed it is no exaggeration to say that only tennis guarantees a minimum of depth, with the others serving as little more than a side dish. Therefore, if in the first case the different movements made by the user have a significant feedback on the trajectory and power of the shots, in all the other modes the effect is decidedly more dampened, effectively reducing them to a mere waving of the arms without great technique. Certainly Racket Sports Party has no intention of simulating reality, but a little more care would not have hurt, although the fun factor is still more than good, especially from a multiplayer perspective. As can be deduced from the title itself, the focus of the Ubisoft work is strongly oriented towards group use, as evidenced by the support for split screen - which allows up to four players to act simultaneously - and the possibility of also exploiting the USB video camera (the same used in Your Shape, to be clear) as an innovative control system. Also in this aspect, the situation is divided between lights and shadows: if therefore the peripheral makes everything even more intuitive, on the other hand it does not prove to be sufficiently precise in detecting movements, turning this solution into a stopgap rather than a real alternative. Racket Sports Party also supports Wii Motion Plus for those who want even more control over their shots: the implementation is good, even if limited to the execution of a couple of spin shots otherwise impossible with the normal Remote. In terms of game modes, Ubisoft has not spared itself: the six different options (Career, Tournament, Championship, Quick Game, Party and Training) promise to satisfy all needs, and reward the most assiduous users with new characters and elements to customize them. The technical sector is also good: the graphics are colorful and pleasant and offer a vast series of settings, sometimes even decidedly original, while the sound does its duty without particular problems. Ultimately, Racket Sports Party represents a good choice for those who have loved the tennis part of Wii Sports and want a similar but more complete experience: for all the others, the risk is to end up with a title that tastes so much of ~already seen ~.", "date": "2010-03-25", "grade": null}
