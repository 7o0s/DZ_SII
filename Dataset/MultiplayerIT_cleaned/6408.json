Of course, as we are about to see, Bloodsports.TV also has its similarities with this genre, but the game developed by Fatshark belongs to the so-called ~hero defense~, a type in which the player is committed to safeguarding a specific point on the map, specific opponents controlled solely by artificial intelligence. But let's go in order, and let's start again from 2012 with Krater, an RPG created by the same Swedish team: inside it appeared the same northern European nation in a post-apocalyptic scenario, due to the fall of a huge bomb. For those who don't remember, the graphics were similar to that of Borderlands. Since then, the Stockholm-based studio has made other titles, before returning to deal with the same setting with Bloodsports.TV: a project at least apparently reduced compared to the one of three years ago, which however managed to attract attention in the months prior to release. Taking advantage of the arrival on Steam, we did not miss the opportunity to try to get some healthy online beating too. Borderlands? League of Legends? Bloodsports.TV takes a little bit from everyone to bring us back to the world of Krater Defense to the bitter end Bloodsports.TV puts the player in the role of a single hero, to face waves of enemies intent on destroying the missile silo present on the map. In reality, there is very little heroic, given that according to the description of the game, the warhead in question goes to attack the village of those who try to oppose us. Be that as it may, the dynamics are strongly oriented towards cooperative play, given that each match can be played with a maximum of five connected players: the multiplayer drop-in drop-out mode is a further incentive to embark on matches via the Internet , thanks to the presence of a ~hot login~ which allows you to enter a game that has already started with a set of points to spend on your character so as to put him on a par with the others. If you wish, you can also try the single mode route, since the Bloodsports.TV engine is capable of scaling the forces in play to make them adapt to the number of players present in the match. In the tests that we have had the opportunity to carry out in single, this has occurred quite well, offering a good level of challenge, although we must say that by remaining alone, much of the fun it has to offer is lost. For the various heroes, actually called Gladiators, there are four different classes, quite classic in their composition: in fact, we find damage dealer, tank, curator and crowd control expert, naturally useful for facing the crowds of enemies that we are destined to face. Each single class includes two different characters, also available in another form that can be obtained through the so-called Path to Glory: it is a tree growth system that sets the player objectives, with the aim of obtaining various bonuses as they are they play games and, for example, a certain amount of damage is collected with a certain class. As we said, there are no human opponents: the success of individual players is however reflected in the inevitable Leaderboards, which can be consulted from the menus with the possibility of filtering the various categories based on the maps (there are a total of six) and the ~leagues~ of which Bloodsports.TV is made up of. Participating in the highest leagues means giving particular bonuses to your enemies, thus making it more difficult to complete the single game. QWER son of Pdor The game mechanics of Bloodsports.TV are what makes it most similar to League of Legends: in addition to the presence of a shop where you can buy items, the control system is in fact also based on the combination of the QWER keys to launch the skills of the character we are controlling, destined to increase in effectiveness as our level rises. Once we enter the battle, it is naturally up to us to use them in the best possible way against the various types of opponents that will come our way, present in sufficient variety, from the normal ones up to real final bosses capable of giving a hard time to anyone who find in front. As already mentioned, much of the fun is due to full-party online games, provided you have a few friends who play: at present, looking for a solo game means in fact colliding with a rather low number of servers. Much better then to organize on your own, to take advantage of the collaborative potential that Bloodsports.TV has to offer. Managing to reach a group of five buyers, Frcan take advantage of the offer on Steam to get a key for everyone, at the price of not even 5 euros each. We conclude as usual with the technical sector: stylistically, Bloodsports.TV closely resembles Borderlands, however drawing inspiration from League of Legends. From the first title it inherits the character design and graphic style, represented by a sort of cartoon where there is no lack of a healthy dose of violence, while from the Riot Games title it inherits the interface and visual, with a zoom level that allows you to highlight a cure for somewhat fluctuating details: adequate for elite-type characters and enemies, a little more anonymous as regards normal enemies and the surrounding elements of the arenas. The matches are commented on ~television~ by a voiceover, a bit tiring in the long run, while the music contributes quite well to defining the setting of the game.", "date": "2015-04-17", "grade": "7.0"}
