Astral date unknown, because the astral clock has stopped and the nearest astral clockmaker is twenty light-years away; first right after the second petrol station. On radar we have seen a planet full of great ideas. The reports speak of things that have never been seen elsewhere and that could be the sign of a developed and thriving ecosystem, with creatures with intelligence far beyond the 'Justin Bieber fan' level (well, at least these should know the shoes fasten). We go down to the surface to verify the data collected by radar and by our expert by consulting Wikipedia (the entries on unknown planets are very strong, even if it is still not clear who writes them). Sulu: Teleportation for Two! Incredible and full of contradictions this planet Horizon (we called it that after a five-minute consultation)! They built beautiful houses, but they didn't put roofs on them. They have spent a lot of resources to invent safe sex, while reproducing by budding (safer than that). In short, they have good ideas, but they make a lot of messes. We can only go back to the spaceship giving it an average rating, hoping they will try again, or improve what they have done. It would be a shame to see so many noble efforts wasted. Sulu: Let us get back to basics that we have to write the review for the great advice of the readers! We discover a potentially wonderful strategy, Horizon, marred by some questionable choices Minutes too long The amusing (?) metaphorical story of the previous paragraph should be enough for you to understand what the substance of Horizon is: many ideas, some of which are excellent, but others implemented in a bad way. The game is divided into two macro sections: the general map, where space fleets move and general management actions are performed (such as the construction of various infrastructures); and the tactical map, where fleets are managed in detail by individual units, attacks are planned and the various planet-by-planet systems are examined. In short, it is the classic pattern followed by many other titles, including Total War, to which Horizon owes a lot. Unfortunately, the interface is not very comfortable to use and makes navigation between the two sections really cumbersome. Not bad in the first part of the game, when there are fewer events taking place, but going forward, when the situations to manage become multiple, having to wait each time for the end of a turn to switch to the tactical view slows down the action dramatically and above all, it often makes you lose sight of the big picture. The problem is that these slowdowns are a bit in all areas of the game. Let's take the fights for example: the management system of the shields, divided into eight sections that can be attacked individually, is excellent and offers many possibilities at a strategic level. Imagine having a ship with one side left uncovered by the destruction of that portion of the shield and having to protect it by using the other ships as an obstacle for the opponents, perhaps creating a funnel effect that draws them into a trap. What's not working? Nothing, considering the single action. Too bad that the overpopulated clashes become really long and tedious, given that every movement of each spaceship must be managed, especially when the forces in the field are so unbalanced that they offer little or nothing in terms of tactical tension. Of course, there is always the possibility of using automatic shifts, but here too there are problems. Unfortunately ~automatic rounds~ is not equivalent to a fight running in the background with the result calculated by the CPU, but to the full fight in which all the rounds played by the CPU are shown. Of course, it is faster than manual combat, but during our test, in the advanced stages, some automatic battles exceeded the quarter of an hour in duration. What can you do in those long minutes? Unfortunately absolutely nothing, apart from having a coffee, a tea or a good glass of wine. Let's not talk about how long the fights themselves would have lasted by acting manually (longer than Ground Zeroes, probably). Deep space It's a shame I can't recommend Horizon lightly. It's a shame because it actually has some really good features to offer. For example, the macro management of one's own people and galactic colonization is interesting and multifaceted. Each planet has unique characteristics that are exploited differently by the various races, the latter endowed with more or less advantageous traits compared to their competitors. It is not possible to build every type of building on every planet, which must be specialized to get the most out of it or for needs of relative balance.or to the choices made previously. For example, a population that consumes a lot of food resources will need more food production than one that has the trait that completely eliminates the need to eat. The latter may focus on other aspects of colonization, but may be slower in researching or accumulating other resources, for example. The possibilities are so many that it makes no sense to try to list them all. Just know that from this point of view Horizon is excellent and that the scarcity of resources is one of the reasons that generate conflicts between races, just like in the real world. Too bad it loses ground again in the management screens, which are often unclear and cumbersome. Let's take that of research: as usual, details abound and the system is truly original (we proceed by discoveries and not by pre-established inventions) and successful in its generality. Too bad that even to do very simple things several clicks are required which slow everything down. The same, to give another example, happens with the management of individual ships. In short, when you decide to add features after features, it would be advisable to dilute the interface a little and simplify the functions that have a minor impact on the gameplay, otherwise you risk obtaining the opposite effect to the desired one, i.e. that the depth and 'accuracy end up, in the long run, to weigh down the gameplay resulting, where you would like to act faster, because there are many things to do, counterproductive for the game dynamics. Summing up, it's a shame not to be able to speak well of all that is beautiful in Horizon due to a problematic implementation, probably the result of too much ambition. Sometimes flying low is a sign of wisdom, not incompetence.", "date": "2014-02-28", "grade": "6.0"}
