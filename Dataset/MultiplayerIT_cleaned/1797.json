{"name": "Conflict: Desert Storm", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/conflict-desert-storm-3.html", "text": "The Perfect Soldier's Handbook C:DS is a third-person action/strategy that puts you in command of a strike team engaged in the real Desert Storm campaign during the Gulf War. Pivotal Games, in order to make the atmosphere more real and believable and to give greater realism to the missions, made use of the collaboration of Cameron Spence, a former member of the SAS, who gave valuable suggestions for the development of the game. Your adventures are divided into 15 missions, which for a change will see you engaged in rescuing hostages, destroying objectives, searching for and covering characters of particular political weight. Fortunately you will not be alone, three other companions managed entirely by the AI will support you and you can give them orders during the game, as well as take direct control at every opportunity. Before tackling the main mode, however, it will be necessary to go to the training section and do some practice with the control system, which uses all the keys of the Dual Shock and is, at least initially, a bit difficult to assimilate. The fire key is assigned to R1 and the front keys are used to control the troop, according to a decidedly FPS-inspired arrangement, which however also fits this title in a convincing way. The analog sticks are used to move around and to look around, with L3 used to activate the first person mode. The difference between the two views is quite important, since by shooting with the third person one the targets are automatically locked as soon as they enter the field of vision, while in the first person it will be up to the player to have a good aim to hit the enemies, balanced disadvantage however, it gives a greater possibility to aim at vital parts and to shoot hidden. Continuing the training it will also be possible to practice with the weapons and with the commands to be given to the troops, which despite being a small number (only four), are still able to cover any game situation. To close the training, a small section dedicated to driving a jeep. Once the ~running in~ period is over, it will finally be time to dedicate yourself to the main mode. The choice of the team, the British SAS or the American Delta Force, does not involve substantial differences except for the skins, the paraphernalia and the mixing of the specialties of the team members. For their part, however, if the Americans are more skilled in the use of firearms, the British are better at first aid techniques. Once you have chosen your team, after a simple briefing of the objectives to be completed you will be catapulted into the first mission, the only one where you will be alone, specifically designed to put the player at ease with the aiming and fire system. The number of weapons available is very high and includes rifles, machine guns, pistols, hand grenades, anti-tank mines, up to transmitters and laser detectors that allow aviation support. Unlike other games, weapons in C:DS have a degree of realism unusual for a title of its kind on consoles. In fact, explosives do not just hit soldiers who are too close, but cause a real movement of air that damages soldiers who are not positioned at a safer distance wider than in the first case. In the case of bombardments this effect is even more evident, in fact it is unlikely that soldiers who are more than far away, or at least protected by a solid wall, will be able to escape death. Strategy or Arcade? While appreciating the programmers' effort in trying to create a game mechanic that requires a certain amount of strategy, in reality many of the choices made in making the game fail to fully convince. The soldiers, once their energy bar is exhausted, do not die but remain in agony until the bar itself is emptied again, which sanctions their definitive death. The problem is that this bar runs out very slowly and therefore it is easy for the player to go and recover and heal his wounded companions. This means that in the early stages the player tends to go into trouble rather than study a precise plan of attack, an element that makes you regret the good old instant death that would have forced you to plan each move more. The quality of the AI of the enemies present in the game is also decidedly fluctuating. Sometimes it happens that the troops meet the player with machine guns drawn without the slightest cover, others that try to hide behind a wall or avoid your shots by throwing themselves on the ground. inspiegably you will see them freeze to position themselves before firing, becoming an easy target, only to then follow your troops stealthily and have the intuition that they are stationed like a firing squad just behind the door, with lethal consequences (for you ) that you can guess. Their ability to use the means varies from excellent as regards tanks to pathetic in the case of Hind-D helicopters, so dazed in the air that they can be destroyed even with machine gun shots. However, your companions are no less, and you will often see them stuck against walls or throw a bomb against a wall, which will end with the inevitable extermination of your group. Completely different speech as regards their fire capacity, far too precise and infallible, certainly useful for the ~hottest~ and most demanding situations, but which in the long run proves to be a pretext for the player to go into hiding and leave it to his own troops the task of managing all the fights. Completely negative judgment then? Not exactly. Despite the defects listed above, C: DS still manages to exalt the player by proposing a worthy mechanic all in all. In spite of what it may seem in the early stages, shooting everything that moves without using a ~minimum~ of tactics turns out to be an unsatisfying choice in the long run, and the game encourages you to use the resources at your disposal wisely. Adequately distributing your troops in the playing area will therefore be increasingly important as the adventure continues: if at the beginning placing a sniper over a building makes little sense due to the large sparsely populated spaces, later a soldier with an automatic machine gun well placed can make the difference. The difficulty level is also quite well calibrated, becoming decidedly challenging in the more advanced missions, and despite the problem of the near-invulnerability of your companions it will be increasingly difficult to keep them alive, sometimes leading to losing the entire troop in an attempt to save only one injured. We could amaze you with special effects....well, we could! Other sore points come from the graphics sector. The frame rate is quite unstable despite the fact that the number of polygons is not very high, also thanks to the desert setting of many missions, which if on the one hand helps to give the game more realism, on the other it certainly does not satisfy the player's eye . If nothing else, the field of view is quite wide, although there is the usual, very annoying mist on the horizon to lighten the work on the CPU. For the rest we are faced with a veritable festival of interpenetrations which vary from passable as heads sticking against walls, up to the irritating when, due to an incorrect collision detection, one of ours is ~absorbed~ for half off a cliff making it impossible to save him. You will even see enemies climbing on top of each other instead of walking around. Fortunately in the sound sector C:DS fares much better, the noises of weapons and explosions have been reproduced very faithfully, as well as the dialogues and radio calls, contributing significantly to the player's identification within of the game. As for extra modes, it is sad to note the lack of effort on the part of Pivotal Games to introduce some additional game modes, especially as regards multiplayer. In fact, the only one available is a Cooperation mode, in which two players retrace the same missions as the single-player, with the possibility, however, of giving orders to only one soldier instead of three as in the normal game. Comment Conflict: Desert Storm therefore, despite presenting some flaws, still manages to entertain the player. The defects mentioned in the review do not affect the value of an overall decent product. The announcement by Pivotal Games to release two more sequels bodes well for the future of this series, hoping that at least the defects found in the review will be taken into consideration by the developers and corrected. Pros: +A successful mix between strategy and arcade +Well calibrated difficulty Cons: - Graphically mediocre - Some elements of the game mechanics would need to be reviewed It is undeniable that in the field of action games with a war background, PCs make good times and bad times. The success of Rainbow Six several years ago has generated a plethora of games all marked by a high realism and tactical depth, undoubtedly interesting features, which however have discouraged all those who do not hThey have time to get lost in long preparatory phases, eager on the contrary to quickly throw themselves headlong into the fray. The attempt to bring the genre to consoles has so far always ended tragically, however it seems that things are changing with the recent SOCOM: US Navy Seals and this Conflict: Desert Storm, which while not being hyper-realistic simulations like their PC counterparts, however, they try to break away from the past by proposing a decidedly more complex mechanic than usual.", "date": "2003-01-20", "grade": null}
