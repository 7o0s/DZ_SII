{"name": "Si torna in pista", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/93489-trackmania-2-canyon-si-torna-in-pista.html", "text": "Trackmania 2: Canyon maintains the two main features of the series, namely the essential gameplay and the intuitive track editor. The gameplay, which is immediately familiar to fans of the series, is based on only four commands which are acceleration, brake, right steering and left steering. So the fulcrum of everything is the trajectories and the physics of the car which, beyond the aesthetic variations, always has the same performance, the same weight and the same extreme counter-steering. On the other hand, the title is based on gnawing milliseconds from the times of travel of the tracks which, despite the simplicity of the gameplay, offer dozens of possibilities to allow us to exceed our best time and therefore to climb the rankings. The Xbox 360 pad works perfectly but the keyboard micro-corrections don't bother the gameplay. Indeed, they often allow quick rescues from potentially disastrous situations. Just complicated The physics of the game are specially designed to enhance the basic gameplay of Trackmania 2: Canyon by allowing the cars to race along vertical walls and making them bounce, in case of a mistake, like balls on a pinball machine. The official tracks, apparently simple, are almost all studied to the millimeter, as the series has accustomed us to, and they suggest the way to go to modders for their creations. These are real puzzles to unravel to find out if at a certain point it is better to make a long jump or a short one or if it is preferable to land against the steering wheel or perfectly aligned with the track. The A08, for example, is a sloped descent. Seemingly very simple. The only problem is that at the beginning, just before the dive, there is a curve. The whole difficulty lies in arriving at the end of the curve straight as rulers to take the descent correctly instead of starting a wild roll. Once the approach has been conquered, we then arrive at the filing of the times trying to improve the various landings that await us before the finish line. To hinder us and help us in achieving record times we obviously have the countersteer, decidedly accentuated to allow very long drifts, jumps of all kinds and slippery surfaces. All elements to take into account if you try your hand at the editor and with the creation of tracks. To surpass the designers of Trackmania 2 requires a lot of polishing work to create tracks that are difficult but manageable enough to allow players to improve run after run. The editing tool is integrated within the title and is so simple that it requires only the use of the two mouse buttons and the wheel to allow us to select, rotate, delete, raise and lower each element. The ranking that matters The recipe of Trackmania 2: Canyon works like a charm. And there is nothing to be surprised at since it is not dissimilar from that of the previous chapters, but here it is enhanced by an evident leap forward in the graphics sector and by a first-class online infrastructure. The Maniaplanet network, integrated within the title itself, includes the rankings based on the medals won, those on the score obtained by placing in multiplayer races and those focused on skill points that enhance the ~time trial~ soul that has always distinguished the series. To enter the classification that counts, i.e. that of skill points, it is first necessary to win the gold medal on a track and it therefore becomes possible, every five minutes, to launch an official attempt. The time obtained is therefore official and is therefore saved, including the ghost, and uploaded to the Maniaplanet server where it is necessary to register to purchase the game. In short, all the official times and the relative ghosts are available on the network, also divided by region and by country, and it therefore becomes possible to download them on the fly, both from the menu and directly from the graphic interface of the game in progress, to learn their tricks and challenge them. Skill points can range from a few units up to tens of thousands, multiplying by every millisecond conquered. Unfortunately in some tests, especially if these include several laps of the track, having only one opportunity every 5 minutes can become frustrating but the desire to set an official time can also keep us glued to the screen for hours, giving further longevity to a title already full of tracks and modes. Among other things, the possibility of observing the ghosts of other players, as well as allowing us to find out if in a certain point it is better to jump further or keep the car glued to the ground as much as possible, includes that touch of digital voyeurism which helps to keep long live the community and to make it feel united even without the aid of chat or direct contacts. Some defects, an avalanche of merits On the gameplay front, the title offers the classic five types of circuits divided by color which include wide tracks, Nordic canyons, bottlenecks, western-style canyons and jumps of all kinds. Then there is the multiplayer which on the one hand sees us engaged in filing times and on the other in head-to-head races with other players complete with local hotseat and split screen modes. In the title, unfortunately, we do not find any career or structured single player experience but the offer is still substantial and undoubtedly commensurate with the 20 euros needed to buy the title. As far as the aesthetic sector is concerned, considering the power and accessibility of the editor and the relatively modest hardware requirements (a relatively new card is obviously required to view the latest generation effects), the result is surprising. The leap compared to the Trackmania of the past is abysmal. The colors are those to which the series has accustomed us but the textures, the vegetation, the metal surfaces of the vehicles and the apt use of effects such as bloom bring the sensory involvement of the player to heights that seemed unattainable in previous Trackmania. Obviously everything is lost a bit in the speed with which our car starts, restarts, crashes, jumps and reaches the finish line, but the speed of the gameplay also allows us to overlook some defects such as the total lack of any effect when our car enters a body of water. In any case, the advantages numerically outnumber the defects and include well-crafted vehicles, complete with real-time reflections on the bodywork, reflecting bodies of water, presentation sequences of the tracks with quality blur and blur effects, convincing clouds that cross the sky and finally the damage to the vehicle which, while not producing effects on driving, are quite convincing. The sound on the other hand just does its job without exaggerating. On the other hand, all vehicles have the same engine under the hood and the sound effects actually needed are a handful. As for the soundtrack, however, the variety would have been welcome and unfortunately it is completely missing. In fact, the title relies on a single track which, despite being of good quality, becomes repetitive after a few games. The solution, since if you are a fan of the series you will spend hours and hours on Trackmania 2: Canyon, is to mute the volume and load your soundtrack directly from Windows.", "date": "2011-09-22", "grade": "9.0"}
