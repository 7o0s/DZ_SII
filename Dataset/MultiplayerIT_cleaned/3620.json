{"name": "F1 2019", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/f1-2019-recensione.html", "text": "Even if the time comes in the future when there are millions of driving games in circulation, Formula 1 will always continue to exert its fascination. It may be that we Italians all have a bit of the Ferrari myth deeply rooted in our DNA, but seeing the red ones whizzing on circuits around the world can only excite even the spectator with little passion for engines. An emotion that also this year thanks to Codemasters and its F1 2019 we can once again experience firsthand, this time quite a bit earlier than usual. To celebrate ten years of the series, the British company has in fact decided to bring forward the release of F1 2019 from August to June, thus responding to a long-standing request from gamers. The arrival of the game in the middle of the Formula 1 championship which began in March makes this event even more worthy of attention, also in light of the innovations announced by the developers in recent months. It is therefore with great pleasure that we got behind the wheel to deal with this review of F1 2019, a game capable of surprising us where we least expected it, even if it is not without flaws. Let's see everything together. Menus and modes: a lot of Career, but also a lot of multiplayer The pitfalls associated with games that have an annual release is well known to all fans of sports titles, whose first question every year concerns the real innovations introduced in the new edition of their favorite series. F1 2019 tries to set the record straight as soon as you get to its menu, completely revised by the developers compared to its predecessor. Even if the interface is completely new, it is still really difficult to remain lost among what have been some staples of the series for some years now. On top of these is of course the Career Mode, which we'll get into later, accompanied by the usual array of Grand Prix, Championships and Time Trials to play solo. Among the novelties of this year there is the considerable space dedicated to the multiplayer component of the title, in which Codemasters has decided to invest to give users the means with which to manage their leagues directly from within F1 2019: it is not necessary then resort more to external tools to do it. The expansion of the events into different categories makes these appointments more varied for those intending to play online, enriching the reward system with the introduction of competition points. These are nothing more than the virtual currency with which to buy aesthetic elements for your driver or for the single-seater you use online (the same for everyone), in the same context in which microtransactions with real money were introduced. Some items can in fact be bought only by spending solid euros, but it is good to remember that these are elements that do not change the skills within the game. Moreover, it could not have been otherwise, given the decision with which Codemasters seems to want to aim at the world of eSports after having also raised its seasonal prize pool to 500,000 dollars. In fact, in the renewed menu there is an entire section dedicated to the official competitions of F1 2019, in which to access videos, calendars and other dedicated material. From this point of view, we would have liked to see greater integration with the game itself, instead of being sent back for each selected content to be viewed via the PlayStation 4 browser. The list of available sections is completed by the Autosalone, where you can admire all the single-seaters up close officers present in the game, and the Cinema mode, where the highlights of the races we run are automatically entered and then eventually shared online. Playstation 4 trophies In addition to the ones you'll get for driving your car, F1 2019 offers a total of fifty-one PlayStation Trophies. The usual Platinum comes with two Gold, ten Silver, and thirty-eight Bronze level achievements. To get them all it is necessary to work hard through the various modes of the game, starting above all from the Career and its rivalry system. Formula 2 and Career If we deal with Career mode after having listed all the others, it is because it is strongly linked to one of the main novelties of F1 2019: the arrival of Formula 2 and its entire championship. In the various modes proposed by the game it is in fact possible to take part in one or more races of the 2018 championship (Mick Schumacher's 2019 will arrive via update) of the minor category, a sort of talent forge where the skills of emerging drivers intending to seek glory in Formula 1. It is no coincidence that this is the incipit of the Career mode, in whichwe are called to take on the role of a driver engaged in the Formula 2 championship. In reality, the latter is not played in full but is shown to us only through some salient phases, useful for defining rivalries and friendships that we will bring to the following season in Formula 1 where we will arrive together with Lukas Weber, our teammate, and Devon Butler, our fiercest opponent. In reality, the decision to place Formula 2 at the beginning of the Career also acts as an obligatory introduction to this category, certainly less popular than Formula 1 but able to reserve pleasant surprises. Starting from the type of car used, the same Dallara F2 2018 for all the teams which therefore makes the challenge the same for all the drivers, accompanied by a different points management system and the races themselves. Each weekend is in fact made up of a single practice session and a qualifying session, followed by the so-called Feature Race, the longest race with a mandatory pit stop, and the Sprint Race, a shorter race with reversed starting positions. We won't go into further technical and regulatory details, but we simply invite you to give Formula 2 a chance in F1 2019 even if its arrival doesn't excite you that much. As in reality, the use of a rougher but also less powerful car than a Formula 1 single-seater can in fact also be useful for learning the game's driving system. Returning to Career, once the introductory phase has passed, as in the past, you can access the choice of team among all those present in the 2019 season, thus renewing the possibility of starting off immediately with a contract in Ferrari or another high-level team. Our colleagues from Formula 2 will adapt by choosing a team capable of competing with ours, thus carrying forward a plot that also allows us to see the answers they give to the questions they are asked during the interview. In narrative terms we are not at the level of similar modes seen in other sports titles, it must be said, but the additions of F1 2019 undoubtedly open an interesting path for what future developments will be. Among other things, the new dynamics also allow the usual Claire's interviews to be a little more varied than in the past, even if after a year we would have expected more innovations in the interaction with the media. For the rest, the Career remains similar to what was seen in F1 2018, with the presence of experience points that can be accumulated in the various racing sessions to then be spent in the research and development phases, paying attention to the changes in the regulation. The gameplay When the time finally comes to hit the track, F1 2019 proves faithful to the philosophy embraced by the series in recent years. The very large scalability of the game settings allows both novices and the more experienced to find their own place among the various aids, among which we find traction control, braking aid, suggested gear and so on. The numerous shots available allow you to find your own orientation: as far as we are concerned, this time we preferred to use the TV Pod camera, since even by removing the vertical element of the Halo, the cockpit view continued to give us the feeling of having little field of vision. Of note are the changes to the interface during the race, in our opinion clearer and cleaner than last year. Even if Codemasters' statements spoke of a completely revised physics, the sensations experienced in driving the F1 2019 single-seaters were very close to those given to us by F1 2018, allowing us to actually sit in front of the wheel without particular worries. A slightly different story for Formula 2, where the use of a different car becomes tangible. Even if the use of the controller continues to be supported, owning a steering wheel has now become a must to fully enjoy everything that F1 2019 has to offer, starting with the improvements to the force feedback performance that the developers offer us every year. Playing a bit with the pilots' artificial intelligence settings, we seemed to see a behavior that was quite adequate for the levels set, even if several hours of play are needed to evaluate any flaws. Lastly, as regards the management of collisions, it seems to us that some concessions are still being made both in the damage to the cars and in their evaluation by the race marshals. The graphics: lights on the EGO Engine When we spoke of surprises at the beginning, we were referring mainly to the technical sector of F1 2019. Although we had given it close to retirement already at thereview of F1 2018, the 3.0 version of the EGO Engine manages to amaze those who approach this year's game, mainly for the management of the lights renewed by Codemasters. If on the one hand it is true that the models are always extremely accurate and up-to-date even in the smallest details, this year it is in fact the lighting and reflections that make the difference, both on the cars and on the elements that make up the track. The biggest difference can be seen in the night races, where atmospheric effects and artificial lights make up a decidedly different glance compared to F1 2018, we dare to say almost at the limits of the generational leap. Moving on to the daytime races, the work done on managing the lights becomes less evident but still tangible, especially in particular moments such as sunset in the way it lights up the asphalt. As a consequence of the work done, there is also a better outline of the shadows, while the delayed texture loading problems encountered in F1 2018 have been almost completely resolved. On PlayStation 4 Pro, there are no drops in the number of frames per second, but wanting to do the fussy you may notice from time to time some aliasing problems. There are no changes to the championship circuits compared to last year: the only changes to the 2019 calendar in fact concern the switch between the Mexican and United States GPs. As far as the sound is concerned, once again this year listening to the single-seaters directly through headphones remains a symphony not to be missed. Naturally confirmed by the comment Carlo Vanzini and Luca Filippi, now at home in the series.", "date": "2019-06-21", "grade": "9.0"}
