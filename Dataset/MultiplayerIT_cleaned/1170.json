Absolutely none, at least in the videogame field and limited to party games. This is the lesson you will learn today with the review of Fly Together on Nintendo Switch. The title itself, moreover, should prompt you to turn on some light bulbs: do you by any chance remember the developers of Northplay? Not too long ago (it was 2018) they released Conduct TOGETHER!, a nice indie production in which the player was called to organize and manage a growing series of trains, between stations and railway routes. With Fly Together the philosophy remains unchanged, as well as fun that should involve friends and family; the means of transport change, which become airplanes, and consequently we pass from the plain to the open sky. Gameplay from flight controllers In Fly Together we all become novice air traffic controllers, but experience - as we know - comes at the end of a long period of apprenticeship. No one will therefore prove to be particularly punitive with you, if in the first hours of the game you take the passengers where they didn't want to go, if you earn much less than expected, if you crash a plane on the nearest mountain: it happens, and at least in Fly Together nobody gets of evil. Fly TOGETHER! and its planes ready for anything The gaming experience (and with it the gameplay) is about as intuitive as one could think. Fly Together shows small colored airports on the screen, and equally colored planes: the player must select the plane, then an airport, and make sure that the means of transport arrives safely at its destination; all with an on-screen timer that indicates how many seconds are left until the level is finished. Easy, right? Even the game trailers published by Northplay would like to convince you of this, and in fact at least for the first two or three worlds it is. Fly TOGETHER!, the white lines indicate new vehicles arriving: attention! But then things get considerably more complicated, becoming more and more satisfying: every single level of Fly Together in fact (and there are more than a hundred in total) is the result of the work of careful craftsmen. No detail is out of place, no path too obvious, no difficulty put there just to make up the number: this is even more true from the middle of the campaign onwards, when every single mistake can prevent you from reaching the third star out of the three that each level offers as reward the most skilled players. The mechanics of Fly Together are therefore easy to understand, fun for everyone, but they also know how to prove demanding and require particular attention for those who want to get the most out of production. The progression: a personal airport Fly TOGETHER!, there are those who have always wanted a personal hangar and those who lie The progression of Fly Together is ramified: initially the player is shown the game mechanics - extremely intuitive - the four or five levels of the first world, the ~base~ one. From here on it will be the buyer who will choose how to continue and the next stage of the journey: the writer, for example, has opted for the desert world, which clearly presented a setting (and consequently pitfalls) radically different from the mountain one. If you want, you can go a bit from one side and a bit from the other, completing a couple of levels here and a couple there: the important thing is to remember that, to completely complete a world and therefore move on to the next, you have to finish the journeys of the individual levels contained in each of them. The best ones will also be able to get all the stars of a given world, without making mistakes (or making very few anyway). To encourage replayability a bit and obtaining the three stars in the individual levels, Fly Together provides an interesting reward system. Every time you take a plane to its destination, you earn coins: the coins can be used to unlock, upgrade and enrich your personal airport, which is located on a separate screen from the game map. From the airport you can buy new planes (which will then be used in the levels), customize the ones you already own and much more. The characteristics of the various means of transport vary: there are planes that can accommodate more passengers at the same time, others that are faster, still others guarantee greater earnings upon landing. They are sufficiently balanced parameters, so that there is no real essential aircraft, but they all turn out to be situational. Fly TOGETHER! and its game map It must be said that having coin after coin is not enough to get all the planes, because the necessary projects go to them volta found in individual levels. In fact, you will notice, while planning trips from one place to another, small but neat game maps, random suitcases: some can get money, others plane projects. Whenever you notice them, it will be advisable to plan a path suitable for collecting them; at the end of the level you can open them and find out what you have unlocked. Multiplayer mode Fly TOGETHER!, a look at the multiplayer mode Fly Together could not miss a feature that can make it the perfect choice for an evening with friends, and that is the multiplayer mode. First of all, we recall that the entire career mode can be tackled in the company of another person, who at any time can simply hold a Joy-Con and take control of the free planes on the screen (this perhaps also simplifies the level of general difficulty). But there is still a dedicated mode, designed for both cooperative and competitive multiplayer (both strictly offline). In the first case, you will manage a certain number of planes at the same time, complete with a score on the screen for whoever gets the best performance. In the second case, up to eight players will be able to beat each other up in an arena, complete with in-flight battles and devastating powerups, ranging from cyclones to be unleashed on enemies to giant cakes to be placed in the middle of the path. Finally, let's spend a few words of merit also for the usable controllers, namely all the existing ones: motion sensors (you can fly the planes simply by ~pointing~ the Joy-Con towards the screen), Pro Controller, touch screen in portable mode.", "date": "2021-05-09", "grade": "8.0"}
