{"name": "Rivolte future", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/167891-shadow-complex-remastered-rivolte-future.html", "text": "When about eight years ago it was released on the market in digital delivery, Shadow Complex immediately amazed positive critics and users with its beautiful graphics and its Metroid style of play, revisited however in a modern sauce, to the point that there were those who came to define the production by Epic Games ~a contemporary masterpiece~. The game, based on Unreal Engine technology, was initially released only on Xbox 360, but years later and after winning many awards, it was released on PC, Xbox One and today finally also on PlayStation 4. The story behind the title is set in the universe of Empire, the novel by Orson Scott Card which tells of an imaginary second American Civil War organized by a powerful terrorist faction of clear communist origin. In this sense, the game acts as a tie-in to the book and at the same time as a prequel to the sequel Hidden Empire, inserting itself into a sort of trilogy between different genres. The protagonist of the adventure is Jason Flemming, a hero by chance who finds himself having to investigate and fight the powerful secret organization that aims to take control of the United States, and having to save his girlfriend Claire, captured by the latter. The story isn't very original, but it proves to be functional to the game, to the point that it develops as the user progresses in the adventure and thus discovers unpublished details about the terrorist organization, the ongoing war and so on. Shadow Complex Remastered: One of the best side-scrolling platform-adventures now on PlayStation 4 Modern classic Like the great original, Shadow Complex Remastered is a fresh take on the classic side-scrolling platform-adventures of yore, but with slightly improved graphics for PlayStation 4, some new dynamic melee attacks, and a series of of unpublished objectives and challenges that are added to the Trophies. However, the strong point of the production remains the gameplay, which offers the right mix of adventurous, platform, pseudo role-playing and shooter elements. The game action takes place between levels, floors and corridors connected by one of the best level design ever seen in a production of this genre, where there is no shortage of original ideas designed by the developers to make the most of the mix between 2D and 3D. The game view of the character is lateral, as mentioned, but in many situations it is possible to use the three-dimensionality of the space around to hit enemies or to glance at a hidden point. Other times the camera can suddenly rotate and give another perspective of the game action, transforming into third person like a modern shooter. The clashes are quite difficult and varied in unfolding, and from this point of view the control system performs well, which allows the gamer to move the character on the screen without any problems whatsoever, not only as happens in a ~normal~ two-dimensional game side-scrolling, since it is possible to make it interact with all three-dimensional space thanks to an intelligent aim assist system. The latter is initially not immediate to master despite the help of the CPU, but once you get used to it it becomes extremely ~maneuverable~. The partially sore point of the game is, if anything, to be found in the limited artificial intelligence of most of the enemies, who often have rather repetitive movement patterns and sometimes do not even seem to notice the presence of the protagonist even if he is a stone's throw from them . It gets better with the bosses, who offer good variety in fighting style and design. Worth noting is the fact that the soldiers reappear in their places even after being eliminated the first time, so retracing their steps they find themselves around. In any case, what has just been described paradoxically does not affect the goodness of a title that remains beautiful to play and challenging, given that even if they are not tops, the enemies are still able to keep the player engaged in tough battles of increasing difficulty . Playstation 4 trophies Shadow Complex Remastered offers 40 Trophies divided into 27 Bronze, 8 Silver, 4 Gold and 1 Platinum. To unlock them, you need to meet requests such as performing a particular melee attack, obtaining a certain type of ending with or without Claire, completing 100% of the game in less than two hours and on any difficulty level, and so on. Retrace your steps In addition to shooting, it is important to explore every corner of the scenarios to look for upgrades, new weapons and useful items: initially Jason Flemming has to rely on his arms and legs, but then he begins to find the rightequipped for his mission, and between pistols, machine guns, grenades and so on and so forth, there is weapons for all tastes, even the strangest ones. In this sense, the title plays with the user through a level design that exploits the perspective not only to change the view in the fights, but also to hide a thousand secrets, secondary roads and brilliant ideas, without however displacing the player or distracting him from what which is the main objective to be achieved, confirming how the developers of Chair Entertainment have worked hard to enhance the mix between the frenzy of the shooter and the beauty of exploration typical of the best adventure titles of the genre. In this sense, once you have obtained more powerful weapons, you can, if you wish, go back to complete those levels that contain previously inaccessible points, and finish exploring them to the end. From this point of view, backtracking is never boring, and as mentioned, not even mandatory, so the gamer is free to decide whether to continue forward following the normal evolution of the story, or to also dedicate himself to exploration to collect each object and discover all the secrets, extending the duration of the game by at least double. Moving on to the technological sector, Shadow Complex Remastered does not show particular upheavals from a graphic point of view. In this sense, the starting point remains the excellent one of the original on Xbox 360, with a wonderful graphic style that mixes two-dimensional and 3D-like elements, refined and rich in polygons, with particle, light and any kind of effects, plus a great attention to detail, even those apparently less important such as the blades of grass that move or the elements that cover or make up the structures in the background. Only that all this is offered in a higher resolution and with some slight tweaks here and there which, however, as mentioned, do not revolutionize the aesthetic part of the product. As for the sound sector, we have a series of excellent samples for noises, effects and anything else that acts as a side sound to what happens on the screen, corroborated by a beautiful soundtrack capable of adequately accompanying the various moments of the adventure.", "date": "2016-05-09", "grade": "8.5"}
