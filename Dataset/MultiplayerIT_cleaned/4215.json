{"name": "Antigraviator: la recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/200390-antigraviator-antigraviator-la-recensione.html", "text": "Announced last December, Antigraviator projects us two centuries into the future, in a scenario where speed racing has taken on completely new and extreme forms, using unprecedented technologies to create wide and dizzying tracks, as well as vehicles that are capable of travel them without incurring any friction phenomenon, as they are equipped with anti-gravity devices. In short, the influences of the classic WipEout appear immediately evident, and the title developed by Cybernetic Walrus does nothing to deny them; on the contrary, it proudly fits into a sub-genre, that of futuristic racers, which in recent years seems to be in great shape, just think of productions such as Fast RMX or the very Italian Redout. Clearly the risk of being blatantly derivative and unable to propose a concrete vision is just around the corner, and it is precisely among the meshes of this no small inconvenience that Antigraviator ends up launching itself. At full speed. The situation is Grav The peculiar mix of retro-style synths (it reminded us of the era of 16-bit systems, but actually not in a good way) and a stylistically unsuccessful interface represent a not exactly positive business card for Antigraviator, but we trust that at least one of these aspects can enjoy a substantial improvement with the next game updates, perhaps before landing on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. From the start screen, the Cybernetic Walrus racer puts on the table a fairly traditional set of options between campaign, quick race and online sector, the latter currently a bit problematic in terms of matchmaking (the title has just come out and there there are few people) but able to offer fun challenges, also if desired locally via split-screen for a maximum of four participants. The core of the experience is naturally represented by the campaign, which allows you to face eight championships to be gradually unlocked, each consisting of four events of a different nature: they can be traditional races, countdowns with the elimination of the vehicle in the queue, deathmatches and more . Once on the track, the experience immediately reveals itself to be very fast and leverages consolidated mechanisms for this type of product, i.e. the obligation to memorize the tracks so that pitfalls can be avoided and at the same time take advantage of the inevitable acceleration ramps, as well as collect supplies that allow, by pressing the A button on the controller, to use a furious boost capable of making us recover ground where we are in difficulty, or to increase the distance that separates us from the pursuers. Traps at the end As already widely clarified, Antigraviator tries to offer an experience close to the classic WipEout, using the same futuristic style and the same ~narrative~ devices, with very high-speed races aboard ships equipped with an anti-gravity system. The problem is that these ingredients are not enough to obtain the best possible result, and we realize this as soon as the vehicle hits a wall or, worse, collides with other ships. The physics of the game is in fact inconsistent, you don't feel any weight from the vehicle you drive (which instead was rendered very well in the aforementioned Redout) and this is also reflected in the gameplay, as it is not possible to rely on actual reactions for balance any wrong maneuvers. The possibility of using a twist to ward off the opponents who are coming at us unfortunately is not enough to put a patch on it, and on balance the whole experience comes out strongly weakened, lacking the necessary personality to try to carve out a space within a vein which remains very fascinating, but which sets very specific stakes for those who want to confront each other in a serious way. The problem with Antigraviator is that while it feels inconsistent, it also makes a big misstep in trying to differentiate itself from titles like WipEout. In fact, we are talking about the attack system of the spacecrafts, which cannot collect the usual missiles, barriers, mines and so on on the track, but only have the possibility of activating traps that are triggered at a precise point along the route, without therefore having the direct control of what happens and who is possibly hit, nor being able to exploit this card to damage those in front of us, perhaps taking the lead off them at the last corner thanks to a good hit scored. On the other hand, the upgrade system is good, which although it is not particularly multifaceted allows, between one race and another, to use the credits earned to buy new Gravs or cComponents capable of significantly modifying the performance of the one in our possession, as well as its aesthetic appearance through the use of different shades or complete skins. Let's make two leads From a technical point of view, Antigraviator performs its task discreetly, delivering smooth and, above all, very fast graphics. Futuristic racers use a series of gimmicks to lighten the load, it is well known, and this title is no exception, avoiding weighing down the polygonal structures with particularly defined textures. In the end, the optimization is good but not great, no doubt due to the limitations of the Unity engine, which is certainly not a champion in terms of brute performance. In fact, we expected to be able to run the game without too many problems at 2160p and sixty frames per second on the test configuration, after all we are talking about a decidedly more essential glance than that of Forza Motorsport 7, but we did not succeed . In fact, at real 4K the system takes refuge in the tranquility of thirty frames with motion blur, unsuitable for this type of experience, while we didn't encounter major problems running everything at 1440p and sixty frames, keeping the settings at maximum. The only drawback, in fact, lies in a couple of annoying clicks that usually occur at the beginning of each race, and which also disrupt the audio continuity. In terms of actual design, the twelve available tracks seemed well done and balanced to us, with interesting sections but devoid of originality and unable to surprise due to the solutions adopted. The same can be said for the vehicles, which boast a pleasant appearance but also characterized by a very derivative approach.", "date": "2018-06-07", "grade": "6.8"}
