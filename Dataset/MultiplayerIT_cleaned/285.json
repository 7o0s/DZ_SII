Of course, in doing so you lose 99% of the beauty of the game and, what we can advise you, is to exploit the low realism as little as possible (perhaps only at the beginning) otherwise everything will become boring within a few hours ... just the time to have absorbed the wonder effect due to the graphics (we'll talk about this in a bit). After all, the beauty of a realistic simulator like this is the simulation itself Why do I always end up planted on that tree? Frankly, the lack of a paper manual worthy of the name is somewhat surprising. It is true that Microsoft has included a real interactive encyclopedia within the game, and it is also true that there are many tutorial missions that really teach everything. However, given the price (60 for the basic version and 80 for the Deluxe version), something more than the enclosed leaflets could have been included above all by virtue of the fact that it is not nice having to abandon a flight to refresh some aspects that they are clear. In short, even if Flight Simulators begin to gloss over the manuals, it is not clear what the advantage is of buying a game in the shop rather than in Digital Delivery. Mysteries of a faith Over the years, the definition of genres and the division of the market into many sub-sectors, one of the realities that has managed to maintain its precise identity, creating a large niche of fans (we are talking about more than a million players scattered all over the world) is precisely Flight Simulator, a series that has been reaping successes since 1980 (the first chapter was released on the Apple II) and represents the top in terms of civilian flight simulation. Having reached the tenth chapter, many are wondering: what do fans find in this game? In fact, for those who look at everything from the outside, it is inconceivable to have fun with the apparently anti-game mechanics of FS: having decided on a departure airport, you have to fly to a more or less distant second airport via a precise route. for those who look at everything from the outside it is inconceivable to have fun with the apparently anti-game mechanics of FS Mysteries of a faith In addition to this, it is also difficult to understand how many enthusiasts change PCs only in correspondence with a new release of the game, equipping themselves with avant-garde joysticks and other strange peripherals and, very often, limiting themselves to playing only the Flight Simulator on duty, until the next release . In short, it seems clear that, no matter how much you try to consider it as ~normal~, the simulator par excellence has created a world of its own around it that should be examined as such, abandoning the traditional schemes that apply to consumer games. Just go to one of the numerous sites dedicated to it, where the communities of enthusiasts gather, to understand that even at an aggregate level there are differences with respect to the mass of games and communities that by now water down the mass market. Standard or Deluxe? As tradition has it, this tenth chapter also comes in two versions: the standard and the deluxe. The standard version is actually quite disappointing. Compared to the 2004 version, there are just a few more airports (we're obviously talking about the detailed ones... there are thousands of standard ones anyway) and, of course, the improved graphics. This is not much, also by virtue of the fact that those who are thinking of switching from the old to the new version are probably part of the ranks of those who spend hours crossing the oceans and, perhaps, have also installed some extra airports and planes by exploiting the expansions free amateur ones or by buying the commercial ones (there are really hundreds of them... talking about them deserves a separate article). In short, the standard version, which in any case is not cheap (we are always talking about ten euros more than the average of full price titles), is recommended only for those who want to try a first, simple approach to the game. Standard or Deluxe? With the deluxe version things improve: compared to the other version there are ten more detailed cities, six planes and five airports. The pre-set missions also increased from 30 to 50 and, in addition, a special cockpit and control tower are added.troll. The additions are not few and give the idea of how much the standard version can appear in terms of content compared to the deluxe. How nice, a slideshow before playing ah no, it's the game. But let's get to the real sore point of FSX: the heaviness of the graphics engine. Setting all the details to the maximum, with a P4 at 3.4 GHz, 2 GB of ram and a GeForce 7800 GT, we only got a handful of fps, accounting on the fingers of one hand. Obviously we weren't able to play due to the continuous shots, especially when we found ourselves in the more detailed scenarios (for example when we flew over New York). Set everything to medium detail, the situation improved... but we certainly didn't get the performance leap we expected (let's say we arrived at an average of 20 fps, just to please). Obviously at the lowest level of details, the performances have become excellent pity however that in this way it seems to be faced with a game from three years ago. Reading around the net, it is clear that the problem is general: Flight Simulator X requires a highly pumped computer to be able to run decently with all the details at maximum. the standard version, which in any case is not cheap (we are always talking about ten euros more than the average of full price titles), is recommended only for those who want to try a first, simple approach to the game How nice, a slideshow before playing ah no, it's the game. This is not a secondary problem, above all because a large part of the charm of the series is due precisely to the ultra-detailed representation of the planet Earth which allows you to truly make every journey from one place to another unique. There are quite a few who stop to admire this or that landscape during their virtual journeys and, frankly, having to do so by impoverishing the details makes everything less pleasant, especially if one realizes that at low detail the differences compared to the 2004 version they almost don't exist and above all that the graphics engine is still much heavier. Thinking about this, the minimum recommended requirements (1 GHz processor, 512 MB of ram and a card with 32 MB of ram) make you smile, with which, probably, you will be able to just load the title screen. The missions and the three-dimensional cockpit The missions deserve a separate chapter, an addition that fills the lack of a strictly ~playful~ side in almost all recent FS (let's say from 1998 onwards ... which is a bit the turning point of the series). In short, Microsoft, probably looking for new users (but the novelty will also please the professionals of the series), has decided to insert real missions structured in a narrative way, in which precise objectives must be pursued and choices made to get rewards. Nothing that could revolutionize the series, which in any case maintains all its other characteristics, but certainly something more that will also allow skeptics to find things to do in a product that otherwise would not make sense to them (it is not easy to enter the perspective of the pleasure of flying for its own sake). Another important addition, which can also be deselected by simply changing the view, is the interactive 3D cockpit that will especially appeal to those who have a virtual helmet (a peripheral that links the movements of the head to the cockpit, creating a rather unprecedented enveloping realism), given that using it with a mouse and keyboard, or even a joystick, doesn't do it justice. Conclusions Flight Simulator X is a step forward in the series but nothing that can make the revolution scream, as Microsoft would like. There are some additions and they are also pleasant (especially the missions), allowing you to explore new more strictly playful possibilities. But there are also some big flaws, which somewhat affect the final grade: the lack of a manual and, above all, the general fluidity which is rather poor. Let's also add the long loading times to have a not exactly exciting technical picture (maybe you had to spend a few more months on optimizing). For the rest we are faced with the usual ~best civilian flight simulator~ on the market. You won't find better in any other title. That should be enough, right? Pros It's the best civilian flight simulator on the marketneed more? The missions are a good addition The new graphic engine is definitely nice Cons too bad it's as heavy as Giuliano Ferrara in Platinette's arms A paper manual worthy of the name is missing The standard version is too poorer than the deluxe one Why do I always end up planted on that tree? Describing all the elements that make up Flight Simulator X would require the sameure of an encyclopedia dedicated to aerodynamics and the different models of airplanes that have been included in the game. Without dwelling too much on these aspects which by now, let's say from the 1998 version onwards, represent excellence and which cannot be improved much, we can say that there is nothing more accurate in terms of simulation. By setting the maximum level of realism, you find yourself fighting with all the conceivable problems in a real flight session. Atmospheric conditions, specific difficulties of the different aircraft models, air pockets and so on and so forth. At this level it becomes a feat even to take off in the air, at least for the neophyte. But don't be scared: FSX allows you to set the level of realism to adapt to the level of skill and knowledge of the individual player;", "date": "2006-11-09", "grade": null}
