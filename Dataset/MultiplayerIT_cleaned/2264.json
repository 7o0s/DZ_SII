{"name": "Serious Sam - The Second Encounter", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/serious-sam-the-second-encounter.html", "text": "Crash landing (?) After defeating the gigantic final boss of First Encounter (one of the most colossal that the history of video games remembers), our Sam teleported aboard the allied spaceship to make a detour to the planet Sirius, when an ~air~ collision with a small train of mysterious aliens (which had not calculated the distances well), damages the engines of the ~SSS Centerprice~, causing it to land badly in the mountains of South America, and precisely in Sierra De Chiapas. Here begins Sam's new peregrination, who will face the newfound alien race of the Mentals along the way, who, mindful of the fresh defeat of the first encounter, will be even more pissed off than ever! Twelve beautiful longish levels set in the ancient civilizations of the Maya and Assyro-Babylonians, and then towards the end in the High Middle Ages, with the help of an overhauled arsenal of weapons to which three brand new specimens have been added (the flamethrower , the bone-crushing chainsaw and the sniper rifle), against a tide of enemies to be killed before reaching the place where the mythical Holy Grail is answered and from where the resumption of the journey to Sirius will be feasible. Will our hero succeed? To you the arduous task of helping him in his attempt ... Winning team ... we change! That must have been the opinion of the Croatian programmers when designing Second Encounter. You should know that initially there was one and only Serious Sam in gestation; then, the usual unforeseen events on the roadmap and the Christmas period of the year 2000 pressing upon us forced Croteam to release the game ~early~, separating the initial project into two parts: ~First~, released on last year these days, and ~Second~ completed and going ~gold~ in the first ten days of January 2002. Both were calculated at budget price (about 20 dollars each). Furthermore, part of the layout of the new levels present in Second Encounter had already been designed at the birth of the First version! The common opinion of all, however, is that the ~unforeseen~ subdivision has helped a lot, given that the technical advances implemented on the proprietary graphics engine have revitalized the product in its second part and added other graphic gems, which initially were not yet to be devised. But we will talk about this in the dedicated special, while now we are preparing to examine the very important aspect of playability. Winning team ... we change! A small introduction is a must. The final months of 2001 saw us participate in two great remakes in single-player FPS: Aliens VS Predator 2 and Return to Castle Wolfenstein, to which our Second Encounter is now added. Having completed all three games at a hardcore level, I was able to draw conclusions about the three different styles of play, comparing them: in Avp2 the programmers have skilfully and excellently created a background plot (so well designed as to be a source of inspiration for a futuristic film of Aliens VS Predator!), with a varied style of play, given by the presence of the three races, all controllable and each with its own characteristics and missions, especially as they are ~crossed~ with each other, creating a sort of continuous thread and making the game a unique experience to try absolutely. Return to Castle Wolfenstein, on the other hand, was based on the classic FPS plot of the last two years, taking a bit of Project IGI, a bit of Soldier of Fortune and amalgamating everything with exceptional graphics, but which in the end left a bit bitter in the mouth for the brevity and extreme linearity of the singleplayer missions. Instead Second Encounter continued to follow the line drawn by First Encounter: lots of ~shoot'em'up~ style action, very few puzzles if not some mere open-air puzzles, combined with a background story that if it wasn't present it didn't change then a lot to the game. A style, in conclusion, purely identical to the predecessor, where the reflections prevail over the gray matter: go ahead in the levels, eliminating wave after wave of enemies that crowd around, with tons of lead, laser shots and flames in tow, helped however by a extreme fluidity given by the excellent graphics engine, which manages the whole in a masterly way! This is in summary Serious Sam, pure and simple action, but repetitive in its modus operandi. Already! The ~average~ gamer has become demanding and sometimes the action alone is not enough to make a game a success. But in the case of Serious Sam, one concept has always been clear: highlighting its ~evolved arcade~ aspect, which places the player in front of an opponent made up of numerous wavesose of ~stupid~ aliens, who pounce without any regard towards the drawn weapons of the character. The mass attack that overrides AI and everything else. Nothing more, nothing less. In conclusion The overall technical aspect has evolved a lot: the graphics have been enhanced, more variety has been added to the levels thanks to the setting of three different civilizations, the tragi-comic-looking enemies of the first installment have been established (on all Kamikaze and the Syrian Bulls) and some new cast members have been added (the Cucurbit with the chainsaw prominently). Furthermore, the cooperative mode has been confirmed, giving that extra touch to team play. In fact, the bulk of the restoration was done precisely by the multiplayer section, which with eight deathmatch maps and the addition of another thirteen in the ~Warped Deathmatch~ Mod, filled the gaps of the first version, which was lacking its own base in this category. Croteam seems to have exploited the Serious Sam topic beyond its limit, which is starting to show evident signs of ~deja-vu~ and which we will hardly see again in its third incarnation except with something ~totally~ original. The impression is that Second Encounter represents the swan song of a style of play that shows all its years and that diminishes more and more over time, to make way for other more complete ones (e.g. Avp2) of a albeit ~evolved~ shoot and run which is Serious Sam. The purchase is highly recommended for fans of the first part, who will not be disappointed by this ~second encounter~. To the others, considering that the game is quite hectic, I suggest you download and try the demo ... you never know! The second (and last?) meeting with Sam! Final release of Second Encounter under review. After having thoroughly described the levels, weapons and graphic effects added (see the Special: Day One, Day Two, and Day Three) we are preparing to definitively comment on the new Croteam creation, announcing two other ~focuses~ created for the occasion (and which will be published shortly): one on the differences between the first and second Sam, the other on the -full-bodied- Multiplayer section. We therefore leave the aforementioned aspects to these last two articles, while in the present one we deal with the ~qualitative~ aspect of the game, in a sort of final mega-comment. Off to the dance then, with the inevitable introduction to the plot as a hat.", "date": "2002-01-25", "grade": null}
