The bridge that connects the institute to the city collapsed due to the flooding of the river. In Detention, nothing is as it seems It's pouring rain and it's cold. The two are completely alone. We are in 1960 and the Republic of China, not to be confused with the People's Republic of China, is under an authoritarian regime which, fearing the advent of communism, has instituted martial law, with which it aims to repress all forms of dissent. In the country there is censorship of books contrary to the regime, or more simply of all those that can help create alternative forms of thought, while political opponents are brutally imprisoned and eliminated. Kay and Wei don't know what to do except wait for the rain to stop. Holed up in a classroom, Wei decides to go look for food and blankets for the night, and to go to the director's office to call for help. The two part ways and then all hell breaks loose. Kay finds herself alone and in a different place than where she remembered being. The atmosphere has changed, there are candles everywhere and disturbing scenes unfold before her eyes. What happened? Where has Wei gone? Why does all hell seem to have poured into the school? From here on the story of Detention turns into a horror tale, where historical reality, popular legends and nightmares intertwine and nothing is what it seems. Detention is an amazing horror game and one of the first masterpieces of 2017 Unconscious A clich wants it to be what from which nothing is expected to surprise the most. Detention is one of the many titles released quietly on Steam, which risked going unnoticed. Fortunately it didn't go like this and the work of the unknown Red Candles managed to rise to the fore, mainly driven by word of mouth. Describing Detention as a 2D horror point-and-click adventure risks underplaying it. Not that it isn't, but after finishing it it's hard to think of it as a Monkey Island, as the word Silent comes to mind several times, followed by that Hill. The action takes place in essentially 2D environments Sure, the puzzles are there, the pointer too, but it's the gameplay as a whole that suggests that we're dealing with something else. Detention wants to tell its story at all costs. The more you go on in the adventure, the more you understand that this is its urgency. The puzzles aren't there to block the player, but to accompany him in discovering the immense tragedy hidden by the events happening on the screen. Some even seem absurd, if you don't read them in their purely narrative function. Only then does one come to understand why a gun is described as a list or why a radio can give access to distant memories, but connected in the protagonist's mind. The whole experience is constructed as if it were a long nightmare, in which the pieces of Kay's life are associated in the typical way of a dream. It soon becomes clear that the supernatural presences that have taken over the school aren't the real horror to deal with, but that there's a deeper, more horrific truth we're trying to unearth. Inner truth, but also historical, which when it finally emerges, with all the desperation it brings with it, cannot leave one indifferent. What initially might have seemed like a simple school-themed adolescent horror suddenly becomes something else, surprising and involving the player in an unexpected plot, in which the supernatural is transfigured into the human. Removal Sure, there are ghosts, taken from Taiwanese folklore, that need to be avoided, but don't expect to find in Detention banal jumps on the chair scattered here and there to guarantee free screaming on YouTube. The atmosphere that permeates the entire game is more disturbing than frightening and the tension that reigns explodes in rare moments of horror, which are built with great intelligence, never letting go of easy solutions. Let's take an example: one of the ghosts must be overcome by walking and holding your breath. Kay can only stop breathing for a few moments, so you have to choose the right moment to start it, but only after getting close enough to the creature to be able to pass it in the time available. There is a lot of Taiwanese folklore in the game No sudden surprises, therefore, but only a very strong tension, which subsides when one is saved. A second type of ghost was used in a different, but equally clever way. A document placed at the beginning of the chapter in which it appears suggests its presence and explains how to avoid it. Herhowever, appearances are rare, so as not to get used to the player, who experiences each meeting as an event. In this way even the simple exploration becomes more tense, because you are always on the alert until the end of the chapter. On the sidelines of everything, you will have understood that Detention is not what we would define as a rich production, but Red Candle has been able to make perfect use of the means at its disposal, without ever overdoing it. The same intelligence used to create the ghosts can also be found in all the other aspects of the game, starting from the apparently simple graphics, poor in certain details, but excellent in style and in its ability to visually accompany the story, as in the column sound, made up of painful and never intrusive passages, from music that recalls the regime and from disturbing sounds that help to better describe the environments. The truth is that Detention could only have existed with this approach, the only one capable of conveying the underlying theme of the play, which is the staging of the sense of guilt in the great theater of the unconscious. There is no redemption in the rejection of reality, i.e. in the removal of what has been and what has been done, as the two endings make us clearly understand, one positive and one negative, both to be seen because they tell the two sides of the whole each other, without ever being consoling.
