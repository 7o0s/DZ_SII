Since the gap between the two parties has narrowed (while remaining quite substantial, of course), the French developers have always tried to make the brand make the proverbial leap in quality, indeed never fully succeeding. Let's see if the right opportunity has come with this last chapter, Gangstar Vegas. Las Vegas died Just to clarify immediately that not even this time Gameloft intends to put some original elements on the plate, Gangstar Vegas presents itself as a GTA clone characterized however by a plot that has so much in common with the Pulp Fiction segment starring Bruce Willis. The user plays the role of Jason, an MMA fighter guilty of having betrayed the agreement stipulated with an underworld boss who expected to end up knocked down in his last fight: hunted down by criminals, our hero will have to ally himself with an opposing faction in order to survive, perhaps climbing the top of the mafia organization along the way. An unexciting incipit followed by a development of the plot that certainly does not improve the situation: the story wearily proceeds between clichs, gratuitous vulgarities and meaningless dialogues, exploiting interlude sequences so boring as to soon induce one to skip them at the same time thanks to the appropriate icon. However, if certain shortcomings on the part of Gameloft are not surprising that much by now, at the same time we must give credit to the transalpine software house for always filling its titles with a large amount of playful content, a rule that Gangstar Vegas does not escape: the map gaming area -rather vast- hosts a considerable number of primary and secondary missions, as well as places to visit and possibly buy to increase one's income, objects to collect and even a handful of gambling simulations which, given the location, make definitely their good figure. Not only that: Jason's abilities can be upgraded with a progression system borrowed from RPGs, the shop where you can buy weapons and vehicles can be accessed with a tap at any time and there's even a sort of reward system. with keys that are given following specific objectives and that are used to open special surprise-cases. Here, if the value of a game was measured by the number of elements it contains, Gangstar Vegas would be an excellent product: unfortunately, however, we also have to deal with the gameplay, an aspect that Gameloft seems to have decidedly underestimated. The missions are trivial and repetitive, the driving model of the cars is unsatisfactory, the combat system is plagued by far too many inaccuracies and the controls are no less, capable of making even the most basic movements within the scenario wooden. It is hard to see even that care in the technical values which has often played the role of a real lifesaver in the evaluation of many titles of the French software house. Although it absolutely cannot be defined as a bad game from a visual point of view, Gangstar Vegas showcases many small flaws that make you turn up your nose, from the clipping of the scenery to the unstable frame rate, from the frequent polygonal interpenetrations to the uninspiring quality of the textures, culminating with some truly sensational ~oversights~, such as the characters who don't move their mouths when they speak. The icing on the cake, during our tests the software became the protagonist of numerous bugs, above all one that systematically crashed the application at startup, which could only be circumvented by deactivating the wi-fi connection. Even with all the defects that have just been listed, Gangstar Vegas is not an unplayable title, and the most ardent fans of the genre could even turn a blind eye (if not even two) to all the distortions of a chapter evidently made with little care, being rewarded with an adventure that is still rich in content and quite long-lasting. What is certain is that for any next chapters the Gangstar series will need a drastic change of course. A chapter that instead of improving the series makes them take a couple of steps backwards", "date": "2013-06-21", "grade": "5.5"}
