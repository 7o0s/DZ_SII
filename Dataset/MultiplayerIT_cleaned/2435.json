{"name": "ATV Offroad", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/atv-offroad.html", "text": "4 jumps on the ~panettone~... To begin with, let's talk about the vehicle we will have to use: the ATV. This acronym is the abbreviation of All Terrain Vehicle, or four-wheeled vehicles (which we have often seen used in American TV series such as Baywatch) which have suspensions that are able to withstand very high loads so as to allow incredible jumps. However, this is not the only peculiarity of these ~motorcycles~, in fact what would be the fun of doing four straight jumps?! You say a casino! But no, because the beauty is that, given the enormous handling, you can perform formidable tricks, given and then considered the shape of the ATV. Even if the top speeds are not very high (about 130/140 Km/h) the various game modes are also focused on this aspect, as well as obviously on the execution of the tricks. Being a title directly translated from the Stars and Stripes version (where, however, this sport is fairly followed), the races refer to the National Maxxis, and we pass from the classic indoor tracks chock full of ~panettoni~ (for the uninitiated they are those bumps that follow a climb and which allow, if taken at the right speed, to make fairly high jumps) to the most unpredictable external tracks with hills and mountains as much as I can't. However, the game allows you to try your hand either in the classic points races, where the aim is to get among the top three so as to accumulate points to move on to the next level, all of course on pre-established tracks, or in Freestyle where the player is free to move 360 over the entire playing area in order to perfect your evolutions. There is also a Cross Country mode where the aim is to reach the checkpoints and beat the other competitors, also a sort of training and finally the career option which makes you face all the modes in sequence. Real or unreal? From a purely playful point of view we are faced with a very amusing title with the right mix between real and unreal, that is if on the one hand the behavior of the vehicles is very real with suspensions that sink in an impressively concrete way, on the other hand if Rubbia would be horrified to see this game given that the physics of the ATVs are extremely dubious it is in fact strange that you can make jumps of several tens of meters and land peacefully in at least impossible areas! However, this should by no means be seen as a defect, on the contrary, because everything is beneficial for a greater involvement which otherwise would have resulted in frustration. A consideration must be made on artificial intelligence: although it is average, with opponents who tend to maintain the position without too many jokes, we too often find ourselves in annoying situations, such as when the computer falls and gets back on the saddle immediately, on the contrary for us, a few really annoying seconds pass! It's not GT3 but... As far as the graphic aspect is concerned, as I have already said, we are on excellent levels, even if strangely not all the textures are detailed in the same way. The frame rate is good with some occasional slowdown that is irrelevant. Different speech if you play in four, with an evident decrease in polygons and a more subtle decrease in total speed. The sound part is really excellent, with several ~heavy~ titles by groups such as Anthrax and Soundgarden, which blend well with the atmosphere of the game, even if however we must point out the presence of some dance pieces that honestly have nothing to do with it! ! In conclusion I can say that I had a lot of fun playing with this Offroad ATV and that even if you only have eyes for Gt3 right now, I suggest you take a look at it because it's really worth it. Pros: Very funny Spectacular stunts Great music Cons: Maybe too unreal jumps The release of GT3 could make it overshadow Out and about with the ATV It really has to be said, finally in the Ps2 games catalog several really excellent titles are appearing that bode well for the future of this astounding console, also because the beginning was not the best, with games just above the sufficiency and poorly programmed or done in a hurry to be able to meet the market needs. This Offroad ATV obviously follows this new ~trend~, which reflects greater care on the part of the programmers in the development of the title, a fact which is certainly due to the greater time available to get to know and properly exploit the hardware that so divided the critics of the car launch. I believe that the much-discussed programming difficulties are relative or at least, if overcome, can allow the development of all those titles that today make us cry out for a miracle (see Gt3 or Metal Gear 2). ATV Offroad certainly does not push the console to its highest levels as the Pholyphony Digital title does, but it can be considered to all intents and purposes one of the best driving titles for the Sony black monolith. Of course, the typology is a bit atypical but those who have had Pc-istic experiences with the two Motocross Madnesses will quickly understand what type of game I'm talking about.", "date": "2001-07-23", "grade": null}
