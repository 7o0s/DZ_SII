{"name": "Fifa 2001", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fifa-2001_a.html", "text": "Second premise The FIFA series has the characteristic of being extremely easy. After a few days of play you are already able to use very poor teams by winning with several goals difference against the more famous teams. I still remember when with San Marino, in FIFA 98, I won trophies after trophies and in FIFA 2000, creating a team from scratch with the characteristics of all the players to a minimum, I fought for the top positions in the standings. FIFA 2001 doesn't differ much, and in the ~virtual~ game that I'll show you shortly you'll understand what I mean. In the meantime let's start by exploring all the menus that FIFA 2001 offers us. The important thing is to win Among the various game modes we certainly find the most interesting and realistic one: the championship. Starting from a team chosen by you from a championship present in FIFA 2001, it will be possible to cover the whole championship and the relative national cup. At the end of the season, depending on the result obtained in the standings (and in the cup), the next championship will be played with the tournaments won. For example, if you win the Italian championship, the following year, in addition to the championship and the Italian cup, you will also play the Champions Cup. Other game modes include trophies (including World Cup) and creating your own league/cup. FIFA 2001 Internet Finally the FIFA series can offer, with the 2001 ~version~, the possibility of confronting other players via the Internet. In addition to the classic online game modes, it is therefore possible to connect to the servers that manage online matches. The games are certainly more involving, but it is necessary to have at least one ISDN line free from lag in order not to find oneself enveloped by the lag itself (very evident in FIFA 2001) or by excessively long uploads. FIFA Upgrades It is possible to customize the teams by acting on the individual players, on the team uniform, on transfers, on the field layout, on the bench and on the shooters. Examples are shown in the screenshots above: as can be seen from the images, these aspects, probably the most ~complex~ in theory, are very easy to use in practice. Note the graphical quality of the players in the previous screenshots. Furthermore, with a few clicks of the mouse, it was possible to update the old Bologna shirt (in the photo with Signori) to this year's (horrid, cursed Umbro) one (second photo). In any case, EA Sports has ensured to publish updates on the teams during the coming year, so as to keep the game up to date. Great move. Now that we have finished the overview of the main menus of the game, we will try to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the game with a very particular match: Bologna vs Barcelona. Are you expecting a goal from the Basque team? We contact the Barcelona management First of all, through the ~Game Mode~ menu seen above, it is possible to create a friendly match between your favorite teams. In this case, an unequal game at first sight: Barcelona (in FIFA 2001 they are among the teams with the best characteristics) and Bologna, whose championship last year did not do them justice, finding themselves with values well below deserved ones. Later you can choose the team control method. it can be changed at any time during the game. The keys are fixed, unfortunately you can't change them, but they are still intuitive. If you have a keyboard with non-conflicting keys (like the old IBM ones) then the use of the keyboard, compared to the joypad, is more than ever recommended: why use only 4 fingers (if not 2) with a joypad when can use up to 8 at the same time with the keyboard? We then choose the keyboard and give the ok. There are 3 difficulties to choose from (selectable in the options and also during the game): we will choose the most difficult one, so as to discover all the potential that the game can offer. So let the teams enter the field! Graphics and comments I would like to point out that all the images that follow, even if they come from the replays, are all images from the game, they are not pre-edited photos. The graphics in FIFA 2001 are stunning and packed with detail. The movements of the players are fluid and real, the spectators engaging (if seen from a distance) and the sideline innovative: cameras, photographers, volunteers and their respective benches! The faces are increasingly similar to the real ones, while from this year the shirts faithfully reflect those of the last championship (advertising included, as regards the top 10 teams of eachin the championship). The comments are by the legendary couple Caputi-Bulgarelli, with the roles reversed with respect to the commentary on TMC: in this case, therefore, Bulgarelli is the commentator and Caputi the commentator. The acting borders on the painful, but it is handled very well by the software: the comments are therefore varied and timely. Furthermore, let me tell you, it is impossible not to be enveloped by Bulgarelli's persuasive ~esse~ (or rather: ~essce~) and ~zeta~ (or rather: ~silk~) from Bologna. But let's move on, and let's start... pardon, let's start the game! Game tactics: the lateral foul, the cross and the header Let's go back to our game. Bologna starts clearly underdog, and its attack is interrupted. With a slide from a Bolognese midfielder, the ball goes wide. Throw-in then for Barcelona. Now, pay attention: the fellow players of the thrower are essentially stationary until the ball touches the ground (you can use patterns, which sometimes mess up the situation a lot), while the opponents remain stationary until the throw-in in ball play. Hence, before the lateral foul, the Bologna player finds himself behind, after the throw-in he slips forward, stealing the ball from whoever was supposed to receive the ball. This movement is practically automatic, the player doesn't have to do anything. This limits the player-to-player ratio enormously, and is one of the reasons why the playability of FIFA has always been considered limited. Have you noticed that the Bara player is always standing still, while the Bologna player circles around him? At this point Bologna have the ball: a forward pass towards Oliveira, who crosses... Signori hits the ball... and Bologna takes the lead! Running on the wing is a very simple operation, which will lead Bologna to score twice again with the same method. If you are in the middle of the field or shortly after, to get rid of the opponents simply ~twirl~ on themselves, as the opposing players do not yet need to enter a foul slide. Conversely, near the corner flag it will be necessary to ~jump~ the players who will slide indiscriminately. The turn is done by pressing the ~ALT~ key, the jump by pressing the ~CTRL~ key. Once you reach the edge of the field it is necessary to cross. In FIFA 2001, as in FIFA 2000 and unlike the previous versions, passing the ball on the ground has become highly discouraged (the famous ~passeggini~ of FIFA 99 are now an ancient memory). Crosses (like shots from your own half) have become key to setting up counter-attacks and winning headers. To cross (and to make any high pass) you need to press the ~A~ key. At this point, hitting the head is equivalent to shooting. The computer automatically selects the player who will try to hit the ball, so the only thing to do is immediately press (just once) the key to shoot: ~D~. Goal. Acrobatics towards the penalty area Running towards the penalty area and mocking the goalkeeper is a difficult task. Succeeding it, once the opposing defensive tactic is understood, is equally difficult, but much more achievable. As described before, in the midfield area it is good to spin and pass the ball. Near the area it is better to jump. Shooting is never in a hurry, and FIFA 2001 gives us one more reason to plan more accurate tactics: the power of the shot. When you kick the ball with the shoot button (~D~) after halfway, in fact, you no longer pass the ball but shoot it directly at the goal. By pressing ~D~ a bar appears indicating the power of the shot: the longer you hold down the button, the more the bar fills up and the shot is more powerful. If you exaggerate, however, the bar turns red and the shot is powerful, but also uncoordinated: most of the time the ball will go out of bounds. It is therefore important to get rid of the opponents and have the right time to load the shot. Game menus and strategies Many options can be changed at any time during the game. Among the many, the layout on the field is very important (during the game it can be recalled with the space bar): FIFA 2001 allows 3 predefined layouts (however modifiable by the player): in this case we choose a defensive one, in fact at the end of the first half Bologna wins 2 to 0, and a good bolt never hurts. Fouls are obviously expected, and the degree of severity of the referee can be chosen (or left random). Punishments are therefore frequent, especially with slips from behind. In the following screenshot you can see the screen that appears when you kick apenalty: you can choose whether to pass the ball to a specific player (1 = ~A~, 2 = ~W~, 3 = ~D~) or shoot in the direction of the red arrow with the power shown in the already mentioned bottom bar ( with the ~S~ key). The match ends with a nice 4 to 1 for Bologna. The most modest team defeats one of the best of FIFA 2001 by humiliating her, and with the maximum difficulty. So things have not changed much from the previous chapters. To make you understand how the playability has remained intact compared to previous years, here is a brief summary of Bologna's career that I have personally carried out (starting immediately with the highest difficulty): first championship: Bologna seventh and excluded from the Italian cup in the second round . Second league: Bologna first in the league and winner of the Coppa Italia. Third championship: Bologna first in the championship, first in the Italian Cup and first in the Champions Cup. To conclude FIFA 2001 is a worthy new version of FIFA 2000: better graphics, internet play and... and... and that's it. Playability remains similar to the previous chapter, especially since those who have exploited FIFA 2000 to the limit will not find anything new in FIFA 2001. The graphics are indeed amazing, but if a green field is framed for 95% of the match, the rest of the improvements are not even noticeable. However, the small innovations such as the shooting bar or headers, which are increasingly fundamental, are interesting. Player fatigue, fundamental in FIFA 99 and curiously less decisive in FIFA 2000, while still present has become completely unnecessary: players never get tired enough to have to plan substitution tactics. In any case FIFA 2001, for those who have never tried the EA Sports football series, is still a must: at the moment there are no football games that can compete with it on PC. Attention to owners of the first PlayStation: FIFA 2001 will probably be the last chapter for this platform, it seems that from 2002 FIFA will become a game exclusively developed for PC and PS2. However, counting that for the Sony console there are equally famous football titles, it will not be a drama  Premise It's hard to start a review without immediately judging this EA Sports product. To say that it has remained identical to FIFA 2000 is heresy, as many improvements have been made. Probably the correct term is ~updated version~: many things have been improved, but the basic structure has remained practically identical to that of FIFA 2000. Since my words could have a purely subjective value, only facts and images will confirm or not my thought.", "date": "2001-04-27", "grade": null}
