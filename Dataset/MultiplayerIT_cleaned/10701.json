Wallace, on the other hand, a wizard in riding catastrophes, decides to open a seaside resort in the basement, and to invite citizens as his customers. First, therefore, we will have to satisfy the dissatisfied, obviously numerous, while towards the end we will have to investigate a mysterious event, linked to the ambiguous nature of Miss Flitty's dogs. If you lack the logical link it is not serious, the second episode, although more solid and triumphal in some respects, stumbles in the management of the pace and the characters. The cast is in full force, but they are like unwanted guests in the space that binds Wallace and Gromit, who you will see interact very little here: a comic duo lives on the alchemy that binds the parts, and if dispersed, it loses its raison d'etre . For this reason the cast, here in full force, often plays the part of the guest who abuses hospitality, and who would like to be accompanied to the door. Curiosity Fright of the Bumblebees is the first in a series of four episodes dedicated to Wallace & Gromit and developed by Telltale. The software house has undertaken to release them on a monthly basis and Multiplayer.it will follow them promptly with a complete review. Note only that it is not possible to purchase the episodes separately, as they are only sold as a complete package. I, you... them That's not to say the characters aren't funny: there's a vein of humor brimming with Anglo-Saxon spirit that pulses through the second episode, though it doesn't give everyone the same colour. Of course you must find it entertaining, and frankly, no matter how nimble one is with the English language, a foreign speaker cannot instantly grasp all the nuances. Fortunately, the puzzles come our way, which start off mildly and then get complicated along the way, but always designed to be solved on a totally logical basis, and therefore very satisfying. Certainly some mechanics are similar to those seen in the first episode, but they have not lost their basic originality for this. It's just a pity that the story lacks pace, so that it never really gets off the ground, also due to the attention shared between all the characters. Although the solidity of the atmosphere and the cleanliness of the game are still of a high level, the problems related to the hybrid controls remain, for which we advise you to abandon the mouse and keyboard in favor of a joypad, also due to the fact that you will have to move often up and down the stairs. Furthermore, most of the adventure will be spent in the same, few locations. Regardless of its shortcomings, however, Wallace & Gromit Episode 2: The Last Resort is entertaining and with just enough character to warrant five or six hours of gags, follies and puzzles: good for some, and excellent for those of the duo who are not familiar with it. an episode is lost at the cinema.", "date": "2009-06-11", "grade": "6.9"}
