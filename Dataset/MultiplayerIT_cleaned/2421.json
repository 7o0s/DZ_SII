{"name": "Evil Dead ~Hail To The King~", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/evil-dead-hail-to-the-king_a.html", "text": "Evil Dead ~Hail To The King~ arrives almost twenty years after the making of the film ~Evil Dead~ (La casa) a b-movies by director Sam Raimi, which has become a cult for mixing horror and demented humor, with a truly unique rhythm It is funny. The film had two sequels: House 2 (which is more of a remake) and Army of Darkness (highly recommended). The protagonist of the saga, Bruce Campbell, who plays the mythical character of ~Ash~, a young supermarket clerk who finds himself fighting the undead. Ash, will be the character you will control in the game. Are you ready for the horror? In the timeline, the story of the game takes place after the events of all three films. In practice, Ash wanted to return (again?) to that cursed house to try to overcome the anxiety that still torments him at night (no sleeping pills, eh?). Unfortunately, ~evil~ still haunts those woods.. and the story repeat! (if he asked for it though). Evil Dead ~Hil To The King~ winks at games like ~Resident Evil~ and ~Alone in The Dark~ (paradoxically those games were inspired by the Evil Dead movie). The style is now typical of survival horror (3D characters and 2D scenarios), fun puzzles to solve, objects to combine with others, medical kits to collect and... lots of zombies. The aim of the first part of the game is to find your new missing girl and collect the pages of the ~book of the dead~ (such as Necronomicom) from which to extrapolate the magic formula to bring the undead back into the coffins. In the second part (the game is on two CDs!) you will be catapulted into the Middle Ages (as per the script) and the aim will be to return home (alive). If you are a fan of the film like me (perhaps it was intuition?) you will immediately understand that these ingredients are perfect for an Evil Dead game! Are we then faced with a masterpiece? Not exactly. Let's say right away that the most beautiful thing in the game is the famous chainsaw of ~Ash~ (Viuleeeeenzaa!). Graphically speaking, the atmosphere makes it good (certain details, such as the tool shed are epic) but everything could have been done better. The grainy textures with smudged shades (plus the low lighting) annoy, camouflaging doors and passages (and it's not intended .. see hig-res version on PC). Horribleeeee! The biggest defect of this title is however the difficulty calibrated in a disastrous way and cannot be set from the options menu (no EASY level in short). It's really frustrating going through hordes of zombies that keep popping up from under the ground. In practice, the enemies are infinite, because if you retrace your steps they will be resurrected again and again! they are not difficult to kill but they are really too many for a game that should also be exploratory. This flaw makes it difficult to move even for a few meters, reducing the game to a ~minefield~ and neutralizes the surprise effect that should ~scare~ the player only at certain times and let him patrol once a clean sweep (Resident Evil teaches). The audio (unfortunately?) is the best thing about the game. Bruce Campbell has personally voiced his 3D alter-ego and the epic soundtrack has been curated by the orchestra of Tommy Tallarico (one of the best videogame soundtrack composers). However, the Pal version of ~Hail To The King~ hasn't been localized in Italian (not even the subtitles !). Bottom line: it's not the best Survival Horror (but just the umpteenth) and it's not the best tie-in (but just the umpteenth wasted license). As for me, I will write this title on the ~book of the dead~ but maybe... I'm a little blinded by disappointment as a fan. If you have the chance, try it first anyway.. maybe you'll be able to tolerate what I consider uncomfortable flaws. Horribleeeee! Pros: the charm of the film and survival horror longevity (2 CDs) Cons: hostile playability and therefore frustrating not excellent technical realization From film to video game Tie-in: video games inspired by the plot of a film. In the 8 and 16 bit era of each film they made the corresponding video game. Today, it seems that software houses prefer other stories and are less interested in buying a (expensive) film license, slowly abandoning the style of releasing the game at the same time as the film. Now the Tie-ins come out (if they come out) generally after years from the arrival of the film at the cinema, almost to be certain that it first becomes a cult, as in the cases of Blade Runner (Pc), Die Hard-Trilogy (Psone), or this highly anticipated Evil Dead.", "date": "2001-08-13", "grade": null}
