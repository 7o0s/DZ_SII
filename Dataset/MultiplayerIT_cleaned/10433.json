The visual simulation of the match, despite its extreme simplicity, succeeded in its intent to provide a visual feedback of the movements made on the pitch by our players, while the classic ~commentary~ scrolled at the bottom of the screen. Slightly ahead of the last episode, Football Manager Handheld 2010 therefore reaches stores with the intention of offering an even more complete and exciting product for purists of the genre. Goal achieved? Not exactly. It seems that the SEGA series has taken a breather, proceeding more by inertia than anything else towards the appointment with the 2010 football season. Kick off The early stages of the game revolve around setting up your game and saving your profile. We must therefore create our own alter ego, select the currency to consider for the market and choose the team we want to train among those available, usually very numerous. Each team enjoys a different status in terms of financial possibilities: they range from the teams in decent condition to the frighteningly rich ones. Choosing a team that fights for salvation means ~flying low~ in terms of end-of-season goals, but the game allows us in any case to exaggerate to get something more from the management. The problem will then justify the failure to achieve those goals, possibly. If you choose a rich team, the situation is immediately very different: in the face of high expectations, both for the championship and for the international leagues, the greater amount of money clearly facilitates our purchases. If you coach a provincial team you will often hear the answer that this player is considered non-transferable, only to see him move on to a noble team. On the contrary, having the means and the name of a high-level company at your disposal will make things much easier for you. At that point, the difficult thing will be simply to obtain the points necessary to become champions. The season begins with a fairly substantial and very important study phase for what your results on the pitch will be. In fact, you have to face friendly matches and assess the health of your owners, to understand whether or not something needs to be changed. Interval Football Manager Handheld gives us ample freedom with regards to setting up the formation, the form, the attitude of the individual players and the team, the strategies, and so on. At the same time, it is possible to organize training sessions involving the various departments to improve their general condition (which is always indicated on the screen, not only by the classic arrows but also by a numerical percentage). The psychological aspect is not neglected either, even if this element limits itself to considering the more or less frequent use of a player as well as the its possible transferability. It's even possible to pack up and go on a holiday while the championship is at a crucial stage, leaving our second-in-command to manage the team and only returning when the games are over. In short, you can do anything and everything has some influence on what will happen once you start the match simulation. In this sense it must be said that the lack of changes in this sense disappoints not a little: although the commentary is also customizable down to the smallest detail as well as in speed, by now all the managers offer a visual simulation and we would have expected the same from this portable reduction. It didn't necessarily need to go big, but after a year still seeing colored dots pushing the ball into the net doesn't help to think that great efforts have been made to make the product more engaging. It goes to penalties Visual match simulation isn't the only thing missing from this new edition of Football Manager Handheld, sadly. The doubts raised about the goodness of the interface in last year's episode remain valid, as the changes made do not go in the right direction. Your presence is appreciable connections that allow us to reach, with the pressure of a single key, the file relating to a team or a player, but the use of the analog stick is still inexplicably limited: why use it only for ~jumps~ in the selection when it would be You can place a pointer on the screen econtrol it like this? Scrolling and choosing operations would be greatly speeded up and the general experience could only benefit from it. Relying on the mere d-pad and scrolling dozens and dozens of lines to get where you want is a bit of an extreme of the concept according to which football managers are by nature slow and boring applications, dedicated only to a niche user.", "date": "2009-10-27", "grade": "7.0"}
