{"name": "SSX Tricky", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ssx-tricky-9.html", "text": "Structure The EA Sports Big product falls into the category of snowboard games (a racing game, to be precise) with tons of arcade elements. But don't be fooled by this last statement! In fact, while not simulating a real board race, this title has a considerable depth of the control system. Although it must be emphasized that from the first games it is possible to master the character sufficiently to face the beginning of the championship. Even if it is with practice that ~SSXT~ expresses its playful potential which, I remember, is not a trivial matter. Video game geeks (as well as myself) will surely have tested the power and speed of the first episode that appeared on the Sony black box. Who didn't like it? I don't see hands raised. But it's obvious! The fact is that the previous chapter, as well as the latter, offers a simple and infinite gameplay at the same time accompanied by a good technical realization and a pumped up soundtrack. In short, a very fun game that was able to give a hand to the PS2 video game market which, at that time, was struggling to offer anything innovative. This latest episode, released well in advance on PS2 compared to the cubic version, features the same omelette (remember that the team that wins doesn't change...) but seasoned in a different way, just enough to make it a little tastier. First of all, the control system is identical to the one present in ~SSX~, even if playing with the very small digital cross recessed on the GC pad is not that comfortable ... The left analog stick is dedicated to the rotation of the boards and legs of the character on the track, the A key to jump and prewind, the B key to adrenaline rushes, and finally we have the table grabs which are carried out by pressing the dorsal triggers in flight. Only initially will it be a little complicated to assimilate all the commands and enter into symbiosis with the minute purple pad, but I assure you that about fifteen minutes will be enough to become one with the selected character. Be careful because after prolonged game sessions you will even start talking like your virtual alter ego. Believe it. The playful experience that ~SSXT~ offers to the player is very deep and satisfying. The fun will take you by surprise after a few minutes in front of (or in?) the screen and it will become increasingly difficult to detach from the joypad. This is because as you get better you can adopt a different and alternative style of board control that will always make you feel new emotions. So also when you learn to KO opposing racers (via the right stick) and your adrenaline bar will rise to the maximum. The only flaw of the game, which only applies to those who have consumed the old chapter on PS2, is the excessive resemblance to its predecessor. What is certain is that the owner of the GC who has never had the opportunity to try them on the Sony monolith will be delighted by the ~new~ fun that ~SSXT~ will be able to give him. The only difference between the old and the new episode lies in the presence, in the latter, of new tricks (called Uber Tricks) which give the player who performs five in a row in the same race the opportunity to draw on adrenaline rushes (turbo) at all times until the end of the stroke. The other addition is represented by some new characters (six), a new track and a restyling of the old ones (now more refined and exciting). Technically better on GC or PS2? In terms of technical realization, it is sad to note that the cubed version is slightly lower than that for the Sony console. This is found in the frame rate (which never takes off and has much more frequent slowdowns) and also in the absence of motion blur when you unload the adrenaline to go faster. All this is not justified at all, being the Nintendo machine more powerful and easier to program than the Sony one. The situation gets worse if you take into account the delay with which this cube game arrived in stores. Usually when there are transpositions from one console to another and, above all, when you have a lot of time available, the products should improve and not the other way around. However technically ~SSXT~ does not leave too satisfied. This would have happened if the game had come out a year ago, but it's not. The tracks are very beautiful and evocative to see (especially that of Mercury City), as well as some lighting effects. The characters are well defined but not too real and their animationsi as well as the movements appear very well done. Even the color palette fits perfectly and makes the visual experience all in all enjoyable (at least when there are no frame rate drops ). The graphics of the product in question, therefore, are not sparse, on the contrary! The problem lies in the fact that everything seems a little dated and that the programmers of the Canadian branch of EA could have done a lot more with the purple hardware (at least eliminate the slowdowns and add some effects). Just look at some other production such as ~Star Wars: Rogue Leader~ to immediately realize the capabilities of the Nintendo box. In conclusion, the cosmetic sector perfectly reproduces the one present on the PS2 version by removing some of the aforementioned little things. Not all donuts come out with a hole Race or Showoff? The modes available in ~SSXT~ include the classic race in which you have to win the competitions in different tracks, the Showoff in which you have to face all the tracks with aerial evolutions and screaming grinds to get a certain minimum score, the Free Race where you run freely on white snowy expanses with no one standing behind you and finally the usual Practice thanks to which you can learn all the commands that the game offers in the best possible way. The longevity of the game manages very well to give the user weeks of uninterrupted fun. In fact, not only does it take a long time to become professional snowboarders, but also growing and enhancing all the characters present among the selectable ones one by one requires time and dedication. Fortunately, this is one of those undertakings that entertain and give so much satisfaction. Try to perform the latest tricks in the dedicated book; as difficult as they are satisfying to perform. Each track has been lengthened compared to those of the previous chapter and gives you the opportunity to indulge yourself a lot more. The number and quality of performable aerial figures has also increased exponentially and it is important to note how performing some Uber Tricks is as suggestive as it is galvanizing. Factor that expertly deepens the longevity of the title is undoubtedly the possibility of making a career with each character by making him improve in the different qualities of snowboarder, increasing the choice of boards to use up to the clothing (the effect on the Master suit is beautiful). If you then think that all the characters have a great desire to grow and do well, you will understand the dose of fun that the product manages to give. Also very entertaining is the two-player mode where you can compete against your friend in challenges for who crosses the finish line first or in the Showoff where stunts reign supreme. In conclusion, a title that lasts over time. Music for my ears During the endless game sessions at ~SSXT~ the undersigned feels auditory pleasure reach his ears and nothing else. In fact, the game releases screaming accompaniments and captivating sound effects. The music varies from hip-hop to house and manages to get so much into the gamer's head that he hums those tunes even with the console off. It should be remembered that ~serious people who know about it~ such as Run DMC, Mix Master Mike, Aphrodite and Pizzicato 5, just to mention, mobilized for the occasion. Sound effects such as the board sliding on the snow or the sound of the wind when you climb and touch the sky with a finger (we are there!) seem REAL. Special applause also for the screams and sampled voices of the characters which are perfectly suited to the style of each virtual ~fighter~. Try to perform a few kilometer jumps and you will hear an always different and hilarious cackling. Separate discussion for the bonus contained in the mini DVD of the game. This is represented by a ~Making of~ lasting approximately five minutes which contains several interviews with the various staff members who participated in the development of ~SSXT~. All in all, little stuff. In summary, this ~SSXT~ represents a must buy for those who have never had the opportunity to play it on PS2 as it is the best snowboarding game out there. Beautiful to look at (albeit with frequent slowdowns), fun and profound to play and, moreover, you don't run the risk of making it moldy on some shelf in your bedroom. If you are still reading these lines and have not yet gone out to buy it, it means that you already have your beautiful copy of ~SSX or SSXT for the black monolith and then you are justified. But if you don't have it, what are you still doing there? Cube holders! Mobilize! Pros: Fun like no other. Very durable. For snowboarders and not. Cons: Annoying slowdowns. That little bit of aliasing that doesn't hurt... Motion blur, where are you? fly! Oh! Oh! Well yes. SSX Tricky is not an airplane game, but the title of the paragraph is still spot on. The reason? It is easy to say: even here on board your snow board you will be able to feel the same sensations as when you are traveling hundreds of meters above the ground, but with the window open You will feel the wind rushing through your hair, in the your ears, on your clothes. Don't believe it? Yet the work EA Sports Big manages to create this atmosphere very well. Word of Jotaro. The game is the direct transposition of the title of the same name for PS2, albeit with some small differences that we will go into further later. But now let yourself be enveloped by the taste for the extreme that SSXT can give", "date": "2002-07-23", "grade": null}
