{"name": "Il Signore degli Anelli - Le Due Torri", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/il-signore-degli-anelli-le-due-torri.html", "text": "~A new power is rising~ The conclusion of the film The Fellowship of the Ring leaves every spectator, unfamiliar with the book, dismayed to say the least: Frodo has abandoned his companions, and accompanied by his trusty Samvise he is directed to Mordor, firmly intending to get rid of the Ring of Power, destroying it in the fiery chasm of Mount Doom; Merry and Pippin, the two merry hobbits who have accompanied Frodo from the beginning of the journey, are prisoners of the ruthless and monstrous Uruk-hai; Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas, on their own, however, are right on the trail of the monsters to save the two halflings. Their lives will be put in jeopardy several times over the course of The Two Towers, and incredible events, encounters and clashes lie ahead for the wayfarers of the now dispersed Fellowship of the Ring... The Two Towers indeed begins a little earlier: ignoring the short introductory stage that allows us to control Isildur (the ancient prince, progenitor of Aragorn, who defeated Sauron in Mordor, depriving him of the Ring of Power), the adventure also comes to life in some phases of The Fellowship of the Ring, and proceeds to the conclusion of The Two Towers, following the original plot quite closely. In short, a book / film and a half condensed into a dozen or so difficult levels. As a start, not bad. ~The defenses must hold~ Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli: there are three characters that can be used to wipe out the hordes of Mordor. Aragorn is the more balanced, and wields bow and sword with equal skill; Legolas, for his part, is the most agile of the trio but also the slimmest, equipped with a bow and knives; Gimli, on the other hand, is clichet the strongest and slowest, and wields a mighty axe. The game is articulated through, it has been said, a series of levels that retrace the most memorable battles of the Tolkenian heroes: and so, we begin in Amon-Sul, against the Nazgul, the fearsome Ring Specters; to then proceed through the Caradhras Pass to the Moria mine and the fearsome clash with the Cave Troll; we then continue with the battles against the Uruk-hai to arrive at the second film/book, The Two Towers, where the heterogeneous trio will have to give their best to survive the terrible clashes in the ancient forest of Fangorn, the plains of Rohan, Westfalda and Helm's Deep, where the apocalyptic final battle will take place. At the beginning of each scheme, however, it is possible to select the desired character, to jump headlong into the action; The Two Towers is not a game that promotes drowsiness, there is no doubt about this, on the contrary it forces the player to act frantically on the joypad performing combinations of attacks of various types (whose uninterrupted sequence grants a sort of ~power-up~ ), parrying enemy blows, deflecting incoming arrows and running wildly through the environments in which the action takes place (also due to the lack of a convenient lock-on system, which would have been really welcome in more chaotic). The better our war performance will be, the more points we will get; points with a dual purpose: first, as in a role-playing game, they will allow our alter-ego to increase his experience level, and then they will allow us to purchase special abilities that will expand the already large repertoire of available actions, allowing us to perform longer and more damaging combos or increase our offensive and defensive capabilities. Ultimately, each character has about twenty skills available, and although the skills show a certain similarity in spite of the different names, appropriate to the character who owns them, they considerably increase the replay-value... and considering the difficulty ( sometimes excessive) and the short duration of the adventure, one can only be really happy about it. ~There is hope~ Unlike The Fellowship of the Ring (which we have already told you about in a previous review), all smoke and no fire, technically The Two Towers keeps its promises right from the introductory film: the initial sequence of the first film, taken directly from cinematic film, leads us to the battle of Dagorlad between the armies led by elves and men and the orcs commanded by the terrible Sauron. But there is a twist: magically, the movie suddenly transforms into a very three-dimensional real-time graphic, and in less than no time we are called to control Isildur in a chaos of soldiers on the move and fighting against orcs and goblins; once the short level is over (actually, it is precisely the introductory stage to which we have already mentioned), the real-time graphics retransformbut in a sequence of the film, which leads us (properly reassembled, of course) to the very beginning of the game. This is not a spectacular gimmick designed to favorably introduce the user to the actual game: each stage has a similar opening and closing sequence, which mixes the cinematic sequences and the polygonal engine developed by EA with skilful direction. An engine, moreover, impressive: not infrequently we find ourselves controlling the polygonal models of Aragorn, Legolas or Gimli, splendidly constructed and textured (despite a certain ~angularity~) and extremely similar to their cinematic counterparts (the actors Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies), at the center of real hellish pits, of which the stage set in Balin's tomb is a brilliant example, a titanic clash between five members of the Company, independently managed by a discreet artificial intelligence, and dozens of orcs, soon joined by the mammoth Troll. A show of this kind, located among other things in an extremely detailed setting, with such a high polygon-count, would normally lead to slowdowns in abundance and obvious frame drops: but no, the frame-rating of Le Due Torri remains constant, and the experience really becomes a real feast for the eyes. At this point, it is also worth mentioning the more striking special effects, such as the quality of the liquid surfaces (which probably ripple in contact with the polygonal models, reflecting and distorting them) or the particle effects of flames and explosions, as well as the bright and distorted, not to mention the beautiful blur caused by the rain. ~There is hope~ And again, The Two Towers detaches itself once and for all and totally from Vivendi's The Fellowship of the Ring for the very high quality of the audio sector: the musical pieces, in fact, are the same ones that the extraordinary Howard Shore composed for the trilogy cinematic, splendid soundtracks that perfectly accompany the player in his fight against the darkness; and finally, the voice actors used to give voice to the various characters in the frequent scenes added and not taken from the film, are precisely the same ones chosen for the big screen. In short, we are faced with a work with counter-flaws, practically free from any flaw. We can report just a management of collisions that are not exactly perfect, but it is really going to look for the classic hair in the egg. Comment The Two Towers is the game that every Lord of the Rings fan has been waiting for far too long. But that's not all, Le Due Torri is also an excellent action game, a hack'n slash like we haven't seen for years, which combines solid and immediate gameplay with the majesty of the technical realization. Everything is of the highest level: the graphics, the music, the dubbing. However, Le Due Torri is also a somewhat contradictory product: extremely difficult, but also rather short, and unfortunately sensationally devoid of any multiplayer mode. This last detail is hard to believe: a game of this type would have been perfect for frenetic games in pairs, but for some strange reason EA has not implemented this feature, and consequently once the adventure with all the characters is over, you get their respective skills and unlocked the many extras (interviews, various photo galleries and a disappointing secret stage), The Two Towers becomes a beautiful shelf memory, to be dusted off every now and then to relive the magic of the enthralling battles imagined by Tolkien and materialized by the inspiration Peter Jackson film or to show friends something truly spectacular. In any case, it is decidedly pleasant to note how software houses have recently realized that tie-ins deserve developmental care equal, if not superior, to that of any other game: just like Harry Potter and the House of Secrets, even The Two Towers finally shows a turnaround and, to paraphrase Gandalf, ~this is certainly an encouraging thought~... Pros Technically excellent in every respect Extremely faithful to the cinematic/literary counterpart Varied, immediate and fun gameplay Cons No multiplayer mode Sometimes frustrating Not too long The second chapter of the film saga of The Lord of the Rings, directed by Peter Jackson, has just invaded screening rooms throughout Italy, but the videogame version of this new adventure has already been circulating in stores for some time. Usually, tie-ins (i.e. productions inspired by qsomething, generally to films) are able to distinguish themselves well from other titles by the lowest degree of ugliness that distinguishes them, especially if the name they bear is commercial: the same fate could befall this Le Due Torri... but don't worry so confident.", "date": "2003-01-17", "grade": null}
