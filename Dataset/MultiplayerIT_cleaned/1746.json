{"name": "Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rayman-3-hoodlum-havoc_c.html", "text": "Sense of humour Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc is based on an unsurprisingly simple narrative structure. Completely dedicated to idleness following the exploits of the second episode, Rayman is forced to get back into action to stop the perfidious plans of Andr, the wicked Black Lum intent on taking over the world with his own army of Hoodlums. On paper, a storyline similar to the decidedly sleepy one of the prequel, therefore, if the Ubisoft developers had not decided to add an element capable of making the whole experience much more intriguing: comedy. Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc is in all respects one of the funniest platformers ever, not so much for the intrinsic qualities of the gameplay (although very present), but rather for the often big laughs that it manages to arouse in the user. First of all thanks to a tastefully self-deprecating and parodic vision of the platform genre, which is expressed in truly hilarious situations, jokes and quotes, but also to the excellent humorous depth released by almost every character. In this regard, particular mention should be dedicated to the excellent dubbing of the game in Italian, which is not by chance the most successful aspect of Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc; it can be said without fear of denial that the final quality of the whole undoubtedly represents one of the highest points ever reached by a video game in this field. An enhanced eggplant The high humorous caliber of Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc also manages to make up for part of the shortcomings of solid gameplay, but not rich enough to allow the Ubisoft title to rival the great masterpieces of the genre on equal terms. The differences compared to the prequel are there and can be seen, but in the end not even the last adventure of the disjointed aubergine manages to fully convince. But let's go in order. Rayman initially has his most classic abilities, namely the ability to literally throw his fists (this time not simply in a straight line, but also with effect) and to use his hair as a propeller to be able to glide and stretch the trajectories of the jumps. The juiciest novelty of the game lies in the presence of a series of power-ups capable of providing Rayman with a special power for a certain period of time, complete with a super-hero-style costume change. Also new for the series is the possibility of accumulating points (mainly assimilable through the elimination of enemies and the collection of bonuses and multipliable if chained in combos), useful for unlocking the considerable amount of extra material offered by the game, consisting of mini-games, movies and more. Among these, it should be noted the exclusive Gamecube of being able to download some secret levels for the portable version of Rayman 3 onto Game Boy Advance, and the possibility of using the Nintendo handheld in a fun mini-game for two players. A question of style If, therefore, there is certainly no shortage of meat in this Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc, however it is not enough to make the Ubisoft title an unforgettable platform. The elements that perhaps most of all affect the global evaluation of the product are the rigid linearity of the playful experience, a decidedly low level of difficulty and a level design that is not always excellent. To this must be added the low sensitivity of the control system and the non-optimal management of the virtual camera, defects which can also be postponed but which nevertheless exist and must be reported. As further confirmation of how much Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc is ~only~ a good title, the graphic design intervenes, absolutely not amazing also because it is the daughter of the multi-format character of the Ubisoft title. The polygon count is relatively low, the textures do not shine by definition and the light effects are anything but exciting; however the cosmetics of Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc is still pleasant, thanks to a skilful use of colors, a series of well-finished animations and a fast and constant frame rate and never subject to drops. Comment Rayman 3 Hoodlum Havoc is playfully a classic-style platformer, equipped with a sufficiently solid and consolidated gameplay, and it is also a graphically satisfying title, although far from squeezing the cubic hardware and (consequently) from surprising the user with exorbitant polygonal piers and dazzling light effects. What really amazes, and constitutes the real strong point of the game, is the delicious humor with which the Ubisoft product is impregnated in its entirety, an element that is not neededfrom a mere side dish to the playful experience, but which even manages to make up for some of its shortcomings, first of all to a level design that is not always up to par. Ultimately, therefore, Rayman 3 Hoodlum Havoc is a more than appreciable title as a whole, but which is forced to look down on the sacred monsters of the genre. PROS Tried and tested gameplay Beautiful and hilarious voice acting in Italian Good longevity CONS Nothing new under the sun Annoying camera problems Technically not great Far from the masterpieces of the genre Once upon a time there was a mascot. In the period of bipolar power of Nintendo and Sega, undisputed protagonists of the 8 and 16 bit scene, owning a game machine from one or the other company also meant, more or less indirectly, preferring Mario to Sonic, or vice versa. However, the very strong, binding bond between console and mascot began to loosen significantly following the overwhelming commercial success of the Playstation - to all intents and purposes lacking a character charismatic enough to define himself properly as a mascot - to then collapse definitively with the exit of Sega from the hardware production, and with the consequent hijacking of the Sonic series on the platforms of the former nemesis Nintendo. And the GameCube is currently the system on which all the most significant characters of the platform universe have found space: Mario (obviously), Sonic, Crash and now also Rayman, with his third adventure.", "date": "2003-02-25", "grade": null}
