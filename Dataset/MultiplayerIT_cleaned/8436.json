{"name": "The Cash and the Furious", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/105797-csr-racing-the-cash-and-the-furious.html", "text": "By its very definition, the racing game genre indicates those products focused on driving a car in the context of various competitions, an activity that can be surrounded by a whole series of elements such as buying and selling models, tuning and so on. With a decisive reversal of the rules of the game, CSR Racing is presented on the App Store giving more space to everything that revolves around real racing, which conversely is reduced to a sort of quick time event. Let's see if it's a winning formula or a failed experiment... By weight of gold Set in an evergreen which is the scenario of illegal car racing, CSR Racing puts the user in the role of an anonymous driver determined to climb the top of the circuit: to do this, it will be necessary to beat every single member of the five Gangs that control the different parts of the city, which in fact make up the game levels. The developers of NaturalMotion have drawn heavily from the clichs of the underground genre, and therefore there is the gang of African Americans (obviously rappers), that of hyper-technological Japanese, that of South Americans with bandanas on their heads and muscle cars and so on. one stereotype after another. As a counterpoint, it must be said that the product looks very good visually, thanks to stylish and functional menus and perfectly reproduced cars: in the version we tested, the title could count on the beauty of 26 models, divided between Ford, Audi, BMW, Nissan, Mini, Chevrolet. A few games are enough to realize that the focus of CSR Racing is not exactly focused on the action on the road, in fact reduced to very short sessions in which the player is busy giving only a handful of inputs to his car. The game revolves around acceleration races over various distances, and all you have to do is give the gas before the start to get the best possible start and then insert the gears with the right timing to maximize performance: green lights on the dashboard in the lower part of the screen they indicate the right moments to act, but quick reflexes are not a sufficient condition to win races. In fact, as you continue, the opponents get tougher and it is imperative to access the appropriate tuning shop to spend the money earned with victories to buy new parts. While maintaining a remarkable structural simplicity, this is undoubtedly the most successful part of CSR Racing, with a good selection of upgrades, including aesthetic ones, such as decals, body colors and customized number plates. It soon becomes clear that the races are not the real focus of the action, but rather a routine to be subjected to to accumulate money and modify your car, further debasing a gameplay that already did not show off great charisma. Add to all this an almost criminal exploitation of in-app purchases and the omelette is done: the title has a second type of currency - gold coins - which is given out with incredible scarcity during the game and which can be fleshed out only by buying special packages with real money. Nothing bad, if it weren't for the fact that gold is required not only for the vast majority of cars - the best performing ones at literally ridiculous prices - but for practically everything that goes beyond the basic modifications for one's car: it is gold to have a momentary performance upgrade from the mechanic, to fill up with petrol (otherwise you have to wait for it to fill up after exiting the application), even to reduce the delivery times of purchases and for the most attractive aesthetic changes. The software does its best to underline this aspect, not only by leading the user into temptation through frequent on-screen messages, but above all by placing obvious bottlenecks that are difficult to overcome without putting a hand to the credit card.", "date": "2012-07-12", "grade": "6.5"}
