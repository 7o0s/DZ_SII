{"name": "Jacked", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/jacked.html", "text": "Jacked quickly becomes boring and none of the extras that can be unlocked by continuing to play is enough to keep the interest level above the minimum threshold Other than Biaggi and Valentino In Jacked there is a clear inspiration to the game organization of the last two Burnouts: the championship is quite long and divided into various cities, which are unlocked by progressing with the game, on a par with what happens to the various usable motorcycles. Along the way, in addition to various types of weapons (in addition to those already listed there are also crowbars, pistols and so on), you can also collect nitro units to have a sort of turbo in the bike (or NOS, like they will prefer to hear the more tamarri) usable at any time with the circle key. In many races you can simply drive and bet everything on speed, but going forward it will become essential to settle a few blows to the most difficult opponents in order to keep them back as much as possible. The game mechanics are sinisterly reminiscent of the one already seen in the first Road Rash, and so is the control of the motorcycle, which is woody, unrealistic, extremely simplified and not at all satisfying. Unfortunately Jacked, due to what has just been said, quickly becomes boring, and none of the extras that can be unlocked by continuing to play is sufficient to keep the level of interest above the minimum threshold. Graphics and sound From a technical point of view, if possible, things get even worse. From time immemorial, at the end of their life cycle, consoles are now ~mature~ and show the best of their potential thanks to technically impressive titles. Jacked is the furthest away from all this, and indeed seems one of the scarcest of the launch games. The amount of polygons on screen is very low (perhaps exaggerating, but I wouldn't be surprised to see something slightly less complex being able to run on PSX), textures are dull and grainy, aliasing pops up all over the place, collisions are worthy of an early 80s arcade and, of course, there is no trace of a minimal implementation of physics. The sound sector, on the other hand, is a little better, with acceptable effects (especially considering the general quality) and honest and energetic music. From a technical point of view, if possible, things get even worse Cross-platform Jacked is currently also available in Xbox version. The music doesn't change at all compared to the PS2 version, except for (as usual) slightly cleaner graphics. The PC version will also be in stores soon, but don't expect miracles. Final comment Taken as a whole, the Road Rash series certainly cannot be considered an emblem of the most refined technical achievement or of the most massive playability, but to re-propose in 2006 the exact same formula more than two decades old, without refreshing the mechanics and without a graphic that it can make up for the other very serious shortcomings is an enviable form of optimism. The game gets boring very quickly, and offers nothing that one might expect. If you are looking for an adrenaline-pumping driving game, there is Burnout. If you are looking for a motorcycle driving game, wait for Tourist Trophy. Who has ears to hear ... Pros Difficult to find one ... Cons Mediocre gameplay Mediocre graphics Fourteen years ago Electronic Arts had the good idea of releasing a somewhat particular motorcycle racing game on the Amiga and Atari ST platforms: in fact, the attention was not focused only on driving the vehicle, but also and above all on throwing deadly blows at the other pilots using fists, chains, iron pipes and other similarly unorthodox objects. The game was immediately successful, and, in addition to seeing a sequel, it was also re-proposed in the next new generation platforms, such as Saturn, Playstation, Nintendo 64 and, above all, 3DO. I say ~above all~ because 3DO, just before going bankrupt, in the first months of 2003, was working on ~Jacked~, a title that faithfully reproduced the concept of Road Rash and that was supposed to rejuvenate its heavily tarnished image. When the Trip Hawkins company closed its doors, it seemed that the troubled fate of this title was sealed. But no: Empire Interactive has decided to carry on and complete the work, churning out Jacked at the beginning of 2006. Will he have done well or maybe he could have saved himself the trouble?", "date": "2006-03-07", "grade": null}
