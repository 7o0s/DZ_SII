There is no doubt that there is a real rise in the representation of mushrooms in video games, but on rare occasions it has happened to find a mushroom protagonist of a videogame adventure. We therefore played Lone Fungus with great interest, a metroidvania born thanks to a successful Kickstarter campaign and self-published on Steam by its developer. The story of Lone Fungus is that of a passion that turns into a job: after dedicating himself to creating video games in an amateurish way during his adolescence, Basti dedicated himself to music and the visual arts in adulthood, to then have the idea of jumping into the development of a metroidvania in December 2019. Now Greencap has grown up and is ready to enter the market after having benefited from the advice of supporters and buyers of the early access version, strong in exploration mechanics that are very effective in creating dynamism and fun, while the Achilles' heel of the production is certainly an uninspiring visual design, both for enemies, both for the settings. We tell you about our fungal experience in the Lone Fungus review. A mushroom alone in command Equipping different spells will cause Greencap to change the color and appearance of his hat For those who know the magical world of mushrooms well, it is undoubtedly alienating to have to deal with a solitary mushroom, but the presence of Greencap as the only fungus still alive in his fantasy world is fully justified from a narrative point of view. The last exponent of the most enigmatic of the Kingdoms of nature must reach the top of the world to regenerate his fellows, with the help of talking mushroom statues that offer clues on how to proceed. The statues are visually inspired by the mysterious Mayan mushroom stones, truly unique artifacts with, according to many scholars, ritual importance. Basti's main source of inspiration was Hollow Knight, and it is likely that the idea of a metroidvania based on mushrooms was born crossing the Fungal Caves of Nidosacro, where the fungi lead a life based on collaboration and identification in a greater whole, beyond the single exponents of the group. In Lone Fungus, on a stele we read that it is the duty of the mushroom champion to defend his Kingdom, as the basis for the life of all other living beings: however, the unique mode of interaction with the animals and plants present in the setting - as it stands to be in this gaming genre - it's based on conflict. The choice of a mushroom as the protagonist of a metroidvania is therefore strange: Greencap certainly has a delightful design, but it doesn't exploit the wealth of messages and meanings that could be drawn from the mushroom universe. A Metroidvania for all tastes The visual design of the enemies is certainly the weak point of Lone Fungus: fireballs, gears and gargoyles are far from pretty to look at Compared to other exponents of the genre, Lone Fungus can be an excellent entry point for beginners: far from the intransigent difficulty of Hollow Knight, the video game produced by Basti offers five difficulty levels, one of which is fully customizable by the player , which can increase Greencap's life points, increase the number of platforms available to facilitate exploration, make boss HP visible, and much more. We really appreciated this almost personal attention towards the player, also present in the Learn mode, accessible through the mushroom temples scattered throughout the map: in this section there are ~safe~ rooms where, without risking game over, you can practice with spike jumps, parries and other complex mechanics to master, all seasoned with advice written by Basti. The map is endless and the design of the rooms is the real strength of the production: the developer had the excellent idea to insert a large number of what he called Mushmovers, platforms of various kinds that ~color~ the navigation in the levels by providing various possibilities of jumping, bouncing, braking or propulsion with the sword. In many moments we have found Lone Fungus exhilarating for the infinite exploration options, even particularly rapid, that it can offer; this speed makes the inevitable Metroidvania backtracking fun and never frustrating. At the same time, the extension of the map and the variety of biomes present manage to create continuous stimuli, provided you don't turn up your nose at an artistically not always very inspired design. bmushroom octopus Interaction with enemies is often made unpredictable by the absence of animations that anticipate the attacks of the opponents present in Lone Fungus Greencap's weapons and spells are not only tools for exploration, but also for combat. Here we come to the really weak part of Basti's work: enemy design. Ugly to look at and difficult to read in the movements - often there are no animations to anticipate an attack, creating an unpleasant feeling of unpredictability - they don't even stand out in the boss fights, in which you find yourself facing large gears, masks, butterflies or fireballs with very little to say, both from a visual point of view and from that of the combat mechanics. In summary, there would have been a need to carry out more work on animations, aesthetics and variety of enemies during the year of early access of Lone Fungus. Good progression in the acquisition of skills: it does not stop at the sword strike ~basic~, but new moves and spells are acquired that gradually enrich the experience, which stands at a total duration of twenty or more hours and, in our case, has not been marred by any type of bug. The idea of making Greencap's hat change color and appearance depending on the magic equipped by it (selectable from the small temples scattered around the map) is nice. Furthermore, by finding certain objects or performing actions, not necessarily virtuous (such as falling a large number of times), new mushrooms are unlocked with which to face the adventure, replacing the initial Greencap: the change is purely cosmetic, but it is a pleasant addition for fans of completionism and trophies of various kinds. Basti has also composed a soundtrack that doesn't particularly stand out, but provides a decent accompaniment to the experience. We point out that there is currently no translation into Italian and the texts are in English.", "date": "2023-04-08", "grade": "6.0"}
