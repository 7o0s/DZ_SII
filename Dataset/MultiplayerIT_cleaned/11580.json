{"name": "Colin McRae: Dirt", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/colin-mcrae-dirt.html", "text": "Observing the history of mobile racers, it seems to see the progress made by the genre on consoles and PCs, only in a very accelerated way: we started with completely two-dimensional graphics, which saw the car in the center of the screen and the track ( often vector) that flowed under it, and then slowly we arrived at 3D, all within a few years. And if there's a company that has stood out for its ability to exploit the potential of the various terminals, obtaining extraordinary technical results, it's Glu: after the amazing Project Gotham Racing Mobile, the Californian team got to work on mobile version of another very successful series, namely Colin McRae: Dirt. The start screen of the game allows us to start a career or to access the Rally World. The latter turns out to be a container for all the ~minor~ modes: fast run (a race with completely random values), exhibition (with the possibility to choose car and track) or challenge (split between timed race, elimination or chase ). In short, there is no shortage of possibilities and the game has the classic ~rewards~ structure that unlocks courses and cars as the events are completed. Once you get on the track, it takes very little to become familiar with the control system: we opted for the automatic accelerator, the best choice from the point of view of immediacy, so you have to concentrate solely on keys 4 and 6 to steer , and on button 8 to brake, but only when necessary. In fact, unlike PGR, Colin McRae: Dirt maintains the setting that made rally games famous, with drifting as the absolute protagonist: beyond a certain steering angle, the car loses the rear and you have to press the keys to can face the curve in the best way. It takes a little practice to figure out when to let the car go or start it again, but after this hurdle the game turns out to be a lot of fun and also quite faithful to the console counterpart. There are three selectable difficulty levels, which clearly modify the values in the field: at the normal level (the lowest), we will be able to catch the opponents even with dirty driving, therefore we will have a faster car, while increasing the degree of challenge we will necessarily have to memorize the best tracks and trajectories. After the exceptional graphics of the mobile version of Project Gotham Racing, Glu does not disappoint and offers us very well made cars faithful to the original models, quite detailed scenarios (although reaching the PGR levels would have been impossible, given the different course context ), some appreciable light effects and a higher than average fluidity. The only flaw lies in the rather frequent pop-up effects, but in general one can only be satisfied with the game as far as the visual aspect is concerned. The speech is very different for the 2D version, which comes with a badly thought out view, lacking in perspective, which makes it really difficult to face the paths. Not to mention the car animation, practically non-existent (three frames: straight or inclined car). The sound sector, unfortunately, is quite meager and basically relies only on the navigator's speech, which scans the classic ~left~, ~right~, etc. The few contour effects are just enough. Finally, the controls are very simple and you learn to master them quickly, but unfortunately they suffer from a non-instantaneous response to inputs, which you have to get used to. PRO Excellent graphics Lots of game modes Fun and engaging AGAINST Very sparse sound Commands do not have an instant response You have to master the drift", "date": "2008-03-10", "grade": "S.V."}
