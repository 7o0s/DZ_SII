We want to try to reach an unexplored area of which we have no map and know nothing. In truth we don't even know if it exists or not. After all, we don't have any emergencies. Although we have been assigned missions, we feel no urgency. We have time. All the time we want. There isn't a world to save or an enemy who wants to kill us for mysterious reasons. It's us and the Planata, our initiation rite. The planet we are on is the real protagonist and for this reason we want to see it, after years spent relegated to a village made up of a handful of houses and even fewer inhabitants. So we run through a valley full of cacti without knowing what we'll find on the other side, just for the fun of it. It is an inhospitable and lifeless area, which flows into a large plain. At first we seem to have reached the edge of the world, but soon we begin to glimpse the outlines of some colossal natural structures, which emit powerful jets of steam. We are in an immense valley on which stands this kind of forest of gigantic rocky outgrowths that stand out towards the sky. While we run to explore them, the ruins of a futuristic city appear on our left, immense but completely destroyed. Who lived there? What happened to the inhabitants? Why doesn't anyone seem to know about this place apart from a few adventurous explorers? These and many other mysteries are the essence of Sable, of which the review will be able to make only a small part of the wonder experienced while we were playing. Initiation rite Sable's meaning is in the journey Sable begins with the protagonist, the game's namesake, who must complete a series of missions in her small village to be able to compose her hoverbike and obtain the power of a glider, i.e. the ability to glide. Ours immediately demonstrates incredible agility, capable of making long leaps and climbing any wall. Climbing is regulated by a stamina bar, initially very low, but it can be increased by bringing the eggs of strange worms hidden in the maps to a certain place (the game doesn't explain anything about it, so you'll have to find everything yourself). The first hour of play is mainly used to acclimatize with the controls and to reinforce the feeling of being faced with a strange mixture between The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, for the exploration modes, and Shadow of the Colossus, for the very rarefied general atmosphere, almost metaphysical in its visual minimalism. While we were playing it was inevitable to think about how much time had passed since the 2018 trailer, the one with which Sable was presented and which made us fall in love with the low-poly graphic style (think that at the time it had only been in development for three months). The mechanics that regulate the gameplay are actually few more than those already mentioned. Sable can talk to other characters, from which she obtains information and missions, and has a compass that serves to orient her and on which icons appear that indicate the direction to follow... in case there is a direction to follow . Often, in fact, the tasks to be performed are simply described and it is necessary to adjust by observing the conformation of the settings to understand what to do. For example in a mission we will be told to follow a trail of symbols to find a mask, adding that we will have to get a little wet to do it. A Sable Desert Landscape It will be up to us to find the symbols and follow them to the treasure, perhaps getting lost on the way or taking advantage of a stroke of luck to arrive earlier. In another mission we will instead be asked to find insects and the characters will only give us general indications on where to look for them. It will be our job to interpret them correctly. But let's go back to our Sable and her initiation rite, which doesn't actually end in her village but accompanies her throughout the entire adventure. Having obtained the hoverbike and glider status, Sable will in fact be able to leave the territory in which she grew up and will have to go around the vast world in search of masks to add to her collection. Masks can be obtained in various ways, but in most cases they are linked to missions that are given in the various outposts, camps or towns that dotted the map. Hoverbike is the only means of transportation to explore and move from one place to another. If desired, there is the possibility of making rapid trips, but only after having already visited a certain place. Exploration In Sable there is always something to discover So far sembra of being faced with a very traditional 3D action, but in reality the soul of Sable is very different from that of the other exponents of the genre, even from its main sources of inspiration. Meanwhile you can't fight, in the sense that there are no enemies and there really isn't a combat system. There are puzzles to solve to get some living obstacles out of the way, but that's about it. Furthermore, the game never oppresses the player by giving him fixed objectives, but invites him to explore and visit as many places as possible. Only in this way is it possible to learn the very nuanced mythology that forms the background to the game world, more evoked than told. Be careful because there is no shortage of more playful sections, so to speak. Visiting different places, in fact, it will often be necessary to solve puzzles that allow you to understand their secrets, perhaps by reactivating mechanisms that have been switched off for centuries, or by overcoming real platform phases. In some cases we will also have to find clues to solve cases, as if we were detectives. Other playful mechanics concern the hoverbike itself, which can be upgraded and customized by purchasing extra parts from various merchants. Improving it only serves to make it faster, snappier and more stable, so don't expect fights on the sands or who knows what, but only a progression of its performance that helps in exploration and movement. sable; the climbing system is reminiscent of Breath of the Wild In a certain sense, Sable constantly hides this dual nature of his, enveloping the player in a marvel made of continuous discoveries and autonomous research, where he never really penalizes him, not even in the case of blatant errors. The game is there, but it's like the scenario: evoked, rather than slammed into the player's face. Sable is a meditative game, one that inspires you to wander and observe. It does so both with its ultra-minimalist graphic style, made with essential cel shading that creates an underground cartoon effect, in which what matters is never the single object, but how this is composed with the rest of the scenario; both with the way it invites us to let go, giving us the pleasure of discovery. We are the ones who have to search, helping ourselves with the tools we have, but without expecting to be given a helping icon or that a mysterious force called game design drags us effortlessly towards the next goal. Problems Sable manages to be evocative often Precisely from this, however, derive some problems of the game that break the experience a bit: Sable works very well when he ignores his playful nature, but suffers when he is forced to be a video game, creating situations that frankly were avoidable. Let's take for example the aforementioned investigations, which are conducted by looking for clues and talking to the suspects. To prove the system, on one occasion we tried to make a hypothesis of guilt, based on what we had discovered so far. Our interlocutor did not seem too convinced by our words, but the mission was finished all the same without giving us the opportunity to carry out further investigations or to try again and without making us understand where we had gone wrong. In another case we struggled to reach a certain place (we are talking about more than half an hour of attempts), only to discover, once we arrived at our destination, that we needed a certain object to resolve a certain situation, object of which we knew nothing and which is acquired much later in the adventure. Sable only errs when it tries to be more video game Another sore point are the platform phases: it is true that Sable climbs where he wants, but imprecision reigns supreme and sometimes it is not clear why a platform is missing or it is not possible to reach a certain place. Eventually it pays off with experience, but it can get quite frustrating having to submit to the system's flaws, especially when the goal is just to explore in the wild. So we have on the one hand the Sable that kidnaps you and takes you with it to a distant, mysterious and inaccessible world, captivating you with a visual beauty and a sense of discovery that you are unlikely to find in other titles; on the other we have the most video game Sable that can't keep up with its models and that one would almost like to remove by force from the experience, it can become so heavy and annoying.", "date": "2021-09-23", "grade": "8.0"}
