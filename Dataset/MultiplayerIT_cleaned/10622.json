The most incredible thing, then, is that this work didn't do it with who knows what technical virtuosity or mechanical innovations: it managed to earn itself a place among the best RPGs ever ~only~ with brilliant writing, a reworking to say the least atypical of the progression of one's alter ego and an artistic sector of the highest level. On the other hand, its creators, ZA/UM, are anything but a typical development team. Literally a collective of artists who in the initial stages did not count even a video game and/or programming expert among its ranks, this group of creatives has been able to dominate one of the most difficult genres to face ever starting from a titanic work of conceptualization ( born, indeed, from a pen and paper RPG) and perfecting itself with every mistake, all without giving in to an inexorable passing of days that has led to even doubling the expected development times. For obvious reasons, therefore, the initial plan was scaled down and Disco Elysium arrived in homes in a slightly less ambitious form than initially calculated. The fact that it is still one of the most experimental and ambitious video games out there, even in its ~basic~ version, is a testament to ZA/UM's abilities, yet their nature dedicated to perfectionism has led them not to rest on their laurels and to shape to a Final Cut of the game capable of bringing it closer to the initial idea. From there the team pushed on the diffusion by developing excellent quality ports, and today their curious baby has also arrived on Nintendo Switch. Will it be a version worthy of the others, or a hasty port at the risk of ruining what is good? Find out in the Nintendo Switch review of Disco Elysium: The Final Cut. Contents: a nice cut changes the whole look Disco Elysium, a conversation in the dark The version that arrived on Nintendo's shores is obviously the Final Cut just mentioned, with all the necessary modifications. It's not actually a revolutionary reissue, but content-wise it offers some not indifferent extras, including full English dubbing, which is impressive considering the incredible amount of text contained in the game. The actor rehearsals, however, are all of a remarkable level, especially that of the British musician Lenval Brown, to whom we owe the voice of the protagonist and all his 24 inner voices (his vocal range is truly insane, especially if you consider that before Disco Elysium he never acted). In addition to this sea of words, there are also new quests related to the ~political vision~ of one's alter ego: these parts of the campaign are unlocked based on the choices made regarding your political beliefs during the advancement, and increase the replayability of the title as well as adding complexity to the plot (in some cases even new characters and zones). Finally, the Final Cut even offers a hardcore mode designed to make each choice more difficult and limit the player's approach possibilities (with far more likely die roll failures, higher prices, and a whole series of other acute problems compared to the classic challenge level). In some ways it is an addition capable of limiting some of the original imbalances - it was all too easy to overcome some situations with the right change of clothes - at the same time, however, we are talking about a solution that makes the experience less smooth and the more difficult narrative exploration, thus going against the very nature of the title. It is, therefore, one more option worthy of praise, even if not for everyone. The rest of the options are mostly minor goodies: you can turn off full voice acting (although we don't really understand why you would want to do that), or select a streamer mode to avoid copyright issues on Twitch and the like. The Switch version keeps all these options and loses those related to the graphic settings, since there is predictably no 4K mode here. Yet this does not mean that ZA/UM have neglected the uniqueness of the platform, given that this port boasts an interface reworked in many aspects and painstaking management of text visibility. Port quality: Revachol on Switch Disco Elysium, the square of Revachol is invaded by protesting truckers As already stated, this team of developers is mainly made up of detail freaks and artists, so it doesn't surprise us too much that to adjust the size of the texts and the interface on Switch - especially in portable mode - they didn't limit themselves tostandards, but have even decided to follow the optometrist scale for a more adaptive reading experience. The interface changes aren't huge, mind you, yet they are perceptible, still demonstrating a little more effort than the superficial ports that are often seen around. The gameplay instead mostly sticks to what was seen for the other versions Disco Elysium console: each interactive element can be shown with the simple push of a button, and through the analog stick you interact with objects in a rather natural way. Unfortunately, the bug related to certain interactions (which require a few too many pressures to be activated) has been maintained, but it is sporadic and usually it is enough to insist a few times for the action to be performed. Furthermore, if you use the Switch off the dock, the touchscreen is part of the equation and everything can be done with a few simple taps of the screen, from managing movement and interactions to opening various menus. Enjoying Disco Elysium in this way comes with a single sacrifice: lower resolution with markedly sharper aliasing. If you use the dock, this is barely noticeable and the visual impact remains almost identical to that of the other versions (even if a little more aliasing remains), instead playing in portability means that each element is more jagged, especially at maximum zoom level. For the record, we are talking about a marginal criticism: Disco Elysium is always splendid to see in action, even with a little less detail and its look highly inspired by twentieth-century art (the artistic sources are many and range from modern expressionism to futurism) makes a minimum of jaggedness seriously ignorable by virtue of the general glance. However, we believe it is appropriate to clarify it. Amazon offer Disc Elysium The Final Cut - PlayStation 4 39.99 See Offer Apart from that, the flaws on Switch are really limited. We are dealing with some longer-than-average loading for larger maps and slowdowns that little affect the experience during some specific ~Shiver shots~ encountered during the story. Both of these issues are known, and it seems ZA/UM wants to fix or smooth them out with the first patch. For the rest there have been no structural changes, which means that the few defects of the original title - a couple of bottlenecks in the progression linked to some main stages of the story and the question of statistics that are all too modulable with the already mentioned equipment before - they stayed. Very little to worry about, therefore, for a RPG that remains a narrative masterpiece of rare audacity, capable of exploiting premises abused to exhaustion such as the amnesia of the protagonist and the need to rediscover the game world piece by piece without trivializing them. Disco Elysium is nothing short of a brilliant title, beautifully written, almost always able to maintain its overall vision regardless of the choices made by the player (no matter how absurd they are), and to place itself among the best games of usual role with a system built entirely around the characterization of one's alter ego and the written text. Its Switch version may not be the most technically extraordinary, but it is clearly curated enough to offer owners of the Nintendo console the experience they deserve.
