{"name": "A tutto gas", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/181545-mafia-iii-faster-baby-a-tutto-gas.html", "text": "Faster, Baby! it is the first of three expansions intended to enrich the map and the story of Mafia III, a title which, while not reaching the peaks of its predecessors, does not lack various advantages, starting from a narrative component decidedly higher than that of the average open world . The approximately 10GB of data to download for the Steam version of the game includes a new town, new vehicles, slow-motion driving modes, missions entirely dedicated to four-wheelers, the possibility of throwing grenades from the car, proximity mines and an important patch, also accompanied by a demo. Faster, Baby! is the first expansion of Mafia III and focuses on four wheels to give a show Sympathy for the Devil From the first to the third Mafia something has been lost, especially from the point of view of artificial intelligence and the uniqueness of the missions, but the latest incarnation of the series has still conquered us with an engaging narrative cross-section full of facets ranging from racism to the crudest anecdotes about the Vietnam War. Interlude scenes from films, charismatic characters, models of excellent workmanship and a quality Italian dubbing close a more than valid picture, net of the obvious technical problems. Problems that were partially addressed with a patch released right together with Faster, Baby! which, also available through the 29.99 euro Season Pass, extends the game map to the southwest, towards Sinclair Parish, an entire town that extends over a rather large area, almost equal to that of the large swampy bayou of New Bordeaux. Prey to the most unbridled corruption, the new area is a perfect hunting ground for Lincoln Clay, the tormented anti-hero that we find here in his most civilized version, in defiance of the bloodiest of Mafia III endings. There is no shortage of opportunity to make money, thanks to a rebellious genius and his weed trafficking, but the main objective is to eliminate the real villains, those who have sold their souls for a bribe. The leader of the latter is Walter Beaumont, a racist and violent police chief who has crossed the line by assassinating a civil rights leader and represents an opportunity for gluttonous redemption. Nonetheless Lincoln remains a criminal, one who solves problems with lead and with the blade, implacable although characterized by important nuances that give us an all-round anti-hero. What changes, at least in part, is the action with an expansion which, despite being focused on the narrative dimension, magnifies the importance of the cars. Importance underlined by a couple of spectacular missions on four wheels that put hordes of police on our heels and allow us to fully enjoy the new features dedicated to vehicles. Once the simulation driving was set up to add spice and drifts to our adventure, we threw explosives on the run, smashed tons of objects to distract the police and tackled the dozens of ramps Sinclair Parish is full of using the new slow-motion driving that allows you to tackle curves at high speed and perform extreme maneuvers with greater precision. Faster, Baby! The novelties enrich the Mafia III gameplay but, excluding the proximity mines, they only stand out during the four-wheeled missions of the expansion, those that finally call into question the vehicles, while we are chased by tons of policemen and while the machine gun of the attractive Roxy spews tons of lead from the passenger seat of the sturdy Nightcrawler. Between destruction, explosives and barrels to roll in the middle of the road, the fireworks display is remarkable and it is precisely in these situations that the star of Faster, Baby! it gets brighter. But it doesn't take much for some clouds to come back to obscure it. The new patch seems to have fixed some bugs, but it still happens that missions crash and we are faced with enemies who are perhaps meaner, but certainly not smarter. Opponents continue to approach every corner carelessly, often without noticing corpses left in plain sight, and continue to be awkward, even when driving, compromising the degree of challenge. On the other hand, we do not mind the return of flashbacks that tell us some background, creating a criminal biopic atmosphere that increases the realism and involvement of the experience. However, the interlude scenes are shorter and less incisive and culminate in a far from exciting ending. However, the first hour of the game offers us some interesting ideas, the spectacular missions mentioned above, a couple of not bad exchanges with Roxy and a rather interesting villain, albeit managed in an all too hasty way. Then it's back to the classic mission structure, with the policewhich becomes a racket to be dismantled with targeted interventions, depleted of some mechanics but enriched by the dynamics of the herbalist who allows us to spend points to improve the growth and variety of grass for our new racket. And it is just as we begin to test our green thumb that it all ends, with a slightly more demanding firefight than usual, after just a couple of hours of playing taking it easy. Very little in relation to the genre, especially in the face of the lack of real technological innovations and in front of some dialogue that is not too well cared for, even from the point of view of animations. On the other hand, the panorama does not disappoint which, like that of New Bordeaux, gives us breathtaking breakers, here magnified by the spectacular nature of the jumps, the tons of destructible objects and slow-motion maneuvers. Sinclair Parish takes us to the post-Vietnam US countryside, still reminiscent of the days of slavery, full of convicts digging by the roadside, trillions of fences to tear down, country clothes and dungarees galore. All enhanced by an engine that still gets along well and gives us excellent reflections, detailed interiors and blurs used artfully to hide the low yield of the seabed. Some textures are not up to the others, but the level is high and is seasoned with iconic songs and the usual Italian dubbing which, except in rare cases, maintains excellent quality. All this gives us an expansion that initially surprises us positively and does not lack some interesting ideas, but inherits some of the more evident problems of Mafia III and ends really too soon to cost 15 euros.", "date": "2017-03-30", "grade": "6.0"}
