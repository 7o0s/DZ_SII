The Kyoto house has adopted a rather clear philosophy regarding these productions: the aim is in fact to offer the big names in the Nintendo catalog to an extremely vast and varied audience, with the hope of instilling curiosity and the desire to deepen the experience then moving on to the company's proprietary hardware. Now what is in fact a ~branch~ of Nintendo, or the second-party HAL Laboratory, has decided to follow in the footsteps of the parent company by debuting on smartphones and tablets: however, not to bring its Kirby, but by creating a completely new game studied and designed especially for the occasion. UFO with fixed-term contract Part Time UFO, this is the name of the product, features a small flying saucer that arrives on Earth from an unknown planet. Once he reaches our world he will find himself carrying out a series of odd jobs to help a slew of people in different kinds of tasks. The only tool that the protagonist has is a sort of mechanical arm that works exactly like the Claw Crane, or the very popular games that use a crane with a claw to try and win soft toys, puppets and the like. The control system is very simple: with the virtual stick to the left you move the protagonist, while tapping to the right brings down the claw. That's all. In this way, the UFO can then collect objects of various types to be transported elsewhere, following the indications of each specific mission. The levels are all organized in this way: there is a task to be completed within a time limit, and although the objectives are always different, the gist remains the same. The first missions require little effort, such as helping a farmer to collect the fruit that has fallen from the van and put it back on board, or to catch fish and release them on a boat. Things start to get complicated and much more bizarre shortly after, when you find yourself having to position a group of cheerleaders in such a way as to form a human pyramid, or even when you have to help a distracted museum employee to reconstruct a precious totem pole gone in pieces. The weight and shape of the various objects to be transported also represents a factor of great influence, given that the element of physics is fundamental in the game: very heavy objects will be more difficult to move, just as it becomes complex to recover those that have escaped us. ~hand~ and that have fallen in a way not conducive to being rehooked by the claw. For each main objective, the achievement of which is necessary in order to continue, there are three other secondary objectives in which one is linked in all cases to the completion time, while the other two differ from case to case: for example in the case of the cheerleaders you have to overcome a final height and create a certain figure. Achievements allow you to get medals, which are the way to unlock the next jobs; moreover, by completing a mission you are paid with a certain amount of money commensurate with your performance. This money can be spent at the shop to buy items and clothing for your UFO, which have not only aesthetic purposes but also the improvement of the protagonist's ~performance~ and abilities: the ability to fit these upgrades to specific requests and needs of each particular job allows you to have concrete advantages in practice. Finally, the graphic component rests on a simple but very well characterized pixel art, with a style that closely resembles the one seen in Rhythm Paradise. We found the sound instead, both in terms of music and effects, annoying to say the least, to the point of imposing its complete deactivation. Part Time UFO is sold at the premium price of 4.49, without any type of in-app purchase or advertising.", "date": "2018-03-15", "grade": "8.6"}
