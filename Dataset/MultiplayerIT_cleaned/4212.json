{"name": "Sports Story", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sports-story-recensione.html", "text": "After a few years of news with the dropper, last November Sidebar Games announced the publication of Sports Story by the end of the year. Surprisingly, during Nintendo's House of Indies Holiday Event on December 23, the news that Golf Story fans have been waiting for arrived: its sequel was already available for purchase on the Nintendo eShop. We didn't have to be asked, and we embarked on an adventure that - anyone who knows the Australian studio's first work knows well - promised to be truly surreal. And it has been confirmed as such, because Sports Story lives up to the formula inaugurated by Sidebar Games with Golf Story and indeed, decides to expand and refine it. The new graphic makes the already pleasant pixel art of the first chapter of the adventure of our budding golfer more vibrant; now we have the opportunity to try our hand not only at golf, but rather we can (or rather, we must) dedicate ourselves to cricket, fishing, tennis and much more, often in contexts very far from those in which these sports are usually practiced; some faces already seen in Golf Story return, but many other characters are also added to the list of eccentric acquaintances that the protagonist meets during his arduous journey. We tell you about this over the top adventure in our Sports Story review. Between Mario Golf and Earthbound Tennis is one of the most successful additions to sports introduced in Sports Story Golf Story centered on a boy's rise through the ranks of the noble game of golf who, out of the blue, nostalgically recalls the lessons his father had taught him as a child: the most important was to watch out for geese, capable of unspeakable atrocities (including putting on the putting line). Said and done: the protagonist decides to leave his wife - or his wife leaves him: it's a long-standing debate among Golf Story fans - and to embark on an adventure that will see him tackle eight nine-hole golf courses, sometimes populated by hordes of undead. These few elements are enough to understand how Sidebar Games wanted to make Earthbound's surreal humor their own, inserting it into a sports formula that looks to the light-hearted tone and simplicity of Mario Golf. The simple system of three hits is borrowed from the latter: first you decide the line of fire, then the power and finally the precision. If we remember these elements of Golf Story, it is because even in Sports Story - a sequel to all intents and purposes, set shortly after the conclusion of the events of the golf epic - golf takes the lion's share, not only in the fun local multiplayer until four-player on five courts featured in the main game, but also in the narrated events. Sidebar Games has shown that they listen to their players, working on some critical points. In Golf Story it was very difficult to read the slopes of the greens, given the view from above and the difficulty of representing the slopes of the course, while now the handy arrows make everything more understandable; the interface has also improved, which overall is more elegant and less spartan. Too bad for the incipit of the adventure, certainly less incisive and memorable than Golf Story. The mall is a very important place in the Sports Story adventure, full of over the top characters The big difference compared to the first adventure of the most hated golfer in the world - a joke abundantly exploited in Golf Story and which returns only in small doses in this second iteration - lies in the variety of sports available to us, always and rigorously inserted in contexts outside head: ranging from the mine where the Queen herself attends a cricket match in which everything goes, up to the tennis academy where you go on to the sound of resounding punishments, passing through the rainy port where you fish frowning fish. Hooks, clubs, BMX and RPG In Sports Story it is also possible to fish in the rain in a simple and fun mini-game From the opening bars it is immediately clear that Sports Story is not a normal sports game. Arriving on a sunny beach, the golfer finds himself having to satisfy his coach's thirst for orange juice, determined not to budge from there before a nice drink. It turns out that getting oranges is not a simple matter, and between volleyball matches and golf shots the protagonist has to scrape together the tokens needed to obtain the coveted fruit. The adventure continues on these demented tones and with a hilarious humor, all under the oppressive aegis of a megacorporation - PureStrike - which owns everything on the island that we find ourselves traveling. We don't want to reveal troppo of the crazy plot and demented situations in which Sidebar Games throws players: it would be unforgivable to spoil the pleasure of discovery. The various settings are accessible according to the level of our badge, which can be improved by completing sports-themed challenges. Often these are simple mini-games, but in some cases - such as, for example, tennis - Sidebar Games has managed to give depth to the new disciplines introduced. Cricket and fishing are very linear, while in our opinion the management of the BMX is not very happy, in which even the slightest mistake prevents the completion of the course and forces you to start over. Overall, however, this sporting mix works well, giving variety to the course of our (now not only) golfer and ferrying us towards the conclusion of the adventure while always keeping the interest and desire to immerse yourself in this crazy universe high. Sports Story is full of secondary challenges and can last well over twenty hours, depending on how much you decide to delve into the available missions. In our adventure there will be no shortage of hilarious encounters with somewhat particular pirates On the other hand, the system for improving the character's skills was not very successful. The advancements are not clearly perceivable and affect almost exclusively the golf field (with a few limited exceptions) and the parameters in which to progress are selectable in some cases: usually there will be no choice, and with the progress in the levels we will see the power increase randomly , accuracy and so on. It's a shame, because we would have liked to see a deepening and accentuation of the role-playing aspects seen in Golf Story, making the main character more customizable. A crazy island The protagonist of Sports Story will even deal with the Queen, who is also very interested in sports To continue in Sports Story it will be necessary to fully immerse yourself in a setting full of unscrupulous tennis masters, mini-golf courses full of miniature tanks and despotic queens in cricket officiating. Sidebar Games guides the player very little: the sentences that mark the next goal (~look for someone interested in your salmon~ is an example) are often synthetic and a little enigmatic, marked by that irrational tone that dominates the entire game path. Sometimes you have to arm yourself with patience and talk to all the characters in the surrounding area to find a way, perhaps starting long chains of exchanging objects to finally reach the solution. It is an approach that you either love or hate, and that for everyone can translate in a bit frustrating situations if you leave the Australian team behind. In the meantime, however, you can enjoy a delicious pixel art - the evolution compared to the first Golf Story and, at the same time, the coherence with respect to the initial layout are remarkable - and a really spot on soundtrack. Too bad for the lack, also in this sequel, of an Italian translation: puns based on Anglo-Saxon culture and the English language are frequent, of which a more than good knowledge is essential. We point out the presence of some bugs of various size and importance, as also occurred at the launch of Golf Story: the desk is certainly very useful which, upon repeated touch, offers unlimited discount coupons for shops, while the graphic glitches, the challenges completed but not accounted for by the game, and the occasional bug that causes the software to crash. The team has already announced that it is working on a corrective patch, and the occasional nature of the bugs does not mean a break in the immersion in the game world.", "date": "2022-12-28", "grade": "8.0"}
