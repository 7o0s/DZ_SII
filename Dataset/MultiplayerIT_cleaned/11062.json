{"name": "The X Factor 2008", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-x-factor-2008.html", "text": "After the first season with mixed results, the television show ~X Factor~ is preparing to return and the auditions throughout Italy are already crowded. The goal is clearly to launch another star, while the timbre of Giusy Ferreri's voice now reigns supreme on the radios and the partnership with Tiziano Ferro produces commercial results of all respect (although it was not Ferreri who won the competition, as it often happens). This is not a novelty, but just the umpteenth television product of this kind, which in this case was born in England in 2004 and then gradually conquered the whole world. The competition is divided into four fundamental phases: the auditions, in which the numerous candidates are screened and reduced to two hundred; the so-called ~boot camp~, in which a further selection is made; access to the ~house~, when the jury identifies the finalists; and finally the television evenings, which fight each other with interpretations while a daily strip shows us the work behind the scenes and the preparation of the singers. Mobile gaming, which has always been attentive to the ~casual~ genre, could not avoid translating ~X Factor~ into a video game... Developed by the Rovio team for Namco Bandai, the game allows us to ~virtually~ participate in the broadcast, doing the whole process: auditions, skimming, final selections and so on. The mechanisms are typical of rhythm games, even if in many cases the structure lets itself go to at least bizarre variations on the theme. First we will have to create an alter ego by choosing its gender, name (from a list) and appearance; after which we will present ourselves before the commission of ~X Factor~ to play our cards. The singing minigame sees us acting on the 2, 5 and 8 keys of the mobile phone while in the lower part of the screen the notes that we have to get right scroll on three different lines. Everything depends on pressing the keys at the right moment, carefully avoiding doing so when the so-called ~out of tune~ notes occur, which can cause us to lose many points by speeding up the arrival of the following bars for a few seconds. Once the song is over, we will also have to try our hand at a short dance session, characterized by similar rules: we will have to quickly press the d-pad in the indicated directions, trying not to make mistakes. A good performance will allow us to access the next stage, which will see the unlocking of a city map made up of different places: the hotel room, which serves as the starting point; the dance school, where we can refine our coordination; the karaoke bar, to improve the quality of singing; the mall, which will see us try our hand at a ~Pac Man-like~ minigame; the disco, where we will have to ~indulge~ in the public for photos and handshakes; the musical instrument shop, with an additional minigame to work on the rhythm. The action is therefore divided between these activities and the actual competition, which proceeds and becomes more and more severe as we approach the final evening... For a product of this kind, the sound sector is usually very important, but we know well how many and what problems games for Java-compatible devices face. In the case of The X Factor 2008, the developers have done a decent job overall, with some decent quality MIDI music, which in any case has no relation to what is happening on the screen: you have to refer to the visual indications, not the rhythm. The graphics are divided between ups and downs: the creation of the characters is excellent for the design and good for the animations, which are quite varied, but the situation worsens exponentially when it comes to minigames, with really mediocre and simplistic solutions. PRO Well drawn characters, with good animations Very simple and immediate A good number of minigames... AGAINST ...pretty poorly made No relationship between music and action Very limited, not fun", "date": "2008-11-12", "grade": "S.V."}
