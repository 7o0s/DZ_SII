{"name": "American Gangster", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/american-gangster.html", "text": "In fact, a couple of quick glances are enough to immediately realize that American Gangster is nothing more than a version of Gangstar: Crime City specially adapted for the film. The game structure, not surprisingly, is completely identical: referring again to the first episodes of the Grand Theft Auto saga (the two-dimensional ones, to be clear), the title allows the user to move the character both on foot and behind the wheel of a car rigorously ~borrowed~, all in order to complete a series of missions with more or less different objectives. Most of them are all in all classic activities, such as reaching a destination in the shortest possible time, collecting objects, identifying and eliminating an objective or completing checkpoint races: a pinch of originality lies in the fact that the user alternately dresses role of the criminal and the policeman, thus operating against or in favor of justice depending on the character controlled on this or that occasion. Certainly nothing can be contested to American Gangster as regards the graphic rendering: the two-dimensional reproduction of a 70s Harlem is perfectly successful, not only in terms of style but also in terms of the extension of the explorable area, truly big size. The backdrops are therefore defined and detailed, but also the sprites of the cars (although they appear in a reduced number after all) turn out to be small joys for the eyes, yet another testimony of Gameloft's technical capabilities. The French software house, however, would have done better to concentrate its efforts also on the gameplay of the product, which proves to be incomplete in several respects. Above all, the control system is not very convincing, agile only on wide and clear roads but which literally goes into crisis when you find yourself in more agitated situations, leading the player to very frequent collisions. But what weighs the most on the final judgment of American Gangster is the excessive repetitiveness both of the scenario and (above all) of the missions that make up the adventure: from start to finish, all you do is repeat the same two or three operations, all debased by a very low level of difficulty and an almost impalpable storyline. In short, if with Gangstar: Crime City Gameloft could have been granted some sins of youth, with this American Gangstar one thinks that the French have once again limited themselves to carrying out their homework.
