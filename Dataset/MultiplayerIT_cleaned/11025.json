{"name": "Rayman Raving Rabbids TV Party", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rayman-raving-rabbids-tv-party.html", "text": "After several rather successful episodes, on various platforms (the debut took place in 1995, no less than on Atari Jaguar!), Rayman had become synonymous with platforms and bright colors. The series didn't particularly suffer from the transition to three dimensions, continuing to produce good quality titles which, however, no longer had much to say. The Ubisoft developers felt the need to ~disconnect~, perhaps thanks to a spin-off, and taking advantage of the Wii release, they had the idea of creating a party game featuring the ~Rabbid~, rabbits who are as crazy as they are stupid . Rayman Raving Rabbids was part of the launch lineup of the new Nintendo console, but at the same time it was converted for other platforms and was in any case a great success, so as to produce two sequels that also arrived on mobile thanks to Gameloft . Once started, Rayman Raving Rabbids TV Party puts us in front of the minigame selection screen: at the beginning there is only one available, just as only one of the pestiferous rabbits can be used. To unlock both minigames and characters, one must collect a large number of carrots and spend fifty on each ~purchase~. Among the peculiarities of the game there is certainly the control system, which depends on the single key 5, even if the mechanics vary every time; and there really is something for all tastes, with clear references to the most famous video games of all time. In the first minigame, for example, Puzzle Bobble is mentioned: we will find ourselves in the air and we will have to shoot bubbles upwards, changing the direction of movement each time, to save our friends who fall. In another case, we will face a huge rabbit in a Super Punch-Out boxing match, and to resist him we will have to press the 5 key when the circles on the screen enter each other. In the minigame ~Seven Seas Rabbids~ we will instead find ourselves swimming in the ocean while avoiding fish as big as they are dangerous, changing the direction of our movement based solely on the circular movements of the rabbit. Despite the simple control system, the various applications are quite differentiated and the level of challenge is very high. Furthermore, the ~rewards~ system with the collection of carrots is the best thing to entice us to reach the more advanced levels. To this we must add the presence of various different, hilarious-looking Rabbids: the one who mimics Prince of Persia, the soldier from Ghost Recon, the double of Professor Layton, etc. Rayman Raving Rabbids TV Party is a product that bases its appeal above all on visual humour, and in this sense it hits the target without too many problems: the design of the rabbits is very successful, the animation level is discreet but in particular the locations that make the difference, with their colors and their structure that is different every time. There are certainly minigames that are more successful than others, but the difference is never abysmal. And it's nice to see that the developers have put a certain effort into creating the sound, with some really beautiful music which, more unique than rare, adds panache and depth to the action. It is useless to talk about the control system: it is based on a single key, with a rather prompt response to input. PRO Good number of minigames Lots of really funny quotes Great music AGAINST Very limited mechanics Challenge level sometimes too high The quality of the minigames varies", "date": "2008-11-24", "grade": "S.V."}
