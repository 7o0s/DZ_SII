It is a prequel to the entire Cube Escape series and the various titles from Rusty Lake, released free of charge to celebrate the label's fifth anniversary and effectively bringing back one of the team's first ever productions, rebuilt with new additions to make it a truly new game. It's really a nice gift: there is no hidden mechanism in the free distribution, just the will to increase your visibility a little in the best way, that is by offering a free trial of the best the team has to offer on mobile platforms, well condensed in the few hours of gameplay offered by Samsara Room. In this small title we find all the typical style of Rusty Lake and his particular philosophy linked to video games in concentrated form: it is a ~room escape~ style adventure, entirely centered on puzzles in sequence and dominated by an extremely hermetic narration, which makes solving the puzzles more difficult but also frees the game from any standard superstructure, thus being able to range in even rather daring logical connections. The result is a sequence of puzzles linked together by a subtle story but above all by a general atmosphere of truly great impact. The strange symbolism of Rusty Lake is all played on the surreal, with bizarre juxtapositions and a progressive irruption of metaphysical elements within apparently normal scenes. We find ourselves inside a hotel room, without any introduction or clear purpose, and we basically have to do something to get out of this or at least understand what our function is. From here starts the whole game of enigmas embedded one into the other, which progressively reveal a much deeper and more disturbing reality than the initial situation, also touching on existential topics: the reference to Samsara in the title is no coincidence, given that metempsychosis of the cycle of life in Indian religions actually transpires in the strange progression of events that take place in the game, taking us on a rather hallucinating journey between different dimensions but always remaining within those four walls of the mysterious hotel room from which we desperately try to get out. The cycle of life within four walls The gameplay is typical of point-and-click adventures, with direct interaction through the touch screen, so you find yourself touching the various objects in the scenario around to understand which ones we can interact with and how. There is also an inventory, contrary to what happened in some chapters of Cube Escape, therefore the proximity to the classic adventure is even more marked, yet the sensations that derive from the game are very different, partly due to the sense of constraint given from the need to act on a few objects in a small environment, partly due to that particular construction of the puzzles that distinguishes escape rooms from classic point and clicks. The most famous competitor in this area is probably The Room, but Samsara Room also represents a different experience from the latter, above all thanks to its particular deep but barely hinted narration, a hermetic symbolism that lends itself to different readings but which will well recognizable to those who have already got to know the strange universe of Rusty Lake. Touching around we discover that among the everyday objects that surround us within the four walls there is something very uncommon hidden, therefore it is necessary to abandon most of the prejudices on the standard use of objects to find the solution to the puzzles, some of which are far too convoluted and absurd, to be honest. In general, however, puzzle design plays on a good balance between intuition and abstract construction, so much so that it is never too far from the logical schemes. We soon understand that the way out of the room is not what one might expect but requires ~becoming something else~, involving different ~dimensions~ (which we do not describe further to avoid spoilers), so we will have to find out how these change the perception of the room and interact with each other to arrive at the solution. From then on, the game becomes a crescendo of fascinating strangeness, bringing out a sense of underlying uneasiness that never overflows into the actual horror, but maintains a sort of lugubrious and dark note that helps to involve us in the strange journey represented. coming to touch existential topics. The graphic style used is typical ofteam in question, all based on 2D drawing with a simple and clean stroke, with well-defined and almost stylized outlines, capable of creating a great atmosphere. The sensation you get is of finding yourself inside a sort of surrealist framework, to be explored in every corner and which can hide a surprise in every tiny nook and cranny, while the sense of wonder and unease is well underlined by the soundtrack by Victor Butzelaar .", "date": "2020-05-28", "grade": "8.0"}
