{"name": "Odin Sphere - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/odin-sphere-recensione.html", "text": "Wonderful creature And it is worth starting to talk about Odin Sphere from its literally sensational graphic aspect. Surely the artistic direction is the keystone of the Atlus production, with such a harmonious stroke and such attention to detail and the use of colors that it leaves you breathless. It is almost mandatory to stop on some occasions to admire the work done by Japanese artists, observe the care and attention with which a game has been packaged which, to all intents and purposes, seems to be an endless book of splendid illustrations. The sprites of the characters are obviously not far behind, but it is above all the size of some of them that is surprising; the king of the first ~book~ is as tall as a screen, as tall as any of his generals, not to mention the enormous dragon at the end of the chapter. The numerous levels of parallax and the excellent animations are just some of the strengths of Odin Sphere, which among other things is one of the few games for Ps2 capable of being perfectly at ease even on an LCD or plasma TV; and even the sound is no different, with good dubbing and orchestrated songs. But what gameplay is hidden behind so much visual abundance? The roots of Atlus production are planted on the excellent Princess Crown, one of the best games released on Sega Saturn, and recently converted also on PSP. Basically it is an action game / horizontal scrolling fighting game, but with deep Rpg contaminations. Everything takes place within the world of Erion in which the adventure is set; the player is called to take control of one of five characters and basically start beating hands by eliminating all the enemies on the screen. The plot, while not exceptional, focuses heavily on the emotional side, ultimately proving to be more than appreciable. One of the original components of Odin Sphere lies in the organization of the levels, divided into various sectors; each of the latter is circular in shape, and therefore can be traveled indifferently both moving to the right and to the left. In most cases the goal is to eliminate all the monsters present in the sector, as quickly as possible and trying not to take damage; once the area has been cleaned, an evaluation of one's work is in fact provided, and on the basis of this, money and objects are obtained as good as the vote was. At this point one or more exits from the section open up, and by consulting the map you can decide which path to follow among those available in order to then, ring after ring, reach the final one with the relative boss. The key scheme is pretty simple; in addition to the jump, there is in fact only one button for attacks, which if held down allows the character to parry and limit the damage. The blind fury from the button masher is partially mitigated by the need to keep an eye on the Pow bar, which is reduced precisely by continuing to slash non-stop; in case it runs out, it forces the character to remain stunned for a few seconds, at the mercy of the opponents. Obviously there is no shortage of combos, even if rather simplistic to tell the truth; fortunately, spells are available, accessible from a special menu assigned to the triangle and usable by filling an indicator with purple spheres (called Phozon) released by defeated enemies. Deep? A bit'... The RPG elements mentioned above are resolved first of all in the possibility of increasing the level of one's alter ego, and consequently the energy and damage caused by the blows, by gaining experience and filling (again) a special bar. One way to get exp is to eat; different foods have different properties in this sense, and continuing in the course of the game, the possibility of cooking dishes by mixing various primary ingredients is added, in order to create increasingly beneficial lunches in terms of experience and energy. The same applies to the ~small chemist~ component; also in this case it is possible to use different basic elements to create antidotes, potions, incendiary or toxic bombs and so on. The presence of seeds is also intriguing, to be planted in order to then see the plants grow and obtain the fruits. Faced with such an abundance of objects to manage, the inventory restriction becomes really irritating, which all too often forces you to make choices by abandoning what you would like to keep on the street, and not even buying other bags solves the situation; a limit evidently set to stimulate the player to continuously use what is present in his inventory, but which turns out to be rather annoying and limiting. But this is not the most consistent defect of the Atlus production, like thisnor are the marked slowdowns that arise in more complex situations. The flaws that prevent Odin Sphere from deserving a place in the Olympus of the Ps2 game library are basically two: the difficulty, which undergoes an increase once you enter the game, and which irritates above all because it is obtained in an ~unsympathetic~ way, i.e. by increasing the number of enemies to face against the reduction of healing items provided. But it is above all the feeling of repetitiveness and slight inconsistency that holds back the ambitions of the title in question; soon you find yourself doing the same things, eliminating hordes of opponents except moving on to the next ring and so on until the end. The pace of the game seems diluted, and the experience thus passes from the enthusiasm of the first hours to the progress by inertia of the following ones; the combat system, so immediate and accessible, soon becomes limited and not very customizable. A two-player mode, while inevitably going to collide with the plot, would perhaps have made it possible to accept this situation more willingly; or a more developed combo system, or a reduction in difficulty or all the same areas to overcome... We could go on, but the substance wouldn't change: Odin Sphere is splendid to see, not so much to play. Comment Every lover of two-dimensional graphics, or more generally anyone who tends to bring video games closer to art, should buy Odin Sphere only for the sensational graphics, truly blindingly beautiful. It is really sad to have to note that behind this unassailable aesthetic component there is not a game of equal value, but only a more than enjoyable action / rpg but unfortunately characterized by a somewhat impalpable gameplay which above all in the long run highlights irritating limits. To say that the Atlus production is the classic example of a lot of smoke and little fire would be excessive and ungenerous; Odin Sphere is rather a game that leaves a bad taste in the mouth for what could have been and is not. Pros Gorgeous graphics Accessible right out of the box Great sound Cons Appears limited quickly Severe slowdowns Questionable game design choices 2D will never die. Or at least this is what comes to mind playing Odin Sphere, the latest Atlus production which, insensitive to the monopoly of the polygon, has chosen the two dimensions without any hesitation. And fortunately, we must add: in fact, it is enough to observe the first moments of the introduction to be amazed, without being able to close it until the console is turned off ...", "date": "2007-06-28", "grade": null}
