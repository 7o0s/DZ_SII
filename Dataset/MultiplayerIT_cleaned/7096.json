A winning design has been accompanied by gameplay that is a little too much indebted to Mario Kart to get out of its gigantic shadow, thus providing important guidelines for any sequels. Now, although it cannot be defined as a real second chapter, this new version for iOS seems to bring with it a whole series of innovations, which begin with the adoption of the free to play model and continue with changes to the game structure. So let's see if things have actually improved or not... In kart with KERS Converting a title originally born on classic platforms into mobile format brings appreciable consequences after just a few moments of play, and F1 Race Stars is no exception. As it is easy to understand, the control system is the first element to take into consideration in this sense: therefore the Codemasters product in this iOS incarnation offers three different types of commands for what concerns the steering (by means of gyroscope, analog stick or virtual keys), and streamlines the remaining functions as much as possible by making the acceleration automatic and leaving the task of launching the weapons and activating the turbo to two on-screen buttons, here appropriately associated with the KERS device. Precisely this last aspect constitutes another of the most evident distinctive signs of this version compared to the original: in fact, it was preferred to take a step back from the formula used on consoles and PC, adopting a boost accumulation mechanics close to that typical of Mario Kart, with drifts that allow you to store energy to release at will in a powerful acceleration. It must be said that the developers do not seem to have taken care of this feature very well, also forced by the absence of a key to make the car slide on the asphalt: the result is that the KERS loads in a rather arbitrary way, with large curves which often lead to no results and very short swerves which are sometimes disproportionately rewarded. Another perplexing factor concerns the weapons that can be picked up on the track, which in the original had been disappointing both for their visual effects and for their behavior in terms of gameplay: although the margins for improvement were substantial, Codemasters preferred not to touch up this component, unfortunately keeping all the defects unchanged. F1 Race Stars is a valid conversion, penalized however by a free to play model that is too unbalanced Fortunately, F1 Race Stars is also full of positive factors that somehow compensate for the negatives we have just listed. Among the happiest notes of the title, the considerable amount of content should undoubtedly be mentioned, well distributed between the career and multiplayer modes (via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth) which can be selected from the main menu: in addition to the very good variety of tracks and drivers, it is fair to underline how the game offers different types of competitions, daily prize challenges, a convincing progression system through experience points and extensive customization options, all ingredients that end up composing a decidedly rich dish. Also from a technical point of view the work done by Codemasters is undoubtedly commendable, with the tasty graphic style already appreciated in the original which is entirely reproposed here in the context of a less complex cosmetic than that of the console version but still perfectly suited to the standards of the mobile gaming. Too bad that all the good done by F1 Race Stars so far ends up colliding hard with a free to play model so invasive as to expire in the odious pay to win category: in fact, the title presents a whole series of elements that can be purchased through the proverbial two virtual currencies (from upgrades for a single race to persistent skills to be applied to the car) which soon become indispensable in order to aim for the podium, thanks also to the complicity of a ruthlessly infallible artificial intelligence. Not only that, F1 Race Stars can boast the not too commendable record of basically containing every kind of known in-app purchase: ranging from the driver's stamina that drops with each race and must be recharged for a fee - as long as you are not willing to wait the time necessary for its natural filling - to the absolute madness of the shortcuts of the tracks which are also subject to a heavy tax in order tobe traversed, with a whole host of further gimmicks in between. Some constant screens that invite the user to spend real money and a system specifically structured to make the credits earned ~honestly~ by competing in the game completely insufficient complete the picture of a title that certainly will not do good advertising for an already disliked by most users like that of free to play.", "date": "2014-05-27", "grade": "6.5"}
