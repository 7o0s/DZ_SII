After a year and a half, this little game also arrives on the Nintendo laptop, where indie works are increasingly appearing in seek new audience. The conversion is, precisely, just a conversion without any changes or adjustments whatsoever. Therefore, if you already know the game, you shouldn't expect surprises, but for anyone who has never heard of it, it's an opportunity to discover an adventure inspired by the classic The Neverhood and the more recent Machinarium. Here is our review of Papetura. A paper world The prison of Pape from which we start in Papetura Papetura tells us without the use of dialogues or texts the story of Pape, a sheet of paper with arms, legs and eyes that is imprisoned in a floral structure. The creature, at the beginning of the adventure, manages to escape and finds himself having to face a dark creature and fiery monsters that jeopardize the whole world of Pape. The adventure has a somewhat surreal cut and also the description that we have proposed is partly the result of the official explanation of the developers, given that the name of our character is not even specified. Papetura is a very short adventure, which can be completed in an hour and a half at most, and even its ~plot~ is more of an idea than a real plot. What dominates in Papetura is more the somewhat magical and absurd atmosphere of a world made entirely of paper that does not always follow logic. You move in a handful of environments and you have to understand how to continue: the options tend to be few, so it's difficult to get stuck, and above all each area has a somewhat explicit suggestion that can be activated at will, after completing a simple mini-game . The problem is that many solutions to the game ~puzzles~ are not very logical and sometimes it is simply not possible to understand what to do: the use of the suggestion proposed by the developers is practically fundamental and this breaks the identification and the fluidity. Many interactions with the environment and puzzles are also a little awkward with the Switch's analog sticks and on more than one occasion Pape's gait and his actions are far too slow and woody. What we mean is that Papetura struggles to be funny or even just intriguing, unlike other small works based on similar puzzles, such as the aforementioned Machinarium. The quality of the works of Amanita Design is far away and Papetura cannot compete from a playful point of view. A world of wonders Papetura's paper environments are amazing At the same time, we cannot deny that we were fascinated by the world of Papetura. While a bit haphazard at times and while certainly very small in terms of the number of rooms, exploring Pape's home/jail is enjoyable. Each play area is made from paper and glue, with places and creatures handcrafted by the developers who have spent countless hours cutting, sticking and folding each piece of paper to create a small but very detailed world. With very little, Papetura manages to give the impression of being in a living world, with its own rules and its own living ecosystem. There are other creatures to interact with in Papetura as well We also deeply appreciated the sound component, both in terms of music and audio effects dedicated to environmental noises and the sounds of creatures, which fill the environment with life and dynamism. The soundtrack is also created by Floex (Tomas Dvorak), known for his work on operas such as Machinarium and Samarost. The music therefore helps to give the impression of being in a work by Amanita Design, but as mentioned from a playful point of view we are not at the same level as the Czech team.", "date": "2022-12-13", "grade": "7.0"}
