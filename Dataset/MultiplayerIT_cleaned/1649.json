{"name": "Will Rock", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/will-rock_a.html", "text": "The Story Continue A violent landslide has unearthed the passage to the lost Olympus: the ancient and mythological world of the Greek deities. The first to witness the phenomenon were a group of local students. They immediately called a famous American archaeologist Will Rock, who together with the brilliant Doctor Headstrong and his daughter Emma will try to decipher the ancient runes of the passage and open the door to Olympus. But chaos ensued when the students revealed their true identities. They are actually the members of a sect whose aim is to make the ancient Greek gods reign on Earth. After Dr. Headstrong opened the passage they killed him and kidnapped his daughter Emma to be the wife of Zeus, chieftain of the gods. Only in this way will they be able to fulfill their mission. Will then immediately went down to look for them, but the cultists stopped him by involving him in a violent shootout; suddenly, however, a shot, mistakenly fired by Will, hits a statue destroying it. Will, albeit driven by a blind fury, is mortally wounded and falls unconscious while the worshipers flee to the lost Olympus with Emma. But Will's mistake causes an incredible power to develop from the statue: the spirit of the imprisoned Prometheus. Fueled by centuries of wrath, the energy of divinity takes over Will's body and joins his deadly thirst for vengeance. Suddenly Will comes back to consciousness  his eyes start pulsing with a strange blue light and a tattoo, symbol of Prometheus, burns on his hand. Half-mortal, half-Titan, and armed with numerous weapons, Will storms into lost Olympus in search of Emma and those responsible for her death. Loaded by the reflexes and speed of Prometheus, by the Titanic hatred against Zeus, he will face the armies of Olympus - with rifles, flaming bows, acid-shooting pistols and everything he can use his index finger on - until his thirst for vengeance will not be satisfied. As you may have noticed, the story is more varied and structured than the one present in Serious Sam, even if it always has an aura of ~already seen~, it gives a good idea of the situation in which our superhero is involved. Of course, we are not at the story levels seen in Devastation or Half Life, but this genre of FPS doesn't need a story much, since it is based more on the ~fun~ factor rather than the ~immersion~ factor. While not so original, this plot is well structured and engaging, which will keep you glued to your seat while quenching your alter ego's bloodlust. Panorama of Olympus Staying on the Will Rock  Serious Sam theme, they also have several similarities on the graphic side, both in terms of the vastness of the visual field and the amount of moving textures. At first glance it looks like a Serious Sam renewed in graphics and retouched a lot in detail. You will find yourself in awe when you face 50 enemies at a time immersed in the grandeur of a perfectly reconstructed area. The buildings are truly impressive, you will find yourself fighting in the middle of a Necropolis full of details and of immense size, columns reconstructed and textured with great skill, mammoth towers that reach up to the sky, all this while maintaining a very high frame rate. I repeat, the engine and the game are not designed to give a level of detail similar to Unreal Warfare and its titles, Unreal 2 and Devastation. This engine is made to display an infinite field of view and a huge amount of textures, just like in Serious Sam. On top of that, the guys at Saber have added a lot of classy touches. First of all is the ~gore~, the quantity of blood splashes and violence and very high, to give you an example: when you find yourself in small rooms fighting against billions of enemies, you will fill up with their blood, in fact after each fight you and your equipment will be completely soaked, complete with a blood-soaked weapon. Also, if you get hit, you'll see your hands full of oozing blood. Really captivating as an idea, making the atmosphere even more ~frenzy~ than it can be. All in all, graphically speaking, it's not bad at all; it is as much a feast for the eyes as any other title, presenting clean and bright textures, a more than excellent frame rate and really well-structured maps. I'm sure this will be a worthy rival to the next Serious, currently ~under the knife~ of the Croteam boys. rage party! Rage Party, which is the core of the game. Like any Fps ~frenzy~, this one toonew title presents various novelties on the gameplay side. The soul of the game always remains unchanged, that is, it consists in facing legions of monsters and bloodthirsty enemies who will try to kill your alter ego, I repeat ~they will try~, since your hero will also be decidedly more thirsty for blood, death and destruction of any other existing thing. The game system is the same already seen in Serious Sam, almost every area has a closed door, which will only open after sowing death and destruction to all enemies in the area. The system for ~respawning~ enemies is different and more fun: when you have killed all the enemies in the area, many more will appear but, unlike Serious where they appeared through portals, in this case they will appear by breaking through walls, floors, ceilings, or falling from towers, sometimes creating a heart-pounding atmosphere. The enemies you will have to face will range from all existing mythological creatures, such as: skeletons, centaurs, minotaurs, harpies, giants, cyclops and many others. I had particular pleasure in noticing the ~functioning~ of the minotaurs; once dead, 2 bloodied minotaurines will be born from their remains, making the action really.... numerous and fun. To be able to deal with all these mythological enemies you will have a wide range of increasingly devastating weapons at your disposal; you will start the game with a simple 9mm pistol with infinite magazines and a hilarious shovel, yes I said right, a shovel to take all the monsters you meet in spades. The choice in the first 2 weapons is definitely fun and captivating, you should experience the thrill of shoveling a group of skeletons making them smash against the walls. Continuing in the game you will find increasingly powerful weapons, with the protagonist's comment attached to the collection of the weapon. You can find weapons such as: machine guns, miniguns, shotguns, rocket launchers and brand new weapons such as a jellyfish rifle, which turns enemies into stone, an acid-shooting rifle, which will literally make enemies explode, or the classic Atomic Rifle that does not need of descriptions. The game is divided into 10 very varied levels, each level has its own different environment and fauna, as well as divided into sub-levels. In itself it is not very long-lived, considering the number of maps available, but to this must be added the Multiplayer mode which includes 3 different modes, the DeathMatch, the treasure Hunt and the beautiful Co-op. Also from this point of view Will Rock is noteworthy, although it does not have a very extensive single mode, certainly exceeding the canons seen with Unreal 2, it has a fun multiplayer mode that will add a lot of longevity to this title. Not to mention the rock atmosphere that hovers throughout the game, accompanying you in the maps you will be greeted by numerous enemies and a splendid soundtrack that mixes a classic style with a rock style in the ~hottest~ moments. rage party! In conclusion I must say that I was amazed, I didn't think I'd find another Serious Sam title that could entertain me as much as the Croteam title. It should be remembered that a similar title is suitable for lovers of ~frenzy~ Fps, or for lovers of fps in general who appreciate the ~destroy everything~ atmosphere. Warmly recommended to all fans of the Serious series, who while waiting for the new ~working in progress~ title will be able to have a great time with this ~Will Rock~ by Saber. Definitely a good job from all points of view, graphics, gameplay and multiplayer. There is nothing missing from the appeal. And with all this, he will be a worthy rival to the next chapter of the ~serious~ hero. Pros: Very detailed graphics Huge field of view and amount of textures in the field Very funny (especially the shovel) Cons: Fps ~only monsters~ not loved by all Gameplay unchanged compared to other titles Repetitive over long distances I Wanna ROCK!!! Is your life dull and full of stress? Do you face problem after problem every day, creating great tension? Well, Ubisoft Entertainment and Saber Interactive are pleased to present a title which, thanks to a constant daily dose, will distract you from any kind of stress. I'm talking about Will Rock, Saber's brand new fps shooter, which will give you days and days of fun and will also act as an excellent anti-stress therapy. At first glance, this new game is very similar to Serious Sam, the ~frenzy~ shooter (for the uninitiated, it is a FPS genre where you will be attacked by billions of monsters and variousthe only task of killing and exterminating everyone to continue in your mission) where you took on the role of the ~serious~ hero who had to defeat the alien army descended on earth. In this case, our hero, called Will Rock, will have to face the return of the ancient Greek gods who came to earth to dominate everything and everyone. The style of play is the same used in Serious Sam, even the graphics, although significantly improved, are quite similar. I have to say, as a lover of the Fps genre, this game is really captivating, did the guys at Saber Interactive do a good job?
