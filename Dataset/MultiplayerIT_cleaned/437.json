To please all lovers of modern war strategy, Paradox repeated the success achieved with the beloved EU with the first Hearts of Iron. Focusing on the few years that saw the most terrible war conflict in history break out, unfold and end, Paradox excellently achieved its goal of providing a solid and profound product with which any lover of thoughtful military strategy could have confronted. The first Hearts of Iron, as we know, was followed by a second chapter, capable of further increasing the degree of depth of the topic addressed. A step forward, into the ''future'' If it is true that ~the winning team does not change~ it was worth rolling up your sleeves and producing an expansion pack capable of extending the characteristics of the last title. And it is here that the main objective of Doomsday comes in: to give new life to the already exhaustive gaming experience by peeking over the last world war which took place in the open field a few years to concentrate on what came immediately after and which due to its risk and intensity can be compared to a real world war, the Cold War. the main objective of Doomsday: to give new life to the already comprehensive gaming experience All that was missing in HOI2 was just the typical aspect of the conflict between the two superpowers, the delicate and sophisticated macro political systems always fighting to be able to assert themselves over the main enemy. Capitalism versus Communism. To do this, the apparatus of the game has been revisited not only from the point of view of the missions (obviously renewed) but also from that of the interfaces and the possibilities offered to the player. Thermonuclear warfare The Cold War scenario, as we well know, shuffled the cards of geopolitics bringing to the fore a new way of ~making war~, in practice shifting the center of gravity of the conflict from direct to indirect fronts. The war potential of the two main protagonists, the two superpowers, had now reached such a level that a direct military confrontation would undoubtedly have reduced all of humanity to a pale memory. This did not mean that the important war industry slowed down its ardor, producing a whole series of improvements that ended up renewing and distorting the nature of war conflicts in the years to come. in fact, we note that the entire research apparatus has been renewed by adding technologies typical of the first post-war decade Thermonuclear warfare The first step taken by the USA at the end of the Second World War, with the use of thermonuclear weapons on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, had officially opened the way for the nuclear race. Situation that we find perfectly reproduced on the virtual battlefield of Doomsday, where the two blocks compete above all in terms of technological research. In fact, we note that the entire research apparatus has been renewed by adding technologies typical of the first post-war decade. Among these are also the first ambitious space research projects aimed at producing the first long-range weapons and the first intercontinental carriers sadly famous for use in the so far escaped nuclear war. Technologies in the limelight If technological research constitutes a good portion of the development of a faction, the same contribution is given by one of the main novelties of this expansion pack. In fact, Doomsday introduces the concept of espionage, through which it will be possible to strike the enemy ~from behind the lines~ by weakening the opposing forces by exploiting the subtle play of the dark power of the secret services. Never as during the Cold War did the so-called ~spies~ find such widespread use among the great powers. In the game, all this is made possible by a series of tools placed in the player's hand in order to exploit the opponent's weaknesses, know ahead of time the enemy movements on distant and not yet visible areas, steal researches already completed and more advanced and finally undermine the relations between countries in conflict. All this gives the game the right amount of contextualization giving a good idea of the typical climate of the first decade of the Cold War. Conclusions From a gameplay point of view, this expansion gives a wider scope, lengthening the duration of the game as much as possible to the end of the 50s. This possibility first of all allows you to be able to carry on the old campaigns as well, being able to play to the end, even alonefor the sake of seeing how it ends. Although there is only one campaign added to those already present, the spectrum of game possibilities is also expanded in the pre-existing campaigns, bringing the new elements listed above into them. although there is only one campaign added to the existing ones, the spectrum of game possibilities is also expanded in the pre-existing campaigns, bringing the new elements listed above into them Conclusions It is fair to add that a large part of the development work on this title has been dedicated to retouching the artificial intelligence and rebalancing the various war components. A few weeks after the release of the expansion we can already find two patches on the official website, whose sole purpose is to rebalance the game by also following the advice of the virtual community which constantly follows the results of the development team. Final comment Doomsday therefore constitutes an excellent opportunity to enhance a game as complex as it is fascinating, making those improvements capable of reproducing the typical climate of the Cold War conflict in a system created to faithfully reproduce the geopolitical framework of the Second World War. While remaining a title for a few, due to its complexity, HOI 2: Doomsday is undoubtedly the best product in the category. Those looking for a faithful tactical and strategic simulation without too many frills, where the planning of every slightest movement can make the difference, cannot fail to find the much sought-after satisfaction in this title. Pros The playable historical period has been extended until the end of the 50s The balance between the forces in the field has been perfected Introduced the possibility to use the Secret Service Cons It is and remains a game for purists of the strategy, without frills It does not support in a way performing high resolutions Very complicated We know that the strategic genre has its roots in a past made up of toy soldiers and models. The joy that a military campaign enthusiast can experience in seeing a faithful reconstruction of historical battles before his eyes is indescribable. Yet in the mid-eighties someone thought it well to translate, first in paper and then digital form, this interesting and evolved form of entertainment. This chain of events quickly led to the birth of some of what are still considered masterpieces of videogame entertainment in the field of turn-based strategy. From Lords of the Earth, a well-known open-minded paper game, we moved on to the first and legendary Europa Universalis of Paradox (strongly inspired by the well-known board game).", "date": "2006-06-17", "grade": null}
