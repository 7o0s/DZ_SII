{"name": "Soccer Story", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/soccer-story-recensione.html", "text": "The Calamity has stalled football for more than a year now. The Soccer Inc. company took advantage of that tragic event to get its hands on the most loved sport in the world and make it its exclusive, preventing anyone else from playing it, even at an amateur level. The appearance of a magic ball in the backyard of two twins (at the beginning of the game you can choose which one to use), sons of a footballer who disappeared during the Calamity, will give life to a story made of desire for revenge and love for this sport, full of humor, but in its own way dramatic. The Soccer Story review therefore serves us to understand whether or not it is worth fighting for the cause of football enthusiasts. Gameplay Certain actions in Soccer Story require possession of certain items Soccer Story is a hybrid title between a football and a Japanese role-playing game, whose exploratory mechanics are linked to the use of the magic ball. The conceptual starting point is evidently Golf Story, i.e. the attempt to link two seemingly antithetical play systems together, creating an experience that successfully mixes storytelling and sport. It is immediately clear how PanicBarn, the development studio, wanted to embrace here too some themes that are particularly dear to him, already addressed in the two Not Tonights. Behind the colored patina and the greater lightness of the representation, therefore, emerges a critical vision of capitalist society and its desire to control people and their passions for economic purposes. In reality, however, the game does little to accompany what is said with a suitable rhetorical system. Indeed, on closer inspection, the exploratory role-playing part does nothing to deviate from certain conventions. Having chosen one of the two twins (a boy and a girl) to play with, we have to start exploring the surroundings of the house and talk to the other characters to understand what the ball wants first and then how to help football. It all translates into wandering around an open world full of little missions and mini-games to play, with the former usually requiring you to find a certain number of objects, be they acorns, X drawn on the ground, targets that appear from the nothing, goals to score or whatever, and the seconds that are more contextualized, such as beach volleyball with your feet, a bull competition, a swimming challenge or a martial arts challenge. Unfortunately, there is a bit of a lack of more structured secondary missions that are better inserted in the story, given that usually the ~quest givers~ keep to themselves and assign us these tasks, we don't know why, just to reward us with money and medals, so as to ensure that we can continue the progression of the main character and the team (one of the first tasks will be to reassemble the local team). The Soccer Story protagonist has a real character sheet Despite the repetitiveness of most of the requests, executing them does not disturb that much because the game world is not very large and, therefore, you are not forced to travel a lot. In some cases you end up going a bit blind and a certain sense of repetitiveness can take over, but each activity never takes too much time and, when it does, it's usually because we don't usually have the right skill yet to finish it. The map is also filled with little secrets that, if discovered, can net you more money and more medals, to keep you interested and reward exploration. The most structured missions are the main ones, which are also the most imaginative and narrativized ones. While there's a lack of touches of genius, those moments that remain engraved in a player's experience, there are good moments, like entering a retirement home by passing laser beams or stopping an unorthodox ice cream business on the beach. this, the only tool we will have to interact with the environment will be the aforementioned ball, with which we will have to do a little bit of everything, using shots and passes as if we were in a match. There is no violence in Soccer Story, so don't expect any fights, even though the mini-games are sometimes quite fierce. So far we are certainly faced with a reinterpretation of the model of Japanese role-playing games that is not exactly revolutionary, but at least intelligent. Of course, one could also start to stop criticizing capitalism by proposing game systems based essentially on the accumulation of power, but so be it. The problem with the game, however, is another, namely that ~soccer~ in the title. Football sections Soccer Story's football matches it's like playing pinball There where Soccer Story resultedreally irritating ta is in the football sections. Unfortunately, simulating football, even in a light way as the title of PanicBarn tries to do, is not easy. As long as the sporting discipline remains in the background of the gameplay, one does not realize how much the game system does not stand the test of the field. Unfortunately, then the game begins. But let's go in order. The matches are played five against five on very small pitches, without lateral fouls, without corner kicks or goal kicks (the ball rebounds onto the pitch when it reaches one of the edges of the pitch), without actual fouls and with semi-circular penalty area inviolable by the players, apart from the goalkeeper. Each player has four stats: speed, shot, energy, and strength, which should be pretty self explanatory. To grow them you need to use medals, which you get from missions or distributors. According to the characteristics, players will be faster in dribbling, they will be able to execute more powerful shots, they will recover faster from slides and so on. Minigames are more fun than real football matches The attempt to create an agile game formula that is far from any pretense of reproducing the dynamics of real football is evident and almost pleasant, a pity that the result is a sort of pinball machine in which there are no tactics whatsoever, if not a vague ability to control of the players and the identification of the best points from which to shoot to always score goals. When you understand the system, you can start a game of massacre in which you shoot from every position and in which tennis results abound, even if the matches last only four minutes. During a match we found ourselves leading 5 to 1 just 29 seconds after kick-off simply by repeating the same shot from the same position... consider that you score easily by shooting from your three quarters or half pitch, with the goalkeepers who often go for butterflies in a decidedly ridiculous and unrealistic way (when perhaps they prove to be very skilled in closer comparisons). The Soccer Story world is small, but full of secrets Unlocking special abilities doesn't improve the situation much, also because when you manage to win 9-0 in the first match against a team considered very strong, there's little to improve and you start considering matches, more and more frequent as the game progresses. game, more as a nuisance to get out of the way quickly to continue the story, than as one of the hubs of the experience, as in theory they would have been thought. Some aren't super easy, but for the wrong reasons, causing more frustration than desire to master the challenge. The bottom line is that you get to the end of the game a bit by inertia, i.e. just to see how the story ends, but with the annoyance of having had to play too many football matches to make it... which it doesn't seem exactly optimal.", "date": "2022-11-29", "grade": "6.0"}
