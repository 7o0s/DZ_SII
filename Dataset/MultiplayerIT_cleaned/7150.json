On the other hand, the very concept of NES Remix lends itself to this type of exploitation: basically, in fact, everything revolves around a skeleton, a fixed structure to be ~filled~ each time with contents drawn from the enormous and marvelous thirty-year legacy of the Japanese company. As the name suggests, NES Remix is based on the dozens of great classics released on the extraordinary 8-bit console born in 1983; but the future of the franchise could naturally then move to the Super Nintendo era, with an extraordinary potential capable of guaranteeing the release of numerous other episodes. Without exceeding in flights of fancy, however, let us remain in the present, analyzing this second chapter in detail. Nes Remix 2 is pleasant and fun, but the series struggles to take off The Dirty Dozen NES Remix 2 arrives on the Wii U eShop - exclusively in digital format - just 5 months after the progenitor. Compact, very short timings, which clearly indicate which path Nintendo wants to follow. If developing a sequel in a few weeks is in fact a totally unusual practice for the market, it becomes more understandable if we consider NES Remix 2 as not an effective successor but rather a new ~episode~, which keeps the known gameplay formula practically unchanged at the end of last year. In this sense, the product description could really end in very few lines for anyone who has had the opportunity to play the predecessor: it's the same thing, but with other games. However, since it is precisely the latter that determine the quality and balance of the package, it is worth looking into a little more. As mentioned, therefore, NES Remix 2 offers an unchanged experience: the juice lies in tackling short clips taken from titles from the NES era, trying to achieve the required objective in the shortest possible time. If the idea sounds rather close to WarioWare to your mind, you are not wrong at all: the conceptual similarities are numerous and evident, as are the more explicit references such as the jingle at the beginning of each challenge. Each of them, we said, must be tackled by trying to reduce the seconds spent as much as possible; in fact, these are then used to determine the number of stars assigned, up to three, through which to then unlock new levels and further NES titles, naturally also pulverized and adapted for the purpose. In fact, this time the catalog can count on 12 ~sources of inspiration~: fewer than the 16 present in the first chapter, but with a probably higher average quality that allows you willingly to turn a blind eye. In fact, we are talking about ~stuff~ that has forever changed the world of video games such as Super Mario Bros. 3, Metroid, Punch-Out!!, Super Mario Bros. 2 with its Lost Levels and Kid Icarus. There are also less important but nice products like Kirby's Adventure and Dr. Mario. However, there are black sheep, such as the very boring Wario's Woods, Ice Hockey or Zelda II, practically the only ~ugly~ game (note the quotation marks, please) of the Link epic. A list therefore quite satisfactory, with ups and downs but on average more than sufficient; compared to the first, however, the balance changes a bit, because the presence of the puzzle games mentioned above makes the sections dedicated to them less fluid and immediate than the others, leaving some doubts about their inclusion. Eventually we can also reflect on the appropriateness of Nintendo's choice to give life to a series that in both episodes offered a qualitatively unbalanced selection of titles, rather than selecting the best and most representative to be condensed into a single hypothetical extraordinary package. But these are evidently reasons linked to more profitable commercial logics on which it makes no sense to dwell. The stage remixes are almost always interesting, in which the fundamental components are modified so as to give life to completely new and unsettling experiences; nice stamps for the Miiverse to get through your own performance, but certainly nothing that provides a particular extra motivation. One last note on the extras, with content aimed exclusively at the most ardent fans; the target of Super Luigi Bros. could not be defined otherwise in an alternative mirrored version (with scrolling from right to left), as well as the Championship mode that rewards the owners of the first NES Remixwith a trio of tests (Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 3 and Dr. Mario) to create a world ranking on the best score.", "date": "2014-04-30", "grade": "7.3"}
