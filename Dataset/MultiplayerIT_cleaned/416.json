{"name": "Magna Carta: Tears of Blood", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/magna-carta-tears-of-blood.html", "text": "Yet, beyond these comparisons, the references to other RPGs, the game manages at the same time to detach itself from certain stereotypes and to propose some interesting novelties from a gameplay point of view. If the plot does not shine for its originality, in fact, the situation regarding the general playability and the battle system is quite different. In the first case we see a rather interesting innovation during the exploratory phase. Magna Carta does not have random combat. Enemies are visible on the screen and therefore in most cases avoidable. Well, during these situations it is possible, by pressing the R1 key, to draw Calintz's sword or not and therefore choose to switch from one of the two exploratory modes to the other (there are two). The substantial difference between the two ~modes~ lies in the fact that one offers a very small view of the surrounding environment, but allows you to run, while the other forces the player to proceed slowly, but has a much wider view. As seen in other RPGs, touching an enemy on the screen will start the fight with us having the initiative first, otherwise they will attack first. It is also interesting to note that once an area has been cleared, the monsters will no longer recur except for particular script requirements. However, this aspect may not appeal to those who like to level up their characters to capacity by re-encountering the enemies of already explored locations. Once the battle has begun, in the upper right corner of the video we will notice two loading initiative bars, one for allies and one for opponents. When the appropriate indicator signals it, we will be able to take the initiative and make our choices. The position of the latter will change according to the number of enemies present on the screen, i.e. the fewer they will be, the further away their marker will be and your neighbor, and the understanding that there will be between your characters, the latter which can be improved through a special mini-game. Magna Carta's battle system uses a game mechanic similar, in some ways, to that seen, with regard to the Judgment Ring, in Shadow Hearts. In fact, the action takes place through a modality that foresees the execution of the actions through the rhythmic pressure of three keys indicated on the screen, in a small diagram. This system is called the Trinity Circle. Performed correctly, the sequence will generate an attack or an action, otherwise it will make you miss your turn. Each character can develop multiple fighting styles, each of which has at least four different movements. By getting everyone perfect on the ~ring system~ party members can learn new attack styles depending on the setting given to the fight. In fact, there are three different approaches to combat in MC. Choosing one over another can change the strategic planning of the clashes. If the battles are set to ~normal~, we will be able to make our PCs carry out the basic attacks based on their fighting style: in this mode, as mentioned above, they can learn new techniques (others will learn them through special style-scrolls or mini-games). With the ~counter~ system, on the other hand, it is possible to insert a sequence of keys to prevent the damage that is suffered from an enemy's attack, counterattacking him, while with ~combo~ it is possible to carry out, as the word itself suggests, an associated combo to the fighting style of its executor, more powerful than a simple attack, but much more risky to execute since it will leave us uncovered to the opponents. It is interesting to note that after each fight it will be enough to sit in any play area to recover HP, without having to resort to the use of special items. This unusual system is not due to an intrinsic ease of the gameplay, but only to the fact that the lack of ~powerlevelling~ of the PCs will force the gamer to face fights that are always very balanced and expensive in terms of energy, for which too many healing items would be needed to recover from time to time. in turn. But the truly innovative and characterizing element of Magna Carta is the Chi System. What is it about. The entire universe of the game is governed by Chi, an elemental force. There are eight types of it and our characters are not immune to it since without it they cannot perform any attacks. Every action performed by the PCs during a battle will always be associated with a type of Chi. When we carry out an attack we will consume a little element in relation to its type, subtracting it from the surrounding nature. In practice, if we are in a sea area, the type of Chi present will be mainly linked to the water element and therefore we will take what we need from it forr perform the action. Obviously the various locations are characterized by different Chi and it is consequently essential to know how to choose well the men who will make up our group of fighters. Consuming Chi entirely means you cannot perform attacks of that element until it has regenerated. This aspect can be further exploited by the gamer to weaken enemies. Usually in the various areas to be covered there are buildings containing the ~elemental lanterns~. They are associated with the type of basic element present in the place. Using a talisman on these objects it is possible to increase the Chi present in the area or to alter one element in favor of another. If you use many talismans and other items you can even completely change the content of the lantern itself. For example, in an area where fire predominates, the corresponding Chi can be changed by replacing it with a different one, so as to be able to deploy PCs in the party that otherwise we would not have used. Furthermore, this change becomes strategically important because it allows you to cause a strong weakening in attacks on enemies in the area, who obviously exploited the old element associated with the lantern. Finally, two other characteristic aspects of MC's gameplay are the ~quest system~ and the ~luck system~: the first consists of a series of missions aimed at recovering objects on behalf of the blacksmiths that we will find within each city visited, in exchange of a certain fee, the second concerns a ~foreseeing~ Npc and the influence that such visions will have on a Pg. Basically in every inhabited place we will see a guy who foresees the future of the party members. Based on the outcome of the prediction, the ~examined~ character can obtain a bonus or malus that will improve or worsen both his performance in battle and the probability of learning new attacks for the style in use. Moving on to the technical component, it must be said that graphically the game ~moves~ between ups and downs. Visually MC has well-crafted locations and an excellent character design, however it lacks that something that makes it not up to some recent productions. Furthermore, the presence of fixed cameras during the exploratory phase makes everything a bit old-fashioned, perhaps also due to the engine, the same, enhanced, seen at work in the first Magna Carta for PC. The polygonal models are globally appreciable, but some animations at certain times are rather poor, contributing to making certain movements too woody for a similar product. The music, on the other hand, does its job well: it is catchy, discreet, even if it doesn't make the masterpiece scream, while the meager English-language dubbing (the game is subtitled in Italian) leaves a little to be desired. Magna Carta is one of those titles that are difficult to classify clearly without running the risk of displeasing some of the readers: you either love it or hate it. In fact, the Softmax game presents a series of truly original and fascinating ideas, some elements which, if exploited properly also in the sequel, being worked on for Xbox 360, could make the eventual series one of the most interesting in the Rpg panorama, but at the same time shows some flaws that qualitatively undermine other aspects. From the point of view of the characters, the exploratory element, the graphics and partly the BS we are faced with a globally valid product, but for the rest, read ~poor AI of party members or excessively slow loading in the highlights~ The game leaves a little to be desired. Pros: Unoriginal plot but quite convincing. Great character design. Original exploratory phase. Cons: Sometimes excessive uploads. Sometimes frustrating gameplay. Companion AI to be reviewed. It was a pleasant surprise a few years ago, when it was released for PC in the Asian continent, enjoying great success among RPG enthusiasts. Now, after a long wait, Magna Carta arrives on Ps2 and in a revised and corrected Pal version (more a sequel than a port) for the occasion to make it attractive to Monolith users. The world of Efferia is tormented by over six centuries of war between two rival factions that vie for dominance, that of humans and that of the Yason, one similar to the other, except for an above-average physical and magical strength , as well as for a series of tattoos that cover their bodies, which characterize the latter from the former. In this terrible socio-political context the characters of Calintz move, head of a group of mercenaries called Tears of Blood, and Reith, a young woman with a mysterious past, endowed with healing powers, who has lost her memory. It is they, together with the mblack agia (Magna Carta - Ed-), the last hope of victory for humans. The story and the events that will follow from that moment on certainly do not shine for originality, but on the contrary, they often give a certain feeling of deja-vu due to various factors of the plot that bring to mind other themed productions. A similar argument can also be made for some settings and for most of the characters, well characterized both in temperament and in skills, to the point of bringing to mind those of the last Final Fantasy.", "date": "2006-07-11", "grade": null}
