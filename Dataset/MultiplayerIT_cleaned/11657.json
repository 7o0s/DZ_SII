{"name": "Orcs and Elves - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/orcs-and-elves-recensione.html", "text": "Orcs, elves, dwarves and other amenities Orcs & Elves doesn't worry too much about providing the player with a background, explaining the facts, introducing us to our virtual alter-ego who, on the contrary, will remain anonymous throughout the adventure (come on, it's us): he slams us immediately in a dungeon without many compliments, our mission is in fact to explore the tunnels of this immense mountain in search of our king, kidnapped by the forces of evil, and of all the hidden treasures, which certainly do no harm to our pockets. The fact that it is not possible to define our avatar in any way is already a bit disorienting, not only in terms of features, but also of skills: there is no concept of ~class~ (magician, warrior, etc.) and the our hero comes to us ready for use, or rather, combat. During the adventure we will be able to master various types of swords and magic wands to face the various enemies that populate the bowels of the mountain, and another element of extreme importance in the most dangerous situations will also be the sparing use of the various healing and enhancement potions. Orcs & Elves is practically everything here: you don't need anything else, much less RPG or video game knowledge, to play it. Exploration, for example, takes place via the directional cross or the touch-screen: it is possible to move one step at a time in the four main directions, and each movement or attack corresponds to a ~turn~. Even the enemies move or fight one turn at a time, so the positioning and use of weapons or potions becomes a strategic thread, especially against the most difficult opponents or the canonical bosses. In addition to the combat sequences, which are the soul of the game, Orcs & Elves offers very simple puzzles mostly based on movement, and thanks to the speed of the game and the frenzy of exploration and clashes, it is almost more like an action-game in first person than a real RPG. Recycling is good for health Technically Orcs & Elves doesn't make a miracle cry, but it is certainly worthy of note for the very solid frame-rate, stable during any action, movement or rotation: in fact, the game engine only moves a polygonal setting, while everything else it is simply a two-dimensional sprite, modestly detailed by the way. Consequently, each pan to the right or left implies a ninety-degree rotation of the camera, which occurs very smoothly. The main problem of Orcs & Elves is inherent in its repetitive play structure, which for some reason also influences the aesthetic one: the various dungeons to be explored tend to resemble each other after a short time, just as weapons and enemies are nothing more than recycled sprites, from time to time, and colored differently to give the idea of greater power or hostility. From this point of view, therefore, one can only be a little disappointed by the lack of commitment of id Software in the creation of a greater graphic variety, which essentially also limits the player's interest in completing the main objectives of the game: exploring and collecting new weapons to face more difficult challenges. On the sound side, the brilliant variety and quality of the sound effects undoubtedly stands out, while the music remains mediocre from beginning to end, while maintaining rhythms and tones appropriate to the fights or to the tension of wandering through unknown and threatening corridors. Orcs and Elves is available for Nintendo DS. In an attempt to resurrect a decidedly neglected genre and, for this reason, almost original nowadays, id Software takes a courageous step and offers a certainly interesting product, even if not without flaws. Lovers of dungeon-crawling and truly classic RPGs will certainly love the feeling of Orcs and Elves, but the game is still extremely repetitive: about ten hours are enough to complete it, several more to explore every corner of the mountain and collect every treasure. but when everything has already been seen, the interest noticeably diminishes. Fortunately, the technical sector makes the game extremely enjoyable, and bodes well for a possible sequel of greater quality and variety. Pros A dungeon-crawling RPG like we haven't seen in a while Simple and immediate Cons Too repetitive Lack of customization By now, few will remember the old school RPGs, so old that looking at them now they make you smile at how decrepit they are but, incredible, still so terribly valid. In fact, there are certainly not a few who, if they have not forgotten them, have spent hours and hours exploring the dungeons of Eye of the Beholder, impersonating one of the first videogame transpositions truly faithful to paper role-playing games, to Dungeons & Dragons pto understand. Orcs & Elves is an attempt to resurrect that kind of production by leveraging the nostalgia of old fans, but also winking at new users, merging immediate and accessible gameplay with more ancient RPG elements: but in 2008 it can still be an experiment winning?", "date": "2008-01-25", "grade": null}
