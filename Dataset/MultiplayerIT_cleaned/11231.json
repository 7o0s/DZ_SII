{"name": "Reset Generation", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/reset-generation.html", "text": "As a business card, Reset Generation can count on some not bad names behind it: the producer Scott Foe, author of the excellent Pocket Kingdom, and the Redlynx team that gave birth to the Pathway to Glory series and High Seize. People who know how to make a valid product for N-Gage therefore, and already from the background of Reset Generation it can be understood that it is not a game like many others at all; in reality it is instead the first video game based on video games. Yes, because the aim is to take on the role of one of the available heroes, all caricatures of the protagonists of many videogame adventures, to capture the princess from your opponent's castle. And so you can meet mustachioed and muscular plumbers, blue hedgehogs, level 50 elves, heavily armed cyborgs and buxom archaeologists just to name a few. The mechanics basically reveals a strategic title, but far from the complexity and heaviness of the greatest exponents of the genre; on the contrary Reset Generation is based on a few simple rules, but on these it manages to offer an immediate, fun but not superficial product. In summary, up to four heroes can collide on the game board, divided into squares; in each round the first phase involves the placement of blocks, similar to those of tetris, which in fact become tiles on which your character can walk, of the color associated with him. Through these tiles he can reach the opponent's castle, keeping in mind however that staying on his own path provides a bonus both in the distance traveled and in attack and defense capabilities. On the contrary, using squares of other colors for movements becomes risky as well as difficult; moreover, the same tiles can also be destroyed thanks to the two cannon shots that each player has available during his turn, with the forethought that if two bombs are fired on a single square, these are destined to bounce towards other shores . But that's not all, since bonuses of various kinds can be recovered scattered over the playing area with which to make life easier, and if this were not enough, you can always resort to the super power that each hero possesses or to the summoning of monsters and allies. All this, together with many other aspects that we have avoided explaining, complete the picture of a truly quality product, fun and capable of continuously stimulating the player. But this would be useless without an adequate support structure; and in fact Reset Generation combines the single player mode, quite short and which turns out to be more of a tutorial than anything else, with a very robust online multiplayer component which is enhanced by the choice to offer, together with the edition for N-Gage terminals, also a web edition absolutely complete and that anyone can play by simply connecting to the site https://resetgeneration-site.arena.n-gage.com/ . A cross platform project that works great and thus amplifies the available user base, effectively eliminating one of the most recurring problems in online mobile games or the reduced number of players on the servers. It's just a pity that only Internet Explorer is supported, with all due respect to Firefox or Safari users, just to name a couple. The graphic component is also of great value, which does without polygons in favor of a well-characterised, colorful look with great personality.
