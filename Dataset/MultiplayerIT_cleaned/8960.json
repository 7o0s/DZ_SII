{"name": "La resa", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/95437-stronghold-3-la-resa.html", "text": "The Stronghold 3 operation was anything but airy: Firefly Studios comes from the six million copies previously sold, in a period in which the PC game is certainly not doing badly thanks to a sort of nouvelle vague that has reinvigorated its pride and perspectives, and aware that the concept of the series has remained for his use and consumption. Without any evolution that in the meantime may have increased the expectations of the fans. During the article, the result of a presentation that took place a few months ago, we appreciated on the one hand the desire to abandon the useless complications of Stronghold 2 in favor of a return to the origins, on the other the technical and technological leap forward that the years elapsed they would have guaranteed. On balance, after a few weeks after its release and after having been patient for a couple of patches, we can however say that the Anglo-Saxon strategic game does not achieve the desired results and indeed represents a great wasted opportunity. Fragile foundations What amused in Stronghold was the apt mix of actions to be carried out to feed the economy, finance the construction of a fortress and then use it to defend against assaults. Without, however, depriving oneself of the pleasure of attacking in turn. The first part of this process is in Stronghold 3 the least successful and, as in Stronghold 2, perhaps the main reason for failure - although, as we will see later, other aspects are anything but perfect. Unlike the second chapter, however, it is not so much the excessive complexity of the steps necessary to collect and rework the raw materials that disappoint. Rather the near total inability to entertain the player while managing life within the village. By creating more and more complex processes, new building materials are obtained as well as more substantial foods to feed the population but, while there are a good number of different operations to perform, there is no interface and supporting data that allow you to manage and plan its economy in the long run. The same system that adjusts the size of the houses - therefore the number of inhabitants who populate it - according to the position in which they are placed, is intelligent on paper but fails above all when combined with the self-assignment of tasks to workers. There are moments in which one is busy with too many actions, perhaps to satisfy requests that are not always calibrated to the best, and then long pauses in which all that remains is to watch and wait. The ability to speed up the passage of time, added with patch 1.2.24396, improves the situation only marginally. And random daily events, such as the attack of wolves or natural disasters, are not enough to raise the pace of the experience. In short, the accumulation part does not work and mortifies the construction and design of the castle and defense systems, which should instead be the core of the experience. And that on balance don't even work badly, thanks to the possibility of designing the walls freely, without the grid and the limits of the past, and with a higher number of elements available. The clashes themselves are interesting on paper for the variety of units available and the amount of defensive systems to play with during sieges, but the need to have to produce every bow, sword, boiling oil station and trap through the unfortunate collection of resources of the game, mortify this phase. Not to mention that the management of the units and their artificial intelligence are not phenomenal either in terms of positioning or in terms of path finding. Even from a technical point of view, the impression is of being faced with an unfinished business. The three-dimensional graphics are not bad, with good models animated with dignity and, above all, a dynamic system of destruction of the walls and siege weapons that makes sieges much more engaging. Although physics is not always consistent. Unfortunately, then, the surfaces are poorly defined and the weight of a certain repetitiveness is felt in the landscapes. The interface and menus, as mentioned above, are not the best for managing resources and units. In some cases, such as for the mini map, the qualitative detachment from more modern productions is felt. If the visual ups and downs are all in all acceptable for a production like Stronghold 3, much less are the bugs and frequent problems - with related assorted crashes - which still occur today. It must be said that, reading online, the evolutions of the last few weeks have solved several problems for many players - but not us - they have seen a clear improvement in performance. With plenty of time to porthave the game on the shelves and considering that it is a production designed and built exclusively for PC, it is surprising that Firefly Studios has not taken a few more months to refine aspects that can be improved with a little extra work. When numbers are not enough The main mode of Stronghold 3 consists of two campaigns. An economic one, made up of eight missions and as easily understood more focused on the management, growth and evolution of the fortress. The other military, seventeen stages long and designed to give more space to the battles. Therefore, the contents are not missing and indeed, considering the high level of difficulty, it is very probable that the lack of variety of objectives and a non-perfect balance in the balancing of the same convince to give up the shot well before reaching the conclusion. On the other hand, it's fun to indulge yourself in building freely within specially designed maps: when they came out there were only two and really small ones, but with the latest patch a third one was added, Terre Abandonate, bigger and more interesting. The five scenarios propose as many sieges during which to attack or defend, at your choice; an interesting addition that we would have liked to have been richer and more articulated. The multiplayer is, like the rest of the product, an open construction site: there are a handful of maps for four players and some progress has been made compared to the release, especially in terms of bug fixing, but there are still few reasons to recommend competitive RTS lovers to invest their time in it. Perhaps when the promised new maps and modes are implemented, the discourse can change. Unfortunately, it has to be repeated, the feeling is of being in the presence of a poorly finished title.
