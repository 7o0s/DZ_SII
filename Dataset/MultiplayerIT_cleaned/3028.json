Just a year ago, in this period, we were telling you our ever more in-depth impressions after the first contacts in Los Angeles and the return to the tests in London. In the middle a somewhat problematic launch has passed, two expansions and the arrival also on Steam, all elements that lead to the present and to the review of Borderlands 3: Blood Size: third and penultimate DLC pack dedicated to the expansion of the story and the assignments of the third installment of the mother series of Gearbox. As always, we previewed it for you and are ready to tell you what we think. A short but intense size Taglia di Sangue starts, as we have always been used to, on board the brand new Sanctuary III. A bounty placed in the dormitories of the crypt hunters calls us to order on the remote planet Gehenna, where the inhabitants of the Vestige town have long been oppressed by the oppression of the Devils. The first few minutes are enough to realize yet another change of tenor of the narration , as Gearbox has always accustomed us with each new content. After having passed through intergalactic casinos and strange Lovecraftian sects, it is now time for the wild west. Vestige is in fact the classic town made up of spurs and saloons, where the sheriff is somewhat the mayor and where foreigners are not welcome. To enclose everything in the usual gender stereotypes so dear to the Texan team, we think about the introduction of an external and omniscient narrator, who in English with a very strong American accent, introduces all the events of the DLC, in full respect of the style adopted. It must be said that compared to the past packages, this Bounty of Blood, in addition to having a much more sensible and shorter title than the past two, is also substantially shorter in duration. We have completed the main quest in just three hours, then dedicating another couple of hours to the many side missions that are unlocked on the planet Gehenna. The quality of the narration is excellent as always, and although the much more serious general tenor limits the irony dear to the series to a minimum, the narrative arc of Taglia di Sangue seemed to us the most squared and successful, also and above all thanks to some important motivations and the real feeling of saving a planet and its people. The characters with whom you interact are few and not even that deep to tell the truth, but this is a direct consequence of a short and circumscribed duration, probably also the result of a not exactly happy gestation period for anyone in the sector and in the world. A couple more main missions would have helped overall, but we are always more for quality than quantity and, from this point of view, Bounty of Blood does its duty. Precisely given the brevity of the assignment we would like to avoid giving you any other clues about the events, but know that you will fall in love with that ~Indiavolata~ of Rose, we assure you. New additions The positive sensations generated by this DLC also derive from the awareness of finally being faced with some interesting additions in terms of gameplay. The tepid tests already carried out previously had not changed the cards on the table, while this time Gearbox has tried to push the accelerator, albeit still allowing everyone to play Borderlands as it has always been done. to discover the usual series of more or less extensive maps, you will be able to get your hands on some new trinkets such as the grass-jumper and the wind-eater, but also an additional means of transport: the motobeast. The first two represent two important additions to the classic gameplay. The herbjuda is nothing more than a sort of plant which, once hit, will release small insects capable of taking mental control of any enemy and unleashing it for a short time against their own kind. Although it is not a fundamental detail for the success of one's mission, it still represents an additional level of depth, especially useful in the case of highly demanding battles, perhaps at the higher Chaos levels. The wind eater is nothing more than a sort of flow that comes out of the ground in specific points and capable of projecting you into the air to overcome particular obstacles, continue exploring the maps, find secret areas or simply be used as a strategic escape in the middle of the clashes . The wind eater is also used during the boss fights in the DLC, in some cases really huge and difficult to get around without the use of this new tool, transforming it into the best gameplay implementation in a secondthat Borderlands 3 presented to us after its release. Just for the bosses, however, one certainly cannot cry out for a miracle. Compared to the past, where playing solo could possibly give the feeling of perceiving a serious danger, Bounty of Blood goes away so smoothly that, despite having faced him as always in Chaos 2, we have not died even once except for a couple of stupid falls on deaf ears. From this point of view it seems that some of the weapons included are really too powerful, coming to a crazy flamethrower gun with an insane range and a truly immeasurable amount of damage. For the rest, Taglia di Sangue is exactly what you expect, more hours of play in a world that we know inside out and that generates fun and addiction, albeit now with a few too many tired moments. In fact, it is evident that the game system needs to be rejuvenated. That process that we hoped to see already in the final Borderlands 3 code and that never happened, despite the excellence of the whole.", "date": "2020-06-25", "grade": "8.0"}
