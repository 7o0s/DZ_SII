In reality, its international popularity is quite recent, and it is mainly due to the increasingly widespread customs clearance of manga and the production of various animated series, often unofficially subtitled. In America, for example, JoJo made himself known above all thanks to the excellent fighting game developed by Capcom in 1998 and recently revived in a remastered version on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade. Also thanks to the success of the recent cartoon adaptation - the new season began a few weeks ago in Japan - it was only a matter of time before the JoJos returned to appear on the shelves of video game stores: the difficult task of translating all their bizzarria has been entrusted to CyberConnect2, a software house famous above all for the spectacular fighting games inspired by another very popular manga, Naruto. Did Bandai Namco choose well? All-Star Battle isn't perfect, but it's the fighting game JoJo fans have always dreamed of Playstation 3 trophies There are forty-four Trophies to be unlocked: twenty-eight bronze, thirteen silver and two gold, once obtained the platinum one is also earned. For many it is enough to complete the story mode and perform certain special moves, while for others it will be necessary to put in a little more effort, for example by buying all the goodies in the shop or completing each secret mission. Roundabouts One thing is for sure: the roster will not disappoint fans of the series. Of course, with eight chapters and hundreds of characters it is normal that not everyone will find their favorite hero (or villain) among the playable ones, but we believe that the forty-one fighters presented - nine of which are offered via DLC - well represent the crazy universe created by the master Arak. Most of it comes directly from Stardust Crusaders, the third chapter and also the most popular, but the fourth series, Diamond is Unbreakable, and the fifth, Vento Aureo, also defend themselves well, also set entirely in our peninsula with its very Italian protagonists. CyberConnect2 has also managed to effectively differentiate the various characters according to their powers and their individual fighting style, so that not all Stand bearers are used in the same way and some of them are characterized by very peculiar mechanics that you have to learn well to be able to make the most of them. This is the case of Enrico Pucchi and his power capable of stealing the opponents' special moves, for example, or Johnny Joestar who can fight both on horseback and on the ground and can also evolve his Stand. Then there are the ~vampires~, such as Dio Brando and Vanilla Ice, and the warriors of the concentric waves represented by the young Joseph and two of the three Zeppeli in the roster... In short, as you may have understood, there is no shortage of variety and thanks to it, the experience is always quite fresh and interesting for each new character selected. It's a shame, then, that CyberConnect2 slipped on the proverbial banana peel, pairing its good ideas with somewhat woody controls and a not-so-intuitive hitbox system. Let's be clear, All Star Battle is very simple to play: the keys that are used are above all four, three delegated to attacks of various strengths and one to dodging. Even pressing the weak key repeatedly is enough to perform a full combo that ends in a Heart Heat Attack, basically the least powerful super move of the two available to any character. The other, called Great Heat Attack, consumes three bars of the relative indicator and triggers a spectacular cinematic that faithfully reproduces the situations admired in the comic. The aforementioned dodging is associated with the basic mechanics, which allows you to move to another parallax plane to get around the opponent and his blows, and another key delegated to the evocation of the Stand, the horse or the concentric energy that changes literally the movelist of the character using it. Between cross-attack impacts, guard breaks, instant dodges, carpet taunts, cancels on special moves and more, JoJo's Bizarre Adventures is a fighting game with good depth, but forget the frenzy of Blazblue, Marvel Vs. Capcom or Super Street Fighter IV: Cyber Connect2 has conscientiously chosen a slow and reasoned style of play, perhaps a little too much if you take into consideration the set of mechanics and maneuvers in the package, which would certainly have benefited from a more sustained pace than the actual one which, in a certain sense , imposes a sort of ~block~ on more experienced players. The other problem, hand-in-hand with the graphic design of the game which we will discuss shortly, is that of the hitboxes already mentioned: considering the peculiar poses and animations of the various characters, it is not surprising to miss the target sensationally with a low kick only because our fighter carries the attack with an almost completely unnatural speed and angle or in any case very different from that of any other character. It happens frequently, throwing us off balance and perhaps destroying a match played on the razor's edge. It's nothing that a lot of practice can't solve, mind you, but it can be a little frustrating at first, also because many combos or fighting techniques depend entirely on the Heat bar and must therefore be planned with a minimum of strategy. Walk like an Egyptian Of the forty-one characters on the disc, only fourteen will be selectable at the start (sixteen, if you have pre-ordered the game and then downloaded Shigechii and Kosaku Kawajiri). The roster is destined to expand by completing the various chapters of the story mode: each of them is divided into various episodes - fights, that is - which should represent the main clashes of the original plot. Some time ago, while reviewing the fighting game Saint Seiya: Brave Soldiers, we complained about its Story mode, which is extremely incomplete compared to those seen in the fantastic Blazblue and Persona 4: Arena by Arc System Works. The story mode of JoJo's Bizarre Adventures, if possible, is even worse: skimpy at best, told only for very short texts without illustrations or catchphrases pronounced by the fighters at the beginning of the match, it is an embarrassing summary of one of the most intricate and brilliant adventures in the history of Japanese comics. We are a long way from the excellent Story mode of the Capcom fighting game, which CyberConnect2 apes with its ~secret missions~, i.e. a series of conditions to be met to take home a cash bonus: the currency is used to purchase optional bonuses that they will help to defeat our opponents more easily and therefore to close the parenthesis of the Story mode even faster. Fortunately, that's not the only game mode: there's also an Arcade mode specially designed for the western edition, the inevitable offline and online Versus, Training and the revised and corrected version of the Japanese Campaign mode, perhaps the most interesting single player content. The Campaign, in fact, allows us to face matches against the ~ghosts~ of players downloaded from the Internet, or ~bosses~, much tougher and more demanding opponents. By winning, special costumes, alternative colors, extra poses and bonus taunts are unlocked for our fighters, which we can then customize in the appropriate menu. Unlike the Japanese version, our Campaign is not linked to the microtransactions that caused the Japanese release to be discussed so much, and can therefore be enjoyed without problems as long as you can connect to the Internet. And every game, regardless of the mode, expands a huge catalog of bonuses, illustrations, audio tracks and more, which can be purchased by spending the currency obtained by fighting. In short, there is a lot to unlock and see, and for manga lovers CyberConnect2 has peppered every line of code with fanservice, inspired by the original work even in the characterization of the menus and their texts. An incredible work that made us smile several times (~Do you want to try again?~, ~Yes! Yes! Yes!~) and which demonstrates how the Japanese software house has truly understood the original material. On the other hand, this is understood as soon as a match begins: the choice of colors and cel-shading is not accidental and the polygonal models seem to have literally come out of the pages of the comic, with the peculiar outlines of Hirohiko Araki's drawing style and the huge onomatopoeias that appear continuously during the fight. The battles are full of hilarious skits that re-propose some situations seen in the manga in every battleground and which can be exploited to further rage on the enemy, perhaps making him run over by the limousine on the streets of Cairo or making poisonous toads fall on his head among the Walls of Green Dolphin Street Penitentiary. Closing a fight with a Great Heat Attack can trigger a~dramatic ending~, provoking the downed opponent results in a close-up challenge statement, even some victory phrases change according to the characters who faced each other to quote various events from the original work. And then there's the gait of the fighters, their extremely quick and absurd poses that made the mangaka Araki famous, the high-sounding and exaggerated claims, the ~strategic~ attacks that take up the comic as Jotaro's power to stop time already stopped by Dio Brando, and so on. A real riot of quotes, therefore, embellished by a discreet soundtrack and entirely Japanese dubbing which proposes, for the most ardent fans, the same voice actors of the recent animated series in the case of the characters who also appear here. In short, a very well-finished job, even if... Shakespeare and the Roses One of the peculiarities that made the original manga of JoJo's Bizarre Adventures famous is represented by the countless musical quotations devised by its author. Hirohiko Araki, a great fan of western music, has filled his work with absolutely cheeky references: it started as a little game, with some mangled names, and then turned into a real tradition, especially as regards the Stand powers between Golden Experience, Aerosmith, Spice Girl, Red Hot Chili Pepper and so on. As long as it was a niche manga it could have been there, but in the magical world of registered trademarks the situation has become much more complex. Hence, the game in the West has undergone an adaptation that will make die-hard fans turn up their noses: many names have been changed to avoid the wrath of those entitled, and so Crazy Diamond has become Shining Diamond, Killer Queen is now Deadly Queen, even poor Polnareff is called Eiffel and for some reason the crazy Pucci father was renamed Enrico Pucchi. The adaptation affected a good ninety percent of the names, including those mentioned crosswise in the glossary and bonuses, for example Kraftwerk which became Arts & Crafts. If on the one hand this change, understandable as it is, has caused us a bad form of urticaria, on the other we still have the Japanese dubbing: perhaps the Italian subtitle will also read ~Reverb! Three Freeze!~, for example, but Koichi Hirose's voice actress will still shout ~Echoes! Three Freeze!~ and therefore not all the bad has come to hurt.", "date": "2014-04-24", "grade": "8.0"}
