This is Nintendo, a name that is synonymous with video games; nothing of what we are used to defining ~electronic entertainment~ would be what it is without the fundamental contribution of the Kyoto society. And the scientific proof of what has just been stated is only a few lines away. It all started in a forest The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time can certainly not be the cornerstone of the success of the 3DS, nor have the same weight today that it had in 1998 when it amazed the world on Nintendo 64; 13 years later, however, it can best refresh the memory of those who no longer have a clear understanding of the strength of Satoru Iwata's company. It is useless to look for it among the technical specifications of the consoles, among polygons or impromptu features; the N-difference exists in the names of the heroes who become protagonists of titles that do not know the concept of time and its weight, suspended in a limbo where the same games are as fun today as they were when they were first released on the market. Compared to other Nintendo products, however, Ocarina of Time has the ~disadvantage~ of having practically never made its absence felt; this is because, in addition to the first release on Nintendo 64, Link's adventure in question has been revived both on Gamecube with the Collector's Edition and on Wii via Virtual Console, consequently offering a truly easily accessible possibility for anyone to play it for the first time time or rediscover it for the umpteenth. Being back on the Hyrule plain even on 3DS can therefore initially leave some perplexity about the strategies adopted by the Kyoto house, as well as the real risk of excessively inflating what is still today considered by many to be the best video game ever made. Although we do not feel like completely sweeping away these critical ideas, it must be said that Ocarina of Time in this portable incarnation represents in fact the first real remake of the original, thus constituting the absolute best version among those released on the market so far. . Grezzo Games, the team in charge of the project, has in fact demonstrated not only ability, but also enormous respect and sensitivity, finally managing to carry out an authentic restructuring work capable of giving renewed brilliance to the game. Obviously what immediately stands out is the graphic component, modernized and adapted based on the capabilities of the 3DS. New polygonal models and animations, higher and stable frame rate, renewed textures are just the tip of the iceberg; because in general everything has been enriched, strengthened with new details and elements, removed from the limits that the technology of 1998 had imposed in a probably frustrating way on the imagination of the programmers of the original. Let me be clear, we are not talking about a graphically shocking title, nor a test bench for the technical qualities of the console; for example the architecture of buildings and rooms has remained identical, and therefore rather simplistic and ~blocky~. nonetheless, the differences are so tangible and well-implemented that it feels incredibly natural, coherent, and just 'just right'. Even the 3D effect proves to be well inserted, making itself appreciated above all in open spaces, although probably many will prefer to deactivate it in the end in order to better exploit some of the novelties of the gameplay. The 3D effect Although not designed for this purpose, Ocarina of Time is absolutely at ease with the 3D stick activated; it is above all the external environments that benefit from it, being enhanced by the renewed level of depth offered by the Nintendo portable. Too bad for the contrast between the three-dimensional effect and the gyroscope, which evidently cannot coexist happily by requiring you to choose between one or the other. Link to the Past If, as we said, the novelties in terms of aesthetics are the ones that are inevitably more evident, it is however with a broader look at every aspect of the product that the work done by Grezzo Games is appreciated. In the game mechanics the changes are more subtle, but incredibly impactful; details that make the difference, and that allow to smooth out some of the imperfections of Ocarina of Time in its previous incarnation. Certainly much more than welcome the presence of the second screen that has given the opportunity to organize bettero the elements of the menus, previously accessible only by pausing the game; now, seamlessly, both the general map of the kingdom can be appreciated on the touch screen, so as to have an idea of the position of the areas to be reached, and above all access to the objects that can be assigned to the virtual keys. Minimal elements on paper, details or little more, but which in reality weigh a lot to the point of making the pace of the game more fluid, pleasant, without moments of irritation. Also interesting is the ability to rotate the camera thanks to the gyroscope, thus moving the gaze by tilting the console rather than acting on the less reactive Circle Pad; this application finds its place not only for the pure exploration of the surroundings, but also when one finds oneself aiming with weapons such as the slingshot, the bow or the boomerang. A solution that soon becomes preferable to the traditional one, provided however that the 3D effect of the console is deactivated; on the contrary, in fact, we are faced with the usual doubling of the image already widely documented. We have deliberately concentrated the article so far on the new elements of this remake, because as far as the pure and simple contents are concerned, there is actually nothing significant to report; no new dungeons, no characters or items. On the other hand, going to affect a game like Ocarina of Time would have been at least risky; the exceptional quality of the title is more than evident even today, beyond any tarnish caused by the nostalgia factor. In this sense, this remake for 3DS is absolutely recommended even for those who have never had the pleasure of previously experiencing Link's adventure; while lacking the revolutionary character it had in 1998, Ocarina of Time has aged beautifully, confirming the state of grace of EAD at the moment of its creation. The puzzles are still intriguing today, requiring a level of thinking now unknown to most modern games; the profound and splendidly characterized characters, protagonists of an exceptional plot which - added value for us in the beautiful country - for the first time can be appreciated officially translated into excellent Italian. The soundtrack is indescribable, just as important within the overall picture as Link himself is; simply, Ocarina of Time would not be what it is without the melodies that accompany every single moment of the game. Finally, a few words on the extras, unfortunately not particularly exciting: the Master Quest, a mirrored and more difficult version that would have been more welcome if unlocked from the beginning, to further stimulate veterans. The ~Challenge the Bosses~ mode is even less effective, thanks to which it is possible to repeat the battles with the bosses already encountered (individually or in a single sequence) trying to improve one's times.", "date": "2011-06-22", "grade": "9.5"}
