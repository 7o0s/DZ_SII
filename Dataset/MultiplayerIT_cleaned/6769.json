It is true that, on the one hand, the work can be facilitated by being able to restart from already tested foundations, but equally so is the fact that precisely for this reason, and for reasons of timing, they are called upon to try to make a product attractive without however being able to detach too much from the previous ones. If then, as in this case, the publisher concentrates the bulk of its efforts on the next-gen and on the ambitious Assassin's Creed Unity, the fears of those who in Assassin's Creed Rogue saw almost a sort of sop for the fans on the older generation of consoles. Fear fortunately debunked by the facts because, we say it right away, the title developed by Ubisoft Sofia, assisted by the studios of Singapore, Montreal, Quebec, Chengdu, Milan and Bucharest is not that ~stepchild~ that many feared, but rather it is all in all valid. The game, which completes the story of the Kenways and that of the New World, setting itself from a narrative point of view between Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag and Assassin's Creed III, remains stylistically anchored to that of the two episodes mentioned - and in this From a perspective, the title certainly can't be called a surprising episode - yet it's unlikely to disappoint fans. Also because the story presents new developments in the classic narrative plot of the series, questioning for the first time the point of view that after a long time has been made by the player. All this by placing the events under a new perspective, upsetting the reference points of the Assassin's Creed enthusiast, and highlighting the reasons of those who for so many chapters represented only the enemy to be killed, in a particularly dark and tormented story written by Richard Farrese. Assassin's Creed Rogue puts the player in the role of a Templar during the Seven Years War Curiosity The Seven Years' War saw the coalition formed by France, Austria, Russia, Poland and Sweden facing each other on one side, and the alliance between Great Britain and Prussia, the new power of the time, led by the ambitious King Frederick II on the other . Unlike in the past, it was not a dynastic conflict, but a clash aimed at territorial conquest to obtain political-military hegemony in Europe, and commercial domination guaranteed by control over maritime traffic. But the peculiarity of the conflict consisted in the fact that it was also fought outside European territory, that is, in all those areas of the planet where the powers involved had colonial possessions. Not for nothing is it considered by some historians as a kind of real World War I. In this sense, the French and Indian one represented the North American front of the Seven Years' War, and was fought until 1763 by the French and the British with the support of numerous tribes of American Indians. Hunt for Assassins! This time, in fact, Assassin's Creed puts the player in the role of a Templar engaged in the hunt for some prominent exponents of the sect of Assassins. The novelty in itself would not be striking, if we consider that in the third chapter of the regular series the gamer wore the role of Haytham Kenway. However, it becomes so when this role is played for the entire duration of the adventure, and therefore not for a single portion, with all the implications of the case as regards the evolution of the situations and the plot. In the background, as mentioned, the French and Indian wars, the colonies, the naval battles, in a mix of situations, events and facts, as always halfway between the historical and the fantastic, between situations that are a bit phone calls and some unexpected twists . Going into chronological detail for the series, Assassin's Creed: Rogue is set between 1752 and 1761, a pivotal time for both Assassins and Templars in colonial America, with the two factions trying to take control of the New World. And given the historical location, there will be meetings with some old acquaintances of the series, such as an aged Adwal, a young Achille Davenport, Master and Mentor of the Brotherhood during the French and Indian War, as well as Connor's future teacher in Assassin's Creed III, and with the latter's father, Haytham Kenway, founder around 1754 and first Grand Master of the Templar Order in British North America. The protagonist of the adventure is Shay Patrick Cormac, who joins the Brotherhood of Assassins at a young age. However, the boy is not very disciplined and a bit of a braggart, and does not take his role too seriously within the Brotherhood, even though he initially shares the cause. allHowever, after a particularly traumatic experience which confronted him with the ambiguity of the methods of his brothers, he questioned the Creed by deciding to abandon it and join the historical enemies of the latter. Shay has a strong character, and is willing to fight for his principles, even if it means betraying his former comrades and becoming their archenemy. It is therefore clear that the innovation that Ubisoft's production does not fully propose from a technical point of view, emerges on the story front, an area in which the game, as mentioned before, clearly diverges from the previous chapters, staging a fought character and finally characterized by an opposite point of view in relation to what has been seen in recent years. Prey and hunters In terms of playability, the title obviously does not offer the innovations contained in its ~big brother~, namely Unity, but on the basis of the previous chapters of the old-gen editions it tries to offer something slightly different. Starting with a structure that certainly remains unchanged, but which at the same time is enriched in quantitative terms by the increase in the size of the map, the number of explorable areas and the situations in which it is possible to find oneself. In this way the gameplay remains broadly the same as always, and even if the number of sequences is reduced by about half compared to, for example, that of the fourth chapter, a good longevity is still guaranteed by the different things to do. And since the story is approached from an unusual point of view, there are also the inevitable variations in terms of assignments, strategies and arsenal. In fact, in the unprecedented role of Templar, the player finds himself carrying out ~inverted~ tasks, and therefore to protect some characters of the Order from the attacks of the Brotherhood, to eliminate the most important local Assassins after sneaking into their strongholds, or to carry out side missions with the constant threat of being hunted down and shot by surprise by one of the ex-comrades in battle. In this sense it can happen to be involved in a delicate assignment, and while lurking in the shadows to be suddenly attacked by an adept of the Creed. In addition to the usual enemies, therefore, the player must be careful of the Assassins hidden in the dark, who from a certain moment in the story onwards are in turn hunting for Shay. And compared to the other opponents they are much more difficult not only to identify, but also to counter. Speaking of fights, the approach for melee remains very similar to what was seen in the previous chapters, as demonstrated not only by the persistence of weapons such as swords and hidden blades, but also by a certain lack of underlying fluidity in the conduct of the battle itself , and an artificial intelligence of the enemies not always up to par, although the latter seemed a little more attentive than usual. On the other hand, a little bit changes in the fight from a distance, because the protagonist has a technologically more complex arsenal in relation to the historical period, with various long-range firearms such as the multifunctional and silent air rifle. Which offers a greater range of possibilities in the attack phase. Obviously there is no shortage of all those objects useful for defending oneself, creating diversions and allowing Shay to run away when needed, jumping from roof to roof or hanging from the ledges of buildings and trees. Just parkour, a key element in the game mechanics of the entire saga (although in the last few episodes its presence has been a bit reduced), where present, sometimes proves to be spectacular, as well as useful in the most chaotic moments where a desperate escape or a equally frenetic pursuit, thanks to a more effective control of the protagonist. Pad in hand, the feeling with the controls is immediate, but the sensation that is perceived in these moments is that of a noticeable greater fluidity and naturalness in the unfolding of the action, despite the fact that some now historic defects of the saga remain, such as that of the invisible obstacles that every they seem to come between the character and his path, or that of some unwanted movements. However, the gameplay is not affected much, especially for those who are used to these things since the first episode. Moving on to analyze other aspects of the gameplay, the stealth and platform-style phases remain the same as in the fourth chapter. In the first case, acting in the shadows remains decisive, without being seen or making noise, using the Eagle Vision to monitor the area, attracting the guards with a whistle when necessary to eliminate them in dark spots or in any case out of reach visual of his companions, and uUsing silent ranged weapons, such as poison or sleep darts, as well as stringed ones. The latter, depending on the position of the protagonist, can lead to complex and spectacular solutions, such as the possibility of suffocating enemies with brutal and rapid hangings. In the second case, between not particularly complex environmental puzzles, acrobatic jumps and treasure hunts (of the Templars, the Vikings, and so on and so forth), the user is faced with a good variety of things to do for don't get bored. Something that will probably happen instead during the game phases that take place in the present, at the Abstergo offices, which turn out to be boring even if they are useful for deepening other aspects of the history and of the war between the Templars and the Assassins. Xbox 360 goals Assassin's Creed: Rogue offers players 46 achievements to unlock, for a total of 1000 G points. As always, these rewards will be distributed within the adventure and in relation to the completion of particular moments in the story or the achievement of some objective. To give some examples without anticipating anything, they can be had by finishing a sequence, completing all 17 naval missions, obtaining 100% synchronization in each assignment, completing the Abstergo challenges or recovering some specific equipment, just to name the most common ones. From the seas of the Caribbean to the frost of the North Atlantic Assassin's Creed Rogue continues directly in the wake traced by the fourth chapter also with regard to the exploration and distribution of events in the game, harmonizing the action phases on the ground with those of navigation in a more organic way. Also in this episode there are in fact the missions on board a ship (but without diving, given the freezing climate), and as we have seen for the sessions on foot, the formula is the same as always, with some marginal additions to the consolidated structure of the third chapter or Black Flag. To tell the truth, however, it must be said that these are still able to make the experience somewhat different, especially during naval battles. Just think of the fact that now, in the open sea, the gamer can also be the victim of a raid by the Assassins, or the possibility in the cold ones to interact with portions of the surrounding environment, especially with the icebergs. Which allows you to partially change the approach to some battles. These real mountains of floating ice, in fact, can be strategically exploited as a cover to avoid a shelling or, by counterattacking, as a weapon. Once torn to pieces, the smaller icebergs cause a tidal wave that hits the ships, destroying the smaller ones and making the larger ones unstable and vulnerable for a few moments. The perfect opportunity, therefore, to unleash the entire arsenal against it and sink it. From this point of view, the Morrigan, Cormac's ship, is structurally leaner than the Jackdaw, given that it also has to move along rivers, but it is no less lethal for this, given that it is equipped with an armament if possible superior to that of the Edward's boat. In this sense, Shay and his crew can count on a set of advanced gadgets, which allow him to be able to exploit a slightly more varied series of attack and defense solutions than in the past. For example, in addition to the traditional primary and secondary cannons, mortars, and hooks for boarding enemy ships, the Templars have prototypes at their disposal, such as the drum which at a certain point transforms the Puckle cannon into a sort of devastating machine gun in capable of tearing apart vessels in seconds, while to keep at a safe distance or even block potential pursuers, making them desist from the idea, together with flammable barrels or mines, there is fuel oil to be released into the sea and set on fire. Then there is the characteristic rostrum set in the bow, with which to break the ice to make your way, but also to ram enemy ships. All these elements, as per tradition for the series, can be changed by accumulating the material and the pounds needed to buy the replaced ones, to enhance those already present and to embellish the boat. To earn what has just been described (and not only, also for Shay's weapons and accessories), one must, among other things, loot the warehouses of the forts, the supply fields and the holds of the other ships, collect the cargo abandoned at sea from some sailing ship sunk, exploit the proceeds of the mainland from outposts, restored buildings and hunting, which is also useful for obtaining skins or other material for the construction of holsters, armor", "date": "2014-11-11", "grade": "8.0"}
