Despite the strength of the license, Friday the 13th: The Game whose review you are reading has not managed to make inroads into the hearts of fans, constantly trudging against the most played Dead by Daylight. Two years after its arrival on the market (already late in its time) the port of the game inspired by Jason arrives on Nintendo Switch and does so a few months ahead of its main competitor. Let's see how it went. The misadventures at Crystal Lake The big difference between this title and all the others, as previously mentioned and as the license itself suggests, can be traced back to the strong inspiration to that series of cinematic slashers that made history, launching one of the most iconic characters ever: Jason Vhoorees. A boy who has always been bullied, he unfortunately met a bad end at the bottom of Crystal Lake, a vacation spot for many families and groups of American kids. Due to the malignant nature of his mother (the first real killer in the series, despite what many believe) Jason has returned to haunt the lives of bathers, accompanied by his iconic hockey mask. In the game we will be called to take on the role of Jason or one of the many who try to survive his fury, with very little chance of saving himself. Leaving aside the pleasantries, what remains are a series of contour elements that recall the mother series, or some well-known characters in addition to Jason, but without ever giving that thrill capable of snatching a smile or a sincere fright. As we will see shortly, the license also represents the biggest limitation of the game, which in fact does not stand out due to the lack of variety. A gameplay with little bite For those unaware of how this specific genre works, let's do a quick refresher. At the beginning of each single game, a series of players is sorted between up to seven survivors and a single individual assigned to be the killer. It is possible to filter some preferences, so as to be able to queue up more easily on games that are close to your needs. The player who will find himself impersonating Jason will have the opportunity to choose the model of killer to inspire (based on the various film appearances) and choose a series of details, such as those related to the large number of different killings, environmental and otherwise. As far as the survivors are concerned, it will be possible to choose one of the unfortunate ones, each with its own particular trait (less susceptible to frights, faster and so on) to which it will be possible to apply specific perks that are randomly unlocked by leveling up. Once you enter the game, the goal will be stupidly simple: escape or die, as well as kill or be humiliated. To try to save themselves, the unfortunates will have to wait for the end of the game, or risk something more by searching for car parts or otherwise managing to call the police by regenerating electricity and communications. On the contrary, the killer will be able to use his skills to make the lives of the survivors more difficult and giving meaning to his own existence. Characterized by an all too short recharge time, these skills are what unequivocally tell the imbalance from which the game suffers, with a Jason so strong that he can almost constantly see through walls, or teleport to any point on the map that he himself knows in full from the beginning of the match. Nothing more than this, except for what concerns the challenges. Objectives, these, which also arrived posthumously compared to the initial release, which represent a series of tasks to be completed to receive specific rewards. The goal is therefore to repeat these operations again and again, unfortunately with the penalty of the single killer. In fact, its various versions are not enough to avoid the tiredness that comes too quickly and that is felt above all by those who have been playing Dead by Daylight for years and know the variety given by the many villains (some of which are also based on licenses of a certain weight ). Among the various problems there is also a legal dispute over the rights that prevents developers from adding new content, blocked only by the possibility of releasing fixes and improvements to stability. It is true that the game applies particularly interesting mechanics such as that of ~fear~, which allows Jason to increasingly increase the fear of the unfortunate, but these elements alone just cannot raise the level of a production thatand trudges often and badly. The port of (h)horror Friday the 13th: The Game presents itself as a technically low-impact title, accompanied by many low-definition textures and an important aliasing. This does not mean that the progress made by the team in these two years has a positive impact also on the version for the Nintendo hybrid. Few if any frame drops in portable mode, which increase considerably when the console is inserted in its base, but we are far from the technical problems of the first launch. What unfortunately it was impossible for us to decree, is the goodness of the netcode. Searching for a match currently leads to dozens and dozens of minutes of mad waiting, which often end with joining a group that is never fully completed. We were therefore forced to play the title in its offline mode, not exactly the best way to enjoy it. This is especially true if one thinks of the number of players who will actually be present (given the moderate previous sales success) but the low number of current users, as well as the difficult use of a product of this type for a target such as the Switch .", "date": "2019-08-06", "grade": "5.5"}
