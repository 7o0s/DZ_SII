In this sense, there are ~honest~ and ~smart~ free-to-play games: the former effectively leave the user free to continue at a slower pace without paying even a Euro, while the latter exploit their mechanics to literally impose the payment of a fee after the first bars. The Pocket Planes here present is not only a brilliant exponent of the first category, but it is also and above all one of the most enjoyable experiences currently available on iOS. A gliding flight NimbleBit evidently feels at ease with the management genre, already successfully applied to Tiny Tower and now reproposed with Pocket Planes in an obviously revised and corrected version. The user is therefore called upon to manage a fleet of aircraft, starting with a handful of small and slow aircraft capable of traveling only short distances, but with the ultimate goal of obtaining domination of air traffic across the planet. To do this, it is necessary to accumulate money by moving goods and people through the various airports arranged on the game map, using the funds available to buy new devices, upgrade existing ones, unlock new destinations, improve station capacity and so on. That of Pocket Planes is not a competitive gameplay, in the sense that there are no opponents to beat and the risk that one's company fails is not even contemplated: however, the NimbleBit title is far from boring or devoid of bite, and indeed it immediately proves truly engaging thanks to a remarkable care of all aspects of its play structure. To begin with, there is a good dose of strategy as regards flight planning: it is therefore advisable to carefully evaluate the cost/earnings ratio, trying to make as few stopovers as possible and outlining routes capable of saving precious minutes of flight. All taking into account the characteristics of the aircraft at your disposal, different in speed, weight, range and designed to carry a certain number of people, goods or a mix of the two. A balance that also involves the choices to be made on how to spend the accumulated money: therefore, the airport of a large city costs much more than that of a suburban area but guarantees a copious and constant flow of work, as well as the upgrading an aircraft you already own is cheaper but decidedly less effective than buying a brand new model. The greatest value of Pocket Planes is precisely that of being able to give harmonious cohesion to all these - and many other - game elements, setting up a management system that is certainly better than the previous Tiny Tower, as it is capable of continuously stimulating the user to find the most advantageous solutions for each flight in order to maximize earnings. Extremely appreciable is the possibility given to the user to exit the application while his fleet is in flight and be notified by a convenient notification when the journeys have ended, in order to go back to planning without having to suffer waiting times. As icing on the cake (alongside the always hilarious BitBook, the fake social network that gives voice to the Bitizen guests of their planes), the title offers an interesting Flight Crew mode, which allows you to join groups in an attempt to be the first to complete some challenges proposed by the developers and thus be rewarded with virtual money or special aircraft. One thing that Pocket Planes has instead totally borrowed from Tiny Tower is the delightful pixel art style graphic style, extremely pleasant in principle even if it is an active accomplice in making some menus a bit uncomfortable to consult. We close with a note relating to the free-to-play nature of the product: faithful to the NimbleBit tradition, Pocket Planes can easily be played without spending a Euro, simply by using a little patience in building your own empire. What is certain is that when there are just a few dollars left to be able to buy that shiny new plane that has just appeared on the market, the temptation to get a credit card can be irresistible...", "date": "2012-06-18", "grade": "9.0"}
