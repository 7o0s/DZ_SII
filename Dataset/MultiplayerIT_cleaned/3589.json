{"name": "Tiny Metal: Full Metal Rumble nella nostra recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tiny-metal-full-metal-rumble-recensione.html", "text": "Intelligent Systems has managed to create - and embody - the Yin and Yang of Japanese grid strategy: on the one hand Advance Wars, a modern warfare series with epic characters and charisma to spare, on the other Fire Emblem, the even more beloved franchise fantasy which has now become the real flagship of the Japanese studio. However, there is a raw and bitter truth: as nice as it is to see it grow in size and importance, the fire brand has literally overwritten Advance Wars. It has been almost twelve years now that a new chapter has been missing and it is only a foregone conclusion that indie teams rush headlong in an attempt to create a clone, perhaps with personality, as a replacement. Area 35 Inc. already tried it a couple of years ago with Tiny Metal, an averagely ambitious and successful title which however sees in its sequel, Full Metal Rumble, a good pretender to the category scepter. Oil for everyone Area 35 chooses to continue the events of the first episode, keeping the iconic characters and adding new ones that blend well with the narrative structure which, although all in all enjoyable, unfortunately remains sketchy and never fully expressed in its potential. For those not accustomed to Japanese strategic mechanics, the gameplay is based on movements in grid maps, with related limitations and the ability of each unit to differentiate and add incremental bite as the main story progresses. It's a mechanism that works and gives rise to depth and fun: Area 35 manages to make its own evergreen mechanics and solves some not exactly ideal flows of the first Tiny Metal, enriching it with new ideas and a whole series of tricks that make it more fluid and believable the gameplay. In fact, in addition to new units, some interesting innovations have been added: each commander now has improved characteristics, which can be upgraded during each battle, which are combined with the addition of petrol and consumable ammunition for the tracked vehicles armed with cannons . Added to this is the push command and the possibility of directly commanding the leader in what proves to be well-designed maps, never verbose and perfect for teaching the concepts to novices in the early stages, and then gradually increasing the difficulty and entertaining with a discreet dose of commitment. War that doesn't change In short, so far a few words but perfect to tell you that Full Metal Rumble has a good mix of cards to afford at least to look at Advance Wars from below. Of course, the charisma of Andy, Max or Rachel is unattainable: although Nathan or Wolfram are successful characters, there is no doubt that Intelligent Systems has that quid that has always placed them a few steps higher than the apprentices. It follows that the narrative - which even incorporates animated cutscenes - advances at a pace that is not exciting due to events or dialogues, but some may also say that this is a minor element in a turn-based strategy game. Full Metal Rumble resumes what was seen in the first episode: a dozen missions (not many, honestly) make up the campaign, this time colored by a semi-open world that can be explored in search of money to unlock superfluous but nice collectibles such as music and information. We would like to dwell precisely on the audio: compared to the first Tiny Metal, the sound accompaniment has grown, stupendous for the absolute dignity of an audio sector capable of standing on its own legs thanks to a couple of inspired pieces. We were saying, the open-world: a feature that neither adds nor takes away, limited in development but balanced by a clear ambition of wanting to make this title a slightly improved sequel, inexpensive but discreet, taking advantage of Tiny Metal's assets and engine so to give fans a new chapter ready quickly and inexpensive on the economic front. The choice pays off: outside the main quest Area 35 offers the skirmish mode and multiplayer, two inclusions that provide density to the playful offer with a good dose of additional offline hours and an infinite online by definition, provided obviously that you find challengers.", "date": "2019-07-17", "grade": "7.7"}
