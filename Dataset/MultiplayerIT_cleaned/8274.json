The days are getting shorter and the first cold weather is approaching. It is useless to despair, the much hated return to the daily routine has now involved everyone, all except the bears of Behavior Interactive who have well thought of taking a nice vacation on a tropical island, lucky them. The only one not to be invited, needless to say, the controversial Nayghty Bear who, predictably, didn't take very well this umpteenth exclusion from the group. For him, the usual routine of evil deeds and perverse murders against the much hated company of holidaymakers awaits. The hunt is on Taking up the game structure of the previous Naughty Bear, released in 2010 for the retail market, this Panic in Paradise offers the possibility of unleashing our murderous fury in thirty missions each with a different objective on which to take revenge, in addition to the other dozens of victims innocents that we will be able to harvest to see our sadistic race for the highest score increase. Raging through the eleven available areas, Naughty Bear has the task of making those who once again wanted to exclude him from the party pay. gruesome and at the same time satisfying the various ways in which it is possible to carry out our dirty work. Taking advantage of the rather elementary stealth dynamics it is possible to rush behind the hairy victims to grab them and submit them to our sadistic fantasy, we will be able to scare them to death until they go crazy, or eliminate them with real unique fatalities for each of the numerous weapons made available in this way which can then be purchased in the shop. Among the numerous variables that come into play in planning our attacks, there is also a camouflage coefficient which remains at its maximum when we are wandering around in the bush, in the midst of which we can never be identified, and can help us to get confused among the other bears if we have stolen the appropriate disguise for one of our objectives, also in this case the game shop offers numerous clothes and strange objects to wear which can be purchased from time to time once unlocked during the missions and which alter the statistics of Naughty. By continuously carrying the usual set of accessories, these (like the weapons) will give us more and more experience until we have taken them to the maximum. Such a structure pushes the more perfectionist player to fully exploit the wide range of objects made available without ever fossilizing on the usual endowment. A virtuosity the latter justified more by the desire to complete the game 100% since, except in rare cases, the use of one weapon rather than another never changes the mechanics of the gameplay making all the offensive tools more or less less comparable in terms of effectiveness and inevitably flattening the game, bringing it to the threshold of monotony. Xbox 360 goals Making the 400 points made available by Naughty Bear - Panic in Paradise proves to be no small feat, in fact it is necessary to maximize the experience with all the weapons and all the clothing, obviously after having unlocked them during the game. A particular objective also requires obtaining the hard-earned platinum cup for each of the available missions. In short, a clean job without any burrs is required. Blood red sunsets One of the most peculiar aspects, which makes satisfying Naughty's homicidal instincts, is the original exploitation of the game environment, each area is in fact enriched by numerous objects and machinery that our controversial bear can exploit for decidedly executions creative (and generous in terms of points), to this are added the destructible elements to accumulate more money to spend on new objects. Wandering around the limited areas of the island you also have the opportunity to find hidden treasures in indigenous temples, which can be reached by bringing the appropriate key to the stone doors within a time limit, forcing us to resort to the entire strength bar which tends to run out when we overuse the ride. Particularly successful are the animations that describe the murders carried out by Naughty, which often manage to elicit a smile for their original execution, sometimes accompanied by a sadistic direction when we will exploit the surrounding environment to kill. Less exemplary is the video cleaning which lacks a slight aliasing, never too annoying to tell the truth, but which is particularly evident in the rendering of the foliage of the bush in mespace from which we are often called to hide. In terms of modeling, however, it is now clear that the border that separated the first products in digital delivery from the rest of the production has now dwindled almost to the point of disappearing and the general rendering of Naughty Bear - Panic in Paradise appears solid and pleasant and, although not making a miracle cry, it is functional to the immediate and light gameplay of the title. Perplexity leaves the mission structure which, while always presenting new elements and more complex tasks to take into consideration as you progress in the game, can be repetitive in the long run for those players who perhaps can quickly get used to the repeated and light-hearted violence of which the entire production is impregnated, also thanks to the general ease with which many missions are able to be completed.", "date": "2012-10-10", "grade": "6.5"}
