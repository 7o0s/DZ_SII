{"name": "Stellaris: Galaxy Command", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/stellaris-galaxy-command-la-recensione.html", "text": "The transposition on mobile platforms of some historical genres matured on PC, such as the strategic, usually requires heavy revisions to meet the different type of use and interface, but in some cases it is possible to maintain a structure rather similar to the original, such as we see in this review of Stellaris: Galaxy Command. This is the mobile version of the famous Stellaris of Paradox, which has actually had a rather bumpy path, given what has happened in recent months. The game is developed by an external team, i.e. Gamebear, a Hong Kong studio that has some experience in strategy games for the mobile market and which evidently doesn't have many qualms about reusing a few mocked materials: in practice, after a few days after its beta launch, the game was removed due to obvious plagiarism that emerged within it which forced Paradox to apologize and the team to rework the contents so as not to run into problems. Quite evident, in particular, was the presence of an artwork drawn heavily from Halo 4, complete with Warthog and Scorpion tanks in full evidence, which sparked a certain scandal in the community forcing the momentary withdrawal. At this point, Stellaris: Galaxy Command has been revised and corrected and has reached the mobile market in a definitive version, showing how beyond a few hiccups the Gamebear team is capable of building a strategy inspired by the classic 4X style on a smaller scale . On the other hand, the developers already have some experience in this area having previously developed Nova Empire, which Stellaris: Galaxy Command looks too much like. In fact, in many respects this new title looks like a sort of reskin of Nova, able to exploit the lore and certain characteristics of the famous Paradox title but otherwise clearly derived from the strategic precedent of the Hong Kong team. The story places us immediately after the conclusion of a terrible and demanding war that has involved all the civilizations of the galaxy against an alien race from another dimension. The Culling, as the large-scale clash that has just concluded victoriously is called, has left behind a trail of destruction but also the hope of restarting and with this spirit we find ourselves having to re-establish new colonies in unexplored spaces of the galaxy, trying to expand civilization again and restore balance. The premise is just a pretext to start the classic 4X-style strategic mechanics in the space field and the lore is generally not very thorough, which is reflected in a certain mechanism of the game that pushes us to perform actions in sequence without great general coordination . Those who simply want to immerse themselves in the maze of strategic management will not pay much attention to the superficiality of the other aspects, however even these will probably notice some distortions that emerge in the game mechanisms, mainly due to the free-to-play setting. Pocket 4X strategy Stellaris is probably one of the best examples of classic 4X strategy currently in circulation, capable of interpreting the classic structure of the genre in a very canonical way but with a remarkable formal precision and peculiar interpretation of different aspects. As per tradition, it's about exploring, gathering resources, expanding and fighting threats, or the pillars of the genre (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate), but with a remarkable balance and the possibility of interpreting the game according to different inclinations. Even Stellaris: Galaxy Command broadly resumes the basic characteristics of the main chapter, but bending everything according to the typical dynamics of the free-to-play game, i.e. interspersing any action with waiting times that open the door to boosts and reductions of wait for payment. With the intention of expanding the colonization of the galaxy, our role requires to build new space base structures and evolve them into the part closest to the ~city builder~, so to speak, manage the resources and collect them around with the exploration missions and science, specializing in the art of trade and then building a solid star fleet and hunting pirates and various alien threats, which represents the greatest challenge and the one in which the continuous need to level up most clearly emerges upward. In addition to these elements, the broader managerial-strategic aspects also require making important decisions on the socio-political and economic orientation of the colony, choosing between different attitudes that influence the entire evolution of civilization, modifyingnor the characteristics. In the style of Civilization and the like, also in this case we can decide to maintain a pacifist or warmongering approach, based on science or spiritualism, lean towards absolutism or a democratic approach and so on. It could be defined as a ~pay to win~ by broad definition, even if the game can be safely played even without making any additional purchases. The problem is that in the latter case, in order to deal with the continuous expectations, one must rely on a truly abundant dose of patience and be aware that to achieve the most advanced results (such as building the most powerful combat ships) it takes really long time. Also in this case we reiterate the concept: there is nothing wrong with looking for a form of monetization, because it is right to pay something for a well-made game, but the problem in these cases is the continuous recurrence of payment requests, which ends up to inevitably warp the core gameplay mechanism. This focus on expectations and microtransactions is probably the greatest weakness of Stellaris: Galaxy Command, which otherwise manages to condense most of the original's features well in a mobile context. All too well, one might say, given that the breadth of parameters to manage and actions to carry out is so high as to almost overload the small screens of mobile devices, which also emerges from an interface that condenses a huge amount of commands. However, the notable elegance and simplicity of the graphic style plays in favor of this, largely derived from the original Stellaris, which by exploiting clean lines manages to always remain very clear, even if tending to the microscopic (use on a tablet is probably much more comfortable than to smartphones). We also point out that the game is available in various languages in addition to English, but not in Italian.", "date": "2020-07-10", "grade": "6.8"}
