What can we do to push them away? The answer, apparently, is simple: to establish stations that orbit around the Earth and that position themselves precisely on the routes that the aliens intend to follow during their approach manoeuvre. The operation will be far from simple and the degree of difficulty will invariably increase with each new fight, but isn't that the case in all video games? After the controversial FPS Shattered Horizons, Futuremark Games Studio does not give up the ~space~ theme for its new production, developed by Headup Games, but completely changes the genre and decides to try RTS, in this case tower defense. There are two peculiarities of Unstoppable Gorg: the first, very evident, is made up of the continuous references to science fiction films of the 50s as regards the cutscenes (displayed on large CRT screens, rigorously in black and white), the interface graphics and music; the second lies in the innovative ~orbital~ approach, capable of adding action and even puzzle elements to the gameplay. Let's explain ourselves better: in each stage our goal is to defend a satellite from the attack of aliens, and this satellite is surrounded by a variable number of ~orbits~. Each orbit has positions (generally from one to three) where we can establish our units, which, depending on the type, automatically react to the passage of extraterrestrial spacecraft, attacking them until they explode. The units remain anchored to the orbit, but the orbit itself can be ~rotated~ by dragging it with the mouse, in order to follow the path of the enemy ships to keep targeting them for as long as possible. Clearly this movement will affect all the units positioned on the circle, therefore in the presence of different alien ~paths~ we will have to manage this possibility in a balanced way, in order not to leave an area of the screen completely at the mercy of our opponents. Invasion of the Body Snatchers In the more advanced stages, the structure of Unstoppable Gorg invariably transforms into a sequence of trials and errors to understand which type of unit to place and where, which are the upgrades in which it is necessary to invest and which type of maneuvers it is appropriate to adopt when passing of extraterrestrials. In short, puzzle elements emerge that at first did not seem so important with respect to the completion of the internships, which get really mangy from a certain point on; perhaps for the wrong reasons. In fact, the management of the ~towers~ and the related upgrades appears traditional: we have stations that accumulate solar energy over time and which therefore prove to be indispensable in order to be able to create new units (energy is, in practice, our currency), the research centers that must be built to acquire ~technology points~ (which are used to access the upgrades) and finally the turrets divided between machine guns, cannons, missile launchers, electromagnetic discharges, bombs, devices capable of creating black holes and more. The passive units remain stationary to suffer the alien attack, so it is advisable to place them in the central orbits, while the active units can be upgraded to various levels on the basis of the ~tech points~ mentioned above. The problem is that suddenly there is a ~leap~ in the balance of the difficulty, to be precise when the armored ships enter the field, practically immune to the bursts of machine guns (even at the maximum level of upgrade) and sensitive only to weapons from missile launchers up, but they cost twice as much in terms of solar energy and can only be built after a while. This forces us to make precise choices and in the end it takes away a lot of operational freedom, which has always been one of the cornerstones of the tower defense sub-genre, or the possibility of completing the internships by choosing from a large number of different solutions. When worlds collide The single player campaign of Unstoppable Gorg is undoubtedly full-bodied, considering the degree of challenge, the presence of multiple levels of difficulty and the twenty-one missions available, which progressively introduce new elements and mix the cards on the table (see, for example, the automatic movement of the orbits). Furthermore, it is not the only mode available: there are also quite a few challenges, i.e. levels to be completed despite a handicap or with the obligation to reach a specific objective, and an arcade mode set in survival style, in which you have to survive as long as possible with a limited amount of energy and standing up to endless hordes of aliens. The nature of the Futurema branded productrk Games Studio is already well suited to future iPad and XBLA versions (although it will be necessary to verify the adaptability of the controls to each platform), and the technical sector proves to be perfectly in line with expectations, with very light graphics (on the notebook that we used for the test ran with the effects at maximum, without any problem) but obviously not very spectacular and an effective but somewhat repetitive musical accompaniment. iPad Version - App Store Link", "date": "2012-02-03", "grade": "7.2"}
