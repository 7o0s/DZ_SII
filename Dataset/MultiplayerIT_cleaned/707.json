{"name": "Prince of Persia: I Due Troni - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/prince-of-persia-i-due-troni-recensione.html", "text": "Babylon zoo Already from the very first bars of the game, it is evident how The Two Thrones marks a decisive return to the past in terms of atmospheres, a sensation made palpable by the scenario of this third chapter - Babylon - within which a deliberately less dark storyline unfolds than in that of the prequel. After his adventure on the Isle of Time, the prince returns to his hometown together with his new love Kaileena, unfortunately without finding a welcome committee to welcome him, on the contrary: Babylon is in fact under siege, set on fire by a mysterious army that, without too many compliments, sinks the prince's boat and kidnaps his companion. Just in an attempt to find Kaileena, our hero will come across an old enemy and, as if that weren't enough, the Sands of Time will be released again, giving the definitive start to the third adventure of the most unfortunate Persian noble of all time. Although far from being a masterpiece of originality and depth, the plot of The Two Thrones performs its task admirably, but above all it brings the action back within the most appropriate Babylonian frames, for the sake of the global quality of the design of the Ubisoft title. Beyond the prince's look, returned to dignified levels, The Two Thrones in fact shows off a convincing cosmetics from every point of view, where the prequel often left something to be desired. The Two Thrones shows off a convincing cosmetics from every point of view, where the prequel often left something to be desired The scenographic setting of the adventure certainly has great weight in this sense, with luxurious interiors with a Middle Eastern taste that alternate with spectacular views of the streets of Babylon: all embellished by a perfectly fitting color palette and by very suggestive light and refraction effects , in stark contrast to the lugubrious and indeed rather anonymous settings of Warrior Within. Even the animations of the prince have undergone a restyling process, now showing themselves to be even more fluid and well connected to each other, also thanks to a series of new moves that can be performed by the increasingly athletic protagonist: these are more of extensions of abilities already known to connoisseurs of the previous chapters (for example, it is possible to climb over the bars on which only hanging was previously allowed, or make an oblique jump after a wall run using certain ramps), but there are real new entries, on all the skills of the prince to hang himself with his own dagger from some loopholes. New game opportunities offered without compromising the functionality of a truly excellent control system, very precise in managing the movements of the character on the screen and an active participant in the success of an extremely comfortable and versatile virtual camera. The Dark Side Among all the technical elements that play in favor of this new episode of Prince of Persia, the design of the playful environment must also be included, also in this case returning in the footsteps of the first chapter. Closing the parenthesis of the wild backtracking seen in the Warrior Spirit, The Two Thrones certainly presents a more linear scenario than the prequel, but for this very reason much more enjoyable and fluid: the game flows like a beauty, among the always exciting plastic movements of the prince that punctuate the intelligent acrobatic puzzles that have become the paradigm of the series. And it matters little if in the end the duration of the adventure is slightly less than the previous one (the game can be completed within eight hours): if it is true that quality is more important than quantity, The Two Thrones has taken the right path, combining a now solid gameplay a varied and stimulating level design, which, as in the previous ones, contemplates the presence of combat sections between one tightrope walk and another. The game flows like a beauty, among the always exciting plastic movements of the prince that mark the intelligent acrobatic puzzles that have become the paradigm of the series The Dark Side It must be said that the latter do not denote major improvements, resulting more spectacular from a visual point of view than from a playful one, due to a system objectively oriented towards mere button-smashing. The real novelty is instead represented by the so-called quick kills, which allow you to eliminate enemies in one fell swoop by making use of some simple stealth tricks: beyond the inherent characteristics of this game expedient, the great merit of these speed kills lies in the their intelligent inclusion within the puzzles, stimulating the user to take advantage of every opportunity to carry them out. The satisfaction conferred by quick kills is added to the classic one relating to time control thanks to the Sands, which in The Two Thrones plays a newmind a role of weight within a game economy further enriched by the presence of the dark prince. At more or less regular intervals during the adventure, our protagonist will in fact have the opportunity to transform into this evil creature, equipped with a series of peculiarities that make the game sections under his control different from the standard ones. Equipped with a devastating chain tied to his arm, the dark prince often finds himself at the center of furious combat, useful both to unleash his superhuman strength and to provide solace to his ever-declining health, which only the Sands of Time left by the enemy corpses can restore. This condition of precariousness adds considerable pathos and frenzy to these playful portions, forcing the user to act with speed and method by exploiting the character's own abilities (which mainly see the use of the chain also for acrobatic purposes, as an extension towards otherwise unattainable holds or as a means of activating various levers or switches). The introduction of such an aspect can therefore be said to be successful - also considering the positive repercussions in terms of storyline - albeit not perfectly balanced and sometimes slightly frustrating. On the other hand, the idea of the Ubisoft developers to insert a couple of playable sequences on board a horse-drawn chariot, technically coarse and generally not very fun, should be rejected. Cross-platform In contrast with what was seen in the previous episodes, in The Two Thrones the differences between versions are palpably felt, decreeing a visible graphic inferiority of the Sony incarnation: less detail on the characters, a frame rate susceptible to various drops, a more modest rendering of the lighting effects and the classic price in terms of definition are the biggest reasons to envy the PS2 version compared to the Xbox and Gamecube ones. Comment Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones brilliantly succeeds in bringing the series back to the tracks laid by the first chapter, substantially eliminating all the distortions of the Warrior Spirit while maintaining its positive aspects. The great merit of the Ubisoft title is precisely the ability to have brought together the greatest strengths of the two prequels by trying to smooth out their defects, which while not reaching qualitative peaks of absolute excellence, remains one of the most solid action games of the moment, as well as one of the finest interpreters of the platform legacy. Also on the strength of some convincing innovations, Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones undoubtedly imposes itself as the best title of the triptych. Pros: Contains the best of the two prequels Convincing gameplay novelties Technically flawless Cons: Rather short length Combat system with ups and downs Sections on the chariot to forget Success can sometimes go to your head. Hence, after his appreciated return to videogame screens with The Sands of Time, the prince of Persia had one of the most typical superstar ~crashes~ with the following chapter, the Warrior Spirit: tamarro look, nu-metal musical background, hit and miss level design, bucketfuls of backtracking. A slavish pursuit of cool at all costs that brought the prince a considerable wave of criticism from the press and the public, but which fortunately seems to have helped him come to his senses. In this new The Two Thrones, in fact, our Middle Eastern noble abandons the ambitions of a sex symbol to return to being a full-time hero ...", "date": "2005-12-10", "grade": null}
