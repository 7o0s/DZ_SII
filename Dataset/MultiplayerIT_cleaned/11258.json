{"name": "Madden NFL 09 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/madden-nfl-09-recensione.html", "text": "To celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the best-selling football game ever, Madden NFL 09, Electronic Arts presents a title that, in addition to the classic graphic and roster update, offers some really interesting additions, which make the title attractive to all users , enthusiasts and non-enthusiasts and veterans of the most popular sport in the United States. There are always thousands of schemes and statistics to get lost in, as well as the classic set of television-style inserts between one action and another, but this time, everything is easier and more usable, within everyone's reach, obviously without going to undermine the depth of the simulation. My personal (virtual) trainer We start immediately with the first novelty, the Madden Test, or rather a sort of tutorial (Virtual Trainer) that engages us in the defensive and attacking phase, trying throws and runs, with the aim of making the player learn all the game movements . However, the final evaluation is not only a mere judgment of one's abilities, but can also be used to set the level of difficulty, which is very welcome for those who take the oval ball in hand for the first time. In fact, therefore, the game adapts to the player, making it immediately usable and as for the lower levels of difficulty chosen, he autonomously chooses the patterns to apply, limiting access to the entire book of movements only to the hardcore level. Graphically, the Madden test is well done, a virtual reality halfway between Tron and Metal Gear's VR Missions: essential, well-finished, never boring and absolutely necessary to fully enjoy the game's potential. The Madden Games are nothing more than small, rather varied scenarios, in which it will be necessary to relive moments of some famous matches, perhaps overturning a game taken for lost in the last moments. Obviously the enthusiast will find a plus in these small historical matches, while all the others will find a decidedly tough and exciting challenge. To complete all 6 mini games, push-ups, running but also throws and tackles and fantasy football, or the stars and stripes version of fantasy football to be played strictly online. The game mechanics, despite having benefited from a new system of shots and various television amenities, have remained almost unchanged. The important innovations included in this twentieth anniversary edition do not upset a tested system, but if possible, they improve what was already present in the previous iterations. The Madden test, already excellent in itself as a means of analyzing one's degree of skill, gives way to the long-awaited adaptive artificial intelligence of the game. In fact, the title will adapt to the skills of the player, taking the evaluation obtained in the test as a starting point. The matches carried out in the test venue have shown that the system seems to work, with the first ones easily manageable given the initial incapacity of the reviewer, while going forward each single match has become gradually more difficult and demanding in accordance with the best performances following. On the online side, with Madden NFL 09 we can play in tournaments, single games and Superbowl up to a maximum of 32 players; very interesting is the mode that allows us to save the best plays to upload them directly to the Electronic Arts servers where you can make your friends die of envy in front of a successful 50-meter throw, rather than a flying interception with a breakneck run up to half. Technical commentary and secret weapons Rewind, Weapons and Backtrack are instead the most tangible novelties when, pad in hand, you are trying to earn that dirty last goal. As the name suggests, rewind gives us the possibility to repeat actions that are not successful, both in attack and in defense. Obviously it is possible to establish whether to enable this function or the maximum number of possible uses, this in order not to make the games too easy especially in the light of the renewed artificial intelligence. If it is the human player, he has the possibility of ~cheating~ a bit, the opposing team led by the CPU is no less: in the defensive phase, repeating the interception of a pitch missed by a hair, the cheeky digital opponent has become mockery of the defenders lined up who expected the same passage. Ball to the quarterback who faked the throw, flying head down into the unguarded center right in the middle. Game over, everyone at home. Weapons, on the other hand, is the warmongering name chosen for some special players who are particularly skilled in certain situations, who by pressing the key indicated on the screen, intervene directly in the action by performing a particular movement useful for resolving the current impasse, both in attack and in defendyou know. Backtrack will intoxicate all true American football aficionados, all those who go all night to watch games and don't miss a Superbowl. In practice, some unsuccessful actions are analyzed with impressive depth and detail, gutted step by step, complete with lines to trace the movements of the players and technical commentary to explain everything. In practice, this sort of study of one's mistakes in the game and the Madden test are the definitive tool for progressing in the game, a real football academy in the living room. A sportsman for everyone? The sensations you get while playing are extremely positive, you can have fun right away even if you are not a true fan of the oval ball. The comfortable, functional and above all fun tutorial works very well, managing to easily guide the player through the learning curve, which can be really steep and ruthless if you decide to immediately enter the game without ~studying~. The control method also does not force us to learn a disproportionate number of keys, and in this light the weapon system is the classic icing on the cake that makes everything even more usable and functional. The only perplexities may lie in the intrinsic repetitiveness of this sport, its dead times and the large number of schemes to try, relying a little on luck, if you choose to play at the highest level of difficulty. Defects, critical issues that are not necessarily attributable to the Electronic Arts product, but which in the long run can, despite the many accompanying accessory methods, affect the use of the title by newbies looking for a different title from the usual football or basketball . Graphically, the game has improved from several points of view, especially as regards player models and animations, with lights reflecting realistically on the helmets, and excellent reproductions of the atmospheric effects, shirts and faces. More generally, the whole outline of the match has been rethought, recreating a decidedly American television look, very colorful and hyperkinetic, light years away from the ~sobriety~ of both EA's and the competition's football titles. If the creation of the players amazes for the detail and fluidity of the movements, instead the substitutes, referees, TV technicians and various attendants leave no mark, that is all those people who are on the sidelines. They are definitely more than in the past edition, but this numerical increase has not been followed by a qualitative increase in their creation. Comment Madden NFL 09 marks a decisive step forward compared to last year's title, and it does so by focusing on content rather than a mere graphic and roster update speech. The Madden test and the good adaptive artificial intelligence make the game usable for everyone, never frustrating and above all attractive not only to American football lovers. The many game modes then manage to give further substance to a decidedly full-bodied dish, with an interesting career mode to bring our alter ego to the Olympus of the NFL. Obviously, it is still an American Football game, certainly made in an excellent way and with an excellent graphic sector, with the only discordant note of the elements on the sidelines. However, EA seems to have taken the right path in creating a title that stimulates the transition ~from the ball to the oval ball~, a choice that is certainly to be appreciated, in order not to relegate the title to the niche of good sports titles only for enthusiasts. Pro Inclusion of the Virtual Trainer and Madden Test Simulation refined but immediate Many game modes Versus American Football Sideline elements not worthy of the player models", "date": "2008-08-08", "grade": null}
