In the case of Monsters with Attitude, the protagonist of this review, we are dealing with a sort of sub-genre that is enjoying great success, in a constant evolution from browser games to digital games. These are the so-called ~.io games~, a suffix that is now commonly used to identify PvP games in which the progression of the players in the game is clearly visible by the increase in size of the characters and in which we essentially find ourselves trying to ~eat~ as many objects as possible to get bigger and bigger, with the possibility of knocking down the smaller players but trying to avoid being hit by the larger ones. Everything can be traced back to Agar.io, an extremely simple game in which you find yourself controlling colored points that grow dramatically by absorbing other points in a sort of PvP with constant progression, which has also become famous thanks to the usual coverage by youtubers famous, making it a real genre. We have already seen an application of this game structure in King of Crabs and now we see another interpretation in Monsters with Attitude, which is decidedly more evolved and cared for. In this case we find ourselves controlling a monster in a PvP arena for eight players, with the aim of becoming as large as possible and therefore winning the game in the short span of two minutes. Again, everything is based on the sudden growth of the protagonist through the destruction of everything around him, but this must be done in a certain order: the monster is only able to raze smaller structures than himself. , therefore it becomes necessary to act in a strategic minimum starting to destroy the smallest elements of the scenario and then increase in size in conjunction with the increase in the tonnage of the monster itself. All in all, it is somewhat reminiscent of the particular mechanics of Katamari Damacy, only that in this case it is a question of sweeping away everything that we find within range within the arena, trying to carry out a constant and rapid growth in order to be the biggest of all when the allotted time runs out. Destruction and growth PvP does not provide for the total elimination of the opponents but only the absorption of part of their energy, with a dynamic that favors the destruction of the scenarios rather than focusing on the fight with the other competitors, also considering the limited time available to reach of considerable size. Obviously the direct attack is still a technique to always take into consideration, given that it mainly serves to hinder the progression of the opponents, in the event that you are in an advantageous position. A further strategic element is given by the presence of bonuses and special abilities, the correct use of which can distort the outcome of the race. Each character has a specific ability that can in turn be evolved and upgraded, while other bonuses of various types can be collected directly on the battlefield. The fight takes place in three distinct phases: at the beginning you have to focus mainly on the destruction of the scenario to increase the size of the monster, in the second phase bonuses and special abilities intervene, with a more frequent distribution of power-ups on the map and finally the third, when presumably a large part of the scenario is now practically razed to the ground, is more based on direct confrontation with the opponents. In parallel to the combat on the maps, a significant part of the time is also dedicated to the growth and enhancement of the characters. As you progress in the game, new monsters are unlocked, each with specific abilities and different characteristics, therefore it is good practice to take care of the development of at least one group of these, in order to have different choices in terms of destruction and fighting styles. Evolution is based on the conquest of experience points to advance in level but also of special cards to be applied to skills, objects that are usually found inside the prize boxes together with the in-game currency. All of this obviously falls within the classic free-to-play dynamic, with forced pauses before being able to open the chests that can be reset with micro-transactions. Unfortunately, there is a hint of pay-to-win in all of this, although the effect is somewhat mitigated by the presence of 8 giocators at the same time and from the chaos that still dominates in many game situations. In general, Monsters with Attitude turns out to be a well-finished game also from a technical point of view, with a good graphic characterization and an excellent scaling effect also given by the sphericity of the levels.", "date": "2019-04-03", "grade": "7.6"}
