{"name": "Revita", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/revita-recensione.html", "text": "The Revita review put us in contact with the latest exponent of a sub-genre, that of roguelikes, often characterized by a consistent degree of challenge and the perverse charm of the dry match: a progression carried out within the single attempt that inevitably , at game over, asks to start over. zero at each attempt in terms of statistics, we will eventually be able to choose a different weapon and count on obtaining a greater number of upgrades at random. history and structure Revita, the protagonist dealing with an upgrade dealer Revita's protagonist is a blue-haired boy who struggles to regain his memories, stolen by a villain who apparently lives atop a creepy bell tower. Starting from a mysterious metro station, which we will be able to embellish and enrich by spending the resources earned with each attempt from time to time, our task will be to climb the tower and clean it of the enemies present. An elevator will take us to the various levels, generated through a procedural system that will mix monsters and resources from time to time, creating unique and random patterns that can prove to be lucky or not: sometimes we will be blessed by the presence of low-level opponents and at the same time by upgrades capable of emphasizing the our ability to attack, other times it will seem that we really have everyone against us, fate first. The standard opponents (over a hundred!) actually act as a mere preparation for the clash with the six bosses, the real protagonists of the game. In these situations we will have to fight with monstrous creatures who wear a mask, similar to the Faceless of The Enchanted City, but boast very different forms, behaviors and abilities, which must necessarily be learned and memorized in order to survive the battle and continue the climb . True progression in Revita is our own experience, learning from our mistakes, understanding which is the best approach to take against a given enemy and then repeating it all over and over again, in an attempt to finally overcome the most difficult obstacle and move forward to meet another, trying not to lose lucidity due to the inevitable repetitiveness of the action. Gameplay Revita, a frantic clash with enemies The structure of Revita therefore takes the form of a classic tower with a degree of difficulty that worsens as we climb it, even net of the many random aspects that characterize each attempt and can therefore make things easier for us or, often, more difficult. In terms of gameplay, the game is a two-dimensional action shooter in which you shoot by aiming with the right analog stick. jump to the left lat, while firing the right trigger and the right lat activates any equipped special weapon. Getting used to this scheme takes some practice, however if you want you can customize the commands and assign the jump to the usual B button for a more classic setting, but less performing during the frenetic phases. Revita, the statue that allows you to sacrifice hearts to get something in return As mentioned above, one of the few freedoms that will be granted to us in each new game is to choose the weapons that we are going to use among the seven unlockable guns, which change in power, firing frequency, range and type. They range from classic pistols to machine guns, from rifles to lasers, passing through rocket launchers. However, damage, speed and range are ruthlessly balanced, so that there is no really better tool than another. It all depends on what we will find along the way to improve the character and his equipment, but also the upgrade system has been set up because always be a compromise. In fact, to open mysterious chests or buy items from vendors, we will have to use the hearts that make up our health indicator as currency, thus giving up resistance in favor of an (eventual!) upgrade of the attack. Revita, a combat sequence The games are thus transformed into a strategic path, in which one must carefully evaluate when to spend one's life points in search of a possible upgrade, because perhaps we find ourselves atstill in the initial stages of the climb and even the bosses are largely within our reach, and when instead to give up an upgrade that is too expensive, trying instead to maintain the greatest possible resistance against the damage that we will inevitably suffer. After a few dozen attempts the formula of Revita is confirmed as quite solid and well thought out, the evident result of a work of balancing and refinement that the author has carried out during the period in early access on Steam, as it should be, even if the feeling of a greater persistence regarding the goodness of the loot as you go higher on the tower. Graphics and sound Revita, the protagonist with one of the many characters who inhabit the departure station BenStar's talent as a pixel artist is very clear in Revita, and although the author makes heavy use of ~bounce~ in the animations the final result is very effective and inspired, and there is no noticeable drop in quality during the long traverse of the young protagonist. In fact, the many enemies and bosses boast an attractive design consistent with the stylistic choices made for the game's graphics. Of course, the levels in themselves pay duty due to their procedural nature: in the end, they are simply empty rooms, whose contours change according to the area of the tower where we find ourselves but they don't hold any major surprises and are therefore placed at the service of the action, nothing more than that. The sound, on the other hand, is really excellent, thanks to music that immediately enters your head and, thanks to the repetitive nature of the gameplay, remains there for a long time.", "date": "2022-04-19", "grade": "8.0"}
