{"name": "Ynglet", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ynglet-recensione-esperienza-astratta-surreale.html", "text": "Nifflas, born Nicklas Nygren, has never loved the figurative too much. His worlds, starting from that of Within a Deep Forest, passing through those of Knytt, NightSky and Saira, have never been realistic places, but have always presented themselves as mixtures of elements aimed at forming coherent expressive wholes, which fascinate as a whole, more than for the individual parts from which they are composed. In this sense Nifflas is a pure videogame author, who has always remained faithful to his vision and never compromised, both in the face of success and in the face of failure. Ynglet, the subject of this review, is only the latest of the works that make up a large portfolio, created in collaboration with the illustrator Sara Sandberg. Platform to whom? Ynglet is a platformer without platforms, as Nifflas himself likes to call it. Made as a prototype for the 2013 game jam No More Sweden, it has only been completed in the last few months. The player plays a jellyfish, called Ynglet, who lives in a floating bubble with a group of friends. Unfortunately their house is hit by a passing comet and the gang finds itself scattered all over the world. The task of the planktonic creature is therefore to find everyone and reunite under a new roof. The narrative side is all here. The game itself does not give it great importance and is limited to presenting it in a short introductory sequence, which then opens on the hub map: a kind of large city seen from above, from which you have access to the various levels in which your companions are prisoners by Ynglet. The hub map already gives a good idea of the visual style of the entire game, which we could define as ~scribbled~, as suggested by Nifflas himself and as clearly visible in the marker strokes with which the various elements are drawn. The latter appear as just sketched, but still create the perception of being in flight over a large city. Be that as it may, having found a level (circled in green) one can finally discover the true nature of the gameplay, also in relation to the past works of Nifflas himself. Gameplay Geometric figures are vital to Ynglet Each level of Ynglet requires you to save one of your friends and find some objects (pulsing triangles... let's call them that). To do this, our jellyfish simply has to be able to jump between the hand-drawn geometric figures that form the path, taking advantage of the physics simulation (there is no jump button) and using the dash when necessary. Basically the gameplay is all here and for the entire game you cross squares, circles, rectangles and other more or less complex geometric figures; either you jump on trampolines or you take what looks like railway lines. The difficulty is given by two factors: the first is that Ynglet can fall down and be forced to start over from the last geometric figure selected as a checkpoint; the second is the shot itself, which becomes increasingly essential to overcome advanced levels, but of which only one charge can be used at a time, which is restored when re-entering a geometric figure or when touching trampolines and other active elements of the scenario. Those platforms launch Ynglet at great speed Having said that, fear not, because Ynglet is very simple to play and immediate to understand (at the beginning of the campaign there is a tutorial, but it is short and not at all annoying) and, although there are various degrees of selectable difficulty, you are not never faced with insurmountable obstacles (in some passages a certain creativity and a little training is required, but that's all). Furthermore, having gotten used to the controls of the jellyfish, we also find ourselves performing small feats, effortlessly guessing the angles from which to launch to reach the next geometric figure. Shape reports Some passages are more difficult than others, but never insurmountable The almost primordial beauty of Ynglet arises from the relationships that are established between the shapes that design the levels and which, in their abstractness, create constant visual rhythms, attracting the player into an astonishing spiral of perceptive elements. The soundtrack generated by an algorithm, which is composed following the progress of the player. The whole forms a coherent and delicate picture, which fascinates from beginning to end, in which geometries are transformed into sentences and empty spaces into silences. Nifflas' work is one of those that manages to involve manysenses, without ever being excessive or unpleasant, but aiming at the decidedly commendable poetic compactness. It takes about two hours to finish it (including the four bonus levels accessible from the main screen), to which another hour must be added at least if you decide to replay in New Game Plus mode: perfect duration so as not to transform the aesthetic involvement into boredom.", "date": "2021-06-19", "grade": "9.0"}
