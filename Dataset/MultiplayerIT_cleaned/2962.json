{"name": "Company of Crime", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/company-of-crime-recensione.html", "text": "Have you ever wondered what would happen if we combined XCOM with Omerta: City of Gangsters and set it all in 1960s London? Resistance Games tries to give us the answer with Company of Crime, a turn-based management strategy where we can both take sides in the crime and build our empire by following the story of the twins Nate and Ally, and take sides in favor of the law with Inspector Graham and put a stop to the gangs that are spreading in some London boroughs. We thoroughly tested both sides, finding it more compelling and challenging to be able to establish yourself as criminals than to hunt them down: in fact, being a policeman minimizes on the managerial front and above all takes into consideration much fewer aspects with which, in the role of Nate and Ally, we must come to terms or our future as the most influential gang in the city will come to an abrupt end. Company of Crime stands out and entertains for some characteristics, while it is a little more crude in others, evolving into an experience that fluctuates between ups and downs, often repetitive. Gangs of London Despite the premises of Company of Crime, playing as criminals or policemen asks you to respond to a specific rule: never exceed with violence. In the first case, because building a criminal empire means learning to dose the respect and fear that citizens have towards you, as well as avoiding attracting too much unwanted attention, while as regards the policemen the question is simpler; we are the guardians of the law, we must never lower ourselves to the same level as those we will end up in jail. The game therefore provides us with firearms and blunt weapons, as well as melee moves that take away vital energy from the enemies, but invites us to behave more like gentlemen and resolve the issue in the first person with a healthy fistfight. Where in XCOM covers are important, in Company of Crime positioning plays a fundamental role: in fact, each unit, allied or enemy, has a Zone of Control which is essential when - hopefully - you will manage your affairs with kicks and punches. We'll see in a moment. Building your own criminal empire is easier said than done and it is here that Company of Crime puts its managerial side to good use: having to impose ourselves on already existing gangs, our main task will be to undermine them from the neighborhoods where they operate, systematically rejecting them from activities that control and learning to manage fear but also the respect we instill in owners, as well as citizens in general. Assets can be either civilian or owned by rival gangs and in the first case it's up to us to decide whether to take them over by force or leave them free to operate, reminding them however that our protection has a price. is under the control of another gang, before being able to reap the benefits it is necessary to kick out the previous owners: to do so, however, you must have already made a name for yourself in the area (having accumulated respect or fear on the basis of the case) and here we understand the slow and long process of imposition that we have to follow. Starting with small but significant actions, such as robbing or brushing up on rivals, we will be able to make ourselves known enough to be able to push them further and further back until they are totally eliminated. Furthermore, our influence and the fear we instill determine the willingness of citizens to pay without consequences. Because we're criminals, the police are always a factor to keep in mind, and how we approach each mission determines how quickly we'll attract the attention of law enforcement. This is regulated by the Heat Meter at the top center of the screen, which basically grows for each illegal act performed but is further encouraged in the event of a direct confrontation with the policemen or when using firearms and killing people. The gauge is divided into six segments: as they are filled, on a mission, civilians will alert the police and you will have a certain number of turns to finish your job before they intervene, complicating things and even forcing you into a fight which will weigh on the Heat Meter. The only way to return to a low profile, other than owning certain businesses, is to bribe the journalists present in each neighborhood: if we're lucky enough, the Heat Meter will decrease, if not, our reputation will increase. Since every attempt at bribery has a cost and money is yet another fundamental component at the base of our criminal empire, it is an ace in the hole to be balanced correctly so as not to suddenly find yourself forced to abuseand because the attention towards us has become pressing. If we don't pay attention to the Heat Meter and let it fill up completely, in fact, the police will have gathered enough information and evidence about us to crush us, leading to a definitive game over if we don't bring the indicator back to level zero. Those good guys No criminal empire is born only on the basis of bad intentions: you need someone to do the dirty work and as much as the twins can get involved on occasion, you need to hire people who know their stuff and send her to beat her hands. There are four units to rely on: Bouncer, Torturer, Brains and Smuggler, each with its own characteristics and specializations. Going in order, the first is basically a tank useful for creating bottlenecks and preventing enemies from escaping; the second is based on status effects such as blinding or temporarily immobilizing the opponent; the third has a support role, skilled in the use of pistols if you want to use them and above all in insulting or frightening the enemies making them lose control; the last one is, said in passing, the one who is good at not getting noticed so much that he can also sneak among the agents once he has leveled up. Combined together, these classes allow you to manage a fight in the most fluid way possible to get out of it without having aroused too many suspicions. Avoid alerting the police is almost impossible especially in missions where there are so many enemies to get rid of but you can always escape before they arrive on the scene if you create the right synergy between the characters: this also means choosing the 'best skill at each level up, between the two available. Speaking of the actual clashes, we mentioned positioning first: it is a determining factor that could lead you to victory even before consuming the rounds. When you come into conflict with a unit, the so-called Zone of Control is created, which allows characters (allies and enemies) to launch an attack of opportunity when an opponent tries to leave without first disengaging. For this reason, positioning and direction to face are essential to ensure a victory as clean as possible. Company of Crime is a turn-based strategy and this is how the fights are managed: first all the members of one faction act, then the other. Each character has two actions available which he can distribute between movement, attack and skill, whose cooldown varies according to its effectiveness. The success of an action is shown on the screen as a percentage and often depends on the state of the enemy and from the point where we decide to launch our attack. In terms of aesthetics and mechanics, Company of Crime must be given credit for what it offers: there is no he just punches the others, you can also grab them, kick them in the family jewels, hit them in the eyes, smash chairs on the back, throw them against a wall or over a table. In short, there is a lot of freedom in the action and this makes for a spectacular mayhem, a continuous street or tavern brawl. Unfortunately, although all this goes quite well with an interesting and in turn very valuable management side from an aesthetic point of view (you check the situation through a map of the city), the positive sides end there. The melee clashes enjoy some clever level design solutions, the style is evocative and the gameplay isn't bad but overall it can hardly be defined as anything more than mediocre. Non-Artificial Intelligence Company of Crime's biggest problem lies in the artificial intelligence which, to put it mildly, is incredibly dim-witted. During the clashes he makes senseless decisions that give the player either advantages that he shouldn't have or, even worse, disadvantages especially when playing in the role of the policemen. The AI won't think twice about spending an action running through the Zone of Control, then using the next one to backtrack, thus taking double damage. He never tries to get ahead of us except on rare occasions, and if he does, he takes actions that can be thwarted by a nearby ally. In case he finds himself in a defensive position, he will do anything to get back to the center of the fray and throw himself into the carnage. In short, in short there is no sense of satisfaction in playing one mission after another (which in the long run become repetitive) against opponents who do nothing to offer us a real challenge. Sometimes you get the feeling that you just need to stretch your arm and wait for the game to comeor himself bumping into our fist. As a result, many skills that are useful in themselves become meaningless because you don't really need them. If Company of Crime were an action game, we'd say it's button mashing; in the case, however, it is a matter of spending most of the actions moving and punching, sometimes using some skills just to vary a little in the fight. All this applies to both criminals and policemen, with the aggravating circumstance that in the second case we will be helped by civilians - ridiculously stronger units than ours, at least as narrow-minded as they are, since they position themselves in front of the entrances, blocking them. A repetitive strategy In spite of some interesting ideas, the strategic component fares no better: both campaigns move along rigid tracks that include the conquest (or cleaning depending on the faction) of some neighborhoods, eliminating the gangs that have taken possession for be able to continue. As we wrote above, in the criminal sphere there are several aspects to keep under control but in the end everything boils down to a series of repetitive actions, as redundant are the scenarios regardless of the action you decide to take in this regard: therefore it does not matter if you decide from robbing a business, defending it from a police raid or brushing someone up to let them know who's boss, the map will be the same and scenery elements such as upper floors won't be calculated because the objective will always hang around the same point. Furthermore, if you can bear this wall of grueling repetitiveness, you will arrive about halfway through the campaign that you will be perfectly free to ignore all the threats that can annoy your rise as crime lords, so many will be the resources accumulated in the meantime. As for the police, playing as them is even easier because you don't have to worry about rocking the boat too much or money with which to hire new staff: your tasks will be different in name but identical in structure to those of the criminals and the campaign more or less follows the same trend, obviously with different objectives having to arrest outlaws. The same agents available will once again be different in roles but identical in substance, with just a few variations in moves. Overall, therefore, the good ideas that Company of Crime has are also sunk but not only by the repetitive factor which in the long run weighs and affects the fluidity of the game.", "date": "2020-08-12", "grade": "5.5"}
