{"name": "Ritorno a Metro City", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/77326-final-fight-double-impact-ritorno-a-metro-city.html", "text": "Version tested: PlayStation 3When organized crime thought of kidnapping the daughter of the mayor of Metro City to keep him in their grip, they obviously didn't do their calculations right. Firstly, Mike Haggar (the aforementioned mayor) has a career as a professional wrestler behind him and his favorite pastime is grabbing poor unfortunate people, blowing up and landing on their heads; secondly, her daughter Jessica's boyfriend Cody is known to be a very skilled vigilante in brawls, able to smash anything with his fists; finally, as if that weren't enough, the girl also has a secret suitor, Guy, who attends ninja school and who sharpens the toes of his boots every evening to be able to perform the most ~stinging~ flying kick the world knows. The three reunite and leave for the slums, with the aim of routing any resistance and being told, with the good but above all with the bad, where they have brought Jessica. The rest is known history: a series of areas full of bad guys to ~soften~ and dangerous final bosses, a lot of moves to make and one of the most famous and fascinating cooperative multiplayer ever. Otherwise we get angry Final Fight, released in arcades at the end of 1989, brings with it an extraordinary load of quotes, able to exemplify the influence of certain figures on the Japanese imagination. The enemies Haggar, Cody and Guy are up against are pumped-up versions of Michael Jackson (were his leather jacket straps that wide in the ~Thriller~ video?), effeminate variations of Andre ~The Giant~ (who fought in the Japanese federations for quite a few years before ending up in the court of Vince McMahon) and the Road Warriors (a very famous tag team in those years), but also original characters who, as per Capcom tradition, would have been fished out in the subsequent years to crowd a ~shared world~ that in many ways resembles the Marvel Universe. The one offered to us by Final Fight: Double Impact is not the first ~arcade perfect~ conversion of what can be considered the scrolling fighting game par excellence, and unlike Super Street Fighter II HD Remix it cannot boast completely redesigned graphics for the occasion , therefore, in the end, the place of this product in that part of the market reserved for nostalgics is clear. However, it must be said that the work carried out by Proper Games has its own reason, with the cabinet visible in the standard view which tries to recreate the atmosphere of the arcade as much as possible (even the graphics are ~deformed~ due to the screen being anything but what a flat coin-op of the time), alternating with two different full-screen views that use filters capable of making the sprites less ~pixelated~ than they actually are. And then there's online multiplayer, which plays a major role: unless you decide to play offline, in fact, every time we start a game a multiplayer session is started and any player in the world can join by entering their virtual token. Similarly, we can search for an already started game and join it, or dust off the second Dual Shock 3 and connect it to the console for a ~double~ with a friend for remembrance of old times. The multiplayer rules effectively forbid us to pause the game, which can be a problem (especially if we are not aware of this detail yet), but in general the games take place without lag and without slowdowns. Due to the amount of moves at our disposal and the famous ~sensation of impact, Final Fight still stands today as a title with a current and engaging gameplay, designed to be faced in two (the opponents can steal too much energy with a couple of successful attacks, let alone when we get surrounded) and with a two-button control system that is well suited to use with the joypad. Playstation 3 trophies Final Fight: Double Impact offers us a total of twelve trophies: five for Final Fight, seven for Magic Sword. The former are obtained simply by completing the game with Haggar, Cody, Guy and in co-op mode, as well as reaching the end by continuing less than eighteen times. To get the seconds you need to complete Magic Sword, get both endings, continue less than eighteen times, complete a stage without being touched, etc. The magic sword Included in the bundle to make it more convenient from an economic point of view (9.99 euros for Final Fight alone would have been a bit too much), Magic Sword looks a bit like the poor brother of the exceptional Black Tiger that we all remember with affection. To watch theoriginal release date of the game (1990), we realize that it is a good three years older than the classic Capcom just mentioned, yet the influences are clear: the character moves in an almost identical way, many sprites are the same (the bats , the chests, the old merchant transformed into an evil flying sorcerer...) but important elements are missing such as the upgrading of weapons and armor, and above all the care in the technical realization is far from being the same, in particular as regards the animations. The game sees us control a warrior who must climb a huge tower and then explore its circles in search of treasures and allies. The latter (a rather large group: giants, ninjas, amazons, priests, magicians, thieves, knights and lizard-men) must be freed from their prisons using the keys collected around, and constitute a sort of ~pod~ of that is, they attack together with us (often using long-range weapons) and have their own health bar. This solution distinguishes Magic Sword from many action games of the time, in which life was generally lost on the first hit. Exactly like Final Fight, Magic Sword can be played in cooperative multiplayer mode both online and locally, even if from this point of view the results are not quite the same: the difficulty seems calibrated for the single player game, so things in twos become a little too easy and the now standardized presence of infinite ~continues~ ends up making the experience almost ethereal.", "date": "2010-05-21", "grade": "8.0"}
