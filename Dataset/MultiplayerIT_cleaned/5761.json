Final goal: to create a visionary title, artistically indisputable and with the same sad tone completely free from any creative and productive constraints and taking full advantage of the newborn friendship with Wycleaf Jean, well-known musician to whom we owe the most famous pieces of the Refugees. On these bases Lost in Harmony was born, the mobile title that we are about to review on these pages: a video game with great potential that tries to have its say within two genres heavily abused in recent years and which, while being fresh, beautiful to look at and rather complex and satisfying to play, fails to materialize that desire for innovation that Yoan had announced and underlined on several past occasions. Is Lost in Harmony really the perfect hybrid between runner and rhythm game? We're not so convinced... A little rhythm, a little runner Basically Lost in Harmony is a level runner where the protagonist, Kaito, has to escape from a whole series of obstacles and impediments by running towards the player aboard his skateboard carrying his best friend Aya astride. With the use of our fingers we will be able to move it sideways to avoid the obstacles that reach us from behind, those that try to hit us from the sides and those that arrive from beyond the screen, in front of the main character. It is also possible to jump and, as if this were not enough, we will have to collect special luminous globes, three per level, and stardust scattered on the ground. To make the gameplay even more tangled, however, in certain phases of the level we will also have to interact with the background music as in the most classic rhythm games: by touching the symbols that appear on the upper part of the screen at the right time. For some, just a tap is enough, others will have to be touched simultaneously by two fingers and still others will have to be literally dragged from one side of the screen to the other. All this while Kaito and Aya continue their escape, obviously simplified during these phases, but which still forces us to always keep an eye on the path to avoid any sudden obstacles. The result of this hybrid between genres is a particularly complex video game, which requires great skill on the part of the player, especially progressing through the levels and in particular if you choose to play Lost in Harmony on a smartphone instead of a tablet, considering that the area of interaction is greatly reduced, sometimes making it more complex to touch the right points or dodge obstacles correctly in the most intense moments. Speaking of levels, the game contains thirteen, all extremely different in terms of setting and challenges offered and which can, among other things, be replayed by choosing between two different degrees of difficulty. It wouldn't be a Fanise title if it didn't also have a narrative component and in fact between one level and the next, we find microscopic story sequences where Kaito exchanges a few jokes on the phone with Aya, through a Whatsapp clone before falling asleep and dreaming about the level to deal with. It is in these situations that we discover that the relationship between the two could be more than just friendship but, unfortunately, a couple of scarce hours of play are enough to reach the sad epilogue without the story ever being able to truly involve us. It is really reduced to the minimum terms, even in its touching sadness. So if you are not a big fan of replayability in the pursuit of gradually higher scores, Lost in Harmony will have told you everything in no time. Artistically impeccable If technically the title is practically unjudgeable, since it is basically a runner without great graphic quirks, artistically Lost in Harmony is undoubtedly a wonderful title. Yoan Fanise was clearly inspired by the works of Hayao Miyazaki and even by the first ideas of Akira Kurosawa starting from the two protagonists, clearly of oriental inspiration. Then there are the levels that have hand-drawn backgrounds and enriched with many details (and quotes from films and TV series) and all the various elements that appear on Kaito's difficult path. Even if the models and textures are often recycled, it is absolutely evident how the final result is extremely fascinating with the various scenarios that evolve during the adventure to respect the tone changes of the music and above all to be coherent with the umgold and the contents of the protagonist's dreams. And we deliberately left the soundtrack for last, which makes use of a couple of really successful unreleased orchestral themes, an original song composed and sung by Wycleaf Jean himself and a substantial collection of classical music tracks, all very well known and often revisited electronically. In short, the musical accompaniment is of the highest level and it will be truly a pleasure to face Lost in Harmony armed with a good headset and the desire to immerse yourself in a very inspired and absolutely peculiar artistic and sound sector. We limit ourselves to pointing out that the title also includes an integrated editor to create your own paths which can then be shared with the community and downloaded freely. The system is quite cumbersome to be honest and it will take a lot of practice before you can make fun creations but it is interesting to note that the system relies on Apple Music and Soundcloud to allow the use of any music track, even protected from licensing, as matches are streamed to protect the value of the song. There are also a handful of in-app purchases to get your hands on clothing and accessories with which to equip Kaito and Aya even if most of these are unlockable simply by playing and it is, in any case, pure aesthetic customization.", "date": "2016-01-21", "grade": "7.5"}
