At the beginning it was, simply, the new work of Ninja Theory, those Cambridge guys who with Heavenly Sword had aroused a lot of interest with a title with an excellent graphic design, but plagued by too much brevity, to maintain the very high expectations that had create around. This time the opposite happened a bit, with a game that through a series of tests was able to make its way into the imagination of journalists and players, always kissed by an artistic care and an attention to style which, it seems, distinguishes every Ninja Theory production. Enslaved: Odyssey to the West, right from the premises, is an ambitious project given that it is the action transposition of that same story, Journey to the West by Wu Cheng'en, from which a thousand variations have been drawn, not least Akira's Dragon Ball Toryiama. Only this time the novella is bent to the inspiration of plausible human characters, full of emotions, who move in a future devastated by the aftermath of a nuclear war, in which a menacing coven of slavers sifts through what remains of the surviving men to kidnap them and subjugate them to a mysterious will. Monkey and Trip Enslaved: Odyssey to the West opens with the two protagonists trapped aboard one of the slavers' ships, at least until Trip, a heroine with the ability to manipulate even the most complicated technologies, causes an energy overload that frees even Monkey, the active protagonist warrior of the game. After a daring escape, both end up in a New York covered by a virgin forest and completely deserted, if not for the deadly robots scattered everywhere, which have long since turned against their creators, killing them on sight. The whole adventure is based on the dichotomy between the two heroes, with Trip who is too weak to be able to survive the journey that separates her from reaching her father's village, from which she was kidnapped, and who therefore manipulates one of the bands whose slavers are used to subjugate humans to ensure that Monkey is inextricably linked to them. If Trip dies, Monkey dies. Behind the promise to free him once he reaches his destination, a journey begins that passes through beautiful settings, emotionally touching moments, even funny ones, and the meeting of bizarre characters. For those who remember, in fact, in the short story, in addition to the little monkey and the Buddhist monk (who here is the beautiful Trip) there was also a pig, who here becomes the sniper Pigsie, whose figure soon resolves itself into the ironic counterpart of the trio, lightening otherwise too dramatic atmospheres. Without wanting to tell more about one of the most successful aspects of Enslaved: Odyssey to the West, or the care with which the relationships between its characters are built. The player directly controls Monkey, who is entrusted with all the fights and interactions with the seabed, in which a series of red spheres are scattered which are used to accumulate the credits necessary to develop its skills, divided between the power of the shield, the effectiveness of the energy stick, which also fires shock and plasma shots, the unlocking of a series of increasingly powerful moves and the increase in vital energy. Trip follows him closely through the levels, asking to be helped only when it comes to reaching higher parts or crossing chasms that are too deep, literally getting thrown to overcome them. It can also be picked up at any time and not only when the conformation of the maps requires it, so that a real bond is soon created between the player and our heroes. Pressing L1 activates a sub-menu with which to give simple orders to Trip, who can draw the attention of enemies to himself, allowing Monkey to advance unnoticed by robots, and activate levers and gears on his behalf necessary to solve the environmental puzzles that constitute one of the elements around which the whole gameplay revolves. Curiosity Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is full of references to steampunk, a literary genre that developed mainly in the 80s born around the idea of an alternative future in which contraptions of the Victorian era, steam powered, evolved towards imaginative innovations, often in a world devastated by cataclysms, starting from the antecedent technological visions of writers such as Julius Verne. One of the authors we recommend, to anyone who falls in love with this atmosphere, is Tim Powers, a leading exponent of the movement who even influenced the Final Fantasy saga, with two novels: The Doors of Anubis, a true masterpiece of the genreand, and Invitation to the Palace of the Deviant. They are difficult to find, but above all the second seems like a literary version of the game, due to the setting and the air you breathe. Fighting, platforming and puzzles Battles with robots are one of the pivotal moments of Enslaved: Odyssey to the West. Monkey has at his disposal a series of bare-handed strikes and combos that he performs by interspersing the use of the energy stick which, when it lights up, can release a devastating rotated move. The robots are able to parry, and with the stick, holding down the square for the necessary time, a stunning blow is charged which opens the guard allowing one punch to be inserted after the other. By leveling up, you unlock a dodge, a counterattack and the possibility of using the stick as a real sniper rifle, capable of firing plasma piercing shots and stun bullets, given that the simple fighting game alternates with sections in which it is essential to clean up the seabed while staying at a safe distance from enemies. The artificial intelligence of the robots is unfortunately low, given that they are limited almost exclusively to coming under and being beaten up. In short, to be a beat'em up for most of the time, Enslaved: Odyssey to the West does not offer a great challenge and at the end of the adventure the deaths during the clashes can be counted on the fingertips of one hand... by Pigsie, who, like a good pig, has only three fingers. The speech with the bosses at the end of the level is different, each to be faced with a specific tactic and which require a careful study of the seabed and its elements. Which, however, can be done after a few attempts. On this structure, spectacular and choreographed driving sections are implanted aboard Monkey's energy cloud, a sort of overboard, and long platform sequences. Here too, as during battles when the camera highlights the end of a combo with bullet time, the work done on the shots is almost always masterful, given that Monkey's evolutions between poles, overhangs and ever more giant structures often leave a good feeling of wonder. To favor this continuous flow of jumps and somersaults, the team has chosen to make the elements of the backdrop to cling to evident with a flash, so much so that just press the cross and the analog in the direction of one of these to see Monkey jump without possibility of error. In short, except for a couple of cases in which there is a time limit to overcome the various sections, you cannot die by failing a handhold or jumping in the wrong direction. This leads the player, in the long run, to concentrate solely on the spectacular action, while continuously pressing the jump button, absentmindedly directing Monkey towards the point on the stage where he is likely to move. Except for the times when you have to coordinate with Trip to operate the levers with which to solve the environmental puzzles that mark the continuation of the adventure. Despite this low difficulty, it certainly cannot be said that Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is a game short, given that there are 14 levels and that it takes about ten hours to finish it normally. What matters, then, is the quality of this time. Bearing in mind the variety of settings and the continuous changes of pace and situations that Ninja Theory offers, those who play will hardly feel the need to abandon the adventure without having finished it. After that remains the highest level of difficulty, the complete upgrade of Monkey and the collection of a series of hidden items, which we prefer not to talk about so as not to spoil the ending in anything. Playstation 3 trophies It's not bad in terms of collecting trophies either, since at the end of the game we found ourselves with more than 40% of the cups collected, trying to collect as many energy spheres as possible and trying to complete all the challenges based on combat, such as killing a certain number of enemies with one move rather than another. Platinum is a more complex matter, since all the spheres and all the hidden objects must be collected, not to mention having to finish the game even on difficult. Characters with author Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is a great game to see, there is little to say. The engine that moves the animations of the characters and their facial expressions is now a trademark of Ninja Theory and, despite having transported the tools that underlie it within the Unreal Engine 3, the transition took place without any trauma . Colorful, with varied landscapes and full of details, even with the now well-known limitations that we have learned about the Epic engine in terms of interaction with the seabed, there are not a few moments in which the player is left toenjoy every glimpse and shot. Above all on PlayStation 3, however, there are fluidity problems, even during the interlude scenes in which the shot widens for panoramic shots where the lack of Vsync (the vertical synchrony which, when it is not there, interrupts half the views ed.). Things are better on Xbox 360, but it spoils a bit the work done by the team, which has otherwise managed to infuse real lifeblood into a series of characters that one cannot help but be attached to. This is also thanks to the great effort made in the characterization and in the dialogues, well dubbed in Italian, and which, together with the sound commentary, complete a really good package from all points of view.", "date": "2010-10-06", "grade": "8.4"}
