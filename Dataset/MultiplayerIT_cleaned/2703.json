The game developed by Payload allows you to build robots and racing vehicles and launch them in various types of challenges, in a sort of mix between Banjo-Kazooie: Screws and Bolts and precisely the good old Robot Wars. To tell the truth, this is not a truly original solution: beyond the concept that we can trace back to the famous television broadcasts of the 90s between the USA and the United Kingdom, the idea of building combat robots to be used later inside of various multiplayer challenges has already taken shape in other similar titles, especially embodied in Robocraft on PC. However, Astracraft manages to offer more or less the same complexity of the latter in a mobile context and it is no small feat, putting in the hands of players both a large and complex editor and a large number of game modes in which to use creations in a more or less destructive way. The basic concept implies a series of variables that can be very difficult to translate on the screen: the construction phase leaves considerable freedom to the players in the creation of robots and vehicles, which can make it difficult to insert them in a structured play context . Also for this reason, the gameplay of Astracraft is perhaps not its strong point, staging challenges that turn out to be a bit rigid and cumbersome (after all, given the protagonists, it could not be otherwise) but it has the great value on its side to give life to users' creations in a rather convincing way, supported moreover by a truly effective technical realization, at times impressive, with a remarkable solidity of the polygonal graphics and of the effects applied even on not very recent machines. All in all, it's not easy to get a lot of fun between somewhat confusing fights and not exactly pleasant races, even in terms of the control system, but the beauty of this game lies above all in the creative phase and in the wonder that is felt when a thoughtful construction , elaborated and carefully built with the editor is taking its first steps within the maps. Creativity in power The two pillars of Astracraft emerge clearly in the initial screen of the game, which allows you to choose between ~creation~ and ~versus~, or the two sectors in which to engage, closely connected with each other. The element of greatest interest is certainly the first, being then the characterizing one for the entire experience: the possibility of building robots and vehicles is already directed towards pre-set methods, but still allows a certain freedom of action. In the Create section we can build war robots that can be tested immediately by launching them in combat arenas, dedicate ourselves to the creation of complex machines to be tested more calmly in single player, develop racing vehicles by making them run on a track (this too can be built freely) or focus on buildings designed specifically for the various multiplayer modes of the party mode. In any case, we are faced with a complex and well-structured editor, which allows you to assemble pieces of various sizes starting from a main core. The construction can be completely free or set starting from a ready-made basic model, in any case the possibilities are really many, as long as the pieces fit together and the vehicle built obviously has a sense, i.e. that it is able to move, attack or defend yourself. Beyond the free mode, the design depends on the game mode in which we want to try our hand but even within these selections different perspectives open up: for example, by taking part in battles in the arena we can tend towards different characteristics and specializations for the robot, making it more or less fast or armored, armed to strike from a distance or with impact weapons. Being distributed as free-to-play, monetization obviously falls within the dynamics of collecting the pieces to be used for construction: with the in-game currency it is possible to buy new elements for construction, some of which can make a significant difference in competitive play. The risk of pay-to-win is real, even if Astracraft manages to provide a large amount of rewards by participating in the various game modes or simply logging in periodically, so it is difficult to speak of an actual need to enter the paywall. Given the variety of events available, it is difficult to evaluate the balance and use of micro-transactions at the moment, but it can be said that it is possible to accessre to a large amount of content even without resorting to in-app purchases, at least from the point of view of creative possibilities. The weakest element of Astracraft is the actual gameplay, even if the large amount of events in which it is possible to participate mitigates the gaps, making it still interesting to switch from one game experience to another. The first stumbling block is represented by the control system: the virtual pad or the arrows on the screen, in a game that can have frenetic rhythms, are not exactly comfortable and pleasant, but there are some obvious inconsistencies that emerge from the use of a common setting for too different game structures such as arena shooters and racing games, for example.", "date": "2021-01-22", "grade": "7.4"}
