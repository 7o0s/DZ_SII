{"name": "Everhood", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/everhood-recensione.html", "text": "The first impact with Everhood is difficult to describe, as probably no trip would be able to get us close to the experience developed by Chris Nordgren and Jordi Roca. This unusual musical RPG reaches peaks of absurd psychedelic effects, which we would not have imagined despite the initial warning before starting the game: a journey of about ten hours we found ourselves following a story of which, right from the start, we knew not we would have understood nothing, accompanied by a gameplay that is the real backbone of the game but it is not enough to prevent the game from a slow downward spiral made up of useless frustrations, repetitiveness and the familiar trick of ~wait, now comes the fun part!~ as for the narrative going on longer than it should have. So let's find out the strengths and weaknesses in our review of Everhood on Nintendo Switch. A surreal experience It doesn't take long to smell that Everhood is ready to play the story card with a twisted logical thread, even too much: just a few minutes and a simple introduction but, for this very reason, able to make us raise our antennas. The premises are that after accepting to lose humanity to embrace immortality we wake up in the body of a doll dressed in red (Red, for friends) only to discover that an arm has been stolen from us. The goal will therefore be to go and get it back and so far everything is in order, despite a setting and above all the undeniably bizarre characters: it takes very little to realize how an innocent premise can be transformed into a maze of information and pieces of plot which it becomes difficult to make sense of, however any word about it would make us fall into the spoiler trap. Just know that your main goal is to get your stolen arm back. In a world along the lines of Undertale in terms of aesthetics, characterized by a strong use of black but in which there is no lack of more ~complete~ and colorful settings, we will move far and wide to obtain the object of our research : we'll talk to trash cans, cold vampires, knights in their underwear, goldfish and so on and so forth, but the moment in which Everhood shines the most - not only in terms of color - are the battles. By opting for an initial non-violent approach, Red's only chance of emerging unscathed from these clashes is to dodge incoming blows from the perspective of a single combat system. Conceptually it recalls Guitar Hero, indeed we do not exclude it may be a tribute since the clash always takes place on a terrain modulated like a guitar fretboard: here, face to face with our enemy, we will have to avoid his assaults to the rhythm of the music. The notes come in different forms but, reduced to the bone, they are of two types: those that we can skip and those that we will have to avoid by moving sideways. However, it is pleasant to see that efforts have been made on a graphic level to vary them according to the opponent to be faced. It's not exactly a golden rule, many have the same aesthetic, however some of them will vary on the theme even catching us off guard. Everhood: One of the first fights in the game In terms of difficulty, Everhood features several including a Story Mode for those who want to relax and enjoy (or try) the story. However, the game was designed to be played in Hard and so we lived it from start to finish, regretting the choice on several occasions: it is possible to change modes at any time but at a certain point it becomes a matter of personal pride and we stayed true to ourselves to the last. The substantial difference between the different difficulties is the number of hits you can suffer before dying and the time frame within which lives are regenerated if we do not take damage. Put like this it seems affordable, but trust me that it is not as simple as one imagines it, thanks to the need to adapt our hand-eye coordination efficiently from time to time: the variety of clashes is in fact sufficient to keep us on our toes and, often, it takes advantage of the psychedelic element inherent in the game to put us in difficulty by trying (sometimes succeeding) to distract us with effects on the screen in front of which one would only want to turn off the console. A trick that the game sometimes abuses but which, all in all, we can forgive him; or rather, we could if there weren't a weighty issue we'll talk about in a moment. Everhood: there is also room for role-playing sessions We can divide Everhood into two parts plus final act. The first is that, despite a story without rhyme or reason, more compelling because we are always thework hard to learn how to survive. In the second half we will gain the ability to deflect attacks and this is where the slow downward spiral of the game begins - bear in mind that while this is an RPG, everything related to the genre is absent, from power-ups, levels, experience, even 'equipment itself. Having said that, once we become more aggressive and therefore have the possibility of inflicting damage on the opponents we will have to retrace the game, retracing our steps and facing again the same characters plus different additions that make the experience less heavy but fail to save it from repetitiveness, above all because at that point (with rare exceptions) we will have seen practically every expressive possibility of the game. The final act is instead a useless dragging oneself into a narrative that continues to leverage excessive hermeticism and exploit the already mentioned ~wait, now comes the fun part!~ to never get anywhere, presenting a series of battles that reaches unwarranted peaks of difficulty and wears down what little patience is left at that point. Everhood: the psychedelic effects are starting to get heavy Everhood is certainly not the first game to reveal its hand right at the end, after going around the issue for the rest of the game, but where others have managed to make amends for this stalling, here it is difficult to give him the benefit of the doubt: of course , the impact of the narrative varies according to the perspective of who is playing, yet the feeling remains that we wanted to play too much with the said and the unsaid. The scarce, if not total absence, of empathy towards the characters plays a crucial role in all of this and is due to their limited development: with the exception of the protagonist, whose cryptic nature makes sense for the story, the others would have deserved better treatment just for how we will relate to them during the second part. So instead it is like dealing with empty dolls, towards which it is really difficult to feel anything other than, possibly, frustration when they make us sweat the hell out of being defeated. In the end, the elements that keep Everhood standing are the combat system and music: we've already talked enough about the first, it's very good without evolving too much, while from a musical point of view there's nothing to complain about. All the tracks can be listened to, or tackled if you prefer, very willingly and while relying heavily on electronics, it also ranges along other genres that manage to offer the right variety. The only general flaw is that trick whereby the greatest difficulty often derives from an excessive use of psychedelic effects. In addition, we cannot leave aside the presence of some mini-games that try to vary the experience: nothing exceptional but overall it looks like a pleasant interlude to obtain the objects thanks to which we can continue our mission. Some technical difficulties Everhood: a kart challenge is always good for us We anticipated it in the previous paragraphs and now we can talk about it: the aspect that most sinks Everhood are the loading times. On average they are between ten and fifteen seconds but in some cases they can extend up to almost thirty; a significant problem when you consider that the game charges for everything from passing through doors, to screen changes up to all the times we retry a battle after being defeated. Considering both that during the adventure there is still a certain amount of exploration and backtracking, and above all that it is sometimes very easy to be defeated (it can happen even in the very first seconds of the battle), everything becomes incredibly frustrating in the long run. If then, from the point of view of the fights, we add the fact of always having to see the introduction of the enemy we are around an average of twenty-five seconds for each repeated fight. We were surprised at how long it takes for a 2D game and in some cases even wondered if the game had crashed or was still loading as there is no on-screen element to indicate this. Everhood: could the mad scientist have been missing? One last flaw to catch our eye concerns the frequent spelling and grammar errors, nothing that could not have been easily detected. Towards the end, when Everhood becomes more descriptive and narrative, they stand out more and could annoy those starting from a good knowledge of English.", "date": "2021-03-05", "grade": "7.0"}
