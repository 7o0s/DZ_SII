{"name": "Soul of Darkness", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/soul-of-darkness_a.html", "text": "On the screen of our mobile phones, for quite some time now, an exciting battle has been fought: the one to determine the best action game around. Java-compatible devices, especially after the latest technological steps, have shown a natural predisposition towards titles with platform and action elements, children of the first Castlevania; and precisely the themes dear to the most classic of the Konami series have provided the inspiration for the birth of reference products such as Shadowalker, the same conversion of Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow (both branded Glu) and the recent response packaged by Gameloft, which brings the name of Soul of Darkness. It is clear that the developers of such an attentive and prolific house could not come up with a challenger without first being convinced of its potential, and from this point of view the new Gameloft title even overturns the beliefs that have always accompanied mobile gaming: seen as a ~poor~ form of entertainment, devoid of particular depth, synonymous with limited commitment on the part of the developers. Well, things have changed. The game features only one mode, in which we'll guide Kale through eleven full-bodied and quite challenging stages. The structure is typical of the various Castlevanias, with the protagonist having to jump on a large number of platforms before finding the exit of the level, taking advantage of each interactive element of the scenario to reach otherwise inaccessible areas, which hide treasures or bonuses of various guy. In all this there will be opponents, indeed we will find ourselves facing a very high number of enemies, almost always different, each with specific characteristics in terms of speed, resistance to blows and modus operandi: zombies, bats, werewolves, fish, water elementals, flying demons as well as the very vampires of the brotherhood that claimed the beautiful Lydia. To fight them we will have a flaming sword and, later, an ice spear. Two diametrically opposed weapons, which have different effects depending on the situation but which can be upgraded in the same way: by pressing the right function key, we will enter a screen where it will be possible to ~spend~ the purple crystals collected to improve the strength of the blows, the effectiveness of the combos, the frequency of critical attacks and the power of the magic. The latter works like the most classic of special attacks, and changes depending on the weapon: in the case of the flaming sword, it is a fiery barrier that surrounds Kale inflicting heavy damage on its surroundings; in the case of the ice spear, we'll see the character throw the weapon like a javelin. The spells prove to be useful during the fights, of course, but they contribute even more to the exploration of the stages, allowing us to destroy doors and barriers that are in difficult positions, or to create an improvised platform on which to jump to reach a very difficult area. high. These are not the only elements that enrich the gameplay of Soul of Darkness with variety, however: at a certain point in the adventure, in fact, we will discover that Kale can use magical gems to transform himself into some of his enemies, for example into an elemental water or in a fish: in the first case, he will be able to walk on the water level and use the ~natural elevators~ created by the waves, useful for climbing platforms that are difficult to reach; in the form of a fish, on the other hand, he will be able to cross narrow water channels that separate him from the final areas of a stage. A product so valid from a playful point of view could not disappoint from a technical point of view, and in fact Soul of Darkness offers us an audiovisual sector of absolute excellence, starting right from the sound: finally a mix of music and effects that work together without generating slowdowns or problems of any kind, even with the presence of classical music pieces to create the right atmosphere while we repeatedly scythe monsters with our flaming sword. Only the independent volume adjustment is missing, but it is an absolutely forgivable defect in this case. As for the graphics, the Gameloft developers have achieved spectacular results: the character design is excellent, there is a huge variety of enemies and all the sprites boast excellent animation. There is not the fluidity seen in Shadowalker, but the quality of the scenarios decrees the clear superiority of SOD: each stage is characterized very well, the backgrounds boast a level of detail probably never seen in a mobile game and an excellent parallax scrolling which adds depth to the whole. Compared to the Glu branded product, the level design is absolutely superior and the landscapes boast an extraordinary variety.
