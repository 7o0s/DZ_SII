{"name": "Gothic 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gothic-3.html", "text": "Discovered worlds The game system is mostly similar to that of its predecessor, greatly appreciated especially among lovers of the genre. For those who already know the first episode there isn't much to add, but if you haven't tried the first Gothic, the system requires some time to be fully mastered: some choices deviate from common use, and above all the beginning can be a little uncomfortable. However, nothing dramatic: after a few hours of playing the system becomes familiar, and we realize its positive sides: first of all the possibility of mastering the numerous options in a simple and as immediate way as possible: from inventory management to character sheet, location map (when available). A very interesting feature is the quest summary system: in a single screen the entire story of the character is practically summarized, the completed sub-adventures, the pending ones and the failed ones, and for each of them it is possible to view the description and the details. Monsters, enemies and adventurers. Talking about the graphic aspect related to RPGs is always thorny. Because if on the one hand the concept of graphic beauty is linked to visual but relatively short masterpieces, it must be said that the very setting of the role-playing game requires entire worlds, infinite game situations, hundreds of enemies, spells and magical weapons. Which objectively, due to calculation, memory and media capacity limits, cannot be rendered with the same fidelity as a closed level, for example, or a track. Nonetheless, Gothic II defends itself admirably, with a good graphic level, which focuses much more on the coherence of the settings than on their definition. The graphics engine, an improved version of the one that moved the first Gothic, is able to display very large portions of the environment without too much difficulty, always maintaining good fluidity. Only with particularly mischievous actions can it be put into crisis, but these are still deliberate attempts aimed at testing the solidity of the engine, which have little to do with normal game situations. Considering the size of the game, which resides on three CDs, the vastness of the worlds and situations, one cannot however speak well of the graphic aspect. The way of adventure Gothic II is a game of multiple situations. What is striking is the vastness, not so much of the setting, but of the opportunities offered. The quests are expertly intertwined by them, and escape the most classic schemes: we will not find an overly linear adventure or the classic nested management (in which each main quest contains secondary ones), but a real complex narrative, which will leave us considerable freedom of action, not to mention that pure and simple exploration, even outside the adventure in the broadest sense, can bring further implications, the discovery of new backgrounds and much more. If Gothic II were to be defined with just one word, it would be ~immense~. To reinforce the already considerable involvement, a remarkable and always adequate sound sector comes in handy. The soundtrack is one that can be heard but not listened to, as indeed it must be in a game where concentration is assumed to be high and continuous, while the ambient effects reach truly remarkable peaks of realism. Furthermore, all the characters have spoken dialogues available, although obviously many of them are interpreted by the same voice, a more than understandable choice if you consider that there are about 400 non-player characters in the game. People and characters. Managing our character involves the multiple work deriving from the simplest real-time parts, such as movements, attacks, dialogues, inventory management, spells and personal progression. At each level acquired, you will have points available to spend on various characteristics, new skills and of course an automatic increase in life points and mana. The menu management is interesting, divided between a contextual part and a part external to the game. For example, if in the middle of a fight you decide to change one of the game settings or check the quests, the game will automatically pause; otherwise, the attempt to use the inventory has serious possibilities of bringing our hero to a premature end: after all who has ever seen an avadventurer rummaging through his backpack in the midst of battle? A good choice, which adds considerable realism to the context. Forces, perhaps Gothic II is a truly remarkable RPG, above all for its considerable extension and for the depth of the plot, full of ramifications and intertwining. Its biggest flaws are mostly due to the genre's inherent limitations, as well as a handful of contestable choices. One of the first is the lack of references to the first episode, if not indirect, which leave those who have not played Gothic slightly confused, or in any case with a sense of incompleteness. Another difficult aspect is the character control system, especially during the combat phases, which is not so immediate and requires practice. The last flaw derives, paradoxically, from a strength: it sometimes happens that, precisely to offer as many situations as possible, the game becomes confusing, due to the large amount of missions and sub-missions proposed. Conclusions In the field of RPG Gothic II is undoubtedly a game that deserves a lot of attention, for its historicity, for its extension and for the depth it is able to offer: three classes of controllable characters, over 400 non-playing characters, 50 spells and 150 weapons constitute a challenge that simply cannot be ignored. For those who are not particularly passionate about the Gothic 2 genre, it is still a very interesting game, once the first difficulties have been overcome. The only real pity is the lack of Italian localization, which makes the game unattractive for those who do not know the English language. Activating the subtitles, also in English, can help but is certainly not decisive. For all RPG lovers and for those who still love high-level games and great extension Pros: Depth of settings and enormity of the setting Variety of weapons, spells and situations Engaging narrative Cons: Not immediate control system Some forcedly repetitive dialogues No localization, not even partial Little time and many doubts With an introduction whose tones are not far from those of ours, Gothic 2 kicks off, a new work by Piranha Bytes, deriving from a first episode that was a far from announced success. We are in the shoes of an unnamed hero who, four weeks after his first adventure, finds himself once again confronted with the threats looming over his world. Unfortunately, the power and abilities acquired in the first episode have been lost and the player will find himself guiding his protg practically from scratch. After a long introductory dialogue our hero will finally come under our complete control, and from this moment on everything, or almost everything, will be under our dominion.", "date": "2003-06-12", "grade": null}
