{"name": "Pro Rally 2002", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pro-rally-2002_a.html", "text": "World champions!!! After the introductory film which shows us both that rallying is a spectacular and fun sport, with a lot of work behind it, and that today plastic surgery is capable of working miracles, we will find ourselves in front of the main screen which, to tell the truth, it is made very well. The first thing that immediately catches the eye is the large amount of game modes and options available to us. As for the actual game, we will be able to try our hand at the ~professional~ mode (which is the main one), the ~time trials~, the ~cup~ and the ~arcade~ mode; and to make the game even more complete there are two multiplayer modes (2 players) which are the ~single race~ and the aforementioned ~cup~. The most fulfilling gaming experience in Pro Rally 2002 is the ~professional~ one, which is divided into two parts: the first (~school~) will be used to obtain the licence, necessary to be able to access the actual championship, and which consists in passing some tests, which will be judged with a mark and the higher the average of the various scores, the higher the certainty of taking part in the official races. After passing the driving school, the championship finally begins, with a team that will sign you for the rest of the season, with your great chance to show off. The championship is divided into rallies (the technical term is this, but we can more familiarly define them as Formula 1-style ~grand prixes~) which are in turn divided into 3 special stages (or stages); whoever has the shortest time at the end of all the stages will win the rally with 10 points (the second one gets 6, the third 4 and so on)! The championship is the mode that will keep you busy for the longest time, since when the season ends, your career will continue (for the better if you get a good placement, for the worse if you don't get the required objectives). Now let's move on to the arcade mode, which impressed me both positively and negatively at the same time. Positive because it turned out to be hilarious right from the start and negative both because it can be completed easily in 3 hours (18 races in total) and for the fact that after overtaking all your opponents, unless you make a huge mistake , the race will be yours without any particular problems. misfire! That's not all... The cup is divided into four competitions each consisting of three qualifying sessions and in order to go on until the end, you will always have to finish first... that's it. As in the case of the arcade, this mode will also end in a very short time, a sign that Ubi have worked hard only on the championship, leaving out these secondary modes, which could still have made the game more complete and longer lasting (even if the championship, I repeat, it will take you a long time). The multiplayer, which is usually the extra weapon that games unleash, made me neither hot nor cold and even if it hadn't been there, its absence would not have been felt that much! Controls and Difficulties Pro Rally 2002 is a pleasant surprise in terms of its immediacy. The control system is simple and in any case extremely functional: R will be used to accelerate, L to brake (or to reverse), X to upshift, B instead to downshift, Y to change camera, A for the handbrake, Z for repositioning the car, control stick for steering and C-Stick for seeing what's happening behind us. As far as difficulty is concerned, we can say that Pro Rally 2002 is a game suitable for everyone, both for beginners in the genre and for experts, even if for the latter the game could be a little too easy, due to its structure of very simplistic game Technically The graphic realization of Pro Rally 2002 is overall discreet. The cars are made up of almost 3000 polygons and although they may seem few, they still make a good impression; the reflections on the bodywork of the machines are absolutely not convincing, giving the impression of having been made in a hurry. On the landscape front we always find ourselves faced with beautiful and less beautiful things: the elements in the foreground enjoy a more than satisfactory realization, but the backdrops and trees are censored, taking into account the hardware made available by the Cube. On the other hand, the frame rate makes a good impression, which has never shown signs of slowing down (everything moves at 50 fps), even if it happened to me on two occasions out of about eighty hours of play, to find a couple of situations in which the graphics engine suddenly went into crisis. An ear tug at Ubi for the physics of the clashes in the game, which give the idea of a game set up more like an arcade than a simulation. Still on the subject of clashes, I cursed a lot when the car crashed into a bush or a simple road sign, for the simple fact that these could not be knocked down, contrary to what happens in other racing games. Finally, a note of merit for the sound, both for the noises and for the soundtrack, with some music that reminded me of the fantastic songs from Need for Speed! Conclusions Born without any pretensions, Pro Rally 2002 has turned out to be a game with many positive and equally negative aspects. On the one hand fun, immediacy, playability and great ability to glue the player in front of the TV make it a recommended purchase, but on the other we find a discreet technical realization, but with several flaws, and a longevity that leaves something to be desired, which make Pro Rally 2002 certainly not an irresistible title. My advice is as follows: if you are a fanatic of the genre and can't wait any longer, buy it, otherwise invest your dindini on Colin McRae rally 3, now close to being released. Pros: Funny Immediate Good playability Acceptable technical realization Suitable for newbies of the genre It is the only one of its kind on GameCube, but Cons: Colin McRae Rally 3 is closer than you think! Too simple Low longevity Avoid for genre experts Enhanceable background graphics Indestructible bushes, road signs, and trees Rallying or not rallying? At the time of writing this review, the 2002 rally championship already has a champion: Marcus Gronholm in a Peugeot, with victory in the New Zealand rally, became world champion with 2 races to go. What does this matter, you may be wondering... Well, contrary to what has been happening in Formula 1 for some years now, with only one team and only one driver to win (Ferrari rulez) and to leave the crumbs to the opponents, the rallying is a sport (although I like to define it more as an ~automotive discipline~) where the driver's skill merges with competition and entertainment and this means that it is not always the same person who wins, making the championship adrenaline, exciting and with nothing for granted! Over the years, the rally is gaining more and more general attention, capturing a number of fans that is increasing visibly... and could the world of video games remain indifferent to this ~phenomenon~? Of course not and here PC (especially) and console (a little less) have been invaded by more or less valid rally simulations. If I say ~rally~, the first name that comes to mind is definitely Colin McRae Rally from Codemasters, the series that perhaps, more than the others, embodies the spirit of this discipline, and that everyone uses as a yardstick with other games . UbiSoft also launched into this genre, with that Pro Rally 2001 which managed to win the esteem of all gamers and, starting from these bases, the French softco offers us the sequel to that game. Let's see together if the Cubic version is worth the purchase or not.", "date": "2002-11-08", "grade": null}
