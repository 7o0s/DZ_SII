Which is true: since there is no oxygen, sound is not transmitted or at least not at a frequency audible to the human ear. But what would space shooters be like without the traditional battle noises, gunfire, explosions (also, in fact, impossible in space) and all the ambaradan that fans of the genre are so well used to? Here, let's avoid asking ourselves and rather let's take a look at what stands as the closest experience to Super Stardust HD available on iOS (as well as on PC and Mac): Darkside. Developed by Clockwork Pixels, the game looks like an ~inertial~ twin analog shooter terribly, terribly, terribly (yes, three times) similar to the famous Housemarque shooter, recently translated into a portable field thanks to the Delta version for PlayStation Vita ( which we reviewed recently and which we liked a lot). The two titles share the same gameplay: two analog sticks (in this case virtual) control the movement of our ship and the direction of the fire, within ~orbital~ scenarios infested by meteorites that gravitate dangerously and by hostile vehicles that will not lose the opportunity to fire on us with their cannons. Our goal, depending on the mode, will be to crumble all the rocks until they are reduced to dust, resist for as long as possible while the threats around us multiply and always try to avoid the impact with the many objects that invade our airspace. Space dust Darkside can be downloaded from the App Store for free, but to unlock all the game's features you need to make a 79 cent in-app purchase. The start screen allows us to access three different modes: Missions, or a story mode made up of the beauty of a hundred levels that become more and more complex and characterized by variable purposes; Arcade, where you are given three lives and play stages in sequence to set new duration records; Survival, with only one life and the task of surviving as long as possible. As already mentioned, in terms of playability and structure, the similarities with Super Stardust HD are many, so much so that we can safely define the Clockwork Pixels production as a clone. However, there are also differences, for example a management of upgrades which in the PlayStation Network game is of the traditional type and which here instead takes on dynamic connotations, with weapons that deteriorate over time and therefore require careful use of their potential before returning to the default focus. In terms of defects, unfortunately some technical ingenuities can be noted: firstly, the choice of the logo and the fonts used is very bad and clashes with the rest of the graphics sector, which instead excels in fluidity, detail and design; secondly, the ~readability~ of the asteroid fragments leaves something to be desired, in the sense that they do not stand out well from the background and therefore it happens several times to suddenly impact them, losing precious energy. The touch controls are excellent but not always precise to the millimeter, a factor that tends to increase the average difficulty, while finally the sound is functional to the action and does not stand out in a particular way.", "date": "2012-08-02", "grade": "8.3"}
