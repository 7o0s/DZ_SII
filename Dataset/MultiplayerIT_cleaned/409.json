{"name": "Tamagotchi Connexion Corner Shop", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tamagotchi-connexion-corner-shop.html", "text": "Tamagotchy, tama, tama-go-tchi ... that this title that at first glance seems designed exclusively for the little ones could actually have something to offer even to the ~older kids~. The word Tamagotchi immediately brings to mind that funny plastic egg owned years ago by millions of people of all ages and genders. For the few who don't know what we're talking about, it's a simulation of a ~puppy~ to take care of and grow by dealing with both the pleasant and the... boring aspects! The natural evolution of that intriguing idea could be the much-vaunted Nintendogs and a title along the lines of the dogs would be the easiest thing to associate with this Bandai production, but this is not. Tamagotchi Connexion Corner Shop is nothing more than a collection of mini-games inspired by the world of its protagonists. The road taken is therefore much more limited, and cheaper, than the real potential of the brand that inspires us. The funny little animals that populate the last generation eggs reappear, but instead of taking care of them we have to help them manage eleven different types of shops. Each business represents a different game to be played exclusively with the strokes of the stylus and obviously they are not all available from the start. Continuing to successfully execute the requests of the various customers in fact allows us to raise our business from the ground floor to the fourth floor and this leads to the automatic unlocking of other mini-games. These are imbued with ~Japaneseness~ and as they increase in size they evolve more or less markedly in complexity and madness. We can find ourselves satisfying the strangest requests: from cooking Takoyaki strange stuffed balls- to decorating our customers' teeth in the most absurd way. Everything happens in a hyper-colored context, with silly dialogues and absolutely visionary and crazy characters. Gothchi, gotchi, ta-ma, ta-ma, gotchi! Everything seems to have been designed for the little ones - referring to the beginning of the article - with a cartoonish and minimalist but decidedly pleasant design. Games also take up this limit: if the dentist vaguely recalls a Trauma Center in complexity, the idea of representing caries as a kind of little devil that comes out of the hole that has just been drilled is as brilliant as it is childish; if creating cakes on request is complex and, at times, difficult, it undoubtedly seems that the judging system tries to turn a blind eye to performances that are not quite up to par. Furthermore, some games are clearly designed on repetitive actions and clichs suitable only for the little ones, such as the combination of cure/evil based on color or the frantic repetition of simplistic requests in the spa The beauty is that, in any case, you want for the goodness of use of the touch screen, either for the freshness of some situations and for the careful design, in the short term and for a quick hit and run can entertain and make even those who have a few years more on their back smile. This while keeping in mind the limits of TCCS which are precisely to be found in the extreme repetitiveness of the action and in the simplicity of the games as well as in a decidedly too small number of the latter. Eleven commercial activities are really too few also due to the fact that only some of them evolve with increasing height and if they do this happens in a very little incisive way. To complete it all, the ~care~ section takes care of it where you can dress, feed, buy objects and furnish the house to the Tamagotchi who joins the game. This way you can spend your hard-earned money serving customers, but it doesn't offer many collectibles and even here there are some features and limitations that can only satisfy the little ones. From a technical point of view, a good use of full colors and a very pleasant style stands out, covering 2D graphics with very few animations - the characters just move up and down - and the total absence of any effect in the name of total functionality . What are really irritating instead are the music, repetitive ad nauseum and not too catchy exactly like the little voices, in pure ~Rare~ style, of the various characters. TCCS could easily be the title to give to your little cousin, or better yet little cousin, for his birthday knowing that his parents have just wrapped a DS Lite for him. The idea is to then borrow it for two or three days to feel like a child again and take advantage of what are crazy little games and a pleasant graphic style. Too bad for wanting at all costs to target the product not too covertly at a reduced age group which has led to providing fanciful tests, but with too many limitations. One wonders sometimeswhether what attracts you is the use of the DS Touch Screen itself - an extremely gratifying and pleasant action - or the games on offer. However, a title not to be despised and which denotes a certain care in its realization but to be exploited only in the short term or for quick escapes into the Tamagotchi world. Or, in fact, an excellent gift idea for the little ones, even if, after seeing little girls literally consume dad's DS playing Animal Crossing, I wondered until when games that are too simple and not very complex will continue to be produced for these new generations. Pros Fun and crazy games Very pleasant graphic style Various and nice characters Cons Graphics a bit poor Eleven games are objectively too few Repetitive and limited Eleven ways to have fun: 1-Preparing Takoyachi: grease spread the dough put the ingredients etc. a very repetitive but initially rewarding game 2-Looking after the bathers at the spa: some want red salts, some yellow salts or a drink of the right color. The water rarely needs to be heated. Boring. 3-Taking care of your teeth: drilling and treating a cavity - cute little devil to catch - has never been so simple, not to mention putting in a new tooth! 4-Creating the required jewels: choose the shape of the necklace or brooch and then place the right stones or ~nuts~ on it. Friendly. 5-Creating the cakes they show you: one of the most complex, use cream, colored ice and various decorations to get as close as possible to the customer's dream. 6-Making up customers: copy the make-up they show you by adding the right accessories and coloring their cheeks and lips. Eyelashes and eyebrows finally complete the look. 7-Making up your teeth: yes there are crazy people who want different writing and colors for each tooth they have in their mouth. Out of mind. 8-Creating bouquets: do they ask you for a big bouquet with bow and paper? Here it is. 9-Washing the laundry: put the right detergent in the washing machine and then spin it. Finish by ironing, patching and sewing 10-Playing in time: in the simplest of musical games you entertain the audience with nice little tunes. 11-Creating floral jewels: practically like in jewellery, but using only vegetable products.
