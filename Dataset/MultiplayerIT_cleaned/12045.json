{"name": "Touchmaster - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/touchmaster-recensione.html", "text": "23 timeless classics? And so, here is a collection that could easily be an add-on to the previous 42 Timeless Classics, with titles in this case derived directly from Midway gaming machines. Inside the cartridge there are 23 of the best games offered in these bar hardware, ranging from completely different genres to each other. The developers' task was facilitated by the fact that the games were originally conceived for a machine with ~tactile~ recognition, but the interface remained rather archaic compared to the possibilities offered by the Nintendo DS: almost no ~drag & drop, as well as word processing or any other more complex use of the stylus. Most games simply require you to press certain items on the screen at the right time. The games are divided into card games, Tetris-style puzzle games, or derived from board games like Othello or similar. There is also a Trivia Quiz but it is completely in English, and the questions are all rather focused on American culture, so it is not a great option for Italian players. The title immediately offers a selection of ~favorite~ games, which brings together the best examples: Crystal Balls is a sort of cross between Puzzle Bobble and Columns, with the addition of numbers, Mahkki is a variant of Tetris based on colors, Target 21 a game of cards, in Solitaire style, in which you have to reach 21 on each deck of cards proposed, just to give some examples. In general, they are all card games with a rather well-known structure, games based on dice or variations of famous puzzle games, in short, the kind of games that are usually found side by side with Video Poker or something like that. No particularly ingenious concept, but pastimes with a well-established and functional structure, more successful in some cases, much more dull in many others. The presence of rankings and scores updated online via Wi-Fi Connection is a good incentive to commit to each specialty, as is the possibility of creating online tournaments (but not simple one-on-one matches, unfortunately), while the impossibility of playing is surprising in local multiplayer with a single cartridge, via game sharing. 23 punches in the eyes, or almost The graphic sector of the game is the least well-finished and captivating that can be found at the moment within the offer for Nintendo DS. Clearly, the publisher has directly transferred the original games, or almost so: dull color combinations and absolutely devoid of any artistic choice or attempt to make the aesthetic side of the game captivating are associated with simple representations, bordering on stylized, of the elements on the screen. It looks like a collection of the dullest flash games taken from some second-rate internet site. Certainly the subjects represented do not lend themselves to particular artistic interpretations (cards, Tetris-style blocks, simple writings) but the general look could at least avoid generating sadness on each screen, with this prevalence of black backgrounds and a chromatic choice made without too much criterion . The game is also essential from a paratextual point of view, without any particular introduction to the various games and with very few, essential lines of text to explain what happens and what we are called to do in the various games, delegating practically everything to the experience direct. This may not be a negative, but it increases the general sense of approximation that seems to characterize all the making of the game. Same thing with regard to the sound, even less cared for, but conversely less essential given the type of game. Comment TouchMaster falls into that category of games that are significantly closer to the ~bus stop harp~ than to the video game in the most classic sense of the term. Furthermore, it is also a rather crude product, which bases all its appeal on the immediacy of the simple game action, calculation and hand-eye coordination. There is something, however, in some of the games, that can keep you hooked for a long time, and if you are into puzzles or card games you will find your match, but in essence, it is a version electronics of the ~healthier and cheaper pastime~, on which, however, no attempt has been made to thicken the structure of the games or their appearance. The addition of the Wi-Fi connection is a good plus in the general evaluation, but many of the games present are really too poor in bite and ugly to look at. The expert gamer will hardly find this interestingor title, which could instead be of interest to casual users, who intend to use the console only to fill the short breaks of the daily routine, as long as they don't get caught up in the sadness that transpires from the graphics ... Pros: Quick fun from small doses Some games are interesting Presence of online leaderboards Cons: Generally devoid of bite Very poor technical sector Absence of game sharing with a single cartridge Perhaps not many gamers have been familiar with the games offered in this Midway collection for Nintendo DS. In fact, these are titles derived from those machines that find space inside bars, or pubs, or recreational clubs, often associated with Video Poker or other forms of entertainment which, despite sharing several characteristics with arcades, have in fact, it has little to do with the glorious arcade machines, properly categorized under the video game category. On the other hand, the Nintendo DS has proven to be much more than a simple console in the classic sense of the term, giving way to expand its market to a whole other range of users who see the Nintendo dual screen as ~the machine for to exercise the brain, and from there to the whole series of internal productions, similar or simply copied from Touch! Generations. On the one hand, this premise must be taken into account when speaking of Touchmaster, on the other hand Midway's relatively unfamiliarity with the Nintendo DS must be considered, which, unlike many other publishers, has not yet launched completely on the new steamroller (from the point of view of market view, of course) of the Kyoto house. This game actually has all the flavor of a publisher's first productions on Nintendo DS: simple, essential concepts, flavored a bit by the use of the touch screen.", "date": "2007-08-28", "grade": null}
