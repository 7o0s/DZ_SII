But when the sequel to a video game defined by many as ~the best ever made~ comes out, it is clear that they are all there, nintendari and otherwise, waiting for it at the gate. Well, the wait hasn't been in vain, and Super Mario Galaxy 2 is exactly as we expected: a game design masterpiece that takes up the mechanics of the first episode but doesn't simply re-propose them, presenting itself rather as an exercise in style branded ~N~, a review of ideas that seem to never end and are renewed from one galaxy to another. We like to imagine the Nintendo developers, naturally supervised by the good Miyamoto, busy throwing down concepts, sequences and situations to be represented on the screen, in a sort of internal competition in which whoever invents the best material wins. For this review, we completed the game in just over fourteen hours, conquering the ~minimum wage~ of stars (seventy-one) and reaping the fruits of an experience that left us truly satisfied, but still faced with quite a few work to do to get all stars and explore all galaxies. So let's start by saying that SMG2 lasts quite a while: we can hypothesize something like 20-25 hours to get one hundred and twenty stars (also because we must consider that the more advanced challenges require a greater number of attempts to be overcome), plus a nice a few extra hours to devote to the inevitable surprises. Difficult to ask for more from a product of this kind, which can be devoured in a week or savored slowly over the course of a month or more, and then perhaps taken up and completed once again with an eye to the times for each individual stage. Galaxy Express The incipit of Mario's new adventure is the usual: the evil Bowser, who has become gigantic thanks to a mysterious power, kidnaps Princess Peach and takes her away with him by throwing his gauntlet at the moustached plumber. The latter obviously immediately sets off in pursuit and after a first two-dimensional section, useful for becoming familiar with the control system and the infrared pointer of the Wii-mote (which also in this sequel is used to collect the astroshards visible on the screen ), meets a young and powerful Luma who hides in his hat giving him the ability to spin on himself. The rotation therefore allows the hero to use the first Launch Star of the game, destined to project him onto what will be the plumber's ~starting point~ for the entire duration of the space journey: a spaceship that depicts Mario's head and that on its surface it hosts several Toads and Lumas who will offer us their help in one way or another. The navigation system between one galaxy and another is therefore completely redesigned, with the ship depicted as a pawn and the galaxies becoming accessible as we conquer new stars. To move towards a galaxy, just indicate it with the Wii-mote and press the A button, with the graphical interface indicating the number of available stars and the possible presence of comets; these only appear after you have collected a certain number of comet medals and are usually the last step towards completing a galaxy. A system therefore that takes a ~step back~ compared to that of the first chapter, but which is also more effective, streamlined and immediate. During navigation you can meet some Greedy Lumas, which in exchange for a few astroshards are transformed into new galaxies that enrich the world in which we find ourselves. The Greedy Lumas are also present within already existing galaxies, and can transform respectively into planets (which usually constitute one of the ~alternative paths~ present in each scenario) or into green mushrooms (capable of giving us an extra life) or reds (which double our vital energy). Speaking of energy, in Super Mario Galaxy 2 there is still a correlation between coins collected and the ~health bar~, in the sense that once you have been hit, you can collect a coin to restore the lost energy. Then there are the red mushrooms just mentioned, which add another three units of energy and therefore make Mario capable of taking double the hits: a particularly welcome help when there is a more threatening boss than usual to face. Speaking of bosses, it must be said that the developers have done an extraordinary job: they are all enormous, but thanks to the particularly apt design they always boast a certain personality. To defeat them you have to learn their movements, as in the most classic of Super Mario Bros. episodes, and carry out your attacks with timing and precision.neither. Plumbers on the verge of a nervous breakdown During the first stages of the adventure, one of the Lumas accompanying Mario looks at the spaceship and prophetically says that its colors (especially the green) remind him of Luigi. Always in view of the ~alternative paths~ on which the game is based, which offer different situations within the same galaxy, from a certain point onwards it will be possible to control Luigi and to conquer new stars wearing his clothes. On a practical level, the ~change~ does not produce substantial differences (Luigi jumps slightly higher and recovers more slowly from the blows suffered, details in short) but fans will only be able to appreciate this return as well as the numerous citations to the unforgettable Luigi's Mansion, one of those GameCube titles that to date have not yet found a well-deserved sequel. Another welcome return is that of Yoshi, the nice dinosaur that Mario can ride and that also in SMG2 proves to have an incomparable appetite: just use the pointer of the Wii-mote on the screen and press the B trigger because he swallows the designated object and you quickly transform it into something else, perhaps a projectile useful for destroying the barriers that stand between us and the next area. Once launched and reached a new galaxy, we are generally faced with a scenario divided into sections that are often quite distinct from each other, characterized by different situations. There is never a shortage of opponents to face and can be eliminated as usual by jumping on their heads (an operation that yields a coin) or by hitting them with the spin (which turns them into star shards), to be performed by shaking the Wii-mote. The ~multiple head jump~ that characterized the two-dimensional episodes of Super Mario Bros. turns out to be rather complicated in a three-dimensional context, also because generally the only reference regarding the position is the shadow projected on the ground by the character. Unfortunately, it is also the only way to overcome the increasingly difficult challenges that are launched by a very competitive little monkey, tests that precisely provide for the elimination of a large number of enemies within a time limit and which must be repeated quite a few times before a mix of timing and luck allows you to complete them and thus earn us a new star. This is not the only type of challenge to face, however: in some galaxies we will have to fly on the back of a gigantic bird, directing its movements by holding the controller horizontally towards the screen; in others we will find ourselves riding spheres in a context similar to that of Super Monkey Ball, regulating the movements with the Wii-mote vertically like a joystick; in still others we will have to catch a mischievous rabbit skating on snowy expanses; finally, we will find ourselves ~sliding~ along endless channels dotted with traps. The variety of situations is therefore one of the greatest qualities of this sequel, truly capable of surprising at every level with some new element to appreciate; an authentic ~toy~ that any Nintendo fan will find simply irresistible. The Mario you (don't) expect If in the first Super Mario Galaxy you could count on the classic rainbow flower capable of giving momentary invincibility and on the white one that allowed you to throw fireballs, as well as on the mushrooms capable of transforming Mario into a bee, ghost and spring, in Super Mario Galaxy 2 the number of powers and transformations has been significantly increased: Mario can transform into a rolling rock capable of destroying most of the objects in his path, acquire the power to create up to three clouds by rotating on himself in order to reach otherwise inaccessible areas and use an auger to drill through the planets from end to end. It can also make Yoshi eat the classic hot pepper to make the dinosaur start running very fast (even on water!), or a blue fruit that transforms it into a sort of balloon capable of rising in the air for a certain period of time. Not only are the possibilities offered so many, but they all have a precise function within each galaxy. In SMG2 there are no ~useless~ powers, which perhaps can make life easier but which have no real purpose in that specific context. Very often, on the contrary, the peculiarities of a galaxy are reflected precisely in the powers that we will be able to use within it, creating a symbiotic relationship between the scenario and the ability to move which alone gives an idea of the amount of work done by Nintendo as regards the level design. The introduction of the drill, for one thing, is brilliant. To uAt a certain point that concept comes into contact with switches that change the force of gravity from one direction to another, thus making it possible to pierce the surface on which the plumber is located from every angle and thus reach the most hidden areas. On the other hand, the management of the power of the ~spring~ appears more complicated, which, as in the first SMG, gives the possibility of making prodigious leaps as long as you press the A button at the exact moment in which the character ~shortens~ on contact with the ground. Technical considerations If the gameplay of Super Mario Galaxy 2 has limits, they are more of a systematic type, that is, linked to the specific characteristics of the Wii controllers. The octagonal shape of the ~compartment~ that houses the Nunchuk's analog stick, for example, often forces you to make a precise diagonal whereas Mario's movement is not constrained in any way; therefore, it can happen that you run into conflict with this discrepancy, especially in the most delicate passages or passages that require great precision. And the ability of the character to rotate on itself - which needs a moment of ~recharge~ to be reused and which therefore does not go well with the most ~crowded~ fights based on the shaking of the Wii-mote - inevitably ends up ~doing misfire~ at certain moments, perhaps precisely when this maneuver is essential to our survival (one thinks of the ~flip-swap~ galaxy, in which the floor is divided into tables that change position precisely following our rotations, alternating with dangerous chasms ). Although the idea that accompanied the development of this Super Mario Galaxy 2 was therefore that of a product closer to casual users, on the contrary the game soon proves to be challenging even for the more experienced. The ~hardcore~ turn appears already evident after the second world, with a decidedly greater average difficulty than in the first episode and a large number of potentially frustrating situations, which however at the same time make their overcoming even more satisfying. Fortunately, if it is true that certain passages can therefore require several attempts and therefore the loss of a good number of lives, it is equally true that the game is never ~cruel~, often offering an extra 1up to flesh out one's reserve. The graphics sector, once again characterized by a practically impeccable frame rate of sixty frames per second, uses special effects in a discreet and intelligent way (fur shading, reflective surfaces, etc.) and shows a masterful use of colours, which gives each galaxy a very precise characterization. Observing the work done by Nintendo programmers, one therefore often wonders why the average quality in terms of graphics of Wii games is so distant, but that's another story... The level design, on the other hand, is practically perfect, capable of lending itself so much to a quick and essential experience as for the more detailed research phases. In this sense, Super Mario Galaxy 2 could act as a summary to synthesize years of game design and playful progress: a condensed gameplay, pure and simple. The management of the camera, while proving to be excellent for most of the time, in a couple of scenarios it lets itself go a bit, creating some headaches. Finally, the polygonal models of the characters and their animations are almost unchanged, while the sound as usual has on its side the strength of songs and tunes so catchy that they remain imprinted in the head after the first listening.
