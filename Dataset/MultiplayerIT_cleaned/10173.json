It is therefore with pleasure that we welcome this Calling, which draws liberally from the horrific imagery of the Rising Sun and which presents itself with a gameplay that is in many ways unrelated to traditional schemes. Damn www The narrative canvas that forms the backdrop to Calling probably won't appear new to horror film enthusiasts, as a large part of the elements that compose it have already been elaborated by one or more films: everything revolves around a mysterious web page which, according to one urban legend, it would cause the death of anyone who visits it. Specifically, the story of the game can count on four protagonists who find themselves living the same nightmare: guilty of having looked at the cursed site, they all wake up in a sort of parallel dimension populated exclusively by decidedly unfriendly ghosts, and it will be up to the user to try to bring them to safety before they die of fear. The expression used is not accidental, as Calling offers an indicator of sanity on the screen, which increases or decreases depending on the psychological stress suffered by the protagonist. This is precisely the pivot on which the entire playful structure of the Konami product rotates, developed as a first-person adventure that relies heavily - if not entirely - on the thrills it is capable of making run down the player's back. In this respect, we can safely say that the goal has been achieved: Calling is a genuinely distressing experience, in the most ~Japanese~ sense of the term: this means that fear is not so much generated by chair-jumping audiovisual climaxes ( however present), but rather by many small elements that constantly accompany the user's journey. The constant darkness of the settings, the deathly silence suddenly broken by an unspecified sound, a figure that peeps out to the side of the screen and then disappears before it can even be distinguished, are all examples of the stratagems wisely adopted by the developers to always keep the voltage level. Not to mention the cell phone, another peculiar feature of the Hudson title: each of the protagonists is in fact equipped with a mobile device, essential above all to solve some puzzles using the camera or audio recorder. Secondly, the telephone is the main vehicle through which the ghosts get in touch with the alter ego of the moment: every time it rings, just press a button on the Remote and bring it to your ear to listen to the chilling babbles of spirits directly through the device's speaker. A well-studied feature with a sure impact, which unfortunately loses a large part of its appeal due to the localization in Italian, guilty of diluting the tension through bad acting, moreover of voices often also characterized by a strong dialectal inflection. People who look like things If on the one hand the horrific system set up by the Calling developers is commendable, on the other hand it is undeniable that the more strictly playful sector has been decidedly placed in the background. Taking advantage of the first person view, the user must command the character by managing his movements with the Nunchuck's analog stick and his gaze with the pointing of the Remote: this second aspect has not been properly developed, given that the camera is not always it literally follows the movements made using the Wii device. The real problems of the game, however, are quite different. On balance, the playful structure of the Hudson title is resolved in long - and rather slow- walks within the settings, interspersed with sporadic collections of objects, some puzzles and close encounters with ghosts which, again from a playful point of view, leave some time they find. Particularly perplexing is the amount of useless interactions that one is forced to carry out with the elements of the scenario: the rooms that one finds oneself exploring are full of strictly empty drawers to be opened and material whose examination leads to nothing, all amplified by the fact that the player almost never has a specific goal to achieve, thus finding himself forced to grope until the trigger of an event scripped. Furthermore, when one comes across a spirit, it becomes necessary to shake the Remote furiously and press the A key at the right time to chase it away as soon as possible and limit the damage to one's mental health: a procedure that quickly gets boring, and which it could have been made more varied perhaps by adopting a system of quick time events. In short, the real risk with Calling is to proceed in the adventure spurred only by the taste for the thrill rather than by a truly engaging gameplay, even if the not excessive duration of the game still avoids the risk of boredom. Finally, ups and downs also characterize the cosmetic realization of the Konami product, graphically barely decent even for the modest Wii standards: despite the limited visual horizon caused by the constant darkness, the settings are generally rather bare, while the polygonal models of the characters leave enough to to be desired especially regarding the facial animations visible in the cutscenes.", "date": "2010-03-01", "grade": "7.5"}
