{"name": "Il ritorno del Re dei Combattenti", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-king-of-fighters-collection-the-orochi-saga-recensione.html", "text": "In the 90s fighting games were the most popular both in arcades and on home consoles, and the protagonists of that period were undoubtedly Capcom and SNK: the first started the dance with Street Fighter 2 and with the numerous updates of the series, the second responded differently with Fatal Fury, Art of Fighting and Samurai Shodown. Gamers were the ones who gained the most from this no-holds-barred battle, being faced with real masterpieces of the genre. In 1994, SNK further diversified its offer with The King of Fighters series, a true crossover that brought together characters from old and new titles, interacting within the same martial arts tournament as well as Marvel superheroes or DC share the same ~universe~. Judging by the longevity of the series, it is evident that it was a winning choice, which among other things introduced the concept of team combat later taken up by numerous titles: the player did not have to select a single character, but a team made up of three wrestlers who would take turns during each fight. The King of Fighters '94 and '95 After an animated introduction that is anything but spectacular, which unfortunately mixes low and medium resolution images in a mediocre way, The King of Fighters Collection: The Orochi Saga presents us with a main menu from which it is possible to select one of the five episodes of the series or access the only extra mode present, ~Challenges~: it is a series of challenges to be completed despite some handicap, which may be the obligation to use only one type of shot, an almost empty energy bar or a time limit. Unfortunately, online multiplayer is missing, but since it was a simple collection it would have been too much to ask the developers to include it. The King of Fighters '94, as the first chapter of the saga, shows its side to a series of limitations from the point of view of the gameplay which, however, are mitigated by an extremely accurate technical realization. It is not possible to edit the teams, therefore it is necessary to choose the pre-set groups combined with a nation: the brothers Terry and Andy Bogard together with their friend Joe Higashi to represent, strangely, Italy; the Art of Fighting trio of Ryo and Akuma Sakazaki along with friend Robert Garcia representing Mexico; ~protagonist~ Kyo Kusanagi's team together with Goro and Benimaru to hold up the flag of Japan, and so on for a total of eight teams and twenty-four individual characters. The impact with the game, fifteen years after its release, is certainly a bit traumatic, especially as regards the balancing of the difficulty: even setting it to the minimum value (1 out of 8), overcoming the clashes unscathed is an all it's more than simple. Linking the various moves to give life to combos (in any case not ~detected~ by the system) is almost impossible, the fights are very fragmented and reasoned, and finally incredible importance is given to the supermoves that can be performed when the energy bar is low red: two are enough to eliminate an opponent, therefore they are ideal maneuvers to change the fate of a clash. From this point of view, The King of Fighters '95 does not introduce who knows what novelties: the philosophy is the same, but the possibility of editing the teams is introduced, which becomes nine (for a total, therefore, of twenty-seven individual characters). Always very high difficulty, extremely tactical clashes and supermoves to make the difference between victory and defeat. These first two episodes, although distant from the current concept of match fighting games, are the best ones from a technical point of view: the sprites are well designed and well animated, but above all it is possible to admire beautiful backdrops, full of details and of animated elements, introduced each time in a different way. A similar speech can be made in relation to the sound: the voices are not that great, but the music has literally made school. The King of Fighters '96, '97 and '98 With the episodes from '96 to '98, substantial changes are made to the series. Firstly, the graphics are almost completely redesigned, some too powerful characters (the members of the Sakazaki team, in particular) are deprived of some moves and there is a strong work of diversifying the fighters. In short, there is a clear improvement from the gameplay point of view, the player is finally given the opportunity to chain multiple moves and the clashes become more dynamic and engaging. At the same time, the difficulty level is significantly lowered and the effectiveness of super moves is significantly decreased. NeglFurthermore, the '97 and '98 episodes, the developers have inserted the possibility of initially selecting a ~style~ that allows teams to charge their spiritual energy in different ways, depending on the approach to the game. There remains the possibility of editing the teams, which reach the number of twelve in KOF98, while unfortunately the visual aspect takes a bit into the background: even if the restyling of the characters involves a lot of work, with a style that can be appreciated or not , the backgrounds become progressively simpler and poorer, sometimes touching sadness when compared with those of the first episodes. The Collection allows us to select the configuration of the controls to use the Wii-mote horizontally, the combination of Wii-mote and Nunchuck, the GameCube controller or the Classic Controller. Although the last two options are by far the best, it is possible to play with dignity even using the d-pad of the Wii-mote, while it is clear that the layout of the buttons is anything but comfortable.", "date": "2009-04-14", "grade": "7.2"}
