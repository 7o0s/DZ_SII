{"name": "Gli extra scaricabili dal Live per Lara Croft", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tomb-raider-underworld-sotto-la-cenere.html", "text": "This new unreleased level downloadable through the payment of 800 Microsoft Points is the first of two contents announced by Eidos exclusively on Xbox 360 for Tomb Raider: Underworld. What perhaps not everyone knows is that it is not necessary to have finished the main adventure or simply remember the ending of the game before starting this DLC, everyone can access it as long as they have started the last episode of the beautiful Lara saga. Exploring under the house The incipit of the adventure is quite trivial, Lara returns to the Croft house and sets about sorting out the memories of an archaeologist's life in search of an old artifact with incredible powers that seems to be buried under her imposing home. Thus begins the adventure. Certainly not very original but functional to the development of this single level that will keep you busy for about an hour and a half or two in exploring the meanders of the basement of Lara's house. This first expansion starts immediately, without too many preambles, ideal for all those who have already played Tomb Raider Underworld and we believe that no user with the slightest savvy can start playing the expansion before the full game. It is obvious that this choice could cause difficulties in the first few minutes for those who finished the game some time ago and now don't perfectly remember all the commands and the control system. If much of the charm of the main adventure was given by the open spaces and the excellent settings, in ~Sotto la Cenere~ the environments turn out to be absolutely claustrophobic and limited. You can find impervious tunnels and cobwebs to make the narrow passages of these catacombs even more cramped. A totally ~grey~ setting enlivened only by Lara's skimpy swimsuits, selectable at will, and included in this expansion pack. The use of the grappling hook has certainly been increased and you can use it throughout the level to move around in this new underground world. Technically This expansion has the same game design problems found in the full game, moving or better jumping more than a few times blindly from one ledge to another is certainly not a bug but a real defect of the virtual direction that has foreseen the scene. What we have certainly noticed is a heavy lack in level design precisely at the level of imagination and subsequent construction of the paths in which our favorite archaeologist must pass. To function properly, the environments must not only be completely explorable but also based on a valid architectural construction. However, the exploration must take place not only with the right amount of difficulty but also being able to count on a camera that allows us to probe every surface in the correct way in order to analyze our moves before executing them, and in ~Sotto la Cenere~ unfortunately not that's it. The interaction with the platforms between which Lara moves is at times absolutely frustrating and very random, thus making Ms. Croft's movements more than fluid and elegant, absolutely awkward and difficult. The enemies encountered during exploration are certainly not able to create complications for the beautiful archaeologist and between zombies and giant spiders, unless there are ruinous errors due to distractions or incorrect interactions with the scenario, it is always possible to come out victorious with simplicity. Comment Tomb Raider: Underworld - Under the Ashes is the first of the exclusive contents for Xbox 360 dedicated to the beautiful Lara and anticipates the forthcoming one dedicated to the Shadow of Lara which certainly seems to be more intriguing. This first episode, in addition to having been made to wait too long, has certainly not negligible level design gaps, and furthermore the 800 Microsoft Points, equal to about 10 euros, are certainly excessive for an expansion that yes and no will occupy you 2 hours of play . We would have liked something more, Lara's new bikinis by themselves don't justify the purchase.Pros The charm of Lara New costumes and a new world to explore Against ...just 2 hours of gameplay 800 Mp is too much Obvious gaps in level design Xbox 360 - Goals The 125 points available for this new content can only be obtained by exploring all the available environments with the ones highlighted in the review. The first 50 points will be unlocked by simply finishing the level, for the others willy-nilly there will be sweating.", "date": "2009-04-07", "grade": null}
