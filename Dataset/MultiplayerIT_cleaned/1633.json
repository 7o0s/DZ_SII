{"name": "Postal 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/postal-2.html", "text": "The tools of the trade The park of tools that you can use in Postal 2 certainly does not shine for variety, but remember that after all you are a common citizen and not an elite soldier of the NSA or a super space marine. Vanga: Doesn't arouse suspicion and is very fun to use. In fact, with it you can enjoy barbaric beheadings. Throwing Objects: Grenades, Molotov cocktails or simple scissors are always in vogue among trendy young psychopaths. Taser: Useful at close range but often inconvenient. Blackjack: Convenient and practical; steal him from some cop and he'll become your best friend (not the cop, of course). Gasoline Can and Matches: There's not much to say, except to use them in the order described and avoid getting involved in the blaze. 9mm Pistol: Common, but also accurate and with a good reserve of bullets. Sawed-Off Shotgun: Spectacular for the ~exploding head~ effect at close range, but slow to reload. Shotgun: The closest thing to a sniper rifle. Accurate but very slow. M-16: Automatic assault rifle with some accuracy problems in long bursts. Heavy Weapons: Rocket Launcher and Napalm Rifle. The big shots of your arsenal, all to be discovered and used for happy mass exterminations ^_^. A Day of Ordinary Madness yes, that's exactly what that film with Michael Douglas was called, I recommend it if you can still find it in video stores. I mention it because it's one of the first things that flashed through my mind after the first few minutes of the game. Strolling around the city to complete your errands, you will find yourself in typical situations of civilized life (ahem): payments to be made, queues at the counters, people who bump into you on the street and, as it should be, trouble with the police in case you commit a crime. However, ours is not a perfect system, and the Postal Dude knows it well, on the contrary, sometimes we even say that he has the unmentionables, and then the fun begins (for him of course). In whatever situation you find yourself, you can decide how to behave, whether to follow the rules and not create problems or whether to carve out a niche for yourself in our hypocritical and anonymous system, leaving your blood mark; in less ideological terms, you can sit still and queue in silence, or set fire to everyone in front of you and do much faster, with the risk of facing the consequences later. Here's the interesting thing: the world of Postal 2 always has consequences; no one will bother you if you're nice (well almost no one, but we'll see that in a moment), while if you break the rules expect specific consequences. We start from the simplest things up to the most serious crimes. If you step on a passing dog, it will start to bite you with gusto. Entering a house without permission you will be warned to leave, then the owner will call the police or take action himself. Dropping your fly in the middle of the street and urinating on people (yes, there is that option) will earn you a good thrashing from a burly bartender, or arrest for indecent exposure. One or more murders... well imagine, do you know the movie scenes with dozens of policemen with shotguns? Here you are . In any case, it is probable that if there are no policemen nearby, citizens will react on their own (we are in America, the homeland of guns, remember this), even if a good number of them will limit themselves to threatening you and then flee if you become more aggressive. Because all in all this is the central part of the game: aggressive and creative. A shooting can, after all, be trivial, and this is where the inherent cruelty of the game comes in, which will inevitably infect you too. A simple kill can be replaced by a satisfying torment or gruesome execution, all simply because you're in a bad mood, and remember, you don't mess with the Delivery Guy! Setting fire to a person with petrol and then lighting the match with a sadistic look, or hitting him with a spade while he begs you to stop, only to then behead him with the same spade mentioned above; blowing off the head of a passerby with a point-blank shot from the sawed-off shotgun; kicking a corpse, or even worse, playing catch with its severed head. These are just some of the bizarre and cruel turpitudes you can commit if you deem it appropriate, bearing in mind that it is a game, a game that is a bit fortified in terms of content, but which succeeds, with a skilful mix of raw violence and poisonous humor - which never fails to send a few digs at the vices and hypocrisies of our society ... your task is to cogread them all - to make things more digestible (~come on, in the end it's just for laughs!~). What an empty life, what an empty life That's not exactly what you'll come to think after a few minutes of playing. Sure, the background music of the map and the general attitude of the people may give the illusion of a perfect, ordinary, peaceful sitcom town, but that's not exactly the case. Even if you decide to behave yourself on every occasion, if you stand in line like good citizens and never take out your trinket in public (what a chauvinist game, isn't it?), there are unpredictable events that will involve you in spite of yourself: as the manual says It's not always your fault. As I already mentioned, the people of Paradise are only apparently normal, and this can be deduced from the various writings, from the billboards, from the names of the shops, from the products that can be found in the drugstores (baboon testicles? Are we kidding? Apparently not ), a great mess of more or less veiled references to the real world and criticisms of the hypocritical respectability that reigns supreme in today's Western societies. This criticism, in the form of truculent satire that even Trey Parker and Matt Stone would never have conceived in their trashy nightmares, does not spare even the various categories of ideological, political and religious protesters and dissidents: if we have animal rights activists, disobedients and so on , in Paradise there are associations against violent videogames, those who want to burn all the books in the world to save the Amazon forest and there are also religious fanatics with lots of kamikaze bomb-men, and all these subjects do not fail to shoot heavily armed. And where is the fun? In the fact that regularly, in almost all your commissions, you will be involved in the disorders caused by these groups, and therefore you will also have the pretext to shed a little blood without ending up behind bars, but you will earn their hostility, ready to target you in the future. The most uncomfortable group to deal with is undoubtedly the police: a special bar will indicate how much you are in trouble with the law and will determine the severity of the reaction of the police forces should they catch you. Showing off family jewels on the street or the like will cost you a simple arrest, but trying to resist that or committing a serious crime involves being shot on sight by the cops. Once in prison it won't be difficult to escape, just don't show up, just as there are many areas where you can go around with impunity and even kill a few as long as you don't show up and don't run away as if you were running away. All in all then the game has an A.I. of a good level, with a somewhat realistic response. A note of note: do not forget the pearl of trash genius of the programmers in including even Gary Coleman, who the more elderly will remember for an ancient sitcom known by us with the title Arnold, who will appear as a big celebrity in little Paradise and then well I'll let you find out hihi The path of violence Several years have passed since the first ~episode~ of Postal. It was way back in 1997 when these memorable lines were read on Gamespot: The game that will make the entire Christian Coalition explode in an immense mushroom cloud of religious fervor is finally here. A decidedly less humorous setting, a third-person setting with rendered 3D models and static backdrops, and a chilling level of involvement, in every sense. That Postal fascinated me, shocked me and perhaps I was expecting a rebirth of the same concept. But it was probably too much then, and it was too much now, and so Running With Scissors decided to season the violence with humor, the pulp with the sitcom verve that is very South Park, perhaps to captivate just that slice of the public that doesn't instead he would have liked a cruder and less ironic approach to the ~concept~ of gratuitous violence. In the meantime you Why don't you try to fix the first Postal? I highly recommend it, despite the high difficulty. What the hell are you looking at, face of  but, what a beautiful face! One of the technical aspects that I liked the most in this game is undoubtedly the creation of passers-by and all the characters that populate the city. The faces in particular have been done really well, and are realistic both in their expressions and in the small details. Perhaps less attention has been paid to the models of the bodies and physics, but the effectoverall not bad at all. Moreover, each character has its own appropriate movements: a teenager can carefree walk or hop, a policeman can approach warily with his weapon drawn, a frightened cashier can run away with his arms covering his face and so on. Overall the detail of the environment is also of a good level, with a graphics engine that can be easily scaled to adapt to a wide range of machines, even if it should be noted that in any case there are frequent loading between an area and a another, perhaps too many, and above all too long, and it is not clear to what bizarre calculations this slowness is due. However, the thing that makes the nose turn up the most is undoubtedly the poor interaction with the environment. Even though there was just enough feedback to suggest some realism, I find it so annoying that I can kick a chair and move it when shooting a Coin-Op in the arcade doesn't even break the glass, as well as cars and many other objects seem to be touched only by programmed events, such as the Muslim kamikaze with the bomb on him or a fire, but not by my destructive fury. It's almost a miracle that the windows break if I shoot at them Then there is no real audio compartment, except for a couple of themed tracks, while most of the game you will spend listening to insults, shots and background noises . Too bad, there could have been a series of heavy tracks in the excited phases mixed with something quiet in order to accentuate the effect of the action on the overall experience. Endless violence, violence without an end... Having good memories of the first Postal, I must say that I was waiting for the sequel with some expectation, wondering what the ~RWS guys~ had managed to combine by going from the two-dimensional isometry to the more accommodating 3D setting that we are used to seeing today. I honestly regret feeling some disappointment, the uncomfortable sense of is that all? which prompted me to keep going hoping something big would happen. Don't get me wrong: things happen, there are too many shootings, and the ~plot~ (well, that thing there...) also leaves room for some ironic diversion, but in the end everything is bloody repetitive: a day of errands, the assault by a group of misfits resulting in a firefight, and, in between, how much we are able to put in in terms of gratuitous, dispassionate voluntary murder with the aggravating boredom and futility of the whole. The underlying idea is really good, and the general context in which it was made creates the right atmosphere, but it is not a solid foundation on which to build a long-lived game. In my opinion, Postal 2 is a game from which not to expect lasting involvement, a game that is fun at first, then gradually starts to get boring due to the repetitiveness and lack of diversions. Certainly it is a light-hearted, light-hearted title, ideal for unwinding when even Splinter Cell tries too hard and your brain needs a healthy, irrational bloodshed simulated to put things back into perspective (I'm talking to intelligent people who know how to distinguish video game and reality, right?). In a nutshell, therefore, Postal 2 does not shine in the shooter firmament, perhaps due to a hasty realization or a failure to develop an idea that would have led to excellent results if cultivated with due attention (or perhaps adequate resources?). Nonetheless, the game remains a decent product, recommended to those who have tried all kinds of FPS and will certainly find this a pleasant diversion. Not recommended for those looking for plot, coherence and logic in a game: this game, in fact, makes no sense ^_^. Another politically correct consideration: kids, there's a nice red dot with a number on the game... unfortunately until your beard grows and you start wearing a car you'll have to do without Postal 2, otherwise your mothers could get scared as you scream excitedly in front of the exploded head of a passerby. But it's not a great loss, come on, there's always Pikachu... Pros: An original idea ~Mature~ humor at will Relaxing, liberating gratuitous violence Cons: Long and frequent uploads Interactivity with the environment that is not excessive In the long run it becomes repetitive Welcome to Paradise, Arizona Oh yes, a really nice Paradise town, a little provincial perhaps, but anything but quiet. People are a little strange, a little touchy, let's say. If it seems to you an irrelevant fact well, you will have to change your mind soon, as soon as you wake up in the morning", "date": "2003-06-07", "grade": null}
