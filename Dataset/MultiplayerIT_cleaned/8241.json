{"name": "L'inizio della fine", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/110046-the-walking-dead-episode-4-linizio-della-fine.html", "text": "Each episode of this series begins with a bad feeling, which in the world of The Walking Dead can only mean one thing: the zombies are close. Around Every Corner is no exception, but at least after the initial adrenaline it offers the group a place to catch their breath. This is actually a false security. Clementine is restless: she wants to find her parents and claims greater independence. This means that in addition to protecting her we must also parent her. A difficult task for Lee and consequently for us. Furthermore, the group is once again torn apart by an internal struggle. Kenny on one side, determined to find out immediately if there is a boat available to escape on, and Christa on the other, worried about Omid's injured leg and anxious to find him some antibiotics. Obviously, we are at the center of the dispute, who must choose which side to take. At this point we were amazed to realize that despite everything Kenny is the only friend we have, or at least the only one in the group we would never do without. It's strange because from the very beginning we sided against him. Furthermore, it cannot be denied that he is on the verge of a dangerous nervous breakdown, but seeing him smile even once, after what he has been through, has left us with an emotion. This speaks volumes about the skill with which the Telltales have built around the characters numerous opportunities to cement a bond with them. A fact that becomes evident in the finale of Around Every Corner, when we are faced with a cliffhanger so powerful that we count the days until the final chapter is released. If you are reading these lines and you are still in doubt whether or not to buy the series, now we can tell you with confidence: The Walking Dead offers emotions that you will very rarely, if ever, find in another video game. I'm Lee: I solve problems Around Every Corner is a complex episode, which introduces many elements but does not dedicate the right space to each one. Omid, Christa and Chuck have just joined the group and there aren't enough opportunities to bond with them or find out more about their past. On the other hand, the scene is occupied by Kenny, Clementine and Ben, who with his sense of guilt and the constant wavering between the desire to help and the fear of dying finds himself influencing the fate of the group without ever becoming part of it. Really. But it's not just them. Around Every Corner also introduces two new characters, Molly and Vernon, plus a few extras. Molly in particular would be a splendid addition to the group, capable of changing its balance, but always remains unconnected in some way. Unfortunately, as we said, so many voices struggle to find space, also due to the frequent action scenes. Lee suddenly transforms into a commando: he kills one zombie after another by hitting them in the head with his pistol, he slashes with his ax and while climbing inside the bell tower he shoots his way through the hordes of undead . Scenes like that are better suited to a S.T.A.R.S. of Resident Evil rather than a provincial teacher. Beyond this, despite being a variation on the previous episodes, the fights cool the tension that the game creates so well when it makes us interact with the other characters. And in fact every time we return to confront Clementine and Kenny, the phenomenal dubbing and the excellent quality of the writing immediately bring us back to the heart of the psychological drama. In short, Around Every Corner is a rich episode, with many more areas to visit and actions to perform, with only a few voltage drops, probably due to the fact that it has to prepare the scene for the last chapter. And yet it contains at least one terrifying, very powerful scene and an ending that surpasses everything the series has offered thus far. Enough to make it another memorable piece of this gripping apocalyptic narrative. The Italian is not dead yet Thanks to the efforts of the amateur translation group CrybioLab, PC owners can download patches to play the first, second and third episode of The Walking Dead with Italian subtitles.
