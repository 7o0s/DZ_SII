{"name": "Dove sono finiti tutti quanti?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/75875-saira-dove-sono-finiti-tutti-quanti.html", "text": "Saira is the first commercial project of Nifflas, a prolific indie author who has given birth to masterpieces such as Knytt and Knytt Stories. The plot is very simple: teleported to Mars, Saira, the protagonist, discovers that mankind has disappeared. What happened? To find out, all that remains is to embark on a journey into deep space in search of the truth. In his latest work, Nifflas takes up all the themes that are dear to him and that he has already proposed in his previous works and tries to develop them in such a way as to make them attractive to a paying public. His poetics (he does not hesitate to define his titles as art) is made up of wide and silent scenarios, barely outlined graphically (the use of silhouettes is remarkable), which offer themselves first of all to contemplation, favored by the carefully studied silences, and then to the playful exploration necessary for solving the puzzles. The control system is very simple, with Saira being able to run, jump and climb walls. By coming into contact with an alien liquid, it is possible to briefly transform it into a ball of fire that allows it to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. It's all about skill For the maps are littered with terminals with which Saira can interact. They usually contain information, or require solving a minigame to open laser doors. Minigames are often not immediately solvable, but require you to search for clues scattered throughout the levels. For example, in one world it will be necessary to search for a numerical code, while in another a sequence of arrows to be entered by shooting at moving tiles. If you want, you can take photos to keep the images of useful clues, or even just to remember a particular location. In addition to exploring and solving puzzles, the protagonist will also have to overcome obstacles that will test the player's skills. For example, in a rather remote world it will be necessary to overcome a race divided into stages of increasing difficulty, which becomes difficult to the point of frustrating in the final, with jumps to be performed to the millimeter and obstacles placed in the most infamous way possible. The only weapon to win and get to the end is skill, or the development of one's manual skills through practice and understanding of the limits and potential of the control system. There are no shortcuts, aids or solutions that hold: if you don't master the movements of the protagonist, you go nowhere (apart from below in the abyss).", "date": "2010-04-14", "grade": "8.0"}
