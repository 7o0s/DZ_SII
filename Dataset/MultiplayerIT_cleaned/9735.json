However, moved by the numerous requests of the fans, and convinced that the game mechanics could be exploited better, John Kooistra has created a sequel to this last title, with the aim of remaining faithful to the original formula, but at the same time adding enough irons in the fire to justify a new release rather than a simple update. Blue Defense: Second Wave! therefore it focuses everything on a renewed control system and new types of enemies, leaving the structure of each level unchanged and the particular graphic style now the developer's trademark. It is therefore obvious that, at first glance, the game seems practically identical to the previous chapter, but once you start a game, the first substantial differences finally emerge. 360 defense Those who have played the first Blue Defense will feel at home right away: once again the aim is to protect the blue planet from the continuous waves of enemies coming from every corner of space, in what looks like a blend of mechanics taken from Space Invaders and Asteroids. It's actually a lot better than it might seem. The direction of the fire is reoriented by turning the device, and this is exactly what makes the game so much fun; to avoid being hit from behind, the player will have to quickly flip his iPhone, rotate it from side to side, tilt it slightly and then suddenly return it to where it was before, in a rapid and incessant pirouette. In short, as well as Eliss, which squeezes the multitouch technology to the core, Blue Defense: Second Wave! it takes one of the characteristics of Apple devices and takes it to the next level. Where the author wanted to push more for this sequel, however, was in the touchscreen controls, thanks to which to give greater mastery and tactics to the action. By tapping the screen anywhere you can split the wave of bullets in two different directions, so as to repel attacks on opposite sides; the multitouch interface then allows you to go even further, further dividing the fire in all the desired directions. Obviously, the more the attack is divided, the less damage will be inflicted on each enemy, thus making it necessary to deal with the opponents according to a scale of priorities. With two quick taps it is possible to lock the fire in one direction, useful if you want to focus it on a boss while keeping the enemy units swarming around it at bay, while dragging your finger you can activate a devastating but limited special attack. The touch interface and the motion sensors thus come together in an apparently perfect symbiosis, but which could easily frighten the occasional user due to the numerous inputs to manage. There is no doubt that, unlike the first chapter, the new Blue Defense is aimed at players looking for a greater challenge, and the incredible variety of enemies leads to constantly adapting one's strategy: among the many new features there are enemies in able to create permanent shields, enemies that multiply in a short time, or units that attack only when hit. Thankfully Blue Defense: Second Wave! it is playable at different levels: less experienced players can start from the simple use of the motion sensors, practicing and gradually arriving at a much more complex and effective approach. Improvements can also be seen on a stylistic level, with more elegant graphics and a less tacky glow effect, while the same cannot be said of the unique and repetitive music that forms the background for each level. Unfortunately, the fine-tuned control system isn't matched by a full-bodied single player campaign or a compelling multiplayer option: the main mode consists of an infinite series of enemy waves that is always different with each game, but which misses of additional content, unlockable achievements and missions to complete.
