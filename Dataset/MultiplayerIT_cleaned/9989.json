The first chapter has certainly not broken through and, with an anime and a mobile game exclusive to Japanese soil, we cannot blame the Italian players who arrive unprepared in front of Blue Reflection Second Light, a direct sequel to the first chapter. For this reason, in the review of Blue Reflection Second Light we explain what we think. Back to school Ao and the first girls we meet in Blue Reflection Second Light Blue Reflection Second Light is a direct sequel to the first chapter, but at the same time it moves away from it in part. What happened in the first game, in fact, forms the narrative basis for the events of Second Light, but the links between the two games will not be immediately visible. The protagonists with whom we faced the Sephira in 2017 will return, but it is not essential to know the story in order to enjoy this sequel. In fact, Hinako and her friends will briefly explain what happened in the first game and that will be enough. Second Light also completely changes the setting, even if it might not seem like it at first glance. Like the previous one, this JRPG puts us in the shoes of a group of girls who are divided between daily life within their school and battles against monstrous beings in alternative realities during which they exploit their Reflector powers (i.e. Sailors Moon with flashier weapons and costumes). Second Light, however, is not the real world. Our protagonists find themselves in a kind of prison, a floating school in an endless ocean in an eternal summer. With the exception of the main protagonist, Ao, the girls have no idea how they got there, what their past is and what they should do. Or at least, they don't know it initially. Also thanks to Ao, the puellae magi will begin to explore places known as Heartscapes, or manifestations of their memories, which can then be recovered. Why are these wannabe Madokas in this reality? What happened outside? Is there an escape route? Unlike the first chapter, the plot immediately highlights multiple mysteries and manages to attract more attention. Ao herself is a figure that raises doubts in the player, since she is very different from the other Reflectors. Unfortunately, just like in the first chapter, the narrative pace is very slow also because it is interspersed with slice-of-life events, or sketches of daily life during which the girls get to know each other better, reveal what their favorite literary genres are, enjoy a cold drink or toiling over school books. Teams and combat The area surrounding the Blue Reflection Second Light school Obviously, the phases of deepening relationships, in addition to characterizing the various protagonists - who will continue to increase in number from phase to phase - also and above all serve to obtain upgrades. Each girl has a set of skills that are essential to make them more powerful (along with the classic level ups). It starts with normal stat boosts, but also new combat moves or passive effects useful for crafting. Continuing relationships through dating and completing small tasks (such as defeating certain enemies or collecting certain items in dungeons) will allow you to empower Ao and her friends, making them true war machines. Just like in the first chapter, Blue Reflection Second Light is a JRPG with a difficulty calibrated downwards. We played ~Normal~, the maximum version, but the ~Easy~ difficulty is also available, which we have not tested. We assure you that the game is extremely easy in any case. Combat system The Blue Reflection Second Light battle screen How do you fight, though? The system designed by Gust for Second Light is a positive evolution of the first chapter. Each Reflector, by default, enters combat with a Rank or a ~Gear~ if we want to use the term of the game. This determines the attacks available and the speed of the character. The higher the speed, the less time it will take to charge Ether, ie action points to be spent to activate one or more attacks in a row. Also, the Gear determines the maximum number of Ether that can be stacked, so at Rank 1 we reach 1,000 Ether and cannot use moves that cost 1,500 and 2,000. However, each attack enhances our Rank and, after a few hits, this level rises. At Gear 3 the girl transforms into a real Reflector (complete with a curtain) and becomes more powerful. It might seem complicated to assimilate the details intowritten format, but the mechanism is very simple to use in-game. Put simply: the more you attack, the stronger and faster you become. Understand well, therefore, that in the simplest and fastest clashes there is not much space to take advantage of the higher level Gear and the related skills, because as soon as you get it, the discount is now over. It's a shame as - over the course of the game - we will unlock more and more warriors (some girls don't fight and their skills are only used to enhance real team members), each of them with unique abilities, which will allow various combinations of powers. For example, there is a character that can be used to give more turns to the others, so as to make them rank up in less time. Other characters are better at healing, others at attacking and so on. Then there are equippable items that allow you to further customize, making sure - for example - that a character starts directly from Gear 3 for maximum power. The combinations, in the advanced stages, would not be lacking. As mentioned, however, the level of difficulty is so low that even a non-optimal team can get the better of it. Ao, the protagonist of Blue Reflection Second Light, in a transformed version Even the bosses are simple and above all all the same. On balance, the entire roster of enemies in the game, strong or weak, can do nothing but attack head on, with occasional activations of altered status, but they can't do much against us. There is a lack of variety and clashes that give the impression of being really challenging or at least unique. The visual design of enemies and bosses doesn't help either - it's generic and soon repetitive. To vary the cards on the table a little, there are one-on-one clashes, which can be activated both by us and by the boss on duty. Respecting certain conditions, we activate a short battle during which we must quickly alternate attacks and dodges/counterattacks, keeping pace with the enemy. If you are successful, it is possible to destroy the boss in an instant, if you fail, we do only a little damage or, in the worst case, the character is knocked out. This mechanic does nothing but make the clashes even faster, cutting short those few moments that could give some satisfaction. The dungeons themselves, just like in the first chapter, are limited in terms of design, being very linear and poor in interactions. We will be able, this time, to use stealth to attack enemies secretly and gain an initial advantage in the clashes, but don't think of Persona 5-style mechanics. You just have to crouch down and wait for the enemy's very limited visual cone to point in a other direction to approach and attack him from behind, thus starting the fight. It is a less dynamic mechanic, in line with the rest of the game, which unfortunately will be mandatory in some side missions, during which combat will be prohibited. The dungeons The school will be expanded with crafting Exploration and combat are only half the package though. When not delving into dungeons to recover memories and unlock new characters, Ao and her friends spend their time creating new ~places/objects~ for the school. We talk about things like a couple of deck chairs with umbrellas, benches for doing homework outside, bar tables, a telescope, and so on. By exploring and defeating enemies it is possible to obtain all the materials necessary to create what is necessary to advance with the plot, but if you aim for completionism you will have to spend some extra time in the dungeons to accumulate additional materials and fully upgrade each location. Each ~place~ of the school created gives bonuses to the girls and also activates new curtains, which in turn empower the protagonists. Blue Reflection Second Light therefore sees us bouncing between labyrinths and school, increasing the protagonists from time to time, creating more and more places and activating more and more skits. Expect to continue like this for over thirty hours and more (much more, depending on how many side-activities you complete). We point out that the camera, during the clashes, is a bit crazy, as it cannot keep up with the attack rhythm of the characters and continues to switch from one to another with a series of zooms and shot changes that are at best useless cases and at worst prevent you from understanding what the enemy is doing, given that girls and monsters attack at the same time. If you suffer from motion sickness, it might be a problem at first. Finally, as we assume you expect, there are no Italian subtitles.", "date": "2021-11-09", "grade": "7.5"}
