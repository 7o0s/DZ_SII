Version tested: Xbox 360 It was 2010 when the very young Klei Entertainment launched Shank in the digital delivery market, a colorful scrolling action platform, characterized by a comic style and a totally two-dimensional setting. Just like the old school of the genre, the title offered highly spectacular situations, bloody clashes and a perpetually over the top difficulty. The sequel is ready today, released without particular proclamations and offered at an even lower price than the original. An insinuating but legitimate doubt grips our minds: is it a more of the same to raise cash or was there really something to improve? To the review the arduous sentence. Tough life What happened to our old ex-assassin Shank in these two years? After defeating his worst enemy, he decides to move to an unspecified location in South America, a very bad idea, since trouble has visited him even before he arrives. Attacked by the guards of a local dictatorial regime, our protagonist responds promptly with his - not exactly friendly - style. So heads, limbs and liters of hemoglobin begin to fly, obviously with the help of our pad. Shank 2 begins just like that, after a suggestive introduction completely similar to an indie cartoon, we are quickly lowered into the action. The aim has remained the same, to cross eight long horizontally scrolling levels, presided over by very dangerous bosses. Klei has enriched the formula by inserting an interesting vertical development and numerous platform sections, very guided indeed, and a series of prisoners to be freed to obtain special weapons. These include the inevitable chainsaw, a shotgun, pistols and a pair of lethal machetes. Shank for his part is far from unarmed, possessing by default two knives that allow him to carry out a large array of combos, throwing grenades and Molotov cocktails and even the weapons left by defeated enemies. This is a point where the humor of the game probably reaches its peak, with frying pans to smash over the mangled bodies, undertaker's spades, hatchets, canes and so on. The amount of weapons and their type of use reaches almost absurd levels, so much so that it is possible to indulge in spectacular combinations, including counterattacks, mid-air shots and everything that creativity can allow. The programmers have significantly improved the response to the commands and the speed of the animations, with the result that Shank 2 is a real joy to play, enjoying a hyperbolic spectacularity, just like in a Tarantino film. I don't break... I break The exasperated dynamism is also one of the major problems of this sequel, certainly softened compared to the steep difficulty curve of the predecessor, but still not without its edges. The player is required to have considerable skill in handling combined assets in the controls, this includes an almost perfect balance between attack and defense, to be learned carefully through the very useful evasive move. Each stage introduces new ideas that must be properly exploited in the final boss, the real test that leaves very little room for error. This would also be a noble intention, referring to the old hardcore school, but unfortunately there are elements that collide with the harmony longed for by Klei. Among these, certainly the objects that accumulate on the ground, combined with the (suspicious) quantity of enemies thrown at our protagonist, create rather confusing situations where it is not always clear to identify what can harm us. The checkpoint system is fortunately extremely generous, and thanks also to the remarkable pace it never makes Shank 2 sessions particularly frustrating. A separate discussion for the hard mode, which forces you to restart the entire level in case of death, and where the enemies are particularly tough, only for real tough guys. The title also offers the possibility of playing co-op online or locally, but exclusively limited to the new survival mode. Here up to two players are faced with hordes of increasingly dangerous enemies, plus a variety of objectives such as protecting ammo or operating devices add some variety. The action takes place on static maps specially designed for the occasion, which however take up the themes of the campaign. Of note is the possibility of playing this fun mode even alone, with a series of unlockable characters by concluding the main one. Xbox 3 goals60 Shank 2 features the canonical 12 objectives for a total of 200 player points. If we exclude the most coveted ones, i.e. for the completion of the standard and difficult modes, the remaining ones require the completion of a set number of actions managed internally in the game, in the manner of Gears Of War to be clear, which require a certain amount of time to be please. Good luck! Stronger, guys Technically Shank 2 is a small marvel, Klei Entertainment definitely knows his stuff, and demonstrates it by setting up a graphic aspect that is almost indistinguishable from a cartoon. Very fluid animations, style to sell that is expressed in a successful mix of violence and irony, and a protagonist who is as tough as he is suited to the situation. The plot is highly specious to send our hero to the most improbable locations, from military camps to burning villages, jungles and ancient temples. There is a bit of everything to not get bored easily, as well as tasty references and tributes to the old school of the genre, impossible not to mention among these Strider or Green Beret. Online support is not limited to multiplayer, but also includes high score charts, which can be obtained by collecting gold nuggets in the various levels. The main campaign will not occupy you very much time, but it is adequate for the proposed price, decidedly honest for a sequel of this caliber. Shank 2 can be purchased on the Live Marketplace for 800 Microsoft Points, and on Sony Playstation Network for 9.99. Live Marketplace purchase link", "date": "2012-02-13", "grade": "8.0"}
