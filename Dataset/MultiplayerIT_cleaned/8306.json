This has been seen for example with the porting of Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy Tactics, but with the new Final Fantasy Dimensions the Japanese company is faced with a double challenge. Effectively reproducing an old-school Final Fantasy and experimenting with a sales model that can satisfy even those who are reluctant to spend 10 to 15 euros on a mobile game. The formula, already tested in Ghost Trick, has led to a JRPG sold in episodes, with the possibility of downloading the prologue for free and deciding whether to continue the adventure by purchasing the next ones. But can Dimensions prove to be a chapter in its own right and not an expensive homage to the early days of the saga? Between lights and shadows Conversion of the mobile game Final Fantasy Legends: Hikari to Yami no Senshi for iOS devices, Final Fantasy Dimensions aims to recreate the experience of the very first chapters of the franchise between random battles, 2D graphics, a flat world map and a very rigid combat system shifts. If this is enough to drive away that slice of enthusiasts who have long since said goodbye to the most obsolete mechanics of the genre, longtime fans and those who couldn't wait to immerse themselves again in a role-playing adventure in the style of Final Fantasy will instead be happy I and II. The same plot, once again focused on a kingdom in danger and magical crystals scattered around the world, re-proposes what have always been the typical stakes of the Square-Enix series. However, there are some variations to the more or less relevant theme, and for example the story features two different groups of adventurers, the heroes of light and those of darkness, whose destinies inevitably end up intertwining during the four chapters that make up the 'adventure. Considering that each of these episodes distributed ~in pills~ lasts about ten hours, Final Fantasy Dimensions turns out to be one of the most full-bodied and long-lived JRPGs released so far on the App Store. Yet it is evident how the structure of the title was not conceived on the basis of an episodic distribution model, since, although it is possible to buy the complete game from the beginning and face a fairly linear and classic adventure, those who instead decide to proceed chapter after chapter could easily let go. The lack of a real crescendo towards the end of the chapter, a hint of the next episode or even just a banal cliffhanger deprives Final Fantasy Dimensions of that biting anticipation that a team like TellTale manages to distill in its adventures. Let it be clear that this is a lack of perception, a consequence of having broken a linear plot into four parts, but if we add to this an above-average price for each chapter (3 for the first and 8 for each of the others on the App Store) few will find the right push to get to the end, also because for the characterization of the characters, dialogues and attention to the story we are faced with a product that timidly tries to emulate the exciting melodrama of Final Fantasy IV and VI, but which fails and instead expires in narrative banality in the weaker chapters. The same goes for the graphic component: the idea of drawing heavily from the 16bit era is absolutely interesting, but unfortunately Final Fantasy Dimensions proves to be neither fish nor fowl, proposing a graphic style that is more detailed than the raw one but charismatic of the NES episodes, but which at the same time is much poorer and less sophisticated than the pearls released on Super Nintendo. While turning a blind eye to how much the retro graphics clash with the high definition interface elements, the result is still a visually anonymous game, a clear imitation of the old school that however lacks a soul of its own. Heroic occupations However, where Final Fantasy Dimensions gives its best is in its evolved Job System, the class system that debuted in Final Fantasy III but which found excellence with the fifth chapter of the series. And it is from Final Fantasy V that Dimensions draws the most inspiration from this point of view: there are over fifteen classes, with each of the two groups of heroes having five exclusive ones available to unlock asas you continue the adventure. Each class has particular equipment and a unique skill set, and longtime fans will recognize a large number of classes, such as the Red Mage, Dragoon and Ninja. The ability to switch from one class to another by inheriting the skills of the previous one allows not only extensive customization of the party, but also has considerable strategic importance in sections where having, for example, a Monk or a White Mage in battle can prove to be fundamental . Just the management of the classes and the battles that can be faced with parties of up to five characters represent the most successful component of the Square-Enix JRPG, thanks also to a fairly high level of challenge and boss fights that require you to always find the right defensive strategy and offensive. The player is continually stimulated to continue and fight, and each battle is an excuse to upgrade your class and unlock new skills. The exploration of the world map, on the other hand, is anything but fun, not so much for the excessive random encounters, but rather for the possibility of choosing between three different control systems, one less successful than the other. If nothing else, this makes the fact that the game world can only be freely explored towards the end of the entire adventure less bitter, thus leaving out those who decide to stop at the first chapters and forcing them to follow fairly rigid tracks.", "date": "2012-09-26", "grade": "7.0"}
