Even if tactics have always played a key role in the various episodes released so far for home consoles and PCs, this time it's the only thing that matters in a title that requires careful planning of one's movements and the use of almost chess-like reasoning. Let's go see what it is. The assassin's move Hitman GO deserves to be awarded even if only for its very particular visual style which is inspired by the world of board games, starting with a chapter selection screen where these are represented as boxes of imaginary board games. The originality of such a solution is fully manifested during the actual gameplay phases, with scenarios that take the form of plasticky dioramas and characters reduced to very lucid pawns. Everything is obviously functional to a playful structure very close to the dynamics of the board game, moreover so intuitive as to not require any text input during the tutorial phase. The primary objective of each stage is to reach the finish line without being blocked by the enemies that populate the path, marked by special lines on the screen: you must therefore move Agent 47 from one box to another along these tracks, keeping in mind take into account the fact that with each movement of the protagonist, the opposing pawns perform a different action according to their category. There are therefore static guards, ready to shoot us down if we position ourselves in the space in front of them, patrolling soldiers who move following a predefined pattern, knife-wielding assassins who rotate 180 at each turn and so on, but such a variety of antagonists is not the only arrow in the bow of Hitman GO's brilliant level design. In fact, juxtaposed during the various stages there are other elements that increase the spectrum of tactical solutions available to the user: we pass from special boxes (plant pots to hide behind, stones to throw to distract the guards, communicating trapdoors), long-range weapons and even the disguises that have always been one of the hallmarks of Agent 47's modus operandi. In short, lots of irons on the fire for a strategic game that is simple in terms of mechanics but capable of keeping the interest alive from start to finish. Hitman GO wins big the bet to take Agent 47 out of his normal field of action Like many other similar titles, Hitman GO has three distinct objectives for each level, each of which allows you to earn a coat of arms that enriches a total necessary to unlock subsequent chapters. Beyond the mere act of reaching the finish line, such missions may require you to collect a briefcase along the way, finish the pattern within a limited number of moves, get to the end without killing anyone or conversely by taking out every single piece on the board from play. Since it is not always possible to obtain all three emblems in a single run, it is evident how Hitman GO stimulates replayability, also because the costs of unlocking the new chapters are high enough that they cannot be satisfied by a superficial game conduct. Therefore, it is difficult to be able to complete the Square Enix product in the very short term, much less if the aim is to obtain the maximum score in all levels, which will surely arouse the interest of lovers of the most difficult challenges. However, the developers wanted to give a loophole even to less involved users, granting five suggestions, each of which allows you to highlight the correct path for a given objective: once this bonus is exhausted, however, you have to put your wallet in your wallet if you want more help, buying three different types of packages or even spending the beauty of 13.99 Euros to make them usable at will. Square Enix is certainly not new to even rather questionable initiatives to monetize its mobile titles, and Hitman GO is no exception in this sense, presenting such an offer of in-app purchases despite an exit price that certainly cannot be defined as a budget compared to the standards we are used to dealing with. And perhaps the only limit of Hitman GO is that of a slightly too high cost, which for the rest proves to be a strategic one with all the credentials to conquer anyone who does not mind seeing Agent 47 in such a div dressers from what we have been accustomed to over the years.", "date": "2014-04-23", "grade": "8.4"}
