The name may be unknown to most, but it is to him that we owe gems of the caliber of Hidden & Dangerous and Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven, the first the perfect synthesis between Commandos, Rainbow Six and Ghost Recon, the second one of the open world narratively more accurate than ever, which still maintains all its dramatic force intact today despite the years that have passed since its launch. His is also Mafia II, a title with which he tried to free himself from the open world model as an amusement park imposed on the market by Grand Theft Auto, trying to keep the narrative focus pure, even if with poor results. In 2009, towards the end of Mafia II's development, Vvra decided to move away from his old studio, where he no longer had the freedom he desired, and began pitching Kingdom Come: Deliverance to various publishers, unfortunately without too successful. Finally he found a lender who allowed him to build a prototype and found his new studio, Warhorse (2011). A lot of water has passed under the bridge since then, including another, unsuccessful tour of the big publishers, despite the prototype and a fortunately successful Kickstarter campaign (2014), which finally allowed the game to become reality; not only thanks to the two million dollars raised, but also for showing that the public was interested in a similar title. The Middle Ages, the real one Kingdom Come: Deliverance tells the story of Henry, the son of a blacksmith in late fourteenth-century Bohemia. We are in the years of the Western Schism: Wenceslas IV, known as the Lazy, eldest son and successor of the beloved King Charles IV to the throne of Bohemia, was kidnapped by a conspiracy of nobles, tired of his conduct and his inability to govern . Sigismund of Hungary, to whom the nobles have turned to dethrone Wenceslaus, his half-brother, takes advantage of it to invade Bohemia with a large army, with which he does not hesitate to attack cities and villages, massacring their inhabitants. The village of Henry also ends up on his way, for events that will be explored in the course of the game, which he is not slow to put on fire. Even with great difficulty, the boy manages to escape, but his family and friends are mercilessly exterminated. In truth, the game begins a little before these tragic events, with what we can consider a long prologue in which to familiarize yourself with the character, with the various game systems and with the scenario. As soon as he wakes up, after a night of debauchery, Henry is called by his father who has tasks for him: to collect a part of the sword he is forging for the local lord and to buy coal with the money obtained from the collection of a debt. At first glance, the setting resembles that of any fantasy role-playing game, but that's just a mistake. Observing Henry's village carefully, we realize that the vaunted historical accuracy of the scenario is a concrete fact: the houses are bare, the furnishings are few, the streets are full of mud and manure, animals and inhabitants practically live together and, opening for example the chest of a drunkard, or a farmer, does not contain who knows what treasure, but only his work tools. Passing by the inn we can listen to the speeches of the inhabitants, related to the historical circumstances they are experiencing, and we can talk to some of them about local issues. Henry, despite wanting to travel the world, is a boy of his time: he likes girls, beer and raids with friends, but at the same time has a great sense of honor and religion, as well as a deep respect for hierarchy and authority. It will be up to the events that he will experience throughout the game to question some of these values (or even strengthen them, depending on the choices made by the player), but everything will be managed gradually and with great respect for the story. Without revealing too much, the very high level of writing of Kingdom Come: Deliverance should be emphasized, which remains accurate and descriptive even when dealing with seemingly trivial situations. Overall, the plot is not exceptional, but it doesn't matter, because in this case it is the substance that is excellent. For example, immediately after his escape, Henry had a dialogue with the wife of the lord of the castle where he was received, as well as his benefactress. It is an apparently insignificant moment, but exceptional in the way it is conducted. The noblewoman expresses to Henry all the frustration for the condition in which she finds herself (she is a young woman married to an infirm old man, from whom moreover she has been away for years), seeking comfort in theboy's despair. The dialogue is tense, highly erotic, while never explicitly talking about sex. The woman seems to want to get closer to Henry, but at the same time her role holds her back. In someone else's hands such a sequence would have turned into a sheepish moment with easy unglued lapels; instead the writers of Warhorse have opted for a more plausible approach, with a very awkward Henry who proves he doesn't understand the situation well (after all, in the prologue he was being arrogant, but he's a clean-shaven virgin) and the woman who can't take that step forward which it always seems about to do. The game is full of moments like this, in which unexpressed desires and social status collide, and the conclusion is not always what modern audiences might expect. That said, don't expect nobles who are always noble, or priests loyal to divine precepts, because this is not the case. However, each sequence is contextualized properly and never ends up resembling the outburst of a frustrated altar boy who curses and listens to metal music to fight guilt. The same missions are contextualized in the same way, so as to never be alien to each other or to Henry himself. In the early stages of the game, don't expect anything too complex, since the non-player characters tend to assign him very direct tasks. When Henry has improved his status and some particular events have happened, the side missions will also become slightly more complex as a result, consequently asking more of the player. In general, however, all missions allow a certain freedom of approach, even if some fixed objectives are unavoidable. Codex issues If you were intimidated by too much historical accuracy of the scenario or by the risk of misunderstanding too much of what happens in Kingdom Come: Deliverance, don't worry, because Warhorse has inserted directly into the game a rich encyclopedia that explains in detail the various aspects of life in the Middle Ages. It consists of dozens of entries that provide valuable and very interesting information, regardless of the game itself. Game systems: some work, others less If from a narrative point of view we have little objection to the work done by Vvra and associates, unfortunately some game mechanics really made us turn up our noses. Let's specify: we tried Kingdom Come: Deliverance both with mouse and keyboard, and with a controller (the standard Xbox One model): in both cases there were some aspects that made us sick. In particular, the systems of burglary and pickpocketing are the worst we have ever tried lately. Let's take burglary: to open locked doors or chests, you need to keep a lockpick in a certain position by rotating it together with the lock. Easy to say, too bad the rotation of the lock is either too slow (controller) or incredibly fast (mouse and keyboard). By calculating how much lock picks cost and how easily they break, even with ~easy~ and ~very easy~ level locks, you will understand that in the early stages of the game, picking can be a real agony. With the growth of the character, which we will talk about later, and with practice, the situation becomes easier, also because it is possible to develop skills that help a lot, but in the first few hours, becoming a thief is very risky (when a lock pick breaks, you noise). The same goes, if not worse, for pickpocketing, an all too cumbersome operation, which requires reaching behind the victim without being seen (and up to here), then slipping your hand into his pocket by selecting an active slot from a wheel in which you find an object of uncertain value. Hopefully you can get away with something, but if you get it wrong (and it happens very often, at least until you've become a master thief) you end up being branded a criminal and chased by the guards. Since the loot is rarely worth the risk, becoming a pickpocket in Kingdom Come: Deliverance really means wanting to stick, even if it must be admitted that practice helps and, above all, that each additional skill allows you to face missions and situations in a different way. Of our own we soon abandoned the career of thieves, to focus on the art of oratory, which still offers some interesting aspects to the game and works much better. Basically Kingdom Come: Deliverance offers simple multiple choice dialogues, but by increasing oratory, charisma and intimidation, you can unlock more choices which, obviously, allow you to get more or less from a certain character. Also the dialogues are influenced by many external factors, which make the whole system even more interesting: for example, the rank of the character you talk to matters a lot, but also the quality of the clothes worn, their cleanliness and Henry's criminal record. In short, a notorious thief wearing dirty clothes is less convincing than a soldier wearing impeccable armor, at least in a certain environment. For this reason, in Kingdom Come: Deliverance it is very important to take advantage of local services such as the toilets, which allow you to clean up, and it is necessary not to go around dressed like beggars... unless you want to play exactly in this way (it is possible ), unlocking among other things a whole series of really interesting sub-missions. Since we mentioned it, let's talk about Henry's growth system. As you may have understood by reading up to here, it is not possible to create a character from scratch. On the other hand though, Henry can be developed however you want. To do this, there are two systems that proceed in parallel: perform a certain action often and assign the points that are obtained to the many skills available. Of the latter there are so many that someone could be dazed, also because there are truly original ones. For one thing, think that you can choose to have more charisma with women by wearing lived-in clothes, or you can decide to be more at ease talking to the nobles than with the common people. Don't worry, because the skills are all explained in the game and there are few that are difficult to understand, at least conceptually. The combat system: love and hate It is right to dedicate a separate paragraph to the combat system, because it has been one of the most debated aspects of Kingdom Come: Deliverance since the first alpha version was released. In general, the mechanics have remained the same: with one button you can swing, while with another you can give a jab. You can also combine the two attacks to do more damage and block opponents' blows. Henry's effectiveness in combat depends on a multitude of different factors: strength, weapon weight, use of a shield, unlocked skills, current status, open wounds, and more. For example, know that eating is good, because it satisfies Henry and makes him stronger, but eating too much can cause him severe indigestion, which makes him more clumsy and clumsy. The same goes for alcohol: a good glass improves oratory and makes you happier, too many glasses completely blur the view, making it difficult to identify opponents. In general, it seemed to us that the combat system follows the grammar of the rest of the game, which is that it tries to be realistic and realistic, avoiding any possible exaggeration. In Kingdom Come: Deliverance, fighting is complicated and dealing with multiple opponents is always a risk. Someone, accustomed to simpler and more direct systems, will find the combat too wooden, but we consider it a precise stylistic choice, which is well linked to the rest of the game. Honestly, a Henry who brings blows in bursts, after rolling to dodge the blows of his opponents, we just wouldn't see him well. Surely the game would gain in dynamism, but the setting would lose a lot of it as a whole. In particular, we think of some advanced stages in which strongholds must be besieged and the clashes are on a larger scale. Here, in these junctures Kingdom Come: Deliverance manages to make better than any other game the sensations you had to experience on the battlefields, with slow advances and battles played not only on brute strength and swordsmanship, but also on the cunning. That said, a little more physicality on impacts wouldn't have hurt, as well as a greater general cleaning. Particularly in fisticuffs, collisions are literally evanescent. Probably this aspect would have needed a few more weeks to be properly refined. Hopefully it's improved with some post-launch patches. Patch or no patch Note for the curious: we tried the game with the maxi launch patch already applied, which was actually released several days ago. Notes As you may have understood, Kingdom Come: Deliverance is a very vast title, approachable in many ways and with a very large number of systems to consider. In addition to those described, there are other very important ones such as the beautiful game map, useful for knowing where to go on foot or for using the fast travel system; such as mounts, useful for speeding up travel and simulated in a truly convincing way; such as the management of physiological needs the Henrys, i.e. hunger and thirst; like the cure system, based on recovery through", "date": "2018-02-13", "grade": "8.9"}
