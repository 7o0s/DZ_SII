But we will not be able to exempt ourselves, for reasons that you will soon see, from more general considerations of an economic and almost ~philosophical~ nature (philosophy of the videogame market, of course), which make the drafting of the piece a little more complicated than we expected at the beginning . But let's go in order and see what kind of ropes we are ordered to cut... Om Nom, Om Nom, Om Nom... The game opens with a very short and nice cut scene: a mysterious box is delivered to the home of an unknown character, who can be assumed to be the player, who opening it finds a very tender... ~thing~ (we really don't know how another to define it!) green with an irresistible face, which responds to the vaguely mystical name of Om Nom. Om Nom is very greedy for sweets, and right from the label printed on the box he will constantly ask his new master for some; there is, however, a problem: the sweet is found in the box, but tied to a rope which is in turn tied to a pin. Now, passing over the fact that every time we manage to give the little creature its coveted prize, when we reopen the box the situation has completely changed and there is a new candy, new strings and new gadgets arranged in a completely different way (it's the surreal way of Chillingo to represent a new level), what we have to do is simply exploit the elementary concepts of physics such as the force of gravity and the pendulum effect to ensure that the little monster, which will not deign to move even a little if not to open his mouth wide, be properly fed. Obviously, if the game were limited to this, it wouldn't even be a game: a minimum of reasoning would be enough to understand which strings to cut and when (for example, if Om Nom is immediately under the sweet, the string must be cut when it is still, if instead is not in axis, you have to do it first in order to exploit the inertia of the pendulum effect); that is why in each level there are three stars, and the player must make sure that the cookie (or candy, or whatever) passes through at least one of these before coming into contact with Om Nom's sharp canines to be able to play the next level. The more stars you collect, and not only does your score increase, but there is the possibility of opening another four boxes: each box is nothing more than a ~world~ made up of 25 levels (for a total of 125) of difficulty and, dare we say, growing evil. In fact, elements such as bubbles which push the sweet upwards, ropes which tie it automatically as soon as it passes near them, spikes which destroy it, air pumps which, activated by the player (with very comic effect sound), push it in another direction and so on, elements which greatly increase the complexity compared to the very simple basic concept, with a consequent exponential increase in the challenge, reasoning skills and reflexes required of the player and, in ultimately, fun. Finest pastry Cut the Rope is the quintessence of ~mobile casual gaming~ as it has established itself in recent years above all thanks to the proliferation of Apple devices: it is a product without too many frills but absolutely engaging and exciting, which tests the intelligence and hand-eye coordination of the player, and whose structure is perfect for use on the fly, in those five-minute break from work or study, or when bored during a trip. It is also a title that can be difficult but never frustrating, and above all graphics and sound, although very simple, are well made, in the name of freshness and sympathy; also noteworthy, and functional to the gameplay, is the implementation of some laws of physics, and it doesn't matter if, once 100% completed, the lack of multiplayer doesn't give reasons for replayability. At 79 cents, less than the price of an espresso at the bar, it would be a crime to let it slip even by those with very different videogame tastes. Unfortunately, however, Cut the Rope does cost 79 cents, but on the App Store: on DSiWare the price increases up to the figure of 5 Euros, ie more than fivefold. It is true that it is a price in line with the other offers that we find on the Nintendo Shop, and the quality that we are faced with is higher than the average of the competition, nevertheless we cannot help but show some disappointment in the face of such a difference: Why does a Nintendo user have to pay over five times the original price for a game that, e.gWhat's more, today on the App Store, at the same launch cost, is it updated to version 1.4 and has reached 200 levels (almost double those found on DSiWare)? One of the strengths of this type of application lies precisely in the negligible price; if this fails, then part of the attraction is also lost. Clearly what we are hinting at here is too long and complex a discussion to be duly gutted in a review, but it is also the reason why, while at the time the iOS version got a high-sounding but very right 9, the DSiWare version gets a somewhat lower vote, even though it stood well above the sufficiency due to its undoubted merits.", "date": "2011-10-10", "grade": "6.5"}
