Many have tried Age of Conan, many are trying Aion but almost all remain firmly anchored to the Blizzard title. Yet the idea remains strong that the large number of players who continue to look around allows ample room for maneuver around the Blizzard-branded giant. Turbine tries once again to exploit this space without abandoning D&D but reformulating the offer according to the trend of microtransactions that has recently invested the videogame entertainment world. Beta finished? Infinite beta! In practical terms Dungeons & Dragons Online Eberron Unlimited (and let's hope they don't add more titles with each patch) is an almost completely usable final beta without limits after a simple installation. To complete the gaming experience there are two options: the usual monthly payment or the direct purchase of objects, instances, races and classes. Monaco, Favored Soul, Drow and Warforged, for example, are blocked for those who do not pay the subscription, can be used freely as long as the subscription is paid and are unlocked forever if purchased directly. The blocks of adventures that include missions, instances and rewards work the same way. Performance in mixed areas collapses inexorably The basic idea isn't a bad one. Those who don't use the new races or have yet to face the first quests don't have to pay the subscription and can play for free until they decide whether to subscribe or buy the adventure packs one at a time, paying only for what they want to play. We still cannot say whether it is a winning choice and even if the population of Eberron Unlimited has already grown, it is said that the share of paying users will not grow. But it could work, especially thanks to that part of the user who doesn't have the time or desire to keep up with a continuous experience but doesn't mind spending a few euros to try out a character or an adventure. The one sure thing is that in the case of online D&D this approach doesn't help the hardcore side of the game. In fact, the DDO store not only allows you to unlock the contents but also allows you to simplify, and not a little, the gaming experience. The facilities due to the possibility of having potions, weapons, teleporters and as many as five bodyguards at any time against the single one of the free version make the title much simpler for those who have no scruples and have the opportunity to spend money. Of course there is no PvP and therefore there is nothing that risks being unbalanced and D&D online remains an experience to be faced alone or with a small circle of companions. But in this way the challenge against the high-level instances disappears completely. Turbine Shop Points To buy items, the current currency of Dungeons & Dragons Online Eberron Unlimited is made up of Turbine Shop Points which can be unlocked for a fee or by converting the favor points earned by completing missions. All the favor points of an account can be used on any of the characters it contains and it is possible to dedicate one of the two free slots to create a new character from time to time and collect favor points from the simplest missions. However, there are a number of bonuses for those who are subscribers and have followed the Eberron Unlimited beta. You get 400 Turbine Shop Points with less than one year of active subscription, 900 with over one year, 1500 points with over two years. 999 points are added for those who were season ticket holders on 31 July 2009, 250 points for those who participated in the beta, 250 points for those who used the store during the beta and every month subscribers get 500 points. Beyond paper Not that the absence of PvP is a point in favor of an MMORPG, but we must consider that D&D already tries to mix multiplayer and single player modes in the same experience and does so by keeping almost all the paper part of D&D 3.5. A world made up of skills, characteristics and dice rolls that unfortunately doesn't go particularly well with real-time combat where most of these values are not applied and where, unfortunately, the wild click frenzy dominates. Clashes and spells are still varied and manageable even if the area spells are not very precise and here and there the monsters interpenetrate, fit together or suddenly appear behind us not because they are stealthy but because the spawn is rather badly made. However, from the creation of the card to the use of skills, Eberron Unlimited embodies the 3.5 edition of Dungeons & Dragons and it is no coincidence that the entire gaming experience is made up of instantsze, separately generated zones that exist only for a certain adventure and for a certain group. Indeed, D&D offers puzzles, collapsing floors, inns under siege and a series of events that are only possible thanks to this formula. Each new adventure pack obviously includes a series of dynamic quests and everything is brought to the highest level of difficulty, facilities excluded, given that we now have all 20 classic Dungeons & Dragons levels available, all spells and 96 ranks, 5 per level except the twentieth, which allow you to have a monstrous number of talents. Engine performance is still excellent. Vegetation, global illumination, reflections and shadows in real time are not a walk to manage when it comes to MMORPGs. In short, what at the time was a graphic orgy, obviously allowed by the completely instantaneous nature of the title, still resists age. Sure some areas, especially within the dungeons, are flat and the environment is rather angular in relation to today's possibilities, but Korthos, the birth area, is full of vegetation, monsters and non-player characters. The environments are still suggestive Unfortunately, to maintain the graphic rendering without affecting the hardware requirements, the island of Korthos was created as a giant instance which contains the accesses for the smaller instances and a series of quests for newbies that lead us to explore the whole island alone or exclusively accompanied by those who are part of our group. The only mixed area is the village and when it is populated by many players the performance collapses inexorably. We go from the 300 frames of the instances to the 75 of the island and we arrive at a measly 27. Very few with a GTX 275.", "date": "2009-10-21", "grade": "7.8"}
