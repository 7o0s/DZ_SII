{"name": "Super Dodge Ball Advance", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/super-dodge-ball-advance.html", "text": "Now, directly from my personal gaming experience, an examination of the Dodge Ball rules will follow, as I have understood (and perhaps misunderstood) them. Two teams of beardless semi-deformed pseudo-adolescents face off on a pitch equally divided between them (the territory of one is forbidden to the other). Each formation consists of seven elements: four on the pitch and three around the opponent's area. Basically, the game consists of kicking each other (and alternately) in the face until one of the two teams capitulates; this happens when all its members have exhausted their energy (displayed by a very common bar placed above everyone's head). During the action we will be able to command only one of our players at a time allowing him to pass the ball to a partner or make a shot. The latter can be carried in two ways, to cause damage of varying magnitude to the opponent: normal (causes little damage) or special (to devastate the enemy front cheerfully and casually). These special shots have been inserted by the programmers in a large number and can be performed by combining jumps and passages in a certain sequence, from which they will spring; obviously the most dangerous shots are also the most complex ones to execute. In reality, their execution can take place in a completely random and confused way, therefore we will hardly be able to decide or understand which attack to launch; however, once two or three sequences have been memorized, those will be sufficient for our purposes. In this regard, if you feel like it, you can consult the infamous, and denigrated, accompanying manual to find out how many and which secret techniques your team includes. Unfortunately, few, very vague indications are provided to try to determine from their name the exact sequence to be followed to produce them. However, using these special techniques seems to work well to our advantage (even in total chaos), to our amazement. I'll give you a tip: if you learn to intercept opponents' shots well, you won't have anything to fear and the match will always be downhill for you; it's all about taking the right time to catch the ball in reception so as to neutralize the opponent's attack. Technically the game looks good. The controls are precise and functional and as regards graphics and sound we can be satisfied. The graphics are clean, fluid and colorful, the animations of the characters are a bit jerky, but their characterization is quite convincing and nice (appearance and clothing are numerous and varied). The backgrounds are made with a couple of parallax planes, to give the right spatial effect in horizontal scrolling. Unfortunately the arenas are very small in number and all sadly inanimate. The sound is mediocre, but it diligently performs its function of accompanying the action with good effects and a single happy, redundant, but never annoying musical theme. 6 Pros: Easy to understand controls Successful characterization Can be entertaining Cons: Single player longevity at historic lows Lacks bite 1 The Dodge Ball, for English speakers, is the equivalent of our Poison Ball and the purpose of this game is to emulate its rules, atmosphere and fun. I start by ignoring or not remembering the slightest rule of the aforementioned game, if it ever had any, despite having cheered up - I remember - distant, childish afternoons. So, strengthened by my ignorance, I jumped directly on the cartridge, skimming the accompanying manual beautifully, to experience the intuitiveness of this piece of simulated entertainment developed by Atlus. I must say that I was satisfied with the work done; the controls of the GBA are known to be few and therefore although there are different combinations or double functions of the keys, everything is easy to access and quick to understand and memorize. The main menu offers items common to almost all sports video games; leaving aside what concerns the obvious configuration submenu, we will talk about the three types of game available: Championship, Exhibition and Versus. In the first we will have the opportunity to create our own team (or choose one from the ~pre-packaged~ ones) and make it progress in the Dodge Ball championship. Having reached the top of the world championship, thanks to the victories over the best placed teams, we will necessarily have to challenge (slength of three rounds) a sort of Dodge Ball Dream Team to conquer the World Cup. At the end of the Championship, its replacement and, unreasonably, more difficult version, called the Special Championship, is unlocked. According to the developers, this should represent a more demanding version to complete than the previous one, but in reality it requires less time and effort, thanks to the experience already accumulated in the ~smooth~ Championship. Finishing the game in single, even starting from scratch and without even having read the manual, will take about an hour and a half, at most two. Demeaning, no doubt! Of course, the Exhibition mode always remains, to make up the number of course. Clearly the Versus mode should elevate the title's otherwise non-existent longevity; pity that to enjoy the challenges in multiplayer (two at most) you need a cartridge each. However, it is true that these statements relate to the difficulty level pre-set by the manufacturer and that by raising the five parameters of the configuration menu, you can have a more exciting and lasting game challenge, to the point of frustration. Personally I am against the possibility of varying the level of difficulty in a video game and I consider this a gimmick that developers use to make up for their inability to arrange a linear and stimulating learning curve. In sports video games, however, providing game parameters customization seems to be the only method to satisfy everyone's abilities and to increase the longevity of the title.", "date": "2002-01-21", "grade": null}
