{"name": "Infinite Undiscovery - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/infinite-undiscovery-recensione.html", "text": "The story of a planet and its moon The background on which the events of Infinite Undiscovery develop is that of a planet where the influence of its moon is fundamental for the life of the population. The natural satellite is in fact the bearer of numerous influences on humanity which can enjoy its beneficial effects. The story focuses entirely on the fight against the Order of Chains, a dark military organization that has literally chained the moon to take possession of its powers. In the game you play the role of a simple flautist named Capell (protagonist very little charismatic) imprisoned by the Order due to the exceptional resemblance to the leader of the resistance Lord Sigmund. And it is precisely around this exchange of persons that the adventure develops that will lead the young man first to join the rebels against his will (whose members will be used to compose the parties) and subsequently to have an increasingly decisive role in the fate of the war . The narration is pleasant, it stands up without problems and pleasantly accompanies the player without ever degenerating even if it only takes off with the second DVD where there are twists absent in the first part of the game, a trend that seems common to all Japanese productions multi disc. The only thing that clashes is the bad acting of the characters in the numerous, but short, cut scenes that he never manages to convince and which often ends in the ridiculous, also thanks to a far from satisfactory English dubbing - and given the absence of any localization in Italian it would be legitimate to expect greater care. Lots of action and little RPG UI presents a mixed structure between the action and the classic RPG. The role-playing component is rich in content and is well developed: there will be statistics, customizable equipment with numerous objects and attack skills for each character which will gradually become more and more differentiated. The player is offered considerable freedom of customization and by multiplying everything for each member of the party you will find yourself faced with a more than considerable amount of options to manage. Alongside this classic jrpg soul there is a strictly real-time fight management, where the turns give way to clashes with monsters that are always visible on the play area to be faced with combos and spells. It is this action inclination to be predominant: the combat system is based on the use of the A and B keys which are respectively intended for the fast attack and the strong one to be chained to give life to the combos, the latter however are few and trivial and this represents a serious limit for a game so focused on the dynamism of the clashes and without a doubt this aspect could have been developed with greater care. Trying to make the combat system more profound is the Connect System thanks to which it is possible to connect a party member to Capell being able in this way to recall the ally's attack skills using the X and Y keys, these will sometimes be essential to overcome specific phases of the game. A further strategic component is given by the possibility of modifying the behavior of the group: with the use of the directional cross you are able to choose between various commands such as ~wait~, ~disperse~ or you can push all the companions to fight against your own enemy (useful for creating devastating combos). What is perplexing is that in the long run the fights are resolved in a wild button smashing, leaving every strategic component in the background and making the battles too chaotic. Such a big map One of the most important aspects of UI is certainly the vastness of the game areas. Players who live on bread and exploration will be happy because the tri-Ace title offers large spaces in which to move freely. The design of the world does not make you cry out for a miracle, it is often anonymous and uninspired, but it does its job well, offering from time to time some pleasant glimpses of the landscape, with an appreciable variety in the settings to visit. There are also numerous cities, villages and camps where it is possible to find refreshment after a long migration from one area to another. Even the creation of the dungeons defends itself well by never presenting a too dispersive or unnerving structure, the only note is that the monotony perceptible in the external spaces reappears here with greater force and those anonymous corridors inevitably tend to look alike. Such a big map Unreal Undiscovery The entire graphic sector of UI is totally managed by the Unreal Engine that has been able to give so many joys to Xbox users. Unfortunately tri-Ace has not been able to exploit the potential of the mEpic engine, and the technical inadequacy of the UI immediately catches the eye: the number of polygons on the screen is far from impressive, above all the creation of the characters is crude and sadly reminiscent of a last generation product with the benefit of high definition. So much so that players who do not use an HD panel will hardly feel a concrete generational leap. Even the rendering of the external environments is not excellent and, in the face of a discreet vastness of the same, a strong sense of emptiness is contrasted, with areas that are a bit bare and without elements of interaction, textures are fluctuating and too often poorly defined. The same goes for the interiors which tend towards obsessive repetition and where the few ornaments are spartan. Even the combat phases show the side to annoying imperfections such as a frame rate so unstable as to lead to momentary freezes of the image in the most agitated action situations, even the camera once hooked on an enemy often suffers from defaiance that bring the target out from the field of view. Furthermore, the frenzy of the clashes, combined with the use of too invasive light effects, makes the battles confusing in the eyes of the player. The soundtrack on the contrary has no particular weaknesses, fits perfectly with the settings and never gets tired (which is no small thing). The game is exclusively in English both as regards the dubbing and for the texts on the video, including the subtitles, but it will hardly embarrass those who have just a minimum of knowledge of the English language despite the use of some jargon. Comment Infinite Undiscovery is a product full of good ideas with a distinctly action soul set in a role-playing outline of the Japanese tradition. What is missing is an adequate development of these promising ideas that only end up being implemented in an approximate way, such as the too limited and flat combat system. It's a shame because the foundations of the game are solid and certainly deserved to be explored with greater care, especially given the illustrious tri-Ace curriculum. There is therefore the feeling of being faced with a partially missed opportunity, and certainly not a total failure, mainly derived from the lack of a well-defined identity of the title. This does not mean that lovers of the genre, who in this lean period find themselves abstinent from jrpg, can certainly consider buying as long as they do not give too much weight to these gaps and to a somewhat subdued technical sector. above all considering the standards to which the Microsoft machine has accustomed its users. Pros enjoyable and well-told story numerous customization options for RPG lovers interesting diversion action... Cons ...but chaotic and repetitive combat system technically not up to par Xbox 360 - Goals Infinite Undiscovery also confirms the little propensity of JRPGs to easily release gamer points. By finishing the game without tackling the various side quests, it is difficult to reach the 200 points unlocked. Other points can be obtained by focusing on the growth of the characters or by carrying out particular actions during the adventure.", "date": "2008-10-07", "grade": null}
