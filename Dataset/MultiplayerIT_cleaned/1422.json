{"name": "Robocop", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/robocop.html", "text": "Dead or alive, you'll come with me! After the dutiful cinematic introduction, let's move on to the most congenial sector for us, the videogame one. It goes without saying that in this field a plot like that of Robocop immediately presented a natural playful predisposition, so much so that the first conversion was released on the Commodore 64 by Ocean, enjoying a resounding success. Now times have changed slightly, especially when we talk about fps, the genre chosen by Titus Interactive for this new incarnation of Agent Murphy. To the youngest of you the house of the fox will not say much, but the veterans will certainly remember its long activity, since the distant 85, and its not exactly transcendental titles. We immediately anticipate that Robocop is not destined to reverse the trend, quite the contrary. The softhouse has tried to adapt the feeling of the original film to the (truly basic) canons of the genre, but the results, as we will see later, are disastrous. From the outset, the game tries to do its utmost in the slavish emulation of the world of Robocop, with an interface with greenish tones that mimics the film, but which is immediately coarse and far from the visual approach conferred by Verhoeven. The inclusion of the notorious commercials makes waiting for the uploads less tedious, certainly not among the fastest considering the help of the hd. The plot does not shine for originality, Robocop will have to restore order in the various sectors of the city, facing 9 missions characterized by different objectives reported by the police station. Protect the innocent After the usual programming in the criminal database, the title quickly puts us in the role of the superpoliceman, enclosed in his bulky armor and forced to wander with pachydermic pace through the city streets, toxic dumps and all the scenarios seen in the film. All this always at the mercy of the offensive action of tough criminals armed to the teeth, and relentless snipers. The feeling immediately arises that something is not going as it should, especially remembering the heights reached by Halo, Metroid Prime and all new generation products. Robocop is immediately inadequate, outdated, barely bearable even for the most radical fans of the saga. There are some pleasant details that help the likelihood, such as the interface with an automatic pointing system and the inhibition of the management software following actions excluded from the behavioral protocol, but also unforgivable absences such as that of the famous original soundtrack, replaced by poor electronic arrangements. As already mentioned, the central will provide continuous in-game support to update the fulfillment of the objectives, especially those concerning the outlaws. This means that it will be necessary to proceed with the arrests of the individuals reported by the police archive, without resorting to extreme punitive gestures (ergo, you will not have to kill them). Undoubtedly one of the very few appreciable elements, since it introduces a minimal strategic nuance: the criminals who decide to surrender throw their weapons by raising their hands, at which point the player will have to make the arrest, taking care not to kill them, the same goes for unsuspecting passers-by. It is possible to save the game situation only at the end of the mission, a bad choice, even if it finds a perverse logic in the presence of few levels available. The defect is even more aggravated by the poor balance of the difficulty curve, which holds decently only in the first levels: Murphy's armor is able to absorb a good number of bullets, and can be repaired after finding special healing items, but just progress through the game to find yourself definitively on the ground under fire from heavy weapons. Robocop can only respond to these with its meager war paraphernalia, which in most cases takes the form of the famous submachine gun from the film. The result is very frustrating, especially at the thought of repeating an almost completed level in its entirety. Producing a title inspired by an eighties film does not imply that you also have to go through the mechanics of the games of those times. Part man, part machine, all cop Technically the situation is no longer comforting: the graphics engine immediately stands out in its childishness, with a rather embarrassing polygonal counting that manifests itself primarily on Robocop itself. Fortunately, we ~admire~ our alter-ego only in the mission preparation cuts, but unfortunately we cannot say the same about the enemies, who are always visiblein their disheartening graphic rendering. The characterization has also undergone an excessively comic restyling, with rough and unrealistic characters in their accentuated roundness, while the vaguely dark colors of a cyberpunk setting are appropriate. Regardless of these considerations, the most worrying factor concerns the framerate, calibrated on highly unstable 60fps, which undergo fearful drops in conjunction with agitated actions, seriously compromising playability. Finally, the tedious voice of the police commander is unbearable, who continuously hammers the player until the various objectives are met. Comment Robocop is a loud fiasco, a completely failed attempt to revive the famous character of the film in 3D. There is not a single positive factor that lifts the work from mediocrity, if we exclude very weak elements that could attract the most ardent fans, but for how long? One wonders who makes us do it, with much more deserving works around like Halo & company. A technical realization that absolutely does not exploit the characteristics of the Microsoft console, the rudimentary play setting and a bad calibration of the difficulty, are all defects that inexorably define the identity of a tie-in to be forgotten quickly. And we cannot hide our disappointment at finding a historic softhouse like Titus clearly out of step with the times. Nostalgics would do well to fish out the celluloid version. Pros It's a video game based on Robocop Acceptable in the first half hour Graphic engine at 60fps Cons: Highly unstable Too far behind the competition Difficulty poorly balanced It was 1987 when Paul Verhoeven brought the character of Robocop to the cinemas: fast, clumsy and implacable robot-policeman, made from the remains of an agent brutally killed by a criminal gang. Under the guise of a big-grain fantasy urban cartoon, seasoned with shootings and ultra-violence, was hidden a work not without psychological implications and a disenchanted cynicism. The description of a civilization corrupted and annihilated by consumerism (continuously highlighted by ridiculous commercials), the rampant crime, the awakening of human feeling in the body of the machine and the consequent contrast between instinct and duty, were all elements brilliantly brought into focus by the director. But most of all the iconographic elements of the work have entered the collective memory, from the protagonist himself to his natural nemesis, the mammoth robot ED-209.", "date": "2004-01-07", "grade": null}
