First of all, a series of missions with a very gentle learning curve will give us the opportunity to become familiar with the controls, and it is certainly not an unimportant phase. In fact, following a meteorite can be simple because with an interception command the spacecraft move by themselves, but in the meantime we have the possibility to rotate, zoom, hit the targets. The feeling of mastery at the end is a fundamental contribution to the success of the missions, and in the most lively clashes it is always important to be able to get ~on the bomb~ by recovering the perfect view for the clash. We were saying, introductory missions. But also the climb of a career. In the group of your fighters there will be protagonists who will act as team leaders, and will be able to bring their experience in their fields to improve units, increase research capacity for spy weapons, etc. It's easy to understand its tactical importance, so during the campaign you will be asked from time to time who you want to take with you and who you want to put on ~layoff~ instead, giving a personalized touch to the style of gameplay you prefer. Although obviously we are not talking about radical changes, it is still a pleasant thing. SO MANY BEAUTIFUL LIGHTS, WHERE DO I START? Take a look at the planets of your system: they are also an important manifestation of the prosperity of your race, indeed... they are the essential manpower for the construction of the armed forces and obviously for research and development. Through a slide you can decide how much percentage of the population will be dedicated to construction, sacrificing research. A useful system in case we need to reorganize quickly to defend ourselves from an attack or to bring the army to a sufficient number of shuttles to launch the winning attack. Speaking of shuttles, it should be specified that they move in groups, under the command of a captain, so no wild clicks to recover the sheep lost in the cosmos. Even among the construction options of the new shuttles, there is a convenient command to replenish the total team of the number of shuttles lost in battle, speeding up times and maintaining the balance of forces. To obtain the necessary funds, you will have to place a mining station on an asteroid, and take care that it is not attacked by the enemy (excellent strategy to leave you without funds) especially because there are no deposits like popcorn and some reside in locations often ~ at the border of a battle zonedamn it. SO MANY BEAUTIFUL LIGHTS, WHERE DO I START? To make sure we don't leave our pens and to make our race prosper, we will also have to dedicate ourselves to research. In the specific screen we have available all the fields in which it is possible to concentrate the efforts of our scientific departments. For example, we will be able to upgrade our fleet, with ever more powerful weapons and stronger shields. More performing engines and more aerodynamic hulls, all with the effect documented with a handy tooltip. Among other things we have the opportunity to integrate an espionage system, which allows us to obtain otherwise inaccessible confidential information. I also often use the star map, which in my opinion is essential for the success of the clashes. Often the most important orders are given from here, and then moved back to the normal view to better savor the events. Attention, this is not a passive assistance, you will always have to keep an eye on how things are going and intervene actively, for example by ordering your corvette to direct powerful missiles towards the enemy's hull, while the fighter flock could devote itself to hit the weapons, leaving him defenseless! The firepower of the ships is also reflected in the size! Try throwing ten fighters into the fray against a Mars mothership, and tell me if in a few moments they are not incinerated by turret fire. In some cases you really need to attack en masse and increase numbers. And if the clashes go well, the units also level up! As you can see, the game solutions are gradually expanding during the course of history, and if you consider the always hovering presence of the mysterious aliens ~that pull the strings~ A LOOK TOWARDS THE FUTURE WITH AN EYE TOWARDS THE PAST The time has come to take stock of Heagemonia. My opinion can only be positive, but if not a comparison, at least a comparison with what is currently still in everyone's hearts as the king of ~360 degree~ space RTS or Homeworld is urgently needed. Definitely haegemonia does not invent anything new when it is presented to us, it simply chooses to re-propose different formulas of impact that were revolutionary in the times of Homeworld and which are now a high quality standard in the best possible way for what are modern times: to offer a incomparable graphic show. Something that on the one hand is to be criticized and on the other to be praised. The units differ aesthetically in few respects, except for size. For example, Earth and Mars have different color trails to distinguish them, but I've often seen aesthetically identical corvettes. A LOOK TOWARDS THE FUTURE WITH AN EYE TOWARDS THE PAST The reverse of the coin is that realism benefits from it, because everything acquires a more metallic, less toyy look, something that Homeworld has left imprinted in my memory, where some color combinations reminded me of the cheerful Maya the Bee. Wanting to see, the release of Homeworld 2 is not that close, so I don't see the reason to skip a genuine and at the same time sophisticated product like Haegemonia. Clearly for some it will be a deja-vu, due to the exodus in search of new worlds, but isn't this how we will continue our story? I hope for Mother Earth that this is not the case, but it is not a hypothesis that I feel like ruling out. Good taste in doing things transpires from this work of ingenuity and it is undeniable that it is a valid product from many points of view. If you are not ideological purists and fanatics of innovation at all costs, but you love having a good game that entertains you, that knows how to squeeze your computer properly by giving you hours of passionate events.. well, then you fall into the category of officially licensed gamers. Haegemonia-addicted! ARE YOU PUTTING ON YOUR HEALTH T-SHIRT? Here we go again. Today we'll put on our spacesuits, run straight to the hangar and after a few communications to the control tower, we'll take off from the hangar and jet off into the cosmos! Ok, for starters relax and find the inner calm to deal with flocks of ships and furious battles, but also with exploration and an eye on the progress of your economy. Perfect, let's get started!", "date": "2002-11-20", "grade": null}
