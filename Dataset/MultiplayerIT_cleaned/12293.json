Developed by the unknown Sandlot Games team, Earth Defense Force 2017 starts from the most banal and obvious assumption possible; The year is 2017, and our beloved planet Earth has been attacked and invaded by an alien race that is anything but friendly. To respond to the threat it was decided to set up a group of soldiers, precisely the Earth Defense Force, with the specific task of saving humanity from forced extinction. With all the military technology that will probably be available in 2017, this kind of futuristic Brancaleone army can however only count on its own legs, as well as on some well-matched firearms. In fact, most of the time is spent under the command of an anonymous hero, running without a moment's break from one end of the settings to the other and chasing everything that moves. If this is already paradoxical, the appearance of the invading aliens is even more paradoxical; huge ants thirsty for human blood or jumping spiders, obviously filled with liters of green liquid, but flanked by more traditional huge robots, flying spaceships, UFOs and so on. The gameplay? Shoot, shoot and shoot. An ~old school~ mechanic in the best sense therefore; just choose the 2 weapons to take with you from a list destined to grow slowly, and which can include grenades, rockets, shotguns, machine guns, flamethrowers, missiles and so on. One look at the text introduction to the mission and off you go into the heart of the action. The controls are hyper-simplified; left analog to move, one button to shoot, one to switch weapons and another to jump. That's all. The rest lies only in the player's ability to eliminate every single alien, without worrying about anything else; on the contrary, the destruction of the setting is favored by the fact that a single rocket is enough to make any building, even the tallest, collapse into a pile of rubble. Each of the 53 missions can be played at 5 difficulty levels; every time one completes one, the protagonist gets an increase in the maximum energy level and in some cases a new weapon is unlocked (of the approximately 150 available in total). This element brings with it the only minimally strategic aspect of Earth Defense Force 2017, or the need to choose a pair of weapons that are minimally compatible with what will actually happen on the combat field; as if to say, if you have to deal with flying saucers, the shotgun is not ideal... In some situations, the D3 production also allows you to take command of some vehicles, in detail a helicopter, a metal exoskeleton, a tank and a hoverbike. Unfortunately the control system has not been refined enough to provide a satisfactory experience in these situations, thus making them little more than not very pleasant parentheses. They come out of the fucking walls! Technically Earth Defense Force 2017 alternates good things with other (much) less good. The realization of the settings is rather bare and poor; whether it is a city or a beach at sunset or the inside of an ant nest, it is difficult to find sections with a polygonal complexity and a level of detail worthy of note. Likewise also the main character, a completely anonymous soldier, is characterized by animations from the minimum wage variety; the run, barely acceptable even considering the unnatural rotation of the pelvis in lateral movements, instead accompanies the really unwatchable jump as well as often not being very useful for dodging enemy blows. On the other hand, the bonuses to be collected to recover energy or shield are sensational, represented by truly horrible two-dimensional pixelated icons. On the other hand, however, a big applause must be made for the enemies; in addition to the dimensions that go from ~very large~ to ~huge~, many of them are extremely well characterized and detailed, and can count on good quality textures. On the other hand, the light effects and explosions are decidedly remarkable, capable of giving truly evocative moments or of pure total-global destruction. The frame rate, on the other hand, travels quite constant, except for particularly chaotic situations in which the graphics engine begins to suffer, lending itself to decidedly showy slowdowns. As for the multiplayer component, the effort of Sandlot Games is limited to offering a cooperative for 2 players with split screen, leaving every online mode at the door. Finally, the price slightly more than that of a budget game with which Earth Defense Force 2017 is sold is decidedly appreciable; one less obstacle to take your place in the defense of the Earth! Comment We have rarely seen anything like this gaudy, crass, ridiculous and at the same time funny like Earth Defense Force 2017. A surrogate for the worst (in a good way) that sci-fi B-Movies can offer, a 100% ignorant action shooter to be enjoyed without asking too many questions. Repetitive in the long run, without online modes and technically very fluctuating, the Sandlot Games production is however undoubtedly endowed with a charm, if we want to call it that, decidedly particular. A title not for everyone, certainly not unforgettable, but which in its own way brings with it a bit of fresh air and which is undoubtedly able to elicit more than a smile from lovers of absolute trash. Pros Trashy like few others Very entertaining Some excellent graphics Cons Poor environments In the long run repetitive Controls not perfect Goals Objectives in Earth Defense Force revolve around completing the game at various difficulty levels; in detail, 50 points for Easy, 100 Medium, 150 Hard, 200 Hardest and 300 Inferno. Finally unlocking all the weapons brings with it another 200 points. Earth Defense Force 2017, or when the worst of sci-fi B-Movies takes shape in a video game. The beauty, however, is that the video game in question is definitely fun, if not even a must-buy for fans of the genre ~the more tacky it is, the more I like it~. But let's go in order...", "date": "2007-05-10", "grade": null}
