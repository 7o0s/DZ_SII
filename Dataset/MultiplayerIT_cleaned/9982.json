Let's do this: let's take a breath and start from the beginning, or rather from the end. Indeed from the middle, who knows, the Telltales have decided that Cronos is dead, and goodbye to the temporal order of events. If you remember, we left in a basement, with Sam and Max who had recently thwarted the plans of the space gorilla. It so happens that here there is also a projector with four reels containing footage of the deeds of their ancestors Sammeth and Maximus, who in the last century managed to steal the Devil Toybox, an artifact with a biblical flavour. Devil Toybox, Devil's Playhouse... is there a connection? Even if it was, you'll have to be smarter than that to get to the bottom of this episode. In fact, you can switch from one reel to another at any time to guide Sammeth and Maximus, sliding the hands back and forth to peek at causes and consequences and find the solution to the puzzles. This is one of Maximus' powers, and it somewhat replaces the divine clairvoyance that characterized him in the first episode. The result is sensational, a work to be preserved over time. But now, it's better to change the reel and tell you everything else. Along the timeline The Tomb of Sammun-Mak is a courageous and perfectionist evolution of the first episode, a very fine engine that runs at full speed. If Telltale were to maintain this tenor until the end, this season will become a masterpiece. The locations are now many and unexpected. But above all, every little event is the pretext for a joke worthy of the best cabaret, for a priceless expression by Maximus or some other moment of excellence. We seem possessed, but the attention to detail reaches the level of great cinematic productions: unexpected direction and armored screenplay. Even the characters have multiplied, drawing heavily from the past of the series but with some important reinterpretations, in addition clearly to the new entries. The narration this time is solid and sufficient to dissect each step without running too much on the accelerator. But The Tomb of Sammun-Mak is not a movie, it's a game. And precisely in the guise of the game it is revolutionary. As anticipated by Telltale themselves, the season develops on the use of Max's powers. The difficult thing was to ensure that the use of objects was limited to a minimum. You will even forget that you have the objects. For a graphic adventure it's a paradigm shift, also because the result works flawlessly. In some cases it is a question of performing the right action during a precise scene, in other cases the resolution of the puzzles is all based on the leaps in time and the order in which some choices are linked, starting from the dialogues. Sam and Max are in even better shape, and never a line of dialogue is wasted. This episode is a perfect device. A bizarre clock with hundreds of gears turning on each other in a waltz rhythm.
