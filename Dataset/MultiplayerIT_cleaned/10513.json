And already here things get bizarre: going from the serious and harsh setting of agent 47 to the cuteness of miniature ninjas is certainly a sudden change of trend. However, under the childish appearance of Mini Ninjas a rather deep game is hidden: IO Interactive's bet was to merge a classic hack and slash structure with elements closer to adventure, mixing combat with exploration and quests to activate and carry complete. Of course, the final result is not a perfectly homogeneous compound but if nothing else the particular characterization helps to give substance to a product undoubtedly endowed with a certain personality. A title that inevitably comes to mind, when it comes to action-adventures and in particular with a fairytale characterization like this, is Zelda: with the Nintendo pillar this IO production shares something, in particular with Wind Waker also given the graphic characterization. The world to explore is quite vast and sufficiently rich in secrets, although it largely lacks substance: the structure is ultimately quite linear, with secondary missions mostly relegated to the recovery of objects. On the other hand, on the properly action front, the comparison with typical hack and slash is perhaps more fitting, although the great variety of attacks and possibilities of approaching the enemy is not supported by a real tactic or strategy required of the player to be able to advance through the levels. A typical case of videogame mix, which does not result in a specific and strong identity, but which nonetheless offers hours of peaceful and relaxed fun, a product endowed with a delicacy and an ironic spirit that make it pleasant for both the little ones than for more experienced players. A matter of balance The style with which the story is told is certainly original: the cartoonish and childish aspect with which medieval Japan (partly mythological) is staged manages to preserve the game from the usual rhetorical and awkwardly epic drifts that often rage in cases similar. There is a dark warlord who intends, as usual, to dominate the Earth and to do so, he has devised an ingenious and terrible plan. Taking advantage of evil magic, he managed to transform the tame animals of the forest into bloodthirsty samurai, not inclined to reason but absolutely devoted to their master and capable only of fighting. As if that weren't enough, it also has another side effect: such a drastic change in nature and its laws causes increasing desertification and a violent reaction from this, which translates into storms and earthquakes throughout Japan. To stop this madness and try to restore balance on Earth, the Master Ninja has decided to send his best fighters to solve the situation and possibly put an end to the warlord's plan, but one by one they disappear without leave trace. In the end, the last resort remains Hiro, the youngest of the village and the protagonist of the story. The latter, far from being inexperienced, compensates for his young age and lack of experience with an exceptional talent and an innate peculiarity: the ability to master Kuji magic, a special power that only a few ninja possess, and which therefore makes Hiro predestined for the arduous task of restoring balance to the Earth. However, our little hero will not be alone in his mission: to accompany him there are other fighters (in all 6) of the ninja village such as the big Futo, armed with a hammer, the stealthy Suzume armed with a flute and Shun specialist in ranged attacks with his trusty bow, more to follow. It is possible to change the main character at any time and the different abilities of each obviously make them suitable for different purposes, although the need to change the character is not perfectly implemented and is often forced, with the need to use a given ninja against another specific type of enemy or in a particular situation. For the vast majority of the time, however, Hiro will be the protagonist, being the only one capable of using magical powers. The video review Action and adventure The structure can therefore be ascribed to that of the action-adventure genre, in itself mixed and therefore already difficult to codify, in this case even more difficult to define. In fact, we find ourselves exploring large areas of the game having to complete certain objectives, which almost always translate into the classic itineraryfrom point A to point B, interspersed with various fights and possibly culminating with an end-of-level boss. The variants are provided by the secret areas to be discovered (which usually lead to hidden altars from which it is possible to obtain new spells) by the hidden objects to be collected and by the sub-quests that are assigned to us by the characters who populate the various areas (among which in the wise Tengu (mythological anthropomorphic crows) stand out in particular), which almost always result in the recovery and delivery of certain objects. The possibilities of movement allow you to walk, run, jump, climb, blend in with the environment and even swim or sail aboard the large ninja hat, which can be used as a boat. Occasionally, it is possible to collect various objects that serve different uses: there are objects to discover and collect within each level, in a fixed number, for their own sake. Others can be used as weapons while still others (flowers, mushrooms and other natural elements) can be mixed together to create healing or attack potions, based on the recipes that can be purchased from the Tengu. The magical arts give a little depth to the game structure, although they are almost all aimed at combat: by recovering the various parchments, we will insert new spells in the inventory, which can be recalled from a quick menu. The effects of these vary significantly: it is possible to launch fireballs, unleash windstorms, implement a ~transmigration~ which allows you to take control of the numerous animals present in the scenarios (the use of which however appears rather limited, being limited to the possibility of passing unnoticed or hit the enemies in the case of heavier beasts) or receive help to discover any hidden altars in the surroundings. However, exploration is little more than a side dish for the combat sections, which are the real backbone of the game which, as previously mentioned, unfortunately do not stand out for their great thickness. The vast amount of combos, spells and attack solutions is not integrated by a real need for technique and strategy during the fights, while the types of enemies are scarce, and in general reduced to the classic close-range/ranged attack dichotomy usually obvious with the usual two or three moves and spells, or by alternating the protagonist Hiro with the archer Shun, for example. Occasionally, the appearance of some specific enemies forces the use of a particular ninja, which in the long run becomes more of a hindrance than a valid idea to vary the action. The presence of the now mandatory sporadic quick time events should be noted. Xbox 360 goals There are not many objectives in the game: 35 for a total amount of 1000 points up for grabs. The classic awards that are obtained simply by advancing through the levels and reaching certain mandatory stages are joined by the objectives that come in particular from the exploration of the scenarios or by performing particular performances in combat. In total, it's not too much of a task to collect the full loot. Little big world What contributes largely to identifying Mini Ninjas in a specific way is the particular characterization chosen by IO for the game: associating the cartoon graphics with the world of ninjas and feudal-mythological Japan was an excellent idea. While not shining for an extremely advanced technical realization, the polygonal models, animations and sound effects cannot fail to make even the coldest gamer smile. It is therefore a product which, also thanks to this stylistic solution, lends itself to being enjoyed by both the youngest and a mature public, also addressing universal themes, but with a touch of delicate and pleasant irony. The scenarios and characters are obviously stylized in this way, but in a manner consistent with the idea behind the game. Of course, the technical rate is not the highest, with elementary polygonal structures and, above all, decidedly simple textures: although everything is well blended, one still thinks that some more effort could have been made in the graphics sector. The relative simplicity of the graphic system, however, goes all in favor of the fluidity of the action, which in this case benefits from a constant 60 fps framerate, which is certainly appreciable, and which further contributes to the cartoonish look. The sound accompaniment is excellent, which combines the classic ambient music that one would expect to find in a title characterized by this scenario with nice and well-selected sound effects, especially as regards the affected expressions similar to-Japanese uttered by the protagonists and enemies. The Italian dubbing that characterizes the supporting characters is also very good (curiously, the little ninjas do not speak), which helps to create a narrative with a fairytale and choral style.", "date": "2009-09-22", "grade": "7.5"}
