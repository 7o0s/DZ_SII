{"name": "Silver Chains", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/silver-chains-recensione.html", "text": "Silver Chains begins with the protagonist waking up on the driveway that leads to a large mansion. There's a storm in the air and the place isn't reassuring at all, but it's the only one where he can find shelter. Passed out at the entrance to the building, ours recovers on a bed in one of the rooms on the first floor. Who brought it there? The rooms of the haunted house are completely turned upside down and turning around you find strange objects, such as doll pieces hanging on strings or a magic lamp for children. Despite the chaos and general sense of abandonment, there are also some details that testify to the presence of inhabitants: lit fireplaces, electrical systems still working, laid tables... the premises of Silver Chains are not very original, but they are decidedly convincing and manage to create the right atmosphere. The house is graphically well done, despite the fact that there are many repeated objects. The style isn't very marked, but the lighting system helps to give the right feeling to the rooms. In general, the first few minutes of the game prepare for what appears to be an excellent horror adventure, even if it fits perfectly into the path traced by Amnesia. Our character can walk, run, crouch, use the classic lamp to illuminate the darkest areas and, later, use a monocle to see hidden objects and details. The interactions are few and very simple: when you approach a usable object, such as a door handle, a dot appears above it which, once you touch it, becomes the indication of the key to press to use it. Around the house there are also the classic wardrobes where you can enter to save yourself from the usual pursuing monster... Unfortunately, after the convincing start, Silver Chains begins to show all its inadequacy, starting with the monster, which obviously cannot be fought against. But let's go in order. Horror, where? As we have mentioned, the possible interactions in the Silver Chains mansion are very few, despite the apparent presence of numerous objects. Besides, the puzzles are very simple to solve. Usually when you can't find the solution it's because you haven't reached the right point of the adventure yet. For example, the aforementioned magic lamp is linked to a puzzle that initially appears unsolvable, but which is easily solved at a later stage in the story, when the solution is literally slammed in our faces. Other puzzles instead require you to look for objects scattered throughout the mansion, so as to make it go through practically all of it, even several times. In short, don't expect anything too complex or memorable from this point of view. But let's get to our monster friend. Instead of creating the classic creature that runs around the game environments looking for the protagonist, the developers have opted for a more guided solution, with the creature appearing at specific times. Silver Chains doesn't have a real stealth system and the only way to survive the chases is to look for a wardrobe and enter it. Once the danger has passed, you can go out and start exploring the house again. Unfortunately the excessive simplicity of the system kills the atmosphere very much, because in this way a relief of tension is inevitable after one has understood it. Horror is such if the perceived danger tends to manifest itself in some way and with the right frequency. In Silver Chains the creature gives some problems only in the final phase of the adventure, when one is already calibrated to face it. After all we are talking about a title that is finished in about four hours, so you will understand for yourself that the moments of terror are very few. Unfortunately the apparitions and supernatural events of which the mansion is full do not help in this sense, because they practically never materialize into a risk for the protagonist. In short, the model followed is the one dictated by Frictional Games, but the result is really distant in terms of modulation and tension management, so much so that it is a truly amateur reading of the genre. Just as amateur is the story that forms the backdrop to the adventure, full of clichs, starting from the inevitable Ouja board, used to communicate with the spirits of the house, passing through the dolls, now seen in dozens of horror films, and getting to the very appearance of the pursuing creature, screaming horror stock from every pore of its grayish skin. Even at the level of writing the level is very low. Silver Chains tells its story through the classic diary pages that are found around the rooms of the house, unfortunately unable to involve in the narrated events and all too clear in immediately explaining thishe what happened. A twist eventually comes, but it's really phoned. That's all? One wonders when looking at the end credits, only to realize that one is already forgetting the mediocre experience just lived.", "date": "2019-08-06", "grade": "5.0"}
