{"name": "Final Fantasy VI Advance - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/final-fantasy-vi-advance-recensione.html", "text": "A game that is a novel Probably Final Fantasy VI still remains the most elaborate, convincing and surprising narrative episode of the entire saga, and in all probability the most complex stand-alone RPG of the last ten years. The premises are simple: the world was devastated thousands of years ago by the ~War of the Magi~, at the end of which the magic itself had vanished, leaving behind a pile of rubble. Rebuilt through steam technology, in this post-apocalyptic and vaguely steam-punk scenario now stands the Gestahlian Empire, which is developing an obscene hybrid power that mixes magic and technology in the military forces called Magitek: with this trump card, the Emperor Gestahl declares war on the whole world, and he is especially opposed by the rebels called Returners. One of these, a thief... indeed, a treasure hunter - as he defines himself - named Locke, at the beginning of the game will save a young Magitek soldier, Terra, freeing her from imperial mental control and proposing to make her available to the resistance its mysterious and overdeveloped magical powers. Then begins a long journey to Terra Branford, in search of its past and its origins, which will intertwine with that of many heroes, including the charming King Edgar of Figaro and his fearless brother Sabin, the sweet military Celes, the cunning Setzer, the wise wizard Strago and the creepy ninja Shadow. Each of these characters will take part in the adventure with its personal story, its objectives and its abundant stage part, captivating the player with an extremely defined and deep characterization. But a group of heroes wouldn't be such if it didn't have its nemesis: and here is Final Fantasy VI presents the most bastard, infamous and splendidly bad enemy in the history of video games, the psychopathic and absolutely amazing Kefka, a tyrant without an iota of mercy , self-centered and treacherous, a concentration of evil such that getting to the end of the game without hating him is impossible, and that he didn't need complex subplots or existential dramas to be such. Kefka is bad, he is evil incarnate, and as such he is the best enemy that a JRPG can field, with all the emotional implications of the case. And if Final Fantasy VI is the best JRPG in history, it's also thanks to him. Final Fantasy VI probably still remains the most narratively elaborate episode of the entire saga today The apotheosis of game-design in a JRPG, first chapter, page one Anyone who plays Final Fantasy VI now will recognize many elements that are now traditional in the genre: multiple points of view in the development of the plot, random turn-based combat, different fighting styles for each character, a fully explorable map with various means of transport, cities and dungeons to explore... It's possible to say that many of these characteristics were seeded by Final Fantasy VI itself, and ironically what JRPGs present now, in 2007, the sixth chapter of the Square saga already did better in 1994. The structure of the game is therefore classic, but the mechanics are so perfect that it is impossible not to admire the balance and intrinsic variety, even in a battle-system that after ten years seems almost naive to us, but extremely convincing. Unlike the trend to which the most recent Final Fantasy or the various porting/remakes have accustomed us (such as Final Fantasy III or Final Fantasy Tactics Advance), in Final Fantasy VI there is no canonical Job System, even if in reality it was subtly integrated into the traditional choice of party members, for a maximum of four, who will face the battles: one of the winning elements of Final Fantasy VI is in fact the playful characterization of the various protagonists, all in possession of totally different skills. Terra is able to use magic, Shadow can throw various objects and weapons at enemies, Edgar can use a thousand gadgets to attack and defend the group... And therefore we note the characteristic elements of the Jobs in the series, with Strago capable of learning enemy skills (such as the Blue Mage) or Cyan and her samurai techniques. There is also the bizarreness, especially in the case of Sabin's Blitz techniques, which must be activated as in a fighting game, or in that of Relm's paintings, which sometimes even rebel against their creator. In short, there is an enormous variety, which made Final Fantasy VI great in the past, and which still today demonstrates a depth that is difficult to match. Obviously the Espers are back, to which are added some specially designed for this edition such as Gilgamesh and Leviathan. The Espers play a central role in the plot, much more coherent and intertwiningate of what happened in Final Fantasy VIII with the Guardian Forces, but their use does not differ much from the eighth Fantasia Square: each Esper can be associated with a character, who will gradually learn new skills thanks to it, being able to even summon him in battle to unleash his fury on enemies or his beneficial powers on the party. So Final Fantasy VI is a JRPG with a classic structure because, after all, it was the paradigm for dozens of subsequent video games, which fished heavily in the cauldron of brilliant and winning ideas that still makes it exciting to venture into the lands of this world today fantastic, facing enemy after enemy and slowly discovering a plot that involves twists, developments and characterization of its protagonists. A game design that is still current and very enjoyable today, there is so much to love and also to learn in this cartridge. The past is closer Naturally, being a 1994 game Final Fantasy VI will appear a bit dated to modern players from a purely graphical point of view: ironically, the overall visual quality of the title was impressive on SuperNES, and still today it remains at medium / high levels compared to at the Game Boy Advance toy library. Don't expect the bright colors and meticulous detail of Golden Sun, nor the excellent animations of Fire Emblem, in short; however, one is amazed by what Square managed to do more than ten years ago, given that the conceptual variety of locations and creatures easily rivals that of the most modern portable JRPGs, which Final Fantasy VI even manages to beat due to the atmospheres they evoke the most engaging narrative sequences (those who remember the sequence of the play with Celes know very well what we are talking about). So the extreme simplicity of the sprites of the various characters and their scarce animations (counterbalanced by the refined character design of Yoshitaka Amano) are the only thing that could make players turn up their noses in 2007. But Final Fantasy VI on SNES not only amazed for what was then an excellent technical achievement: the splendid soundtrack helped to increase the already rapidly growing fame of Nobuo Uematsu, who with this sixth Final Fantasy offers us perhaps one of his most heartfelt and complex works. The music in Final Fantasy VI is simply magnificent, and there is little else to add... except perhaps that in the transition to the Game Boy Advance they ended up feeling the weight of the scarce hardware capabilities, resulting in a bit rougher at a attentive ear. But the magic of those pieces of music is really all there. Final Fantasy VI is a milestone in videogame history, and as such it still manages today, after more than ten years, to remain young, fresh, exciting in every aspect, especially narrative and playful. The epic of Terra and his companions is a story that, with hundreds of RPGs between the original edition and this port, continues to have no rivals: it is probably the concentrate of that Square magic that between ups and downs over the years has never managed to establish itself as it did with this Final Fantasy. Season everything with an exceptionally deep and fun battle-system despite its age, brand new Espers and dungeons that increase its already enormous longevity, a new revised and corrected localization, and we can safely say that the Game Boy Advance closes its career definitely in beauty, for those who want to rediscover a masterpiece or those who are willing to overlook the dated graphics to immerse themselves in it and fall in love with it. Pros: Narratively unbeatable Battle-system that doesn't feel the weight of the years Unforgettable soundtrack Cons: Graphically a bit dated Final Fantasy VI doesn't need much introduction: in 1994 it arrived in America with another title, Final Fantasy III, because it was precisely the third episode of the series to be officially translated into English. Since then it's not uncommon, reading forums or magazines, to stumble upon statements about the grandeur of the Squaresoft title, of great nostalgia for that adventure which effectively dictated the rules for the production of JRPGs released in the last 13 years. Every typically Japanese Role Playing Game must collide with Final Fantasy VI, a comparison that has now become essential, given that the sixth Final Fantasy established the modern paradigms of the genre, at a narrative and playful level. The protagonists and their rivals, in the game, almost became the archetypes for the invention of the heroes who faced countless battles in countless other subsequent games. Yet despite the undisputed quality of that masterpiece for the SNES, Square Enix is only now offering a port for the Game Boy Advance, presenting the original game with a revised translation and corretta (although some changes from the original American version have been kept compared to the Japanese edition, such as Terra who was actually called Tina and so on), new quests, new dungeons, new spells, four new espers and more.", "date": "2007-03-06", "grade": null}
