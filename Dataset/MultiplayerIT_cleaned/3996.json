One after the other, the major exponents of the toys-to-life genre have gradually lost their appeal, transforming themselves from an unstoppable money printing machine into an extra problem for those who have to manage the warehouses of the large video game chains. In a period in which even the famous Activision brand dedicated to Spyro and his companions has taken a break, Ubisoft however manages to fill this void with a very particular formula, which focuses entirely on space battles and ships to be built and customized. A risky choice in some ways, but which in light of the qualities of Starlink: Battle for Atlas could have more than a few chances of success. The Story of the Fox and the Nova Starlink: Battle for Atlas follows a group of Earth astronauts as they search for the origins of Judge, an alien crew member of the interstellar ship Equinox who has no recollection of his past. A mission therefore far from expansionist aims, which however is soon interrupted by the attack of the Legion, an alien force determined to get their hands on a powerful source of energy, the Nova. Thus begins a long adventure across the seven planets of the Atlas star system, which offers a vast open-world setting to explore to discover new biomes and learn about the background of the different protagonists, whose discreet characterization is entrusted to dialogues, cutscenes and some extra files. The campaign offers an overall linear narrative but, after a first guided phase, opens up to a number of activities such as to easily forget the main objective. In fact, each planet offers a rich management component, made up of materials to collect, life forms to study and enemies to defeat in order to strengthen the Starlink alliance and weaken the Legion in view of the inevitable final showdown. Life on the planets is dynamic and the balance of forces varies according to how much importance is placed on strengthening local structures and population, even while engaged in missions on the other side of the Atlas. This translates into a very variable longevity: based on how much you want to explore, or make your life easier during the epilogue, it can easily fluctuate between 15 and 30 hours of play. To understand: if you want to run towards the end you can do it easily, but you have to deal with more powerful enemies who could make the clashes quite difficult. Unfortunately, the structure is rather repetitive and the tasks soon end up looking a bit alike. Also thanks to the vast but not particularly populated worlds, with elements of the scenario that are too often recycled, there are few things to do during the long journeys from one side of the planet to the other in search of the objectives of the moment. Even space exploration is not very varied: so you spend too much time flying between one planet and another, encountering only a few asteroid belts and marauding ships, which soon represent a nuisance rather than a welcome change to the continuous succession of stones and absolute emptiness. However, the experience on Switch can count on an important added value: the Star Fox. In fact, Fox McCloud and his team of mercenaries make their appearance in the story from the initial scenes, highlighting good integration into the campaign and great attention to detail. Fox's missions are therefore anything but a simple cameo, and represent an important bonus that make the version for the Nintendo hybrid the most complete of the lot in terms of content. A gameplay that mixes physical and digital The core of the experience revolves mainly around the spaceships and pilots of the Equinox, through a hybrid customization system that mixes physical and digital elements in the gameplay. As belonging to the toys-to-life genre, Starlink: Battle for Atlas can count on particular and well-made interactive toys. At the moment, in fact, there are ten pilots and eight different starships available, whose abilities can be customized through the use of additional wings and weapons. Their composition is completely modular: this means that each ship can be physically assembled freely, without the obligation to follow particular rules of symmetry or aerodynamics. For example, it is possible to attach three different wings to the left side of the hull, leaving the right one completely unguarded; or you can mount the weapons upside down, so as to hit the enemies in the queue as needed. Each additional element gives bonuses to various stats, but increases the ship's weight and thus reduces its flight capabilities. Weapons have elemental characteristics that make them more effectiveeffective against particular types of enemies, while the pilots are equipped with extra skills capable of overturning the clashes. Then there is a large amount of modules to be obtained on the field, which offer important extra bonuses especially at higher difficulty levels. There are four, with the highest making for downright challenging engagements, both on the ground and in space. The life system is the classic one of the genre and each ship represents the attempts at its disposal before being swept away by the enemies to start over from the last checkpoint. Too bad that even from this point of view there is little variety: the enemies are few and have repeated patterns, which makes the fights a little less fun as the adventure continues. Starlink editions Starlink: Battle for Atlas is sold in both physical and digital stores for 80 euros. The retail version for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One includes the Zenith ship, pilot Mason and three additional weapons; the Switch one, on the other hand, has the Airwing of Star Fox, Fox Mc Cloud and Mason as pilots and two weapons. In addition, however, it also gives access to the digital version of the Zenith spaceship and the Chopper weapon. On digital stores, the basic version includes 4 space ships, and you can also buy a deluxe version with all the ships, weapons and pilots for 100 euros. Individual ships cost 30 euros in physical version and 15 euros in digital version. Technique: between dirty graphics and portability Integration with toys is ensured by a bulky adapter for the controllers, but Starlink differs from other exponents of the genre for the possibility of completely freeing itself from the physical support: game, ships, pilots and weapons are all usable and purchasable even digitally . In this way, a very important tactile and playful element of the experience is lost, especially for the little ones, but the versatility of the package is significantly increased, especially on Switch, where the portable component is also very solid from a technical point of view. Carrying all the characters and ships with you is not in fact the maximum comfort, even if it makes the change of equipment much more immediate. In TV mode the technical compromises are obviously more evident: compared to the other consoles, the Nintendo one shows a reduced quality of the textures, an unrealistic rendering of the liquid surfaces and a very marked aliasing (to get a more precise idea, here you can find a video comparison between Switch and PS4). However, the visual distance remains good and the bright color palette of the settings also makes the game pleasant to look at.", "date": "2018-10-22", "grade": "7.8"}
