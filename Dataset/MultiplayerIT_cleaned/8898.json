Sitting in the driver's seat is an unconscious man, who fortunately recovers in time and manages to escape from the metal trap in which they had locked him up. When he resurfaces, he finds a beautiful girl waiting for him, who without telling him who she is or providing him with explanations, hands him a bunch of keys and urges him to get moving if he still wants to participate in the illegal race par excellence, an event in which every year they take part hundreds of drivers from all over the world and which takes place along the route from San Francisco to New York: over three hundred kilometers in which there is no shortage of pitfalls between police cars, disreputable guys and a lot of traffic to watch out for . The two therefore set off, taking advantage of each portion of the completed race to reveal some secrets to each other, until the inevitable final phase in which they will have to play it all and really trust each other. Need for Speed: The Run stands in many ways as a breakthrough episode for the series produced by Electronic Arts, given the adoption of the powerful Frostbite 2 engine and the inclusion of sequences in which we can see and control our character beyond outside the cockpit, which has always been a sort of taboo for driving games. The Wii version, however, has to give up these features in favor of a traditional approach, entrusted to the authors of the entertaining (but far from spectacular, from a technical point of view) TrackMania Wii. How many octane? For the creation of Need for Speed: The Run, Firebrand Games has fielded its own graphic engine, Octane, on paper capable of fully exploiting the technical capabilities of Nintendo consoles thanks to HDR-like polygonal rendering, advanced reflection effects on surfaces and the guarantee of a good drawing distance, all at 60 frames per second. We could not check whether this is the frame rate of the game or not, however it must be admitted that the graphics flow smoothly, without uncertainties, and that some scenarios boast a not bad body, detail and design. The locations where you run in the middle of the forests or in the mountains are undoubtedly the best, from this point of view, while some urban tracks are instead dull and desolate. We proceed between ups and downs also with regard to the cars: the most famous ones boast good models, while the ~secondary~ cars, in particular those that are unlocked for challenges, have an excessively angular and ~fake~ appearance. The interlude sequences, which as mentioned on HD consoles and PC take place ~live~, using the same engine of the driving phases, on Wii have been represented through the expedient of the ~comic book~, with a series of vignettes characterized by a fluctuating drawing style, which however are ~recited~ by Italian voice actors in a more than discreet way. The rest of the sound sector focuses heavily on the ~signed~ soundtrack, which monopolizes every moment and soon becomes a bit intrusive, given that it almost completely covers the effects. Is that a good thing? Steering wheel in hand It is possible to play using the accelerometer integrated in the Wii-mote, preferably by setting the controller in a steering wheel-shaped adapter, or opt for a traditional solution with the Classic Controller. Both prove to be valid, even if the second offers greater precision, especially when traffic is intense and we want to avoid unwanted head-on collisions. The purely arcade approach of the gameplay translates into wide curves, to be tackled full throttle without problems, while in case of difficulty you can drift and get away without touching the brake, provided you act in advance. Speed management appears to be at least curious: we have a nitro bar that fills up by completing overtaking, performing acrobatic manoeuvres, remaining in the slipstream of other vehicles and marching at maximum capacity, but activating the boost does not produce who knows what advantage over the our opponents, who on some occasions we will be able to overcome almost because they are the ones who let off the gas. In the speedometer box we can also see a bar that indicates the energy of our car, which drops when we suffer impacts and once reset, it makes us lose one of the three ~lives~ available to finish the race. Not always to win you will have to cross the finish line first: during the campaign we will have to deal with different rules, including elimination races in which you have to ram the other competitors. As mentioned, the story mode is supported by a ~challenge~ mode whose contentsuti must be unlocked gradually, between cars and aesthetic customizations, while multiplayer is only locally via split-screen. Considering the brevity of the campaign, which can be completed in just over a couple of hours, the picture is unfortunately that of a product with an extremely short life expectancy.", "date": "2011-11-30", "grade": "7.8"}
