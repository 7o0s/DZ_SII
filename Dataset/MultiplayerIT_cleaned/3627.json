{"name": "Contra Anniversary Collection", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/contra-anniversary-collection-recensione.html", "text": "Contra Anniversary Collection closes the trilogy that celebrates Konami's fifty years, and does so by involving us in a new journey back in time. As you will be able to read in this review, we are talking about a less substantial collection than the previous Arcade Classics Anniversary Collection and Castlevania Anniversary Collection; on the one hand because in fact the Contra franchise boasts a less dense and varied history than the aforementioned Castlevania, on the other because the Japanese company did not want to cross the borders of the 8 and 16-bit platforms. This has limited the selection to just five unique games, which however have been presented in different variants since launch: you won't have to wait for updates. The original Contra is available in three editions: the arcade version, the western reduction for the NES and the Japanese one for the Famicom. Super Contra, likewise, is featured in the arcade edition and the NES conversion titled Super C, while Contra III: The Alien Wars and Super Probotector: Alien Rebels are the same SNES game but in Japanese and Western variants. Finally also Contra: Hard Corps and Probotector are the same title, respectively for Genesis and Mega Drive: the well-known transition from human protagonists to anonymous robots was made because at the time we wanted to avoid showing younger users the scenes of slaughtered men from bullets. Finally, Operation C for Game Boy represents an exception, given that it is a product that mixes elements taken from different episodes of the series and successfully translates them onto the small monochrome screen of the Nintendo handheld. Story, gameplay and options Bill Rizer and Lance Bean, the historical protagonists of Contra, are clearly inspired by the heroes of the action movies of the 80s, in this specific case the Arnold Schwarzenegger of Commando and the Sylvester Stallone of Rambo. Selecting one or the other character makes no difference, with a view to a war of the future that sees our planet invaded by a hostile alien race that we will have the task of defeating using a large arsenal. In terms of gameplay, the experience is immediately recognizable: the emphasis on the shooter component, with the possibility of destroying pods that release alternative fire modes, alternates with a use of jumps and platforms put at the service of our ability to dodge enemy bullets. Projectiles that are obviously plentiful and well aimed, as is the tradition for the arcade classics that aimed to monetize (literally) by introducing an average degree of challenge substantially higher than today's standards. From this point of view the arcade version of the game and the NES reductions have a lot in common, but an option added to the Anniversary Collection allows you to activate the autofire at any time and thus give some respite to the controller buttons , making things easier for us. For the rest, the options are those already seen in previous collections: a save slot to access at any time, the ability to save a replay, view (but not modify) the controls, choose between various graphic settings and add or not a frame around the 3:4 layout of the first episodes. From the arcade to the consoles Trying your hand at the original Contra still proves to be a fascinating experience today: there are run & gun-style mechanisms that the Konami series was the first to introduce, very interesting ideas (see the change of view between one stage and another) albeit not always well implemented and, in general, an emphasis on power-ups and boss fights which is particularly reflected in the second chapter, Super Contra. At the time, the writer spent a lot of money on it and the sensations remained more or less the same, including the understanding of what it meant at the time to create huge enemies made up of several sprites, whose elements had to be damaged progressively before the complete destruction (see the early stages helicopter). The distance between arcade and home console clearly increases in this case, and although the NES version of Super C looks good, it is clear that compromises had to be made on a visual level in terms of details, animations and graphic complexity. The Game Boy episode, Operation C, stands as a spin-off that brings together elements of the first and second chapters, and does it in a surprisingly good way. In fact, if in the Castlevania Anniversary Collection review we underlined how the releases for the Nintendo handheld were too slow and poor to be re-proposed today, the same cannot be said of this 1991 action shooter, fast and fun. TrophiesPlaystation 4 There are sixteen Trophies included in the Contra Anniversary Collection, and getting them all is just a matter of time for those who decide to purchase the collection. In fact, it is enough to complete the individual games of the package, in their variants and in any alternative paths, to fill up on achievements. The latest games and documentation As expected, it is the most recent games included in the collection, those designed for 16-bit consoles, which push hard in terms of ideas and innovation compared to the original formula. Contra III: The Alien Wars sees the historical protagonists now elderly but still able to unleash chaos thanks to a particularly rich arsenal, which presents the possibility of using two different slots for fire modes and launching a devastating smart bomb when needed . The game makes use of the peculiarities of the Super Nintendo hardware to bring very spectacular zooms and rotations to the screen, while in terms of gameplay the climbing mechanics are relaunched and emphasized, with entire sections to be played hanging somewhere. The debut of the franchise on the Mega Drive, in 1994, takes place with Contra: Hard Corps and introduces various new features, including four selectable characters (a man, a woman, a werewolf and a robot), each equipped with different power-ups that can be kept within five slots for an ever so multifaceted management of the shooter component. Moreover, both alternative editions, Super Probotector: Alien Rebels and Probotector, include an option to play at 50 or 60 Hz, significantly increasing the speed of the action. As per tradition, the Contra Anniversary Collection also includes an e-book that can be consulted, unfortunately, only on the TV: it reports the history and synopsis of each game included in the package, as well as some interesting interviews with the developers and a set of preparatory sketches.", "date": "2019-06-17", "grade": "6.8"}
