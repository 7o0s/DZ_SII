Considering that the television series is already a nice tribute to the atmospheres of the 80s and 90s, we could not expect anything other than a retro-style video game and pixelated 2D graphics, which in turn incorporates different atmospheres and action adventure solutions from the NES era and SNES, drawing particular inspiration from those games that often served as a tie-in to film productions. It could cynically be said that the whole Stranger Things operation tends to be at least pimping towards those who desperately seek to rediscover that vivacious and sanguine spirit that characterized the entertainment products of about thirty years ago (or who simply suffer from it fascination, despite not having experienced them live), albeit extremely well done, and more or less the same things can also be said about this game developed by BonusXP, which despite the premises turns out to be a well-structured and fun title, at the beyond the pandering manifested already starting from the icon with the NES cartridge. It's all part of the promotional campaign for the second season of Stranger Things and it's likely to think that the budget made available for this maneuver was also considerable, but there is an evident desire to offer a genuine product behind the development of this game, which is not just a mere vehicle to increase the hype and spread new materials about the show (there is an unreleased trailer to discover inside, collecting eight VHS tapes scattered around the scenarios), which is even more surprising if you think that the app it is completely free and does not hide any type of micro-transaction or aggressive advertising inside. The Stranger Things operation, also on the videogame front, is confirmed as nostalgic but also genuine Weird and pixelated stuff The Stranger Things game is an action adventure with a top view that mixes fights with puzzles, all obviously within the town of Hawkins, so seemingly trivial but with different dark sides under the surface. It is clearly a nice piece of fanservice for those who have followed the television series but the game proves to be so good that it can be appreciated even by those who are unable to grasp the references, even if a smattering of the show is absolutely recommended. We start by controlling only agent Hopper in search of the eight missing boys starting from the mysterious laboratory of the city, but things soon become more vast and complex with the recovery of the various characters which opens up new game solutions thanks to the use of the different specific skills for each. The care put by the developers in the level design is somewhat surprising, which presents rather brilliant puzzles in their mechanics, often requiring an alternate and combined use of the various protagonists to get to grips with the different situations, ranging from activating switches to activating or interrupting traps the exploitation of environmental elements in a creative way to overcome obstacles and threats. The expansive map also feels like an homage to period games (Mother, Jurassic Park, Zombies ate my Neighbors as well as Zelda come to mind) and features various areas of the town as well as the parallel dimension of Upside Down, all presented with the appropriate pixelated 2D graphics that appear however particularly credible, following an appreciable pragmatism that prefers clarity and fidelity to some classic canons rather than the end in itself style of many ~artsy~ productions. Another aspect that demonstrates a particularly happy realization of this game is the control system: taking full advantage of the touch screen, the developers have opted for a sort of point and click that is effective for interacting with the elements of the scenario without sacrificing too much movements in the most action phases.", "date": "2017-10-11", "grade": "8.2"}
