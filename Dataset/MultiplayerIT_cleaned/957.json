[C] Walking on the roofs or sliding on the ropes is a must. on the agenda. The management of the view puts in great difficulty; in fights. Kurenai can; kill your opponents in many different ways. [/C] The game The invention of the machine gun can turn the tide of a battle, especially if you are in feudal Japan. The application of this weapon, however, is banned for ethical reasons and the instrument ends up being destroyed. The project necessary to build it, however, is stolen by a team of ninjas, who exterminate the family of the young Kurenai and try to kill her too, by hanging her. The girl miraculously survives, is picked up by a ninja and initiated into martial arts: her new reason for living is to obey her master's orders. And if by doing so she can take revenge on whoever killed her parents, even better... The plot of Red Ninja: End of Honor holds no particular surprises, if not the crudeness of the events shown in the animated introduction. And the game is no different: if you've ever tried Tenchu, you know exactly what we're talking about: an action game with stealth elements, in which, however, the direct approach is often encouraged. Since the first mission, however, we realize that the developers have relied more on Kurenai's curves, shown from practically every angle and with the most subtle pretexts, than on solid and stimulating game mechanics. In fact, the feeling of dealing with a product that is neither meat nor fish is immediately felt: the approach is not exactly stealth, and it is in the action phases that all the defects are found, first of all a management of the view completely busted. Secondly, there is a lack of any innovative element, as well as the essential thickness for this kind of title: the missions are similar and simple in their structure, the artificial intelligence of the enemies leaves something to be desired and the combat system does not involve . [C] Often the game lingers on the curves of the protagonist. Walking close to the walls is a pain in the ass. a classic of stealth games. Getting behind an enemy results in an instant kill. [/C] Technically speaking The graphics in Red Ninja: End of Honor are average for current PlayStation 2 games: the characters are made up of a good number of polygons and the level of detail is sufficient. There is nothing to cry out for a miracle, however: the protagonist is well done, but we have seen better in other games. And the animations are not surprising, not even those that show Kurenai intent on killing an enemy after taking him from behind. The same can be said for the settings: without infamy or praise, often simple in design and characterized by a banal use of colours. All this is accompanied by a sound commentary that is not very incisive, which does not arouse emotions and which seems to have been placed there so as not to disturb the player as he sneaks up on a possible victim. The control system is good in assigning functions to the various keys, but the character's reaction is as inaccurate as that of the virtual camera. The mix of these factors heavily affects playability, especially when there is running on walls (yes) and during fights. Comment There are too many things that don't add up in Red Ninja: End of Honor. First of all, the impression is that the developers wanted to think too much about Kurenai's attractiveness rather than the validity of far more important factors: the thickness, the control system and above all the management of the visuals. As it is, Red Ninja does not represent a valid alternative to the last Tenchu, and it does not even stand out for its technical realization (which remains average). In short, a title to avoid? Well, those who don't know Tenchu or those who want a slightly different (but not valid) approach to the stealth game genre will be able to find in Red Ninja: End of Honor a game capable of entertaining for a while. Pros: Protagonist well done Adequate technical quality Cons: Poor management of the view Lack of depth Graphically ~already seen~ If ninjas have never enjoyed great popularity in the cinematographic field, or at least not in the West, in video games the figure of the assassin on commission, ruthless and cold as a machine, has held the ground for decades. Existed during the Japanese Middle Ages, the ninja were lethal warriors not so much for their skills and for the countless known tricks, but for the total dedicationtion to their mission and to their masters. Dedication that often led them to sacrifice their lives in order to achieve the set goal. There are dozens and dozens of games in which ninjas appear in more or less important roles, with classic or revolutionized characteristics, but it is in the field of stealth games that their appearance takes on a certain significance. With Tenchu, for example, justice is really done to the figure of the ninja, as in the game the imperative is to complete the missions without being discovered, rather than eliminating all the opponents. Red Ninja: End of Honor represents an attempt to resume the same discourse, introducing unpublished elements (especially aesthetic ).", "date": "2005-04-21", "grade": null}
