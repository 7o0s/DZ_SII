{"name": "Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/slayers-x-terminal-aftermath-vengance-of-the-slayer-recensione.html", "text": "At the end of the now distant 2007, the bizarre and captivating trailer of Italian Spiderman was published on YouTube, a film directed by the elusive Gianfranco Gatti and starring Franco Franchetti in the tight-fitting role of our local superhero characterized by a showy pair of mustaches and a dull physique absolutely startling role. The film, according to the owner of the channel on which the video in question was published, dated back to the 60s and, still unreleased, was finally preparing to make its debut after a miraculous recovery and careful restoration. The aforementioned feature film, which would later be distributed on YouTube in several episodes, was actually the ambitious and highly successful project of an Australian film school, an exercise in trashy style, which not only managed to accumulate millions of views on well-known platform, not only helped to prove Dario Russo's directorial skills, but also configured as a perfect example of meta-narration. Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer echoes the period film that was not a period film at all, the result, as narrated in the game's intro, of the vision of a sixteen-year-old who, finally an adult, he managed to shape the video game of his dreams, the one he had already designed in a notebook, while pretending to take notes during school lessons. Not only. This deliberately classic and retro-style FPS is also the (more or less) direct sequel to the lysergic Hypnospace Outlaw, bizarre Internet simulator in the 90s in which, among many other things that happened, you also had the possibility to knowledge of Zane, ~developer~ of Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer, as well as the protagonist of the adventure himself. In short, the guys at Big Z Studios Inc. wanted to instill a distinctly meta component right from the start which in fact characterizes and at the same time justifies the very existence of their creature, an FPS with a spicy flavor and suitable only for a small and well-selected audience , as well as the subject of analysis of this review of Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer. Badass sales Everything in Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer is retro, even the HUD of course Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer, as the title suggests, talks about revenge. Good Zane is a budding vigilante in his teens. He plays in a band, he enjoys school in his own way, in his spare time he learns how to be a hero, he is prey to some delusions of omnipotence and above all he trains himself to curse with timing and the right tone of voice. His world is completely turned upside down when a group of evil punks, including talking excrement and flying demonic heads, decide to set fire to his small Central American town, while killing his mentor and his mother. The plot, admittedly obvious and devoid of well-characterized characters, develops through a few dialogues and even fewer videos, which however have the great merit of reproducing the style and aesthetics of the very first 3D video games. Transitions now soft, now clear, connect scenes characterized by shy and nervous camera movements, non-interactive sequences through which virtual actors are filmed obviously stingy with details, mono expressive, with complexions and clothes that flaunt acid colors. In short, you need to appreciate a certain type of aesthetic, style, atmosphere to fully enjoy these narrative interludes. Lovers of B-horror movies, '90s action movies, anyone who grew up discovering the plot of their favorite video games from instruction booklets and skimpy dialogue will adore Zane's foul-mouthed banter, basic cinematography, grainy images that characterize the progress of the plot. Of course, don't expect conventional weapons in Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer, instead expect mostly demented versions of the common rifles and grenade launchers Don't expect who knows what twists in the eight hours necessary to reach the end credits, nor to witness particular emotional evolutions of the protagonist. The depth is the same as any Scary Movie and should be approached in this spirit. In every line of dialogue, dubbed in English but subtitled in our language, the sophistication of the pun, of the double entender, of the effective joke is missing. We laugh at the absurdity of the context and at the simple foul language of ours, don't expect brilliant concatenations of words and rhetorical figures. The retro style obviously also reverberates on the graphic front. Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayerhas no intention of offering the user a futuristic and up-to-date aesthetic system. The reference model is Wolfenstein, Doom, the old Duke Nukem. The settings are stingy with details, the animations are not at all fluid, the low-resolution textures, the special effects are reduced to the bone and characterized by a retro rendering. As Italian Spiderman recovered the aesthetics and style of the detective stories of the 60s, the creature by Big Z Studios Inc. wants to be mistaken for an FPS released during the 90s. In Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer there is obviously no shortage of exciting boss battles Also from this point of view, in short, it is not a question of a game aimed at compromise. There's no middle ground: either you adore the style you adopt, or you hate it. After all, the art design, between posters, bizarre enemies and residential neighborhoods made up of charming villas, follows in all respects the trends, fashions and tastes of the aforementioned decade. The overall result is coherent, credible, pleasant, provided you are in tune with the aesthetic dictates promoted by the game. Retro gutting The white weapon with which the protagonist of Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer is equipped, recharging over time, can release powerful bursts of energy The illusion of being in your hands an FPS from the good old days is not broken at all when you savor the gameplay. Compared to the founding fathers of the genre, the only opening to modernity that Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer grants itself is the completely free and fluid management of aiming. For the rest, that is, what was valid for the 1993 Doom, including the rhythm and the taste for collectibles hidden everywhere, the same is also true in this case. The levels, with a relatively small size, offer the same mix of shootings, platforming phases and solving puzzles mostly related to finding keys or mechanisms to be activated to pave the way and thus reach the finish line. There's no room for who knows what kind of interaction with the scenery, nor is the control scheme broken down into complex or numerous commands. You shoot, you change your weapon, you interact with the scenario through the only button assigned to the task, stop. The arsenal itself does not consist of many mouths of fire. The white weapon, a pair of pistols, a sort of shotgun, a bizarre grenade launcher, a missile launcher and a gatling gun represent the sample of death tools that the protagonist can use during his carnage. In Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer there is no shortage of bizarre settings Yet, in its basic nature, Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer keeps you glued to the screen. The tight backtracking required in the levels, the rhythm with which the enemy hordes alternate, the relative variety of proposed scenarios, the good feedback returned by each weapon, capture the gamer in a pleasant whirlwind of furious shootings and moments in which you explore palm to palm the setting in search of the hidden path. In any case, it is certainly not in this game that you will find something original, given the declared intention of the developers to beat, in every possible sense, a path already traveled in the past, crafting, if anything, a tribute with a familiar and already known look for longtime fans of the genre.", "date": "2023-06-07", "grade": "7.0"}
