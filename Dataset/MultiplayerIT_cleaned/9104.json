With Zen Wars, the US developer has decided to stay once again between castles and sieges, but it does so through game mechanics which, although they may seem completely new in the midst of the iOS offer, will ring an alarm bell for who followed the Atari scene in the 90s. In fact, if Angry Birds has revived the idea behind Crush the Castle, Zen Wars replicates the concept behind Rampart in a not too veiled way, a small cult currently considered one of the ancestors of today's tower defense. In command of a small oriental village, the player's aim is thus to erect fortresses and defend them from continuous enemy assaults, strengthening their defenses and attacking the opposing units that will try to besiege them. The art of war Each level that makes up the short single-player campaign is built on a turn-based structure, in which the player has two strategic phases and a decisive one available. In the first phase you have a whole minute to match pieces of wall and surround your towers, a fundamental condition if you want to have any chance of survival in the following rounds: in fact, only cannons completely enclosed within a wall can fire against the enemy, and so a tiny breach is enough to render them unusable. Furthermore, each piece has the shape of a more or less elaborate tetromino, transforming this very first phase into a sort of Tetris game, although it will become increasingly difficult to be able to fit the pieces well once the scenario is littered with fragments of walls. Once the time is up, the player will be given only about ten seconds to place the cannons inside the newly created fences: progressing in the campaign will unlock laser beams and catapults capable of confusing enemy units, but in the end we find ourselves most of the time to prefer the traditional cannons, cheaper and more effective. In the third and final stage, the player uses the newly placed cannons to fire on the advancing enemy, trying to take down as many soldiers as possible before time runs out. All this is done by simply tapping on the points where you want to fire, but the variety of opposing units ensures a minimum of challenge: some will be able to build bridges that will facilitate the siege of the army, while others are equipped with huge and devastating cannons, and it will be up to the player to decide which one to eliminate first. Once the last phase is over, you start all over again, using the pieces of wall to strengthen your defenses or rebuild the fences where they were destroyed by enemies. The pieces will become more and more articulated and difficult to fit together but this, combined with some timid attempts to add variety to the missions, does not prove sufficient to give depth to the gameplay. However, you do not have enough time to get bored: before you can realize the repetitiveness of the mechanics, the single-player campaign ends abruptly, so much so that it is possible to complete it within a scant hour. However, the experience continues in the company of a few friends online or locally, thanks to a multiplayer mode that highlights the strategic component of the game by placing the two opponents facing each other. Here, more than in the single-player campaign, one is often forced to hit one's own walls to create enough space and freely fit the more complex pieces, but an inaccurate input system occasionally leads to missing the target. As if that weren't enough, the amount of players online is so low that it is almost impossible to find someone to play with, making the multiplayer option inaccessible to those without friends who share the same game. With all its more or less relevant flaws, Zen Wars remains a pleasant variant in the castle defense genre, characterized by original mechanics, even if performed in a fluctuating way, and above all by a remarkable graphic realization: in addition to the exquisite cartoon style and interlude full of humour, the soundtrack is also worthy, strong in an epic character that is very rare for a mobile production.
