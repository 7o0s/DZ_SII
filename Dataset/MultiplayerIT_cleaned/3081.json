{"name": "Minecraft Dungeons", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/minecraft-dungeons-recensione.html", "text": "We should have been working on the Minecraft Dungeons review for at least a month already, but the most unfortunate year of the last decade doesn't seem to want to give us a break. Mojang, due to COVID 19, was forced to postpone the release of its new title by a month, a postponement dictated by work difficulties and insufficient in any case to deliver all the promised features for day one. Minecraft Dungeons to date is thus devoid of some not bad goodies, such as crossplay between the various platforms or the possibility of using one's saves on different consoles, which could have given greater prominence to the production. However, this also allows us to immediately have an idea of what Mojang has in mind for the months to come for Minecraft Dungeons, that is, planning a large number of free and paid updates aimed at improving the gaming experience. However, today we will stop to analyze what you can find from next May 26 in the basic package which, we remind you, will also be distributed through the glorious Microsoft Game Pass. Welcome back adventurers! Minecraft is universally recognized as a pop phenomenon of inestimable value and this Minecraft Dungeons plays to leverage the popularity of its older brother. The cubic worlds of Mojang are back this time in a revised and corrected version in a simple and intuitive cooperative dungeon crawler, in short, aimed at an audience that doesn't want to keep up with excessive statistics and builds too much. This desire not to complicate things for the player is clear from the creation of the character: a simple list of skins to choose from, irrelevant in terms of gameplay. In this case, the presence of six skins to be purchased separately as DLC and the consequent impossibility of being able to customize the textures or colors of our hero at will leaves us with a bitter taste in the mouth. Choosing between one character and another won't make any difference and the total absence of dialogue or moral choices within the game makes this first step essentially superfluous. No classes, therefore, but not even initial skills or other various amenities: let yourself be guided by instinct and jump into the game without thinking too much. Your task will be to save the inhabitants and defeat the Arch-dweller, chasing him through nine levels to prevent him from fully exploiting the power of the Sphere of Dominance and thus subjugating the entire population. On your way there will obviously be well-known faces from the Minecraft universe, such as the Creeper for example, but also some unpublished enemies ready to give greater depth to the lore of the product. The plot is veiled at the beginning of each level and is only used as a pretext to make you travel between the different areas: so don't expect anything really memorable or engaging, it's a simple sop introduced to guide you throughout the adventure. Indeed, the whole sense of the game is precisely to forget about the narrative and throw yourself headlong into the various dungeons by repeating them an infinite number of times, with the only goal of leveling up, strengthening yourself and being able to go and fight on higher difficulties . A linear structure Minecraft Dungeons thus offers an extremely linear structure, taking its cue from that of the various Diablo likes, but then suddenly braking when things start to get interesting. To complete the entire adventure it will take you about four or five hours depending on your speed and luck in finding magical objects, to discover in the end that all you will be left with is the possibility to replay the entire story in Adventure mode and then Apocalypse, having to face increasingly stronger and numerous enemies, albeit of the same types encountered during your first run. The basic concept is absolutely not to be thrown away but shatters when you collide with the paucity of equipment found in each dungeon. In fact, we are talking about two or three objects at most, often totally useless for the purposes of building the character and often even surpassed by what you already find yourself wearing. In short, there is a lack of a correct balance of the drop and a real reason to continuously replay the usual ten levels. As a good self-respecting hack 'n' slash, the combat system does not require particular skills, especially if we think that there is not even a shadow of the management of dozens of skills and talents here. Mojang opted for a much more practical solution by allowing specific items, called Artifacts, to be equipped at will and become the only active skills in the game. You can equip a maximum of three at a time and theseskills will allow you to launch area magic shots, temporary healing or buffs all limited by simple cool downs without having to worry about mana or energy of any kind. Any skillshots have obviously been excluded from the equation, for a game structured to be enjoyed primarily using a controller. Talents also don't play an active role in gameplay but come in the form of passive bonuses to unlock, embedded in your weapons and armor in a semi-random way. You will therefore be able to find broadswords capable of inflaming opponents or sucking up lethal energy or even stunning throwing weapons to accompany your hunter armor thanks to which you can summon a pet to accompany you on a mission. To activate these talents you will have to invest special points given at each level up, in a virtually infinite loop of growth and enhancement. Unfortunately, the risk is that of having to forcibly change your weapon towards something that you just can't appreciate, given that given the imbalance of the aforementioned talents, the basic damage will often be the only real discriminant. Little loot and no one to talk to As we said previously, the weakest part of the production is hidden inside the drop tables, definitely too stingy. The only way to obtain additional equipment and artifacts therefore remains to rely on luck and bestow the emeralds painstakingly collected in the dungeons once you reach the camp. Don't expect anything particularly scenic since you will find only two miserable NPCs with their stalls waiting for you: a blacksmith who will sell you weapons and armor and a merchant from whom to recover the artifacts. Unfortunately in this case a mechanic strongly linked to randomness comes into play since in both cases you can only blindly buy the various goods, hoping that the content can somehow come in handy. A very short-sighted decision and which overall disappoints the player, hungry as he is to receive adequate rewards for his efforts. Despite this constipation in giving equipment, the game still manages to offer a level of challenge and a well-balanced difficulty curve, both in solo and in multiplayer, thanks to the possibility of deciding the level of the enemies to face, and consequently the quality of the loot, just before embarking on an adventure. Also interesting is the visual impact that manages, despite the characteristic style of Minecraft, to be at least varied and have its interesting moments without ever being able to really flex its muscles in terms of polygonal mass or sparkling particles.", "date": "2020-05-22", "grade": "7.0"}
