From the in-depth study on the Protheans seen in From Ashes we have gone through the remarkable Leviathan, a parallel story that served not only as a pretext for experimenting with something new, but above all the presence of an ending capable of splendidly enriching the original one. If there is something that fans were missing, however, it was the Omega space station, one of the main settings of Mass Effect 2, barely mentioned in the third chapter thanks to a cameo by Aria T'Loak, but nothing more. Just the conversation with the asari left an unpleasant feeling of incompleteness. Well, the new DLC Mass Effect 3: Omega arrives precisely to fill this gap, drawing a big question mark in the player's head: is it a content voluntarily omitted for mere profit or an unmissable opportunity to put on Shepard's shoes again? Blessed among women As usual, the content is activated by consulting the emails in the Normandy's terminal and requires a save prior to the game's ending. Shepard receives an invitation from Aria in the Citadel, but is directed to a new location functional to the deepening of information already known. Omega has become a Cerberus military post, the population has been isolated and mercenaries driven away or killed. The asari asks Shepard to join her in a mission to recover the station, which is the main setting of this new adventure. With the help of a Batarian fleet, the couple manages to penetrate the defenses through a highly spectacular pre-calculated sequence, from here they begin to take up arms. The story is enriched by a new set of characters, we discover that the station is controlled by a cunning Cerberus general, Oleg Petrovsky, while it is not long before he meets the first known female Turian in the world of Mass Effect, Nyreen Kandros. Through the numerous interlude scenes and dialogues we discover the various nuances of these characters in a story completely independent of the basic narrative line and full of twists and turns. Another interesting detail is represented by the impossibility of choosing teammates, Shepard faces the entire adventure with Aria and Nyreen, with some sections that will see him operate completely alone. Although there are no particular novelties in the fights, the presence of two new types of enemies manages to slightly refresh the formula, and Aria's biotic powers are heavily felt. Indeed, it is necessary to make the most of the Asari precisely to get out of many of the furious clashes that await us. Bioware seems more inspired than on past occasions, proposing a level design that expertly exploits confined spaces and covers. Nothing revolutionary compared to the structure we know, but it must be admitted that everything is undoubtedly well orchestrated. On many occasions, the enemies have ample opportunity to surprise us from behind by exploiting the alternative routes of the maps, thus making the clashes always tense. Although the progress is linear, there are two hub areas that give some breathing space and offer alternative missions, in reality little more than objects to recover, but their presence is certainly welcome. Last but not least, on a couple of occasions the programmers enjoy dilating the pace, facilitating atmospheres vaguely inspired by Dead Space and definitely appreciable. The constant presence of closed doors to bypass, on the other hand, turns out to be a bit suffocating, a clear pretext for masking the loads but which at least avoids interrupting the action excessively. Tough choices As it was easy to imagine, the outstanding feature of this production is still the high magnetism caused by the universe of Mass Effect. Excluding the setting, undoubtedly fascinating and able to exploit the nostalgia effect (we will also review the Afterlife), it is always the characters who glue to the armchair thanks to a brilliant series of dialogues. Bioware has no rivals in this field, there's little to go around it, the ability with which it manages to convey the viewer's emotions is simply admirable. There is never a safe line in which to take refuge, often the finger trembles on the choice to make, but there are never any judgements, only consequences. The narrative maturity is able to elevate the events towards metaphors of not negligible depth. At one point a character exclaims ~Always be true to yourself,~ as if to suggest that it doesn't matter how many Paragon or Renegade points you accumulate, the only thing that matters is the intensity of the experience.Aria T'Loak often steals the show with her severe and angular temperament, but which does not hide an underlying fragility capable of enriching her personality. She is one of the most successful characters, able to take Shepard through a painful path of moral choices that will define the relationship between the two. The Italian dubbing is also excellent, as always. However, it must be said that this DLC is not all rosy, the final part suffers a bit from all points of view, testifying to obvious production drops, and it is a factor that should not be underestimated for a four-hour experience , sold at a rather high price. Furthermore, doubts about content probably removed (or not adequately developed) from the original game to be sold separately are not entirely dispelled, even if it is unlikely that Bioware has not worked on it considering the duration of the adventure and the extent of the new additions. In any case, it remains a controversial policy that does not shy away from exposing its side to criticism. Regardless of all this, Mass Effect 3: Omega is a product that we would like to recommend, while it remains a mandatory purchase for anyone who loves this saga.", "date": "2012-12-05", "grade": null}
