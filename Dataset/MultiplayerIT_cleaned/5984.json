There are many pitfalls for such a project and the risk of completely distorting a product like Dragon Quest in the eyes of historical fans of Yuji Horii's fantastic worlds should not be underestimated. However, to be optimistic, there is also the possibility of finding yourself in front of a title which, thanks to the introduction of a whole series of role-playing mechanics taken from the main series, for the first time manages to give new life to a genre, that of the musou, for too many years the same and difficult to digest by the western public. While in the lands of the rising sun the Omega Force titles grind copy after copy with each new release, the rest of the world if it does not see associated successful brands often linked to the world of manga or anime is very reluctant to give these titles a chance. but with Dragon Quest Heroes this trend is finally about to change. Dragon Quest Heroes manages to sweeten the musou formula with some very interesting RPG elements A new threat The impressive introduction of elements typical of role-playing games is certainly the best quality of Dragon Quest Heroes, which puts us in the shoes of two protagonists called to defend the Kingdom of Arba from a mysterious threat that has undermined the peaceful passing of the days. Suddenly the monsters have gone mad and started attacking humans under the evil influence of a shady figure who wants to take over the power by sending the whole kingdom into turmoil. Initially the two soldiers of the imperial guard Aurora and Lucyus are called to the defense of King Doric, but soon they will find themselves traveling the world with a large group of companions all usable in battle. The plot does not reserve anything particularly profound or unexpected, but it is enough to keep the interest alive and to drag us along the various chapters for dozens of hours. As per the tradition of the series, given the involvement of a master like Akira Toriyama in character design, it is not possible in any way to intervene on the somatic features or on the personalization of the protagonists, obviously outside of paraphernalia and equipment necessary to improve their statistics. Once we took up the sword we found ourselves faced with a very simplified combat system of clear musou derivation with the presence of a fast attack and a charged one, the parry and the lateral dodge. However, there are some variations designed to give greater depth to the clashes, such as the possibility of casting spells by consuming magic points. Each character has three magical attacks at his disposal that underline his abilities: for example, Aurora masters the elements of ice to freeze enemies and Lucyus is a skilled swordsman capable of sinking fiery thrusts causing huge area damage. King Doric is slower but very strong, Juliette can count on her crazy inventions to hit from a distance while Alena is unstoppable if she manages to ring together the most articulated combos. Furthermore, by landing a certain number of hits, a temporary boost is activated which allows you to use repeated magic attacks without consuming magic points and to suffer less damage, ideal for the challenging boss fights scattered throughout the levels. Variety is guaranteed between fire-breathing dragons, cyclops and laser-armed robots, with some fights requiring head-on combat and others requiring the use of cannons or crossbows scattered throughout the scenario. The enemies themselves are quite varied, with the iconic slimes alternating with skeletons, flying bats, funny and ravenous felines, knights with mighty shields, wizards and monsters of all kinds, all very well characterized. Fine medals By calling into question the other Omega Force titles, including the recent Hyrule Warriors which as a concept follows the same logical thread of the spin-off taken from a franchise that has nothing to do with the musou, we confirm a substantial improvement in the structure of the missions: in general there are fewer enemies on screen, they don't go down with just one hit and each of them is well cared for in terms of modeling and animation quality. On the level design front, the multiple objectives of each mission require a less superficial approach than those faced by Link where it was enough to throw himself head-on against the enemy, above all due to the introduction of Medals to be useduse to summon monsters to fight alongside you and defend an objective under attack from multiple directions. You can use the sentinels who limit themselves to defending a small perimeter around the area where they have been summoned, or the activists who launch themselves into the attack of the enemy. It is therefore necessary to decide which monsters to summon and where to place them based on those available and then constantly run back and forth trying to destroy the dimensional gates by stopping the invasion. It is certainly an interesting introduction that adds depth to the gameplay, but which in the long run does nothing but conform to a repetitive formula again, where the success of most of the levels will be linked to the survival of an objective, be it this a generator, bridge, side character, or valuable item being targeted simultaneously by monsters coming from different directions. To ensure further depth to Dragon Quest Heroes we think the fourteen playable characters to unlock throughout the story and combine in the party of up to four players. This is where the role-playing contaminations that are completely absent in the spin-off dedicated to The Legend of Zelda come into play: each wrestler is well characterized from the point of view of utility in battle, even if they are all completely devoted to attack, lacking the possibility of deploying a healer or a particularly armored companion to absorb the damage of the most difficult bosses. However, there are some monsters that suffer more from fire rather than electric attacks, and then it becomes necessary to choose the right companions based on the spells to get to the end of the level more easily. In battle it is also possible to switch from one character to another instantly by pressing L2 and use the one who seems more suitable to face a certain type of enemy, while in the navigation sections and in the game hubs we will have control of one of the already mentioned Aurora and Lucyus, the real protagonist couple of the title. Playstation 4 trophies Dragon Quest Heroes: The World Tree and the Roots of Evil offers 50 trophies, of which 36 are bronze, 11 silver and 2 gold, to which is added the inevitable Platinum. It starts from the simplest tasks like finishing the tutorial up to the most challenging ones, like bringing all the characters to level fifty, creating a hundred accessories with alchemy and completing all the missions. Musou and RPG During the adventure, the Nubirock spaceship acts as a hub to have access to the missions on the game world map and to the more strictly role-playing part, which includes weapons and equipment to be bought with the money earned in battle, the crafting of objects more or less rare, the awarding of skill points and the trade of precious materials. The merchant updates his price list quite often, while the alchemist makes rings, necklaces and bracelets by combining specific raw materials that are obtained from fighting enemies or from trunks scattered throughout the scenarios. It is also possible to find maps that add caves to the game world, even if they are not real caves since they reuse the scenarios of the main adventure. These together with the secondary missions are very useful for accumulating experience points and gold so as not to find yourself too disadvantaged in the following chapters of the story, where the power of the enemies constantly increases. This is where the musou nature of the title emerges most overbearingly, with missions in which all you have to do is run around the map to kill as many monsters as possible while waiting for a new wave to take the place of the previous one. However, everything makes sense in terms of improving the characters and everyone's skill tree, full of upgrades and new attacks to be unlocked by spending the skill points earned by accumulating experience points, fortunately shared among all the characters even if not directly employed in the party. Precisely this sense of progression fills one of the biggest critical points of Hyrule Warriors which totally lacks party management mechanics and an engaging character evolution system capable of keeping players glued to the pad for dozens of hours. Even from a technical point of view, Dragon Quest Heroes distances the Nintendo exclusive, thanks to the cartoon-style cel shading embellished with a bright color palette full of nuances, as well as the unique trait of the aforementioned master Toriyama. The settings still suffer, non-destructible and covered with rather flat and not very detailed textures, an unmistakable sign of the development between two generations of consoles. The actionit always flows fluid and granite at 60 frames per second even with the screen full of enemies, interspersed only by the computer graphics cut scenes that tell the most important facts of the story and leave room for ironic situations peppered with Japanese humor, which do not struggle to get some smiles. The only two problems we have encountered concern the management of the view, especially in the battle against large bosses where the camera tends to get stuck in the polygonal models blocking the view; and on the other hand, we were not satisfied with the game interface saturated with information, with the map and indicators that sacrifice the action on the screen.", "date": "2015-10-12", "grade": "8.0"}
