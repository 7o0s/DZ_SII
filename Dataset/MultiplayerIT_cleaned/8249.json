The present Plicplic diligently respects the two parameters just described, but will he be able to rise above the real chaos of similar to him? Rise of the umbrella As expected, Plicplic has a very simple game structure, which leverages a few concepts and an absolutely immediate control system. The protagonist is a nice umbrella that floats in a scenario that brings to mind the old Super Mario titles, above all thanks to the rounded hills that stand out in the background. Pressing your finger on the touchscreen lets you momentarily lose altitude in favor of the direction you moved, while releasing it coasts back to the center of the screen. As with all endless runners, the aim is to go as far forward as possible, or rather higher, since Plicplic develops completely vertically. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to take advantage of the control scheme just described to collect the stars that parade in the lower part of the display: each of them gives the umbrella a momentary boost, while collecting three or more in series with a single swipe gives the start of a short but intense turbo phase in which one is immune to external dangers. These are represented not only by the birds that cut across the screen horizontally, but also by the raindrops that appear from time to time and which can slow the ascent just enough to ruin the user's plans. A simple contact with the aforementioned birds leads to the immediate game over, but Plicplic has a good game in discouraging an overly cautious and consequently potentially boring approach to action: in fact, a whole series of actions are contemplated which envisage a certain factor of risk (for example passing under a passing bird) but whose reward is a multiplier capable of exponentially increasing the final score. In addition to the stars and birds, then, the game screen is also occasionally crossed by power-ups that guarantee momentary benefits of various kinds, while during one's ascent one often comes across groups of coins to collect and spend in the appropriate shop to enhance some characteristics of the protagonist umbrella. In short, Plicplic puts all the ingredients of the perfect modern endless runner on the plate, nevertheless it is ultimately a little less enjoyable and fun than its more illustrious colleagues. The main reason is the generous random factor that can lead to the end of a game: whereas in other similar titles the possible failure is mainly due to a lack of reflexes of the user, here the inertial movements of the parasol and a system consequently inaccurate control can lead to much more frequent and ~undeserved~ game overs. Plicplic still makes up for it thanks to its relaxed pace of play and above all to a delightful audiovisual sector, but at the end of the day it is one of those titles that hardly anyone will remember in the months to come....", "date": "2012-10-19", "grade": "7.4"}
