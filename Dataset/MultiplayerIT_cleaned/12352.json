{"name": "Sid Meier's Pirates! - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sid-meiers-pirates-recensione.html", "text": "From PC with love Released in 2004 on personal computers, the remake of the classic dated 1987 met with great success both with critics and with the public at the time, even earning an adaptation for X-box a few months later. For the PSP version, the programmers have chosen to keep the game experience and all the contents of the original unchanged, with some compromises only as regards the technical aspect which in any case has never been particularly evolved even on the occasion of the debut on pc. The plot that forms the background to the events is indeed rather weak and banal; son of a family of wealthy merchants, the protagonist experienced the drama of seeing his loved ones arrested unjustly during his childhood, and when he reached maturity he decided to leave in an attempt to free them. But you know, without money you can do very little, and so what better solution than becoming a pirate? Pirates is therefore a not particularly complex strategy but not for this less engaging, on the contrary; the greatest value of the 2K Games production, which in the end is nothing more than a collection of more-or-less-mini games, lies precisely in the ability to continuously provide the player with new stimuli, until quickly reaching the famous syndrome of ~5 more minutes and then I'll stop~. Once you have passed a brief preliminary phase in which you are called to choose the specific skills of your alter ego, the time comes to start the actual game, starting from one of the many ports available. These represent one of the focal points of the game, since docking there opens up a series of actions in front of the protagonist that can be performed in the place in question. Go to the tavern, for example, to enlist sailors, get information from the bartender and waitress or buy objects and secrets from some shady figure; or go to the merchant, to sell or buy goods at attractive prices, or repair and upgrade the boats of your fleet, or even go and talk to the governor to obtain the concession to attack hostile boats. Once set sail, we are faced with the most ~action~ part of the product, with dozens of boats of various flags from which to stay away or on the contrary to attack at will, after having evaluated their fire potential; in case you choose the path of confrontation, you need to pay attention to the direction of the winds to use them in your favor in order to get next to the enemy boat and then give the green light to the cannons. The battles can also have a ~aftermath~ in case you go to invade the bridge with your crew, since in this case it is necessary to challenge the opposing captain to a duel with the white weapon through a mini-game that is actually too simplistic. Winning these clashes brings with it not only the money and the goods kindly granted by the defeated galleon, but also the good reputation in the eyes of the governors of the friendly ports, who can give their daughters for a ball (also represented by an extremely simple minigame ) with the result of obtaining valuable information also from the bridesmaids in question. But obviously there are not only friendly ports, but also enemy ones, and docking there means having to try to infiltrate without being discovered by the guards, in order not to risk ending up in a cell for a few months. The variety of Pirates is also further emphasized by the turn-based land battles, in which in control of a handful of men divided into three unit types for close or ranged attacks, you must attempt to outmaneuver the enemy using your own I also favor terrain features or vegetation to be able to hide. A strategy to recommend As for the graphic component, Pirates is certainly not the ideal game to amaze your friends; the rather stylized graphic style and the compromises necessary to guarantee the excellent loading speed have led a product that was already far from impressive from an aesthetic point of view to become a bit spartan in this portable edition. Nonetheless, the style is certainly of good quality, to the point of being able to turn a blind eye to technical deficiencies without problems; even the sound is not that great, extremely poor to the point of leaving the game without any type of audio accompaniment on numerous occasions. Continuing with the negative aspects, the game interface and menus, while functional, appear exaggeratedly minimalist; for example, entering cities, interacting with characters and moving around the various premises are aesthetically practically identical in any port you land on, and most of the actions arenot managed only through text menus. And the quality of the various mini-games is also slightly fluctuating, some of them - as already mentioned - a little too repetitive and not very deep, especially after having played them a few dozen times. But overall it's really hard not to recommend Sid Meier's Pirates to any PSP owner willing to spend several hours playing one of the most valuable games in the entire line-up of the Sony handset. Comment Sid Meier's Pirates also confirms on PSP the excellent impression he made on his debut on PC and with the subsequent edition for X-box, also finding an extremely happy place on the Sony laptop thanks to a game structure suitable for games of both a few minutes than several hours. Extraordinarily engaging and intriguing, the 2K Games production does not reach peaks of excellence only for a really too spartan technical component, especially in the interface, flanked by the presence of some mini-games not up to the others. But even with these ~flaws~, Pirates remains a highly recommended game. Pros Incredibly addictive Excellent variety Long-lived like few Cons Modest graphics Menu too spartan Insufficient audio The fact that PSP has become the preferred platform for conversions from other formats has certainly not been a source of pride for the Sony portable, which has always been in serious shortage of exclusive productions that push its sales to the levels of the now unattainable Nintendo DS. Nonetheless, it may happen that one of the aforementioned conversions finds in PSP not only an ideal environment for its characteristics, but even goes on to constitute one of the most recommended titles of the last few months for users of the handheld in question. This is indeed the case with Sid Meier's Pirates.", "date": "2007-04-17", "grade": null}
