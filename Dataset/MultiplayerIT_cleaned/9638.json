{"name": "La rivolta delle macchine", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/82428-revolt-la-rivolta-delle-macchine.html", "text": "If we exclude the thousand clones of Canabalt, Farmville or Doodle Jump, one of the most abused genres on the App Store is certainly represented by the twin-stick shooters. Free or paid, in the arena or in vast spaces, with cartoon or realistic graphics, there really is something for everyone. The latest addition is titled Revolt, and is the result of the work of the independent developer Kristopher Peterson, who, like many others, preferred to cure elements already consolidated in the genre rather than introduce risky innovations. The result is a sci-fi shooter, with accurate polygonal graphics, explosions galore and a significant amount of enemies, weapons and power-ups. Robocracy Revolt strives to accompany the thousand shootings with a sketchy post-apocalyptic storyline. The year 2012 has once again been disturbed, but this time it coincides with the rebellion of the machines which, over the decades, have managed to subjugate the entire human race, giving life to the so-called Robocracy. The player thus takes on the role of Guy, a decidedly anonymous rebel, both in name and in character design: the choice is probably due to the intention of immersing the player more, but the result is bad, and the impression is that of following a puppet in his fight against robots. Unfortunately, apart from a couple of poor illustrations, the whole story is told through the short lines of text that introduce each level. A pity, since there is no shortage of interesting nuances and a rather unpredictable final twist. To come to the aid of more or less skilled players, Revolt offers three different levels of difficulty, while the unlockable achievements on Game Center would give you an excuse to replay the adventure over and over again. However, the conditional is a must, because the eight game levels are all too similar to each other, all set within narrow and anonymous laboratory rooms: a dull level design and a repetitive alternation of corridors and rooms makes the very unpleasant exploration. As if that weren't enough, the total absence of reference points, combined with the possibility of rotating the camera at will, sometimes risks confusing and disorienting the player, who could unwittingly find himself going in circles or going backwards. Revolt recovers during firefights, although slightly wooden controls do not allow to reach the same degree of satisfaction given by Minigore or Guerrilla Bob. The real strength of the game lies in the variety of weapons to unlock and upgrade, ranging from simple pistols to very powerful rocket launchers: each of these little gems has different upgrade levels, which can be reached by spending the money you collect between levels. There is no shortage of armor or grenades of various types, capable of paralyzing the opposing droids, setting them on fire or blowing them directly into a thousand pieces. In this case, throwing a grenade near a series of fuel tanks and creating pyrotechnic ripple effects is quite satisfying, but the action can never get fast enough due to the small number of opponents: regardless of the level of difficulty, in fact, you are never assaulted by waves of robots, who rather prefer to welcome you one or two at a time. Precisely for this reason some ideas, such as the ability to avoid bullets by rolling on the ground, become almost useless, and you are never in a situation unpleasant enough to force you to flee. In addition to the short campaign, the developer then decided to add a Survival mode, in which, in a rather traditional way, the aim is to survive as long as possible the increasingly numerous waves of enemies; having eliminated a series of opponents, the player can decide whether to upgrade their weapons or defenses, a choice that becomes increasingly important as the robots become more aggressive. Technically, the work done by Peterson is rather fluctuating: an overall good graphic realization must contend with an unstable frame rate, which shows its worst in the event of large explosions, while some animations appear awkward or sketchy. Support for Game Center and OpenFeint allows you to share your Survival mode score with your friends, as well as enriching the game with twenty unlockable achievements. However, if the developer had gone further and added an online cooperative or competitive mode, by now Revolt would have to offer something better than a handful of levels that are all the same.
