{"name": "Haven: Call of the King", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/haven-call-of-the-king.html", "text": "My namey is Haven, and I have a job to savey the worldu Difficult to remain impassive in front of the presentation of Haven: Call of the King. Once the ~New game~ option has been selected from a menu characterized by a difficult to digest design, we see a real-time introduction that illustrates the poor plot underlying the Midway product: the classic ugly, bad and unscrupulous despot learns that a slave named Haven could represent a danger to his own dictatorship, due to his tendency to hear an elusive ~voice~, an omen of revolt action. It goes without saying that the subject in question is the protagonist of the game, who will find himself having to try to overthrow the bad guy's regime without disdaining to save the inevitable girl in danger. Two things of the intro of Haven: Call of the king instill in the player the suspicion of being faced with a mediocre production: namely the aforementioned character design to scream (of terror) and an Italian dubbing performed by Anglo-Saxon actors, a disturbing expedient already used in Time Crisis: Project Titan which however is probably the best managed aspect of the game. At least that's fun The moment is cathartic While ~funny~ is not exactly an adjective that fits perfectly with the title Traveller's Tales. True to their curriculum, the development team has created a trivial, uninspired, and above all boring 3D platformer. To get an idea of Haven: Call of the king, just think of a Jak & Daxter (the game structure is substantially identical) stripped of all the most captivating aspects. No element in the Midway production, except very rare occasions, manages to reach sufficient quality levels, starting with the control system: Haven's simple movement on the screen is not very precise, with the red-haired protagonist skating more than running and floating more than jump. Not to mention the management of the only weapon available to Haven, a sort of yo-yo that can be upgraded to different types of shots following the collection of certain bonuses: the lack of any lock-on system prevents you from always hitting with effectiveness the enemies on the screen, as well as the imprecision of the first person view makes aiming the weapon at specific objectives a feat. Walking in the world of Haven is also made even more tedious by a virtual camera whose inefficiency requires continuous manual adjustments to be performed with the right stick. But these are just some of the technical defects of the Traveller's Tales title, not even covertly obscured by a graphic realization up to par. Visually Haven: Call of the King shows not only a poor polygon count, but also an acidity color palette, a set of woody animations and, obviously, textures with poor definition. However, a low-level cosmetic appearance does not correspond to a sound accompaniment of equal low quality (if we exclude the Anglo-Italian speech), therefore characterized by average effects and music that is even too evocative for such an uninspired title. Haven in Hell But it is in terms of pure and simple gameplay that Haven: Call of the King takes the chair and shows everyone how NOT to create an original and captivating 3D platformer. As already mentioned, the game structure is ~borrowed~ (to use a euphemism) from Jak & Daxter: as in the Naughty Dog title, in fact, the Midway production offers the player the opportunity to explore a ~unique~ world and not rigorously broken up into stages, in which the user mainly has the task of collecting gears that perform the same function as Jak & Daxter's orbs, i.e. to allow progress in the game. Too bad that Haven: Call of the King, in addition to being affected by obvious technical shortcomings, is not even able to offer a discreet copy of a valid gameplay after all. The result is a boring, characterless, banal title, whose fate is to end up straight into oblivion. Between schemes stolen from Crash Bandicoot and bosses very far from any semblance of originality, it is clear that Traveller's Tales and the 3D platform genre have very little in common... Conclusions The partnership between Traveller's Tales and Midway has given birth to a product whose quality fully justifies the chronic lack of hype that accompanied its development. Haven: Call of the King is in a nutshell a decidedly flat 3D platformer, the perfect example of how to shamelessly copy a structureconsolidated game like that of Jak & Daxter is not enough to create a qualitatively satisfactory product. Try it again, Traveller's Tales. But maybe with another genre Pro Appreciable musical accompaniment The tragicomic dubbing into Italian by Anglo-Saxon voices elicits more than a smile Solid game scheme, albeit not very original. Cons Trivial and poorly made game system Poorly precise controls Bad management of the camera Technically (very) subdued Character design among the worst ever seen in history The development of Haven: Call of the King is, needless to deny it, passed decidedly on the sly. The hype formed around the Traveler's Tales platform was in fact extremely limited. It must be said, however, that the Midway production certainly did not appear in the most attractive of ways: the team in charge of the development did not enjoy great fame (especially after the sensational flop of the last, disappointing episode of Crash Bandicoot), and the look general of the game did not appear exceptional, mainly thanks to a low-level character design. However, history tells us of notorious ~sleeper hits~, little ~advertised~ titles that in the end proved to be decidedly successful.
