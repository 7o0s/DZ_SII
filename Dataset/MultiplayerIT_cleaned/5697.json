It is impossible not to notice the lack of mounts and flight, strong points of most modern persistent worlds, but before shaking your head it is good to keep in mind that in return we are guaranteed agile characters, samples of platform phases, glides complete with sprints and action-packed combat. The narrative itself is characterized by excited interlude scenes which, thanks to the rather lean leveling, follow one another quickly, allowing us to enjoy a plot undoubtedly full of stereotypes but flowing and not without twists. The only major obstacle to a growth experience largely usable alone are the dungeons, often essential for equipment and requiring a party, but even in this case things run smoothly thanks to a cross-country lobby. server that is reachable at any time, includes options for selecting participants and guarantees the virtually instantaneous creation of a playgroup. The quests are not always inspired and can trigger a pinch of monotony but once you reach the fifteenth level, the PvP Arena appears, which can also be tackled in three against three, which automatically balances the characters, includes a ranking system, guarantees good prizes and enhances the combat action . In addition, there is the open world PvP which has the advantage of being integrated into the game fabric and is even essential for obtaining some pieces of equipment. Worn the dress of one of the two main factions, specifically Crimson and Cerulean, specific quests become available made potentially complicated by the fact that with one of the two outfits on, it is possible to be attacked by the wearer of the other. Ready for the verdict on Blade & Soul, an MMO that makes combat its strong point As a Kung Fu master Let's go back to talking about the peculiarities of Blade & Soul which include the aforementioned combat, equipment management, instances that can be tackled by 24 players even without having to create a party and the loot attribution system, which is based on an auction whose pot final is distributed among all those who did not get any drops. Alternatively, you can choose the classic ~round robin~ mode, while the random mode is missing, which would certainly be useful when playing with friends. The action soul manifests itself in dodging, tripping, reactivity, direct aiming and countermoves which, which is rare and appreciable, also allow you to block some boss attacks. There is no shortage of reload times and some moves with automatic aiming but reactivity, combos and mobility are always vital, guaranteeing importance to the player's skill which is also reflected in the optimization of energy, in the moves available only under certain conditions and in the organization of group, which allows you to keep even the most powerful bosses at bay by tripping, immobilizing and hurling giant scorpions, demons and immense birds into the air. Reading the action isn't always easy, and enemy move markers sometimes get mixed up with area-of-effect spells and other effects, but the combat works quite well and allows any player to get by even without healers. In order not to die, it is important to understand how iframes work, moves that make you invulnerable for a few seconds and are essential for surviving the various special attacks that are not always avoidable. The Kung Fu Master has several and for this reason, thanks to an effective counter, he can act as a tank even if it is not easy to use due to the need for very high reactivity and the possible ping problems related to it. In a group, however, it is always possible that the others keep the bosses and any henchmen busy, helping them by taking advantage of the crowd control and support moves that are available for all classes. The best upgrade has a very long recharge time but generously increases the damage of all companions and can be decisive. On the other hand it prevents you from using the ground hold which can be useful in certain situations, but before tackling them it is always possible to resort to the ~respec~ which now includes four presets, one of which is designed for PvP. The fulcrum of the equipment are the Hongmoon objects that evolve together with the hero with the sacrifice of certain objects, by defeating world bosses or instances and thanks to special shopkeepers who require currencies often linked to dungeons of increasing difficulty. We leaveand with the weapon that can also be upgraded with gems to progress to jewels and finally arrive at belt, bracelet and so on. The clothes, on the other hand, have an exclusively aesthetic function, excluding faction PvP, but to replace the classic sets is the Soul Shield which guarantees important bonuses for each individual piece and further bonuses once three, five or eight pieces are combined. Initially the evolution of the equipment is rapid and inexpensive but once you get to the forty-fifth you need more and more materials for each individual advancement, which also requires keys to open the chests and charms to remove the seals from the objects. And it is here that the Korean soul of Soul & Blade manifests itself, confronting us with the need to spend a lot of time in farming, daily missions and crafting. With a little organization it is possible to achieve any goal but it takes time and enough patience to resist the repetition. This is because currently there are few high-level instances, the open world PvP is not able to break the monotony of the daily faction contents and crafting goes through forced interdependencies and long cooldowns, all different from each other, which make it cumbersome and slow down the growth of professions artificially. Violence does not solve problems One-on-one battles are at the heart of the PvP arena, but they also play a role in single player thanks to the challenges against the heroes and monsters that dwell in the Mushin Tower. Coming with five Hongmoon specialization levels and a massive dungeon in the latest patch, the tower is a major addition for solo players and a very useful tool for testing your skills and upgrading your gear. Those who prefer the clamor of the crowd can count on the open world PvP whose missions are necessary to obtain new advancements, powerful items and materials for crafting. Unfortunately in this case the still imperfect balance of the classes is combined with the often overwhelming disparity of the equipment, with sometimes frustrating even if avoidable results. The maps are in fact divided into different channels which, while not representing a particularly elegant solution, allow the two factions to face the same area without meeting. If nothing else, the disparities in equipment can be filled and the premium status, obtainable with the game currency and structured in levels that guarantee increasing bonuses, does not involve overwhelming advantages. Of course, the possibility of obtaining some materials by putting your wallet in hand is not the happiest but this is certainly not the main defect of Blade & Soul. Neither are the limits of the graphics engine nor of the interface, which is cumbersome and full of defects but rich and completely customizable. The level of detail, there is little to go around it, is scarce but the settings are spot on, colorful and lively, trodden by characters made peculiar by the countless clothes, ornaments and complex customization of the heroes. The physical structure, face and size of the heroes are markedly different for all four races and can be further extremes allowing the creation of Riace Bronzes as well as deformed little monsters. In short, there is no lack of variety that includes vocal samples of all kinds and emoticons, while the optimization that would be decidedly important given the need for a stable frame rate during the fights is missing. Furthermore, the settings lack a bit of grandeur even if suggestive landscapes and well-characterized villages are ennobled by the effective soundtrack that ranges from east to west.", "date": "2016-02-18", "grade": "7.0"}
