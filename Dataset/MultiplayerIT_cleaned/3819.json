{"name": "Civilization 6: Gathering Storm", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/civilization-6-gathering-storm-recensione.html", "text": "Before writing the review of Civilization 6: Gathering Storm, the second expansion of the last chapter of the most famous existing 4X strategy series (born when the genre was not yet called 4X), we tried to try it in several games, all with settings very different from each other. We then played a marathon against Sweden in a world made up of archipelagos, then a normal length game on very large landmasses led by the Maoris and finally a quick game with random territory generation using Hungary. In all cases we have selected the highest level of difficulty. In short, we have tried to have as complete a picture as possible of the contents of the package and their manifestation during the game. The reason is that during the games from which we obtained our recently tested Civilization 6: Gathering Storm, whose contents remain very valid even now given that very little changes compared to the final version, there were some doubts about the impact of the new features introduced into the gameplay. The verification, let's call it this way, confirmed what emerged then: Gathering Storm is an expansion designed to enrich the final part of the game in particular, while in the rest of the game its impact is much less, even if present. But let's go in order. Environmental events The core of Civilization 6: Gathering Storm is the introduction of environmental events into gameplay. Starting a new game with the expansion installed, a good number of active volcanoes appear on the map, while atmospheric phenomena with a high environmental, economic and anthropic impact occur from time to time, such as storms, floods and long periods of drought. Every atmospheric event produces positive and negative effects on the territory. For example, the flooding of a river can destroy the improvements of the tiles, but at the same time it can increase their productivity. The only one of all that has no positive implications is the tornado, a pure concentration of destruction that leaves no way out. Although they are interesting, for most of the game environmental events present themselves as impromptu moments of gameplay, that is, they affect only in the rounds in which they occur with minimal long-term effects. What really matters is climate change, which becomes central towards the end of the game, when civilizations are at least in the industrial age and pollution starts to become a real problem. To increase the specific weight of this feature, the developer Firaxis has introduced a whole series of innovations at the level of districts and resource management, without forgetting the dedicated technologies and policies, which manage to completely change the approach to the game. In particular, the world congress, which allows all civilizations to vote on decisions that have a global impact, bringing into play the weight of each one's influence, becomes of capital importance in order to be able to carry forward some policies or some economic choices . Let's take a direct example. Gameplay Driving through Sweden we found ourselves colonizing an extremely fertile territory, but at the same time fragile from an environmental point of view, whose coasts presented a high risk of flooding (visible during construction thanks to a dedicated icon). Since the game world is made up of archipelagos, the sudden rise in water due to the pollution caused by the industrial era and the intensive exploitation of oil and coal for transport and electricity risked suddenly taking away a certain number of boxes, impoverishing us inexorably and causing a sharp decline in the population. To try to curb the impending disaster, we slowed down industrialization by using our influence over the world congress. Basically we have imposed a very high tax on the construction of some polluting buildings, while we have reduced taxation on coastal barriers, which serve to contain the violence of the sea (mostly you can choose to increase or decrease the costs of entire spending areas, such as those military, but we understood each other). To pass the measures, since we knew we could meet the opposition of some civilizations in full industrial boom, we invested about two hundred influence points and obtained the favorable vote of the congress. By doing so we gained a few shifts to fight the rising waters. Unfortunately, Eleanor of Aquitaine was enraged by our aggressiveness on a diplomatic level and declared war on us, taking quite a few city-states with her (even having her fleet parade in front of the capital didn't helpto). But that, as they say, is another story. Other considerations Overall Civilization 6: Gathering Storm is a very complex expansion. In addition to the innovations already illustrated, there are others of absolute importance such as the engineering projects, i.e. the aforementioned coastal barriers, but also the construction of railways, canals, including that of Panama (one of the new marvels), tunnels and more. Each project has a cost both in economic terms and in terms of environmental impact, so as you will understand it is another addition that gains strength towards the end of the game more than in the initial rounds. The world congress itself is the harbinger of other innovations, always linked to diplomacy: for example, it is possible to compete with other companies to bring aid to a civilization affected by an environmental disaster, or to obtain a prize in some specific field. All this is linked to a new possible victory, the diplomatic one, which requires particular attention to relations with other civilizations. It must be said that even in this case we are talking about end-game content. The same goes for the new era, ideally placed in the 21st century and built around ecological progress, with the introduction of new technologies with low environmental impact or others that serve to 'clean up' the planet. The only contents that are noticeable even in the initial eras are obviously the new civilizations, all characterized very well. For example, Kristina of Sweden has great advantages in terms of scientific development and can establish the Nobel prizes in the world congress, as well as being able to build the open-air museum, while Kupe of the Maori begins her civilization at sea and gets bonuses time to found his first city. Without listing them all, let's say that the new civilizations are on the level of the others released in pairs via DLC. Of course, there's all the other content to consider here, so it's a welcome addition that doesn't feel like it's meant to sell DLC. The same goes for the new improvements, buildings and districts, which must be considered in the whole of the offer and in the functions they take on with the other additions, rather than in their singularity. To say, the channels would not have made much sense outside the ecological discourse. Finally, since we know you care, let's report that some AI behaviors have been improved. For example, in our games we have not had problems of overcrowding of religious, while some political agendas have seemed less surreal, even if still present and crucial for international relations. Only Gandhi never changes... even if in truth we are now fond of him as he is and we wouldn't really see him being a pacifist (joking... but not too much). Last note: the addition of two scenarios, one for solitary players and the other designed for online matches. The first is dedicated to the black plague and you need to be able to get your civilization through a terrible pandemic; the second is set during the First World War and is aimed at those who love the military side of the Civilization series. Of the two, we especially tried the first, which proved to be well constructed and interesting in some respects. Obviously it is not the core of the game, but it will please those who like to extricate themselves from complicated situations.", "date": "2019-02-11", "grade": "8.0"}
