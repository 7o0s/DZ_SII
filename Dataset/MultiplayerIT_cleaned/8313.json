And that's exactly what Slick Entertainment has tried to do with Shellrazer, a hybrid between shooter, running game and strategy that puts you in command of a giant combat turtle in an attempt to eliminate armies of goblins and become the most powerful and attractive tortoise in the area . Turtle to the Rescue! In each of the numerous levels that make up the Shellrazer campaign, the protagonist turtle moves from left to right and must destroy all the enemies, towers and outposts that appear one after the other along his path. Simple and a bit trivial: the basic idea is all here, but the Canadian developer has managed to make it interesting through a couple of simple details. The player is able to build a tower on the turtle's shell that can contain up to three units, each of which can be freely chosen among all those unlocked during the adventure. They range from the healer to the quick goblin with a machine gun, from the sorcerer to the slow and powerful rocket launcher, and here a small strategic component also comes into play, since the chosen units and their position on the tower influence the ease with which a given unit is attacked or the balance between attack and defense power. Slick Entertainment must have read the manual of the casual game model by heart, and predictably there is a whole series of elements that lend a hand to the player and create a minimum of progression: an in-game shop allows you to buy objects, equipment and power- up, while with the coins collected you can level up your units. Needless to say, the lazy ones can immediately get a large number of coins through in-app purchases, but even playing normally it is possible to save enough money to secure at least one boost between one level and another. The experience, it must be said, turns out to be extremely repetitive in a short time, with the player who finds himself constantly repeating the same actions within scenarios that are gradually more difficult and full of opponents; from the world map it is possible to choose different paths depending on whether you want to face bosses, free hostages and unlock new units, but with the exception of some dead ends they all lead towards the beautiful turtle that our protagonist wants to conquer. With such a large number of levels, the risk is clearly that of getting bored well before reaching the second half, when the variety of air and land enemies begins to require a much more strategic and interesting approach. If you exclude the minutes spent buying items, upgrading units and customizing your turtle, the player's long journey is limited to using the touchscreen to shoot everything that appears on the screen, speeding up the turtle's advance and occasionally both select the units to heal. However, the control system deserves a separate discussion, since the developers have provided two different schemes to adapt to both the small size of the iPhone and the large iPad screen. The first option, clearly designed for the smartphone, allows you to fire using a single finger, dragging it from the selected unit to the various enemies. This way you avoid crowding the screen and obstructing the user's view, but the best solution, especially if you play on an iPad, is to use two fingers: one to select the attacking unit and the other to move freely the fire reticle; especially in the advanced levels, the more chaotic ones and in which every lost moment is most often equivalent to groups of goblins who manage to pass their defenses, the second method is undoubtedly the most suitable.", "date": "2012-09-20", "grade": "7.0"}
