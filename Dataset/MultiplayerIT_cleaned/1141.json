{"name": "WRC 4: un Rally d'annata", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wrc-4-un-rally-dannata.html", "text": "Three to the left, it widens Without a shadow of a doubt Evolution Studios has treasured the mistakes made with the previous chapter, afflicted by some really gross programming bugs; in addition to a not always convincing car dynamics and an all too confusing management of the menus, what had cut WRC 3's legs was a delirious calibration of the level of difficulty, capable of going from very easy to enormously frustrating in the space of a setting . This year the World Rally Championship was born on very different bases, and above all it develops in an extremely satisfactory way from practically every point of view. In continuity with an idea that is not always implemented in the best way, the programmers have once again opted for a balanced game model between simulation and arcade elements, without going too far in one direction or the other. Therefore, the cars, equipped among other things with an excellent diversification in road behavior based on the peculiar characteristics of each one and a convincing sensation of their weight, do not struggle too much to respond to the player's commands while gratifying him after each corner successful or every perfectly designed drift. The difference between the various road surfaces is evident, with the car passing in a completely convincing way from the perfect adherence of the asphalt to the precarious one of the ice, clearly with gravel, mud, sand and so on in the middle. The control system, mapped as usual on the analogs for steering, acceleration and braking, responds quickly to the stimuli imparted by the player, perhaps only sinning for an excessive sensitivity of the left stick, however easy to correct via options. The game structure, rather classic from every point of view, puts the player in front of a series of races scattered across various settings in the world as per tradition for any self-respecting rally game. Unlike most of these, however, WRC 4 proves to be more lenient on off-track raids and bumps by granting the option to repair the car at the end of each single stage; which, except in the case in which you arrive at the finish line with the car completely destroyed, provides all the time needed to get back on track in perfect condition. A sacrifice of realism in favor of greater accessibility, but which probably degrades the management of the conditions of one's vehicle and favors a race conduct that is less attentive to these aspects. Adding to all this an imperfect consequence between impact (or rather ~type and extent~ of impact) and its real effect in the form of damage, it is clear that this aspect represents one of the few flaws of Sony production. change my setup As for the aesthetic aspect, WRC 4 denotes a greater balance right from the game menus; although it cannot yet be defined as streamlined and completely flowing, the step forward compared to the baroque confusion of the previous episode is evident. On the graphic side during the actual game, without a shadow of a doubt the Evolution Studios effort proves to be the best rally game that appeared on Ps2, albeit with some negligible flaws. Surely a non-annoying but visible aliasing will be the most criticized aspect, followed by a slight pop-up of the more substantial elements of the distant backdrop, but these are still imperfections that do not overshadow the goodness of the work done by the programmers. The 16 game settings, albeit with a slightly fluctuating quality, in any case manage to capture the attention with an exciting wealth of detail, but above all thanks to a truly realistic and convincing use of colors. In any case, if in the settings you can see a few too many edges or some imperfect textures, certainly this cannot be said with regard to the modeling of the cars, truly splendid and faithful copies of the real counterparts with a truly excellent quality of detail . Obviously, the lion's share is in this sense the replays, which have always been the trademark of the series and capable of enhancing the excellent work done by the graphics. The cut of the shots, extremely realistic and varied, gives the sequences all the dynamism that is typical of sport in its real version, stimulating repeated viewings to appreciate particularly successful passages or, on the contrary, analyze one's mistakes. Worth noting are the particle effects, exhilarating in the passage of the car through streams of water or small rivers, and in the same way also the reproduction of the cloud of dust raised by one's racing car, probably the most credible we have ever seen. However, the sound component is not entirely convincing; except for the songs usedwell-chosen but subject to personal tastes, leaves more than a few perplexities the work of the navigator, often late in signaling the curves and in some cases even exaggeratedly in advance, creating a deleterious confusion for the conduct of the race. He doesn't even help the voice actor of the Italian version, very aseptic and not very credible in the tone used. Finally, the online game mode, promised and then excluded at the last moment in the third chapter, was positive, which in this case offers the possibility of up to 16 players to challenge each other on a track; obviously, in order not to make everything a demolition derby race, the cars of the challengers appear as simple ghost cars. Comment WRC 4 imposes itself this season on the disappointing Colin Mc Rae 2005 thanks to the desire to renew, perfect and correct as opposed to the cloying static demonstrated by the Codemasters programmers. While winking an eye and a half to casual gamers with some choices that may not exalt the purists of the genre, the Sony production always remains on levels of absolute goodness through above all a physics and a car control system truly capable of returning the sensations to actually be behind the wheel. All this, added to a first-rate graphic component and a certainly appreciable online mode, closes the circle for what is currently the best rally game out there. Pros: Beautiful driving model Graphically really well done 16 international environments and online modes Cons: Navigator disappointing and inaccurate Accident management too accommodating Some minor graphical glitches Despite the attempts by some outsiders to aspire to the throne of best rally game for Ps2, the reality of the facts has roughly always resolved itself into a duopoly between the historic series of Codemasters, Colin Mc Rae Rally, and the effort of Evolution Studios, WRC extension. With a sort of improbable and ironic tacit agreement, over the last few years the two companies have alternated each year in the role of ~winner~. In confirmation of this trend, after last season Colin Mc Rae Rally 4 had prevailed over a WRC 3 plagued by truly unacceptable defects, on this occasion the Sony production is certainly the game to be preferred.", "date": "2004-11-12", "grade": null}
