{"name": "Mr. Saitou", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mr-saitou-recensione.html", "text": "It's been almost five years since the release of Rakuen, a video game in which players take on the role of a child trying to escape the sad reality of hospitalization by heading into the recesses of a colorful fantasy world. Behind Rakuen - which now lands on Nintendo Switch with the rich Rakuen Deluxe Edition - is Laura Shigihara, developer, composer, singer and established Twitch streamer who has dealt, among other things, with the soundtrack of Plants vs. Zombies, World of Warcraft, Deltarune and To The Moon. Shigihara has decided to return to the Rakuen universe with a short spin-off, lasting about a couple of hours. Let's take on the very curious role of Saitou - the most attentive players have already seen him in a cave in the Morizora Forest in Rakuen - transformed into a worm-blade and called to live a bizarre adventure in the depths of a fantasy kingdom totally different from the reality that goes through in everyday life. Yes, because Saitou-San is actually a Japanese salaryman hospitalized in the same hospital from which the adventure of Rakuen's child started. We tell you all the secrets of the incredible llamaworms in our review of Mr. Saitou. A terrible secret The caves visited by Mr. Saitou in the guise of a llama-worm together with the bud Brandon hide glimpses of rare beauty Like many exponents of the isekai genre (in the videogame field we could mention the recent Forspoken) Mr. Saitou also begins by showing the sad and empty life of his protagonist. Mr. Saitou (or rather, as the video game's Japanese subtitle reads, ~Saitou-San~) commutes to and from work by train, restlessly, and falls asleep exhausted next to a steaming bowl of ramen in an izakaya. We then see him lying in the station, apparently passed out; Saitou wakes up in a hospital familiar to those who have lived the adventure of the child of Rakuen.In this regard, we appreciated the return of elements already seen in the main work of what we hope will become a real series: there are minima, birds of various sizes that have the habit of placing themselves in the least appropriate places; the llama-worms, which we will return to shortly; No Holds Bard, a musical group already present in Rakuen, are also back. We don't want to spoil too many surprises for you, but suffice it to say that Saitou-San will find himself transformed into a llama-worm reliving the anxieties of his office life - only now his boss and all his colleagues are llama-worms as well. We really appreciated the irony of Laura Shigihara and the writing of the excellent dialogues, always light and funny; however, in our opinion, what made Rakuen truly unique was Shigihara's ability to tell even very tough stories by transposing them into the fantasy world of the Morizora Forest, without however renouncing to address complex and painful themes. In this case, Saitou's journey always remains very light and fun, and only in the final Shigihara pulls some very well placed tail shots that managed to move us and give us a beautiful moral. A relaxed adventure Bosstou is the blade-worm version of Mr. Saitou's feared boss Just like Rakuen, Mr. Saitou also has the unmistakable aesthetics of the products born with RPG Maker XP, and reuses many of the assets already present in the 2017 video game. This is in no way a defect: Mr. Saitou is not sold as a technologically revolutionary product, but as a low-budget indie video game capable of entertaining in a simple and immediate way, with an undoubted focus on the plot and on the amusing dialogues between surreal and totally crazy characters. In terms of gameplay, Mr. Saitou is very simple and immediate: you explore the caves where the llama-worms live, you carry out simple interactions with objects and elements of various types in the scenario, you solve puzzles that sometimes require a fair observation.In some cases, the collaboration between the worm-blade Saitou and the bud Brandon, his travel companion, is essential for the resolution of environmental puzzles. In the meantime, surreal and hilarious characters meet, enjoying Laura Shigihara's pungent irony on corporate life and its mechanisms, while mushrooms, sunflowers, sphinxes passionate about mathematics and chatty llama-worms keep the player's interest alive for the entire short duration of Mr. Saitou. If it is true that sometimes the reference to Rakuen is pushed to the extreme (several puzzles explicitly refer to similar situations in the 2017 video game, but can still be solved even by people who have not played it), it is however undeniable that Mr. Saitou remains notable for the care of its pixel art and above all forhis music, which also collaborated with Toby Fox, acclaimed author of Undertale and Deltarune. We report the absence, at the moment, of a translation into Italian.", "date": "2023-03-21", "grade": "7.0"}
