{"name": "Spiriti e affini", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/180807-malicious-fallen-spiriti-e-affini.html", "text": "Five years ago, the original Malicious brought a frenetic boss rush structure and a highly artistically inspired ~lore~ to PlayStation 3, in which we put ourselves in command of a Spiritual Vessel, a sort of puppet made up of pure energy, to face a sequence of six powerful bosses surrounded by myriads of minions at their service. The order in which the levels could be selected was free, and with each victory a new power was gained for the avatar, whose offensive capabilities depended on the Cloak of Embers, a black cloak that changed shape depending on the selected weapon, becoming if necessary also a shield or a pair of wings. There are many valuable elements of that production, which despite a barely mentioned narrative sector (to be explored by reading simple textual screenshots) managed to fascinate extremely due to the terminology used, the atmosphere and the spectacular nature of the battles. For example, the Spiritual Receptacle rested on an armchair (or a chair, in the case of the female version of the character) made up of the Cloak of Embers, which fell apart as soon as we used the controls to move the warrior and select the desired stage. Available for a few days on PlayStation Store, at the not exactly popular price of 29.99 euros, Malicious Fallen offers not only a remaster of that chapter, but also of the sequel released on PlayStation Vita in 2013, Malicious Rebirth, adding an additional boss sequence and an extra mode made especially for the arrival on PlayStation 4. Malicious Fallen is a challenging boss rush with a very inspired ~lore~, but it has some problems Things from another world If you've already had the opportunity to try the Malicious experience, you'll know exactly what awaits you: a furious and frenetic, often chaotic, action game characterized by a hardcore approach that is particularly evident at the normal challenge level, where instead facing the bosses opting for the easy level trivializes the battles extremely much. However, we will also be able to select the number of ~continues~ available, thus reaching a compromise between the harshness of certain situations and the possibility, albeit with some significant effort, of successfully overcoming them. The main limitation of the game, which unfortunately has not been resolved even in this new edition, lies in the management of the view, which in some situations is really problematic. By pressing the R1 backbone twice it is in fact possible to hook the boss on duty, but the camera will follow his movements even when they are sudden and projected upwards, preventing us from looking around and defending ourselves from the constant attack of the many minions present inside each map. To remedy the problem, you must promptly ~disengage~ by pressing R1 only once, an important operation also and above all to massacre normal enemies and thus gain the aura necessary to enhance the Spiritual Receptacle and allow it to carry out attacks that are far more effective than those normal. The possibility of freely choosing the order of the bosses has great strategic value, especially during the first of the three available campaigns: the attacks of which the Cloak of Embers is capable are initially few (a rain of ash bullets, unfortunately very insignificant , and the ~fists~, two large hands of which the cloak takes the form, which allow you to hit your opponents in a powerful way), but each defeated boss gives us a new weapon, in this case the sword, the spear, the shield and the wings, as well as a punching power-up that allows you to unleash flurries of blows by continuously pressing the Square button. Deciding when and how to acquire certain powers therefore affects the continuation of the campaign, providing us with substantial advantages based on the style and equipment we prefer. It's just a pity that some tools and moves turn out to be roughly useless, in proof of facts: the sword is devastating but too slow, the bullets tickle the bosses and only rarely is it possible to place one of the many combos that are unlocked by progressing in the story . Malicious intentions The set of maneuvers that the protagonist of Malicious Fallen can perform after the first campaign is quite complete and provides him with a large leeway against the opponents that make up the second sequence, ~Rebirth~, borrowed from the PlayStation Vita episode, and the third, ~Disfatta~, which as mentioned was created specifically for the PlayStation 4 version. We are therefore talking about extra capabilities that are grafted onto the tools already at our disposal, but which in some cases prove to be really useful; see for example the whip, a secondary skill of the lance, che allows not only to chain various minions together and eliminate them (moreover by emitting discharges that also damage any nearby bosses), but also to hook an opponent and reach him very quickly: a fundamental move when the enemies tend to move away and it becomes difficult to reach them in order to score a few hits. Of course, the original solution of the interface has been maintained, which does not indicate our vital energy except in the very aspect of the avatar: its arms and legs tend to disintegrate when it takes too much damage, and at that point it is necessary to use part of the aura scraped together to stop for a moment and heal his wounds, provided that the many threats around us allow it. This factor in particular, i.e. the presence of infinite minions that attack and interrupt our eventual combos, in some cases really gets on our nerves but is part of the formula developed by the developers: when things work, the action is frenetic and spectacular, but when you find yourself ~stuck~ in a chaos of bodies and bullets, the smile tends to disappear to make room for frustration. Playstation 4 trophies Malicious Fallen's thirteen Trophies can be obtained by completing the game's three campaigns and Pursuit mode, defeating the first boss, changing your avatar's outfit, exceeding your score on the online leaderboard, or making a successful first counterattack. It's all about the bosses As it was easy to predict, the part of the experience borrowed from Malicious and Malicios Rebirth pays duty from the point of view of polygonal complexity and effects, despite being able to count on a valid remastering work, which brought the graphics to 1080p and 60 frames per second (albeit with some dips during the most hectic phases); redrawing the textures sometimes with a few tricks, such as those of the PlayStation Vita version, whose surfaces were simply applied a high resolution filter rather than a new texture. The high artistic value of the enemies certainly remains, alternating huge and menacing figures with other small but usually more combative ones, as they are able to escape our blows more easily. The final bosses of the first two campaigns are literally huge and, as per tradition, require the destruction of certain objects before substantial damage can be done to them. The process is the same: you have to learn well all the enemy's attack patterns, study the most appropriate countermeasures to avoid being dangerously stunned (that too is a rather annoying eventuality) and then take advantage of the collected aura and the moments of relative stillness to charge energy and produce attack sequences emphasized by spiritual power. Not a small challenge, especially when it comes to the final boss of the second campaign, really difficult to defeat: as if his flying swords and all the moves that derive from them weren't enough, at a certain point he surrounds himself with a group of avatars which give no respite and make it extremely difficult to maintain the health necessary to survive, let alone be able to score a few hits. Naturally, we had high expectations for the third campaign, the one created especially for this edition, and we weren't disappointed: the assets boast great quality, the design of some bosses is truly splendid (in more than one situation, we note the closeness to the monsters of Bayonetta) and there are some bitter surprises from a narrative point of view. Finally, the extra Pursuit mode further enriches the offer by offering us the definitive battle, in which all the game's bosses take part, designed only and exclusively for the most skilled and determined players.", "date": "2017-03-11", "grade": "7.0"}
