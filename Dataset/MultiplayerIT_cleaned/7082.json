We had already complained about the ridiculous Italian / European distribution some time ago in our latest reviews. Summary of the previous episodes: years after the birth of the franchise in Japan and the broadcast of the cartoon on our local television networks, Nintendo publishes the various episodes of the game very close to each other, also proposing titles developed for Nintendo 3DS NintendoDS. And so, after playing Inazuma Eleven 3 (twice!) and the very first Inazuma Eleven, we also found ourselves inazuma Eleven Go. After crying for a few hours, we turned on our Nintendo 3DS knowing that this version is was specially developed for the latest handheld from the big N, which was enough to project us into the Raimon universe making us forget all our psychosomatic problems towards football in a flash... Inazuma Eleven Go is the first real episode for Nintendo 3DS and it shows! To the soul of football The usual, excellent introduction to cartoons - accompanied by a theme song, sung entirely in Italian, unfortunately giving goosebumps - immediately serves some characteristics of the new Inazuma Eleven very hot. The story, in this case, takes place ten years after the events of Inazuma Eleven 3 and Raimon's victory in the Football Frontier International. Victory which, unfortunately, has transformed football into something even more important for this wacky universe: controlled by the empire of the Fifth Sector, football has become ~regulated~, in the sense that the various teams are forced from above to win or lose, otherwise they will be dismantled. The new protagonist of the franchise, Arion Sherwind, will have to deal with this harsh reality, just admitted to the Raimon school and his football team, very different from the one ten years earlier: led by the very good Riccardo Di Rigo, the Raimon boys have stopped believing in their favorite sport. It will be up to Arion and his friends - as well as numerous protagonists of the prequels, now grown up, first of all Mark Evans himself - to change the team's mind and to Victor Blade, the ruthless emissary of the Fifth Sector sent to put a spanner in Raimon's works . Always absurd and ~over the top~, the plot of Inazuma Eleven Go will tug at the heartstrings of true football fans, touching on the themes of corruption and love for sport, but it will always be necessary to come to terms with a convulsive script and quite creepy. Most of the dialogues and the numerous animated sequences are well dubbed in Italian, often by the same actors who lent their voices to the local animated series: despite the somewhat childish tone, the texts are excellent and characterize the many characters well, true highlight of the story. Keep in mind that Inazuma Eleven Go, if possible, exaggerates even more than its predecessors, introducing not only the aforementioned implausible ~football empire~, but even the concept of summoners, football players capable of manifesting their inner energy in the form of a huge warrior spirit. Inazuma Eleven meets JoJo's Bizarre Adventure and Persona, in short, and the warrior spirits are obviously a new gameplay mechanic. The 3D effect Unlike the last Inazuma Eleven, where it was a simple addition, the stereoscopic effect of Inazuma Eleven Go is implemented very well. It has no relevance in terms of gameplay, but the optical illusion makes the skits of the special techniques and cutscenes even more spectacular. That warrior spirit inside me roars Inazuma Eleven Go does not differ much from its predecessors, at least in terms of gameplay. From a technical point of view, in fact, the transition to Nintendo 3DS is immediately noticeable thanks to the new polygonal engine, much more effective, and an excellent cel shading that makes everything even more cartoonish. Level-5 once again proves to be a master in exploiting Nintendo portable hardware to full or almost full capacity, as already happened with Dragon Quest IX on Nintendo DS: Inazuma Eleven Go is a real feast for the eyes, with the many details that embellish the fully polygonal models and settings. Even the sound accompaniment satisfied us quite well, although some pieces of music, however pleasant, are a little too short and the loop makes them a bit repetitive. In short, if on the technical front giant strides have been made, on that of the bare and raw gameplay the milesseldom have been more technical than content. Inazuma Eleven Go is played exactly like the other episodes of the franchise, stylus in hand: during football matches you touch the lower screen to pass the ball, intercept opposing players and select the various options and special techniques. To the latter, even more spectacular than in the past, are added the aforementioned warrior spirits: the characters will acquire them with the story and a maximum of three can be summoned per game. Warrior spirits enhance the stats of the characters who summon them and allow you to use exclusive techniques, combined or single, even more powerful. However, some of our opponents can also summon them, triggering spiritual head-to-head matches that seem to come more from a fantasy anime than from one about football. In any case, fans of Inazuma Eleven should be used to these extravagances, and the renewed visual spectacularity of the special techniques of the players and spirits will be a not indifferent plus for them, also because they imply an even more painstaking management of the formations, of the equipment and passion points. It is a pity, therefore, that most of the fundamental games of the story oblige the player to achieve certain objectives to trigger cutscenes, in the long run a bit invasive, in which the various characters comment on the unfolding of events. The optional matches, on the other hand, allow us to express our imagination in terms of strategies and formations: at a certain point, in fact, it will be possible to recruit new Raimon members thanks to the so-called ~friend packs~. The idea on paper is interesting, but it doesn't work very well: in essence, it is possible to unlock a list of characters that can be recruited, but to do so, various requirements must first be met, for example having found an object or defeated a certain team in a precise manner. The recruitment mechanism soon becomes a bit too cumbersome, and to recruit the most famous and important footballers - such as the most famous ones of the past episodes - it will be necessary to sweat the proverbial seven shirts. Finally, it is worth noting that Inazuma Eleven Go is available in two versions, Light and Shadow: the differences between them are decidedly marginal and concern, specifically, some sidequests and particular football players and warrior spirits that can only be obtained in one version rather than in the other.", "date": "2014-06-04", "grade": "8.0"}
