{"name": "Phantom Crash", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/phantom-crash_a.html", "text": "Obviously at the beginning you will save money, you will be able to buy an inexpensive mech, but still suitable for the purpose. You will be able to choose from many models belonging to three worldwide dealerships: the Japanese Kojima, the American American Stars and the Italian Gruppo Venturo (it would be nice if the Italians really started building them in the near future!). Scoobies have an original shape to say the least, since they are made thinking of animal shapes. Some look like spiders, others are bipedal and resembling some dinosaurs like Velociraptor. Once you have bought your animal-shaped mech, you will go to Wild Machines, the second-hand weapons and means of locomotion shop: yes, because you can choose how to make your scoobie move in combat: with legs, with wheels or with of tracks, depending on your fighting style and your needs. Once you have chosen the weapon and the means of locomotion with which you want to make your robot dart, you can buy a frieze or decals to further customize your fighter. You will thus go to the arena where you can start fighting to earn money and upgrade your mech by going to Plus Tech. Be careful though to balance the weapons with the scoobie's body. A fast scoobie will only be able to carry light weapons, a sturdier and heavier scoobie will be slower but with more firepower. As always, you decide what your fighting style will be. The point of Phantom Crash is not to collect as many mechs and make them all heavily armed so as to become the leader of the tournament. In fact, between one fight and another, you will find yourself exchanging small talk with the other pilots, undertaking interpersonal relationships that will lead either to friendship or to rivalry, depending on how you behave in the fights. All this surrounded by movies in perfect manga style. Establishing a good relationship with your chip will be equally important, the artificial intelligence that will monitor the scoobie you buy will have its own conscience. It will give advice during fights, but will also react arbitrarily depending on the guide animal that will be assigned to it (for example, a dog). Technically speaking.. Speaking of the technical aspect, it is noted that Phantom Crash has been made with care, but it is far from spectacular. The explosions, the ~Predator~ effect of invisibility, the weather conditions, the scenarios, are very well done, and are realistic to the right point, giving the right atmosphere of the era in which we are. The scoobies are extremely original in design and sometimes even funny, since they can be disassembled and reassembled at will as if they were Lego bricks, but in any case less realistic than the average of similar games (if we can speak of realism, since there are no ). There is an immoderate use of the motion blur effect, which despite being an effect that Xbox produces in an exemplary way, does not make it clear whether we are dealing with a title that travels at 30 fps or 60 fps. Relatively important, as Phantom Crash is smooth, fast, frantic and adrenaline-pumping, with no uncertainty in the frame rate. Graphically this title settles on good levels, but if the programmers had lost even just one more month of programming, we would have found ourselves faced with an excellent title from all points of view. Phantom Crash almost always manages to hit the target, were it not for a certain repetitiveness in the fights and the not excessive size of the areas which limits the freedom of movement of the scoobies. All in all, the latest Genki effort is an excellent title that will give fans of the genre hours of fun thanks to the game interface that allows you to create your own robot in all its components, and the original and playful design could also appeal to who has never approached this controversial video game category; moreover, I believe that it will be a great example for the other development teams dealing with mech simulators, who will certainly try to imitate the innovations (and they are not few !) that Genki has introduced in Phantom Crash. Gameplay The plot of Phantom Crash is not the most intricate. Set in the near future, in the Tokyo that we all know (and which in the game will change its name to New Tokyo), a bizarre sport is practiced, loved by both adults and children and broadcast in the universe. The sport in question is practiced with ~small~ robots (cfive or six meters maximum in height) called Scoobie. Don't be fooled by the relatively small size of these combat vehicles - they're fast, nimble and well armed. Each boasts an arsenal of four different weapons, to be mounted on the arms and shoulders. The whole arsenal can be acquired entirely during the game: starting from the classic machine gun to the guided missiles, and moving on to hand-to-hand combat with the piercing hammer. In addition to the modest dimensions that scoobies have compared to games of a similar genre, the characteristic that differentiates scoobies from the classic mechs is their ability, during combat, to make themselves invisible. The yield is the same seen in the film Predator, and therefore very spectacular to see. However, the most attentive players will still be able to see the distortion on the game scenario, and therefore hit the enemy all the same (basically, it's also a matter of training). Like all special things, this invisibility will have a duration; depending on the model of your scoobie it will vary, or it will stop working when your beloved mech is destroyed. Speaking of innovation, it is reasonable to think that the games of this genre are all alike, but in the case of the Genki title, this is not the case. In fact, Phantom Crash is distinguished precisely by the fact that, to start the tournament, you will have to buy a robot with the 200,000 New Yen available.", "date": "2002-10-30", "grade": null}
