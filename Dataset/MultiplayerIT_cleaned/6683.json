{"name": "Di nuovo nel Limbo", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/142012-limbo-di-nuovo-nel-limbo.html", "text": "Limbo probably represented one of the greatest ~indie~ experiences in the console field, helping to definitively clear this type of videogame production even on properly gaming machines, accustomed until a couple of generations ago to very different types of management and distribution. Furthermore, there is no doubt that Playdead has developed a particular relationship with Microsoft after the exclusive launch of the game (which later turned out to be temporal) on Xbox 360, despite Limbo being released on a plethora of different platforms. What is also demonstrated by the announcement of Inside, his new project, as one of the spearheads of the ID@Xbox program. One could therefore find a particular meaning in choosing this title as a surprise gift for users who bought Xbox One in its first year of presence on the market, beyond the simple choice of a game that is not too expensive for Redmond's coffers : a search for the fertile and experimental condition of the golden age of Xbox Live Arcade, perhaps a promise about Microsoft's commitment to supporting and promoting those particular and avant-garde videogame productions that seem to have been rather sidelined in the new policy that characterized the first year of Xbox One. Also in this the change of course imposed by Phil Spencer's guide to the Xbox division is evident, with the birth of the ID@Xbox program and at least an attempt to retain users with a gift to thank the early adopters, a choice that until some month ago that would have seemed somewhat out of the question. Limbo on Xbox One is essentially the same as previously released on other platforms and already reviewed at the time, but let's see how much a revival of the game with minimal graphic adaptation can be worth now. Years later, the adventure of the nameless child in limbo remains an experience to try A sad story The title of the game is an explicit metaphor of its content: in the role of a mysterious boy with no name we find ourselves exploring a dark world in search of his lost sister. After a few steps between the settings painted in black and gray, totally devoid of color, and a short crossing of a river aboard a boat, it is not difficult to realize that the Limbo reported in the title is none other than the place where find the main character. Symbolically crossed a sort of Styx, the strange and terrible world that appears before you is something more than a hostile territory: it is a group, a continuous test that requires you to win challenges after challenges in order not to run into terribly heinous deaths. The apparent lightness of the stroke with which characters and settings are drawn shouldn't suggest a simple and good-natured platform, because Limbo hides a ruthless cynicism, which soon makes us understand how every single move must be perfectly calculated, every mechanism operated with the perfect timing and every measly wooden box is invaluable in solving the increasingly complex puzzles that fill the levels. The world staged by Playdead is terrible, yet also irresistibly intriguing, which lends itself to multiple readings and whose picture is completed at the end of the game while remaining open to different interpretations. As if the perfect mechanisms studied by the developers weren't enough to engage players in the increasingly complex puzzles they encounter, there is something that goes further and connects the path of the nameless child along his personal limbo. A common thread that makes the entire gaming experience coherent between the particular graphic style adopted and the irresistible complexity of the puzzles, and makes it unforgettable even without resorting to dialogues and cutscenes. In the disturbing silence made up of cold and sad shadows, the bond with the protagonist is strengthened, pushing us to reach the end of his journey, attempt after attempt, error after error. Xbox One goals There are 13 unlockable achievements in Limbo for a total of 1000 points to add to the gamerscore. The unlocking of the objectives is linked to the collection of particular luminous globes positioned in particularly hidden and inaccessible places within the levels, requiring a rather meticulous search, but helped by the thousand tutorials that can be found on the net. Updated Limbo? Limbo has remained essentially the same excellent game that gained attention in 2010, therefore the judgment on its value in an absolute sense remains unchanged from the review published at the time, to which we refer for information on the original version. On Xbox One, the game gets the classic upscale treatmentand frame rate, thus presenting itself in the splendor of 1080p at 60 frames per second, but being a title so strongly characterized from a stylistic point of view, minimalist and obscure, almost hermetic in its graphic representation in two colors, a technological update of this type certainly not able to make a sensible difference. For the rest, the contents and the level design have remained identical and this places a serious limit on the usability of this new version of Limbo for all those (many, probably) who have already played it in one of the previous versions, since it is then a experience entirely based on the continuous unhinging of the obstacles placed on the way by solving the puzzles that fill the levels. Even the positioning of the bright points that lead to the unlocking of the objectives, practically the only strong element in terms of replayability of the title, has not been changed compared to the original version. In short, more than an adaptation it is a real re-edition without substantial changes and perhaps after the past years and the various conversions implemented one could have expected something more in terms of content. This obviously applies to those who have already experienced Limbo previously and does not detract from the value of the game, which remains high, representing a highly recommended, almost mandatory, purchase for all those who have not yet had the opportunity to play it.", "date": "2014-12-12", "grade": "8.7"}
