The incipit of Snake Pass, the new title from Sumo Digital, is very simple and immediately immerses you in an atmosphere that closely resembles classics such as Banjo-Kazooje and Donkey Kong Country. Thanks above all to the very pleasant soundtrack signed by the former Rare David Wise, but also to a graphic that never skimps on colors and which in HDR offers very bright glimpses to admire between one puzzle and another. The environmental puzzles are in fact the fulcrum of the experience, together with the element represented by the many collectibles, but in this case the developers have focused on something different: the problems to be solved are not so much in the levers to pull or in the mechanisms to activate , but rather in the peculiarities of the character we control. Noodle, like a good snake, cannot simply move and jump to reach the three colored stones that determine the completion of each of the fifteen levels that make up the campaign, but must proceed in a zigzag, coiling around the bamboo structures present in the scenarios and trying to don't fall on deaf ears to achieve your goals. A far from simple undertaking, which in the more advanced stages takes on the connotations of a real grind, a factor that also influences the duration of the adventure: if you are lucky and proceed at a great pace, regardless of orbs and coins , you can reach the epilogue within three or four hours; where, on the other hand, you have too many difficulties in overcoming certain passages or you care about collecting everything the game has to offer, Snake Pass will keep you busy much longer. Snake Pass is a very colorful and in many ways innovative game, but also frustrating and a bit short The Tempting Serpent The control system developed by the developers reflects the peculiar nature of the protagonist of Snake Pass: holding down the R2 backbone allows you to crawl forward, but the maneuver is ineffective if you do not simultaneously use the left analog stick to zigzag, thus allowing the character to leverage his own body to push himself. By pressing X it is possible to raise the head, a fundamental movement when it is necessary to intertwine around a structure that we have the task of climbing, while acting on the L2 backbone allows you to stiffen after a twist to laboriously gain ground in the context of a complex climb. The Triangle button quickly calls (but often misfires) the little Doodle to lift his tail when necessary, perhaps when we are dangerously slipping into an abyss due to disadvantageous counterweights, while pressing the R1 backbone allows you to switch from a more close to a more distant one. Unfortunately, this option does not solve a series of flaws involving the camera, which can be freely adjusted using the right stick but is so reluctant to accompany our action that it puts us in great difficulty when we are pressed against a pole and we would like to change the angle of view, only that doing so we could lose contact with the structure and fall. For this and other reasons, success in Snake Pass is more often than not the result of luck, speed and ruthlessness, for example when you launch yourself head down on a pipe knowing full well that we could slip, but finding the cue sufficient to reach the desired point. Playstation 4 trophies The thirty-four Snake Pass trophies are obtained not only by completing the four areas of the campaign, but also by using a special ability that is obtained at the end of the story, resorting to Doodle's help a hundred times and collecting an increasing number of objects. The trophy entitled ~Snake? SNAKE? SNAAAAKE!~, obtainable by dying in a certain circumstance, definitely made us laugh. Strip the sadness Collecting the three colored stones present in each stage and placing them at the main portal proves to be an increasingly difficult mission, given that as you progress through the campaign, the scenarios become progressively larger and more complex, full of traps and moving platforms, as well as elements that characterize the four different areas of Haven Tor: the earth, the ponds in which to dive, the rivers of lava from which to keep away and the gusts of wind which make it even more difficult to overcome certain passages. The fundamental objects are signaled by the traditional light that rises towards the sky, but not always risult visible and sometimes feel the lack of a map that avoids boring downtime while we retrace our steps to figure out where to go. In the end, it is a matter of details, which however combined with the difficulty of climbing some structures, the inconvenience of managing the camera and the frustration of falling on deaf ears or ending up in a trap (albeit mitigated by the presence of a good number of checkpoints) often make the experience very frustrating. A feeling that contrasts sharply with the colors, the funny faces (ah, Noodle's expressions can be changed with the directional cross, just like in LittleBigPlanet, of which Sumo Digital created the third chapter), the funny music and a approach, in general, which seems to want to promote different situations and atmospheres compared to a noisy championship of blasphemy. Let's therefore say that the authors have probably not been able to express themselves at their best from some points of view, but also that a campaign with more stages (especially in relation to a popular price, yes, but up to a certain point) would not have displeased us at all . One last thing regarding the technical aspect: playing on PlayStation 4 Pro you notice slowdowns in camera rotation when the video output is set to 4K (whether they are dynamic or not we are not able to say), while at 1080p graphics run substantially smoother.", "date": "2017-04-05", "grade": "7.0"}
