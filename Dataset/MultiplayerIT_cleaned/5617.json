All's well that ends well? It seemed so, but then we discovered that the series was not over at all! Minecraft: Story Mode continues again this year with a new handful of episodes that tie directly back to the previously narrated events. Even if the numbering of the episodes does not imply any breaks, this Order Up! it actually represents a new beginning. If you have followed the series from the beginning, you will feel more the presence of an eventful past behind the characters; if instead you have just entered the adventure, do not despair: a few minutes are enough to familiarize yourself with Jesse and his friends. However, beyond the fact that Jesse and company now wear flamboyant costumes, the substance of the game has not changed. There's a new villain on the horizon, the envious Aiden, more obnoxious than the old Ivor (who eventually came to his senses) but less charismatic. Judging by how the episode ends, however, we don't know if he will be the main antagonist of this second part of the series. The fifth episode is in fact self-contained and could be just one of the new separate adventures that our heroes will have to face. In short, what we thought would be the usual action story, instead presents itself full of events and possibilities, a real surprise considering how Minecraft: Story Mode began. At the center of the rivalry between Jesse and Aiden is a kind of magic tinderbox that opens a dimensional portal instead of lighting a trivial small fire. It goes without saying that Aiden wants this mysterious object for himself. Thus begins a chase between the two rival groups that leads them into a fantasy world with extravagant laws and bizarre individuals. It seems incredible, but the sense of mystery invades the blocky world of Minecraft. The fifth episode of Minecraft: Story Mode lays the foundation for an original narrative setting! Cube problems The new adventure of Jesse and his companions has an excellent narrative rhythm, is full of twists positioned at the right time and for once makes us want to have a chat with the characters who accompany us, thanks to clean dialogues free of melodramatic tones. A few touches of irony here and there, such as the appearance of the revolutionary Milo, who wears the red cap of commander Che Guevara, puts even the most adult player in a good mood - in fact, this remains a series especially suitable for a very young audience - which can enjoy the texture without puffing. On the other hand, all the flaws that have accompanied Telltale's games for years now remain carved in stone, i.e. cheesy timed events, game mechanics that are always identical, even if it were illegal to modify them, and a general low-level production, with the exception of dubbing, once again excellent time (but always in English, sorry). But where Order Up! it definitely breaks away from the previous episodes is in the construction of the world. We are not talking here about the buildings, which are very beautiful and inspired, but about the narrative elements that give coherence to a fantastic world. How do people think who live in a world where you just need to punch a tree to get wood? What values do they have? In its small way, this episode tries to answer these questions, taking the first steps towards a real Minecraft narrative universe. In short, Minecraft: Story Mode seems intent on becoming something more than an easy source of income. If the type of game doesn't hurt your hardcore gamer sensitivity and you want to play with friends or family to have a laugh and spend a few hours without pretensions, Order Up! it might be a good choice.", "date": "2016-03-31", "grade": "7.4"}
