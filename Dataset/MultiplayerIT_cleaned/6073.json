They built the anticipation, revealing cards in fits and starts throughout the first part of August until culminating in the stream on the 14th and the publication, the same day, of the missing cards on the Hearthstone Facebook page. Finally, on the 24th around 7 pm - Italian time - we finally got our hands on the second major expansion of the Blizzard TCG: the Grand Tournament. A debut not without problems: for the whole evening it was very difficult to connect and, once inside, there was a latency of up to twenty or thirty seconds in navigating the menu and opening the sachets. In any case, it is the fourth add-on to the game following the Naxxramas adventure and the Goblins vs. Gnomes expansion in 2014 and following this year's adventure Blackrock Mountain. In this Grand Tournament, a ~major~ expansion with a high number of cards introduced, a good 132, many creatures of Azeroth participate: from the Murloc and Pandaren knights to the Tuskarr ~walruses~, from pirates riding parrots up to illustrious names such as the Lord of the Covenant, His Majesty Varian Wrynn or Rhonin, the leader of the all-powerful wizards of the Kirin Tor. The Grand Tournament includes even more cards than Goblins vs. Gnomes, but the big news of this expansion is the presence of the new ~triggering ability~ Inspiration, which is added to Battlecry and Deathrattle. Another novelty is the presence of the ~carousel~, a mechanic that is activated with the Battle Cry of some cards: in practice, when one of these is played, two minions are revealed, one for each deck; if the minion summoned by the current player has a higher casting cost than the one revealed by the opponent, the ability present in the card's description is activated. Although there is a lot of enthusiasm for all the innovations already mentioned and for those we are going to see, we also have some small perplexities. Anyway, welcome to the Grand Tournament! The Grand Tournament introduces tons of cards and a new seasonal reward system New inspiration, new ~meta~ The main revolution introduced by the Grand Tournament lies in the change of the metagame thanks, as usual, to the introduction of new cards that are allowing the birth of unprecedented types of decks. Like the Secret Paladin that revolves around the Mystery Challenger, a six-mana 6/6 that puts all the secrets of the deck into play when it enters the battlefield; however, for an analysis of the cards and classes that, in our opinion, have benefited the most from this new expansion, we refer you to an upcoming special. What immediately catches the eye, however, is the introduction of the new Inspiration mechanic which opens up multiple scenarios together with the other novelty in terms of gameplay, the carousel, which would seem to amplify even more that ~RNG factor~ with which there we take it every time we lose a game. We asked some pro-players if, with Grand Tournament, luck affects the game even more than it did with the Goblins vs. Gnomes expansion. The answer may be disappointing but it makes perfect sense: the most experienced players calculate each situation brought about by chance starting from the worst situation they could find themselves in and play accordingly. Let's take an example by quoting one of the new cards: the magician has been given the Spellmaker as a servant which, when summoned, provides a random spell to each player; normally one would play it without too many problems but a pro player calculates, really quickly, what could get into the opponent's hand considering parameters such as the life points and the cards in hand of both players or the possible combos with the cards in the deck opponent. Some of them have reached an incredible level of excellence in making these calculations but the variables are really many. In fact, have you ever wondered why some pro players are particularly slow to play and wait until they almost risk losing their turn due to the end of time? Lots of cards and the new players? As we have repeatedly reiterated, the lifeblood of collectible card games is the introduction of new sets but this, as far as Hearthstone is concerned, creates some perplexities: with over five hundred cards in the game it is not easy for new players to catch up with the experienced ones and often, those who start from scratch and want to face it as a free to play game, are disappointed by the defeats that begin to arrive around rank 18 or 17, in which the opponents generally begin to have more cards and perhaps some legendary it makes the difference. For a couple of monthsa step forward was made with the Brawl mode thanks to which, once a week, Blizzard gives everyone the opportunity to get a pack of classic cards for free by winning a single game. You can also win a pack of classic cards with the daily quest that lets you watch your friend win a game. Gran Torneo helps inexperienced users by introducing the possibility of obtaining, at the end of the season, therefore once a month, a special box of rewards in addition to the classic card back: the contents of the boxes will vary according to the rank reached but, as we know, it will contain one or more golden cards (which, as you know, provide a high number of powders to create others) and it will be sufficient to reach rank 20 (also within the reach of new players, given that it is not possible to go back from 25 to 20) to get back and case with the minimum prize. That's still not much, you might say, and indeed we are often asked questions such as: ~How can I become competitive without spending a fortune?~ or ~Is it still possible to play Hearthstone free to play?~ It is clear that if one wants all the cards and the ability to play with many different decks, he must open his wallet and buy tons of booster packs (and still may not have all the legendaries) but if a new player focuses on only one class , you create cards with the dusts that you earn by eliminating others, accumulate coins to buy bags by winning games in any mode and try to do the daily quests, then it is possible. One thing is certain, and it is a constant that should not be underestimated, the number of cards that make up the deck has always been the same since the beginning of the game: new ones come out, the years go by but the decks are always made up of 30 units with a maximum of two copies of the same (one for the legendary)! Finally, let's not forget the Arena, as the Grand Tournament has also brought changes to this mode: the prize package we will have at the end can come from classic cards, from Goblins against Gnomes or from the Grand Tournament and not just from the latest expansion as it was before.", "date": "2015-09-01", "grade": "8.0"}
