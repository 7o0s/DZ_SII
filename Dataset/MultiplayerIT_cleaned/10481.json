In about a month and a half the disputed sequel - for those who missed the first one, a particularly convenient bundle is available on Steam these days - will finally arrive in stores but in the meantime, to while away the wait, the developers once paid of Microsoft have released this Crash Course, free on PC and sold for around six euros on Xbox 360, a figure which, it is good to say and forget about it, is certainly worth spending and will satisfy those who still host Left after twelve months of its release 4 Dead at home. Four times two The package is made up as a small campaign consisting of only two maps, set at the end of the fourth segment of the original, continuing it since it starts with the four survivors who escaped the plane crash following the transformation of the pilot into an undead and therefore committed to becoming wide among the usual crowds of enemies, up to the umpteenth escape that will act as a red thread with the beginning of the sequel, somehow connecting the two groups of survivors. About half an hour of play through a now deserted city but bearing the signs of the battlefield that was, with destroyed walls and overturned cars, an environment which, with the exception of a couple of greener passages, has allowed the creation of multiple paths, winding passages and many possible respawn points for enemies, with the various Boomers, Smokers, Hunters and Tanks - the Witch is always the same, whiny little woman crouched in some corner - able to respawn with a higher frequency than in the past, making it very more frenetic an experience that in fact offers a significant quantity of weapons, ammunition and bombs, becoming quite angular at the highest level of difficulty. There are also two moments of siege, the first while waiting for the flames unleashed by the player on a bridge to subside and the second at the end of the expansion, grappling with a current generator and a minibus inside a large garage, with at least two valid points where to position oneself: a coach used for resistance to the bitter end and a mezzanine floor with a gatling gun included. So nothing is missing from Crash Course, even if perhaps it would have been appreciated to see some new features, perhaps a preview of melee weapons, just to entice users and give further value to what is in any case a valuable addition. Finally, everything was also made available in Versus and Survival mode, so as not to miss anything. Visually nothing has changed and the only real partially out of tune note concerns an extensive use of previously used textures, giving the experience a slight sensation of already seen, despite the level design being of a high level as mentioned. There are a couple of new audio samples which however don't particularly develop the overall narrative context, nor do the writing on the walls.", "date": "2009-10-08", "grade": "8.0"}
