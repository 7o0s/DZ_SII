{"name": "Nier Re[in]carnation", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nier-reincarnation-recensione.html", "text": "After the clamor that arose with the impressive success in Japan, the review of Nier Re[in]carnation allows us to look a little closer at this strange project by Square Enix, which fits precisely into the now trite groove of gacha RPGs, but at least interpreting it in the particular style of Yoko Taro and her varied series. The aesthetic is of a level that is difficult to find in similar productions within this genre, leading to truly particular atmospheres and characterization, able to make Nier Re[in]carnation stand out easily, even among hundreds of similar titles. But beyond this, the game is in all respects an RPG with turn-based combat and gacha elements, with some gameplay aspects that are also less developed and profound than what we are now used to seeing in countless other competitors- more or less anonymous - crowding the mobile landscape. History The story begins with an unknown girl who awakens inside a world called The Cage, guided by a strange floating being identified as Mama, who is intended to act as a narrator and reference point for tutorials and explanations within the game. The scenario is made up of various areas characterized by different recurring elements, each of which however is made up of huge towering and apparently abandoned structures, among which the Girl of Light, as she is simply defined, finds herself initially wandering aimlessly. Mama seems to have partial knowledge of the surrounding world, but her figure is rather ambiguous, given that she still seems to follow a purpose, immediately directing the girl towards what soon becomes her mission: to discover mysterious statues called ~dark scarecrow~ scattered around the settings and activate them to start various sub-stories, able to unlock objects, rewards and characters, as well as enriching the knowledge of The Cage. These are memories, concerning relationships between automatons and humans and much more, which transport us to different eras and various places to discover the mysteries of that fascinating world now in ruins, all characterized by the typical dreamy touch of NieR. The splendid aesthetic by Nier Re[in]carnation is truly the defining element of the game, alternating the evocative 3D graphics with the huge metaphysical structures of The Cage with the various styles and different atmospheres of the 2D stories, allowing you to range between settings and inspirations very different. All this is also accompanied by a truly high-profile soundtrack, another feature that has now become emblematic of the NieR series and is also fully recovered in this mobile spin-off. Nier-style gacha RPG The 3D exploration phases with the Girl of Light are the least interactive The gameplay is divided into two main phases: the exploration of The Cage by controlling the Girl of Light under the guidance of Mama and the various stories that emerge when the statues are activated, which usually stage 2D narrative sequences interspersed with various turn-based combat. Nier Re [in] carnation turns out to be a kind of anthological story, in which various backgrounds are grafted into the main story of the girl provided by the many sub-stories activated by the statues scattered around the game world. Some of these are self-contained, many others are instead linked together to tell larger stories but all are characterized by the typical melancholy tone of NieR and focused on various characters who can then be conquered through the gacha system. In the stages within the memories, the game becomes a scrolling 2D of sorts Beyond this layered and interconnected narrative, which slowly reveals the secrets of the mysterious The Cage through the various stories to be discovered, the two phases also offer rather different game mechanics: the exploratory part is essentially contemplative, allowing you to observe the architectural wonders of the setting with very limited interaction, being able only to advance along a pre-established path, while the action takes place mainly within the stories, where the fighting is also concentrated. The combat system of NieR Reincarnation is turn-based and semi-automatic The turn-based combat system is semi-automated, in the sense that even without resorting to auto-play it still provides that part of the actions take place autonomously, in particular as regards the standard attacks, leaving the player the possibility to select attacks and special abilities once the bar has been filled, therefore paying attention to the various cooldown periods. From thatthis point of view, Nier Re[in]carnation offers absolutely nothing new compared to the many other similar mobile RPGs, indeed the combat system is probably even less deep and stimulating than many others seen in recent productions of the genre, which is rather disappointing if we think of the remarkable action phases to which the series has accustomed us. The various characters in NieR Reincarnation belong to different tiers based on power and rarity in the gacha system The other pillar of the gameplay, as befits a mobile RPG gacha, is the collection and management of characters, which occupies a good part of the time and is precisely inserted in the by now abused canon of this genre of games. Characters can be summoned by investing gems, with a hierarchical system that sees the most powerful characters being extremely rare: again, as in many others, the powerful 4-star fighters have an appearance rate of around 2%, which which forces you to really try many times before you can get the most coveted characters. This necessarily involves a clear pay-to-win drift, considering how in-app purchases of currencies become practically mandatory to obtain the rarest and most effective characters. It must be said that Nier Re[in]carnation does everything to reward the player with a large amount of rewards and various currencies, but the percentages of obtaining the most popular characters are so low that it is very difficult not to resort to microtransactions. Different speech for the upgrades of characters, weapons, minions and memories, which can be carried out through a regular commitment on the main quests, those deriving from events and the PvP mode, all capable of providing good quantities of materials and currencies to invest in these areas. Note how the game also includes various collaborations, starting with the inevitable partnership with NieR: Automata which characterizes this first official phase, with the presence of some of the well-known characters of the chapter in question.", "date": "2021-08-03", "grade": "7.5"}
