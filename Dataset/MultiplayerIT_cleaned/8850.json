The reference is intended primarily towards the television show: between storylines carried out for months and then canceled without the slightest explanation, scraps of the past that steal television space from far more deserving athletes and above all stables with enormous potential that are absurdly burned (yes, we're talking about the Nexus), there's nothing to be happy about and the progressive drop in ratings is clear proof of this. But the same goes for video games: it's great that titles like WWE '12 allow us to play any type of match in any type of arena, with any type of character and any type of stipulation, peppered with at least two modes of large thickness; but it would be even better if at the basis of all this effort there were less woody gameplay, characters that are really different from each other and simpler rules of engagement. It is precisely this need that has led THQ to produce WWE All Stars, a different wrestling game than usual, more ~caciarone~, with graphics that give a nod to the so-called ~gimmick era~ and a roster equally made up of superstars current and legends of the past. A simpler experience also in terms of gameplay, given the reduced number of moves compared to the aforementioned WWE '12 and a deliberately exaggerated representation of them. Unfortunately, the attempt to get closer to the great classics of the genre has once again failed, and despite a decidedly successful structure, the THQ San Diego product fails to stand out. Let's see why. Dream match galore On the cover of WWE All Stars stars of the past stand out such as Ultimate Warrior, the late Randy Savage, the immortal Hulk Hogan and The Rock, grappling with an improbable (ohib, not in the case of the Great One...) comparison with the current WWE wrestlers: from John Cena to Randy Orton, passing through Rey Mysterio, Kofi Kingston and so on, for a total of about forty usable characters. Those who have always wanted to see the confrontation between Andre the Giant and The Big Show with this game will be able to ~simulate~ it, above all thanks to the Fantasy Warfare mode, which starts precisely from the charm of generational clashes to offer us real dream matches between wrestlers with an similar, as can be Ultimate Warrior and Sheamus or the aforementioned Andre the Giant and The Big Show. However, the core of the game lies in the Path of Champions mode, basically a variation on the ~Road to WrestleMania~ theme in which we have to win ten matches to get to the final confrontation with a particular character. An excellent structure, we reiterate, not excessively rich in content but balanced, capable of proposing sufficiently varied situations. The problem lies in the gameplay, which unfortunately leaves much to be desired in terms of collision detection, impact rendering and ~pure~ fun. Here too the problem of balancing the difficulty returns, if possible in an even more marked way than in WWE Smackdown Vs. Raw, due to the unfortunate implementation of the special moves. In fact, it will be enough to calculate the times well and it will be possible to pull off any maneuver against the opponent, provided that you start the ~load~ while he is about to get up from a previous attack. The 3D effect WWE All Stars boasts a purely ancillary and very limited implementation of the 3D effect. The developers have simply limited themselves to introducing this solution where possible, which in fact is barely noticeable and completely disabling it does not seem to affect the visual rendering of the game in any way. Three-dimensional suplexes The Nintendo 3DS version of WWE All Stars, beyond the irrelevant three-dimensional effect, therefore presents itself as a mere porting of what has already been seen on the Wii, with the same strengths and weaknesses. Difficult to determine if the graphic style falls within the first or second: it is a solution that goes hand in hand with the bright colors and exasperated styles of the wrestlers of the past (or with The Undertaker, who with his ~dead man~ gimmick refers precisely to a period that has now disappeared), but which does not fit well with the aesthetics of the current WWE superstars. On Nintendo consoles, this element then encounters further difficulties due to the poorly detailed polygonal models and poorly defined textures, so much so that the final result is not exactly a feast for the eyes. A similar argument can be made for the sound sector: on the one hand we have the excellent commentary by Jim Ross and Jerry Lawler, on the other a management of the announcer that leaves much to be desired, as the name of the winner is pronouncedquestioningly rather than affirmatively. A problem that already existed in previous versions of the game and that no one has bothered to fix on 3DS.", "date": "2011-12-19", "grade": "S.V."}
