{"name": "Neo Cab", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/neo-cab-la-recensione.html", "text": "In this review of Neo Cab we talk about a title that enters the Apple Arcade catalog without being an absolute novelty: on the other hand, the gaming subscription of the Cupertino house does not live on exclusives alone, and it is not uncommon to come across premium products already released on other platforms. This is precisely the case of the work created by Change Agency, a graphic adventure that has been able to convince critics in its original incarnations for PC and Nintendo Switch and which we are preparing to analyze in its version for iOS devices. A guided adventure For such a title, starting from stimulating premises is essential and in this sense Neo Cab performs the task impeccably, offering the user settings and characters that were evidently the result of careful writing work. The plot takes place in the near future and sees Lina as the protagonist, one of the few still active taxi drivers in a world that has seen human driving almost completely replaced by automated one. We meet Lina while she is driving towards Los Ojos, a Californian city under the total control of Capra, the technological multinational responsible, among other things, for the unstoppable rise of self-driving taxis. The reason for the trip, however, is of an exquisitely sentimental nature, given that Lina has decided to change her life and move in with Savy, a best friend with whom she has had a stormy past. Lina's work also comes into play in all of this, who needs to pick up passengers and take them to their destination to support herself financially. It is within this context that the gameplay of Neo Cab fits harmoniously, with the adventure that is divided into six nights (in fact the game levels) during which it is necessary to choose which customers to serve, trying to place them at ease so as to obtain a high evaluation and consequently a better compensation. Therefore, most of the time is spent observing Lina while she drives her own taxi, reading the conversations she has with the passengers and helping her by choosing the answers that seem most appropriate to us. A curious variable in the field is that of the Feelgrid worn by the protagonist, a smartband that indicates her current mood, making certain dialogue options unavailable if she is not in the right mood. For a title that is in fact more of an interactive story than a real video game, it is evident that the quality of the writing must always remain very high, and Neo Cab in this sense convinces up to a certain point: the characters are many and well characterized, the dialogues touch on different and even rather profound topics (we go from sentimental issues to reflections on the dehumanization of modern society) but the texts are often verbose and redundant, almost appearing as fillers rather than tools to advance the story. Even in terms of narration not everything works wonderfully, with a plot that turns out to be too undecided about which direction to take among all the suggestions offered by the premise and an ending that makes the various choices that have been made during the adventure and the attention placed on the management of Lina's finances. In short, one could say that Neo Cab tends to work a lot on appearance and less on substance, a consideration that can easily be extended to the technical component of the product as well. The graphics boast a truly sophisticated design and very varied and convincing character models, but the facial expressions are not always punctual or particularly effective in making emotions appear, a significant limitation considering the absence of dubbing. The representation of Los Ojos outside the car's cockpit is also rather disappointing, reduced to a series of empty and all the same streets that do not do justice to the writers' vision for the city. Something more could also be done for the sound, which could have better compensated for the absence of voices with more numerous and dynamic music, even considering how the effects are reduced to the bone.", "date": "2020-01-31", "grade": "7.0"}
