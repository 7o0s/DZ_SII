{"name": "Madden 2003", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/madden-2003.html", "text": "Let's get into the details I admit, this introduction was really long, but I wouldn't have done it if Madden 2003 had been a mediocre game. Instead, EA Sports has churned out a spectacular, complete and unforgettable game. Madden 2003 has it all, I find it hard to find gaps in a game that offers all the possibilities and combines them as the player wishes, allowing to adapt to any type of game preferred by the user: arcade, simulation and management, special modes and a splendid tutorial, all surrounded by excellent graphics. Madden 2003 allows you to participate in single matches (exhibitions or friendlies, whatever you prefer) or in a complete championship (Franchise). Within the league it is possible to choose whether to participate exclusively in matches or also take care of the managerial side of the league, such as firing coaches, buying and selling players, managing their salaries or even a look at young talent to bring into the league. senior team. Once the championship has started, it is possible to compare the statistics of your players with those of other teams, check the injured players, decide on the first choices, exchange players and in general follow the progress of your team's career, so as to understand whose get rid of at the end of each season. Right at the end of the same it will also be possible to hire a free agent, who will take care of helping you in the search for new players. We will also have to immediately take care of the team that will face the next championship. Are you still there? Everything I wrote is optional. You can only do it if you want to. Otherwise it will be enough to play one game after another without further worries. And it's not over. You can decide how to play each game: as a ~player~ our task will be exclusively to execute the schemes imposed by the CPU in the best possible way. Pure arcade. As a ~coach~, however, the roles are reversed: we will decide the game strategy, the CPU will take care of executing it as best as possible. Pure simulation. Finally, in the ~classic~ mode we will be able to manage both the schemes and their execution. Pure Madden 2003. And again: in addition to the ~natural~ options at the start of the game (management of fouls, injuries, offsides, help for newbies, etc. etc.) even ~in game~ can be managed or managed many aspects, such as: automatic replacements, audible management, recommendations on the best schemes, and much more. What have I forgotten? Nothing, because everything has been implemented. Other modalities If the championship certainly takes away 90% of the time spent playing Madden 2003, we must certainly not forget what else EA Sports offers us. Also in this case the choice is not lacking. You can take part in a 2-minute drill (the last two minutes): it is the most exciting phase of the game, in which between timeouts, off-field runs and empty passes, matches can stretch up to a quarter of an hour. Another mode is the ~Situation~ (game situations): in this case you will be able to participate in a game with all the default game settings (and we ~default~ them). Another example of how Madden 2003 allows you to manage any aspect of the game: you can decide to start at a disadvantage, 10 yards from your touchdown line, with 30 seconds left, with only one timeout available on fourth down and 20 yards for the down. Or you can create a situation in which you normally found yourself in particular difficulty during the championship: useful for trying to find the best strategies. But the Mini-Camp is certainly the most interesting pastime: wandering around the United States you will learn to pass, defend, kick, block and, in general, to face moments of play that are always present in every game, all within an ~anti-stage~ of training. Trying to collect as many points as possible (for example by throwing the ball inside some circles or blocking a player before he reaches touchdown) you will unlock new game modes and, above all, you will be able to perform what you have done in the anti-stadium within a real match. From dream to reality. Truly spectacular. Technique As previously mentioned, Madden 2003's graphics are well done. At maximum detail, in 1024x768, the game could give some frame-rate problems for those with penultimate generation computers, but in general the fluidity of the players is excellent, the playing field is realistic, the public shakes on the spalaces and stadiums are detailed. It is possible to play in any weather condition, from clear weather to snow storms. The audio is discreet, the interlude music becomes repetitive in the long run, while the game sounds are realistic and engaging: the ~STUMPF~ of a block, the ~PAT~ of the holds and the roars of the players ring in the ears even after having closed the game. The match commentaries mirror the musical ones: barely discreet and repetitive. Also John Madden, who acts as a technical commentator, has poor quality 'as an actor. There is decidedly little satisfaction, and when a touchdown is made the tone of voice of the commentators does not change at all. The sound from the audience is also low quality, after a while it becomes a ringing in the ears and a mere annoyance. Playability is at high levels: being able to set everything up, it's impossible not to adapt to Madden 2003. If the defensive phase, however, is ~naturally~ tending towards boring (keeping a line player we'll almost always go against the front, and our action will already be over there: you have to try to take control of the players who mark the opposing runners or the outside linebeckers), the attack phase is truly engaging: once the action starts you will have to keep d keep an eye on four or five players at the same time and, in a few seconds, figure out which of them is free for a pass and at the same time in a position suitable for receiving the ball; in the case of a race, you will have to juggle jumps, rotations and elbows to get rid of the opposing defenders and run as far away from them as possible, towards the goal. The many commands tend to confuse the player, but Madden 2003 comes in handy here too: it is in fact possible to use a joypad, the keyboard (recommended) or a combination of mouse and keyboard. However, the manual is very complete on the possible combinations, and in a short time you will memorize the positions of the fingers in the various phases of the game. Do not miss the management of the replay, complete and customizable as you want. Conclusion If there were votes Madden 2003 wouldn't have gotten 10 just because of the audio. Being in Italy, however, it would have been a wasted 10 (or rather, a 9.5): how many could enjoy a game so well done but so little known? Madden 2003 isn't America's national sport just because baseball has more history behind it. But it is also undeniable that Madden 2003 is a well-finished game because it was created by those who love that sport. Comparisons to the FIFA series come to mind every now and then. I get shivers. Madden 2003 is a great game, complete in every respect, fun, long-lived and dedicated to enthusiasts and curious novices alike. I wonder what they will do in Madden 2004... maybe a sticker album from the 2003/4 league, with Madden 2003 attached. Introduction Some years ago Italia 1 bought the television rights in Italy of the NFL (National Football League). We are talking about ten years ago, if not more. Every Sunday morning, sometimes for the whole morning, it broadcast a summary of the games played the previous week and a summary of Mondey Night (the ~postponement~ of our football). Thus football entered the homes of many sports enthusiasts: once they understood hitherto unknown terms such as touchdown, quarterback, audible, snap, spike, linebacker, fair catch, touchback but above all ~yards~, the Italian football championship , made up until then by a small niche of enthusiasts, had a spectacular boom. Countless teams were born, and the Italian Super Bowl had its year or two of notoriety, almost placing itself in ~second tier~ sports such as volleyball, basketball or tennis. But the harsh law of money kills any sport that doesn't declare many (having it and declaring it are two different things), and after a short time football returned to the drawer and, consequently, among the minor sports. In America, or rather, in the United States, Football is a sport second only to baseball in the hearts of Americans (national sport), ~official~ only for a few decades (the Superbowls are not even forty) and yet, in the climax (Conference Semifinals onward) involves the entire country, coming to a complete stop to watch the Super Bowl. This is a great idea, which in terms of advertising revenue, audience and image replaces the 5 or 7 finals of other sports as loved as football, such as basketball, ice hockey and the aforementioned baseball. It is therefore obvious that for such a popularly loved sport EA has not dedicated one of its games, to be precise the Madden series, which givesa few years he accompanies us in one of the most complex and at the same time brutal and rewarding sports ever seen. But why ~Madden~? Madden was a short-career player in the 1950s, and he owes his fame as a young (33-year-old) and winning coach of the Oakland Raiders: out of 142 games in charge of the Raiders he brought home, in about ten years, 103 wins and the eleventh Super Bowl. Since 1980 he has dedicated himself body and soul to Football as an analyst, commentator and much more, managing to always remain at the top of his fame and winning an avalanche of career awards, far from over yet.", "date": "2002-11-21", "grade": null}
