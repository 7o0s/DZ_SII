This is probably what the developers of Ultra Age are thinking, which arrives this end of April 2022 on PC, following the publication on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, where it was received quite coldly, for very good reasons, as we will also see in the course of our article. However, we must not ignore the attempts made by the two Korean development teams who created Ultra Age, an action game that now has improved graphics, a more stable frame rate, a new voice acting and which promises, in the second half of 2022, to release a free DLC that will introduce a roguelite mode that could be the best way to play Ultra Age. Before looking to the future, however, let's look to the present and find out exactly if this game is already worth playing now - here's our review of Ultra Age in the PC version. To you, in 2,000 years Age, left, protagonist of Ultra Age Ultra Age can be roughly divided into two parts: story and combat. There is more, mind you, but for simplification now let's imagine it this way. Well. The plot can also be ignored and in all honesty we have the impression that even the developers did not believe it all the way. The narrative premise is quite classic: we are in the future, in 3174 to be precise, and the Earth's resources are exhausted. Humans are divided between those who live in a space colony known as Orbis and those who live on Earth, in a security facility. The problem is that this is what is explained through the official description of the game on digital stores. Starting Ultra Age, however, we are left largely in the dark about these details and all we understand is that we are Age, a young warrior who must complete missions for Orbis. The boy has only seven days left to live and his true goal is to satisfy the requests of the Orbis to obtain eternal life. Accompanying him is Helvis, a support robot. The plot continues over the five hours of play by placing us in the middle of classic sci-fi clichs. The problem isn't just the banality of the whole plot and a (skimpy) set of uninteresting characters with soporific dialogues, the problem is that most of the time the plot will be ~we have to get through this door, we go here and there activating switches to reset systems~. Ultra Age is based on a handful of narrative ideas but absolutely fails to capture the player's interest. Crystal therapy done right Ultra Age offers various weapons, such as this katana As mentioned, Ultra Age is not just a plot, far from it. In fact, we are talking about a fighting game that first of all wants to put us on the field and make us beat our hands. The structure is also classic in this case, since it is based on very simple moves, which require you to repeat the light attack and then perform a heavy attack to unleash a combo ending that varies according to the number of hits that have it preceded. In a nutshell, don't think you're facing Bayonetta or Devil May Cry in terms of complexity, which can be bad for those who are very experienced in stylish action, but good for those who are not completely comfortable with these systems. In addition to the normal attacks we also have a grappling hook, to attract enemies or leave towards them. There is obviously a dodge, somewhat generous in terms of invulnerability that allows you to dodge many blows simply by pressing the dedicated repeat button without too much precision. Weapons have special attacks in Ultra Age All this is actually nothing in particular, as you well know. However, Ultra Age has an additional idea, which is pleasant even if it can be improved. The protagonist's weapons are not eternal, but are created through the absorption of crystals available in the environment or dropped by defeated enemies. Using the weapon consumes its energy and when the bar is about to run out it is possible to activate a very powerful special move. The player is therefore encouraged to consume the weapon as quickly as possible, especially by using the combos correctly (finishing moves consume more energy, so pressing the light attack without activating combo makes it slower to access the special move) . The problem with this situation is that the number of charges of the various weapons will practically always be maximum. Various types of enemies are weak to different weapons, but most of the time you will only use two of the six available. The character can carry four types of weapons with him and change on the fly, also performing an attack move at the same time, but only on rare occasions will he really find himself wherer Change weapon during fights. In this sense, Ultra Age could have done much more to make playful situations more varied and dynamic. Finally, our helper Helvis is able to activate some support skills. The most important is healing, which recharges by defeating enemies or finding dedicated crystals. Also, it allows you to use some kind of power-up that increases the chance of doing critical damage. The most particular feature, however, is time travel: it is possible in practice to reload an area (without the character moving) to make the crystals reappear and thus obtain other resources, provided that enough enemies have been defeated to have enough time energy , clear. However, this is an almost useless mechanic, at least on normal difficulty, because the enemies give us many more weapons than we need. Boosts for everyone Ultra Age's enemies are mostly robots As mentioned, Ultra Age isn't really all about story and combat. The game world is extremely linear, but hidden around are a number of power-ups and enemies give experience points, quite generously by the way. Through these points, we can enhance the skill trees of the various weapons, obtaining passive damage bonuses and obtaining new combos or expanding those already available. Furthermore, Helvis can also be upgraded, to heal us more and more. The most interesting part are the upgrades to be found in the environment, which allow you to unlock various Age abilities, such as adding damage when using the grappling hook, the possibility of shooting even in the air and above all the unlocking of equipment slots. Unfortunately, this last feature of the game is the least interesting and we thought it was too botched. In fact, Age can find special crystals that improve his statistics, such as life, attack, critical damage values, armor and more. We didn't like the fact that the slots are locked behind the power-ups, though, as it risks nullifying one of the game mechanics and, in the final stages, could prevent the character from power-up and therefore make life a little more difficult for the player for no reason. The main problem, however, is that most of the time we find crystals with lower stat bonuses than those already equipped. This bonus system spends more time being useless than satisfying the player. Another problem with Ultra Age is the presentation. Yes, the PC version has refined the graphics and optimized the frame rate, also allowing it to be left unlocked, but overall we are still talking about a low-budget game, with repetitive environments, few types of enemies and bosses repeated all too often considering the scarce number of hours the adventure offers. Fighting is fun most of the time, even if the feedback from hitting enemies isn't as satisfying as in the best games of the genre. The problem is what happens between fights. For this reason, we are intrigued by the idea of the roguelite mode promised by the developers via free DLC. Assuming some new enemies are added, it could be a good way to enjoy the best part of the game without too many distractions. For now, however, we cannot judge what is not there.", "date": "2022-04-30", "grade": "6.0"}
