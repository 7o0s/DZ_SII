The name of the package seems to suggest it, but we know that this is not the case, just think of the rumor of the elusive Uprise and above all of the ~clarifying post~ by DICE itself with which it says that we must expect more in the near future. But the real question we all have to ask ourselves is whether this new package is worth the usual outlay of money (net of the thousand problems that have plagued the game in the last year). The answer is yes, and not because there is a greater amount of content than in the past, but simply because DICE wants to close the season with a bang, letting new users ~taste~ one of its most loved titles, that Battlefield 2142 that eight years ago had transported the saga into the 22nd century. The DLC also has a narrative thread to take us into the near future: China warns the United States that Russia is developing advanced weapons capable of upsetting the balance of the battlefield. It's up to the Marines to invade cold, snowy Siberia to stop the Russian efforts. That is to say? It will be possible to pilot the HT-95 Levkov tank/hovercraft, faster and more maneuverable than a normal one (and also equipped with a side strafe) but without a rotating turret: basically an old-fashioned tank destroyer. If we feel too far from the battle we can catapult ourselves from one part of the map to another by entering one of the Launch Pods, while if the infantry has breached our defenses we can wipe them out with the small fixed Schipunov 42 emplacement, or the current Metal Storm, which from the name suggests its ~wide-ranging~ power. And then? Among the gadgets we find the XD1-Accipiter, a small armed reconnaissance drone and the DS3-Decoy, a device capable of reproducing the sounds of battle, a real bait to lure opponents into ambushes. And the weapons? Two and both dedicated to sniping. The Rorsch Mk-1 is a real window onto the future, a miniature rail gun, a ~one shot, one kill~ sniper rifle, with long reloading and reloading times but really powerful and lethal, also equipped with a minimum area damage. A real bomb. If, on the other hand, we want to kill the old-fashioned way, we can hunt opponents with the hyper-technological composite bow, armed with three types of arrows, from normal to explosive ones. Needless to say, here too a blow on the head and the game is done. The real protagonists, even if little more than extras, are the prototypes of two future ~actors~ of Battlefield 2142, namely the Titan in Hangar 21 and the T-1 in Giants of Karelia. In fact, therefore, we are witnessing a ~prequel~ of 2142 and who knows that in the future the Swedish boys do not want to go back to making us collide aboard mechs and gigantic airships. Last Stand is undoubtedly a spot on DLC for Battlefield 4 It's cold outside The four maps in the pack have two things in common. The most obvious one is the Siberian, wintry and snowy setting. However, the less obvious one is the quality of the level design, more or less high in all battlefields. It must be said, however, that the infamous Levolution does not give great thrills. We can set off potentially interesting and lethal situations, but not exactly unforgettable ones. Operation Wipeout is a decidedly open map, with a circular appearance, perfect both for vehicles, such as the HT-95 Levkov, but also for snipers who can enjoy clean lines of fire even from long ranges. It goes without saying that the rail gun prototype seems to have been made to sweep away soldiers who approach hot spots without cover. It is not a simple no man's land, however, given that close combat is guaranteed by numerous structures and a never banal level design, both in the western part where the frozen lake is located, and in the eastern part, which is more mountainous and jagged. In the midst of the six control points, evenly distributed throughout the map, there is also the possibility of conquering a submarine to launch an aerial bombardment. Not bad at all. A beautiful map, large, airy, and full of ideas, where airspace control is obviously the key to bringing the match home. But it's also perfect for testing out all the new gadgets and weapons in the DLC. Hangar 21 is a very unique map. You fight on the slopes of a mountain, where a huge hangar opens up halfway up (so big that you can get inside with a helicopter), inside which one of the legendary Titans is under construction. We can't fly it, but we can start the engine test thanks to which we can instantly cook all the unfortunate opponents. In short, a not exactly memorable Levolution event. The gigantic ~shelter~ is not flat, but full of structures, corridors and areas aboveelevated; therefore a rather complex environment, which enhances the clashes both from long and medium distances. Outside, on the other hand, the climb towards the entrance is made impervious both by the steep profile of the mountain, but also and above all by the many structures, which make the race to the top a real challenge. And if we wanted to avoid trouble, we can always take advantage of the Launch Pods positioned above a sort of warehouse, which, as previously written, allow us to launch from one part of the map to another, including Hangar 21. Without a doubt one of the best maps in the pack. Giants of Karelia is a very large and very exciting map, the only one where it is not the total dazzling white of the snow that dominates. It seems that the thaw has begun in Karelia: the snow punctuates a particularly steep mountain environment, therefore a perfect battlefield for vehicles, with a river that cuts the map in two and with numerous bridges that connect the two banks. It must be said, however, that the particular conformation of the land, full of ups and downs, hills and elevated points also allow the infantry to have its say, being able to get around or hit the armored vehicles from above. Therefore, it goes without saying that even here the level design is of great class, a perfect example of all the potential of Battlefield's gameplay. Very large spaces, of course, but there are also close-up clashes. As with Hangar 21, the future ~past~ of the franchise also makes an appearance here, in the form of the T-1 mechs under construction in a secret facility. Not being able to drive it as it is waiting for the ok from the engine, we only have the possibility of collapsing the roof on all those inside. The last of the four maps is Hammerhead, perhaps the least beautiful of the lot, but probably the largest and the one in which the Levolution system is most appreciated. We are mainly above the soft surface of a frozen lake, which can be destroyed by explosives placed as needed, perhaps even when there are tanks on it. And if we wanted to complicate the game even more, there is also a nice snowstorm that can limit the players' vision. An all in all uninteresting battlefield and on balance with little personality, which fails to snatch the scene from a small masterpiece like the giants of Karelia. Not ugly, nor unfunny, just not excellent compared to the others in the DLC.", "date": "2015-01-13", "grade": null}
