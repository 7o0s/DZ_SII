{"name": "Shadow Hearts: From the New World", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/shadow-hearts-from-the-new-world.html", "text": "The new world We are in the United States, in the period of the great depression, of prohibition, that of gangsters like Al Capone and the illicit trafficking of alcohol, of Charleston and the explosion of Jazz. Johnny Garland is a 16-year-old boy who lives in New York and lost his father and brother, as well as his memory, in a tragic fire that took place a few years before the events narrated in the game. For economic reasons, but also in the hope of finding clues about his past, the young man has opened a detective agency together with his friend Lenny, a gigantic colored who is very protective and of few words. One day Professor Gilbert of the University of Arkham shows up in their office, who instructs the agency to gather information on a strange individual of his acquaintance. Having said that Johnny immediately gets to work, but once the man is tracked down, something happens to our friend that will change his life forever. Attacked by a creature apparently from another world, the young man is saved by the Indian-American Natan and by the breasty Princess Shania, the character who in the game can transform into anthropomorphic creatures. Mode-On Maniac: for the record, the aforementioned maid also has one of the most beautiful backsides in the history of video games, especially when she transforms into a winged being Mode-Off Maniac. But let's now analyze the technical part of the game. Without a doubt the most important component of the series has always been, like the plot, the Battle System. In fact, in SHFTNW, it has remained almost unchanged, if we exclude some simple and effective innovations made by programmers to update it, without however distorting the concept that characterized its predecessors, especially the Covenant. The old, new Battle System Considered by RPG enthusiasts as one of the best of the genre ever made, the Battle System is therefore re-proposed here in a version practically identical to the past, but with the addition of an unprecedented option to perform double attacks, and the simplification of Combo management . In the first case it is a command that will allow the gamer to have his Pg perform two types of offense in sequence, for example a physical attack and a magical one one after the other, while in the second case the action can be carried out, when available, instantly, without having to queue up party members and wait for them to be placed, as was the case in the past. This feature in FTNW assumes a very important role, enhancing the strategic component even more, and not only in the offensive phase. In fact, the enemies have similar abilities to the protagonists and therefore can perform very dangerous combos, especially the bosses, if their ~stock gauge~ is not blocked or reduced in good time, preventing them from acting. Another important new feature is the spell management system, here called Stellar magic. Once the Solomon's Key has disappeared, the crests are inserted in special tables (stellar charts) depicting the constellations. In them it is possible to establish, depending on the spaces available, which types of skills we want our character to learn, and if we connect them in the right way, they will give life to other more powerful spells. A bit like what happened, in some ways, in Final Fantasy X with the Spherography. The various slots, of different shapes depending on the type of power they have (circular for healing ones, square for attack ones, of various colors based on the element they may contain, and triangular for other practices -Ed-) can be upgraded, for example leveled up to contain magical elements of a higher degree than the starting ones, while the spells can in turn be customized by reducing their cost in terms of MP consumption, etc. The Judgment Ring All this takes place with a man named Buigen, Gerard's ~boyfriend~ (remember him? He was one of the twins who ran the itinerant shop in SH2 -Ed-) by paying a certain amount. Stellar charts can finally be equipped to any character you want (excluding Shania) at any time. The hub of action in SH's Battle System is once again the Judgment Ring. Nothing happens without him: attacks, use of items, spells, defenses, etc. This system is based on the assumption that the gamer must interact more with what is happening on the screen even after having given the orders to the PCs. When you select an action, the Judgment Ring appears in the upper right of the screen. It can be depicted as a disc inside which a line moves following a circular path, like the hand of a clock. Based on how it is performed, the circle has some sections containing ~slices~ of various colors: pressing the X key toappropriate moment, i.e. whenever the mobile line is inside the aforementioned portions of the ring, we will be able to determine the beginning of the action itself and how many ~moves~ the character can perform. Like saying, for example, that if you have three colored segments in your disc and you have ~caught~ them all with the ~hand~, your hero will inflict three consecutive hits on the enemy at the time of the attack, and so on. Skipping an area implies reducing the number of hits inflicted on the enemy or losing the turn itself. Furthermore, depending on various factors, such as for example the equipment of some particular objects, the line can move more slowly, while the colored areas can in turn be expanded through the acquisition of the usual upgrades. Go-go colours From an aesthetic point of view, From The New World presents itself to our eyes in a totally different way than its predecessor. Abandoned, as mentioned several times in the course of this article, the gothic scenarios of early 1900s Europe, the game has ~passed~ to very colorful and brilliant environments, showing us some of the most beautiful or evocative places in the United States, from Chicago to Grand Canyon, up to Roswell passing through the Alcatraz prison, with an expertise of details and scenographic care of excellent workmanship. But it is the characters, especially in the close-ups, that have been made to perfection, rich in animation and well characterized in their physical antics. From the sound point of view, however, we are witnessing the presence of one of the most unusual soundtracks in the history of RPGs. Yoshitaka Hirota, the composer of the OST of the first two SH, flanked for the occasion by Tomoko Imoto, offers us some excerpts taken from the Covenant, but reworked, plus several unpublished: a strange combination of sounds and music emerges, we repeat, not exactly from Rpg. Jazz, tribal, blues, SHFTNW's soundtrack is decidedly varied. Well made, in line with the issues covered in the story and not at all out of tune with the context. Being the non-direct sequel to the most interesting RPG of the past videogame season is not easy at all. Like it or not, comparisons between games are inevitably made by enthusiasts, and often such comparisons end up crushing the new product if it turns out to be a little too different from what you expected it to be. If then you also put in the competition which has never produced high-level RPGs like in this period (Suikoden V, Grandia III and Final Fantasy XII above all), then it's really tough. Yet Shadow Hearts from the New World defends itself well and indeed, even if in our opinion it loses in atmosphere, it manages to surprise positively, to update itself without conceptually distorting itself, leaving the winning formula of SH unchanged, to the delight of all fans of the saga. Ultimately, a recommended Jrpg. Pros: Plot different than usual but very accurate and valid. Well developed battle system. Great variety of fighting styles and techniques for the PCs. Cons: The new ~colorful~ environments may not appeal to everyone. Dungeons too short and sometimes repetitive. For some years now, the Shadow Hearts saga has become, for J-RPG enthusiasts, almost a sort of ~brand~ in terms of quality, on a par in some ways with that myth that is Final Fantasy. Characterized by an excellent gameplay, a fantasy-horror plot that winks at real historical facts (the First World War and the following period) seasoned with a good dose of humor, the series has in fact been able to impose itself on the general public with its style, carving out an important space for themselves in their hearts, especially thanks to the excellent second episode, Covenant, elected as the best ~made in Japan~ role-playing game of the past videogame season. Shadow Hearts From the New World is the third chapter of this very interesting saga. While basically maintaining the same title, this episode has no narrative link with its predecessors, and therefore we are not talking about a real sequel. In fact, the development team has decided to completely modify the cast of characters and the settings, replacing the gloomy and dark ones of the previous productions with other more colorful and bright ones. The result is a game conceptually similar to its predecessor, we are speaking from a technical point of view, but visually ~different~, which perhaps slightly loses that gothic charm that characterized it thanks also to the scenarios of a decadent wartime Europe, and to the charisma of the protagonist, Yuri , but it still maintains, we say it immediately, on the high quality standards of the saga.", "date": "2006-07-06", "grade": null}
