{"name": "Super Mario Ball", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/super-mario-ball.html", "text": "Rendered flipperamas and progressive unlocks As gratuitous as it is playful, the plot of Mario Ball is based on a machine inaugurated in the world of Mario: a spherical transformation chamber capable of transforming anyone into a rubbery and invulnerable ball, just ideal for being launched and bouncing around. But the cannon that was supposed to fire Princess Peach on a simple target is sabotaged by two Goombas, and delivered directly to the ready-to-close grates of Bowser's castle. Mario jumps into the machine in turn, and the game begins: Mario in the form of a ball works exactly like the canonical pinball ball, and the game is controlled through the side buttons that control the two side bars. Mario Ball, as anticipated, however, is not a normal pinball game. The levels are designed with a division into levels, which communicate thanks to special unlockable cannons inside them, while the various rooms of each level are intercommunicating and progressively unlockable based on the stars obtained by the player in eliminating enemies, collecting bonuses and solving elementary puzzles. All this, playing like a pinball machine. The player will then have to face screens full of enemies to hit and eliminate and interactive elements to operate (such as buttons that activate mechanisms and so on), collecting coins and stars earned and finding the boss of the level who will guarantee a cannon with which to go out towards the others levels. Once you enter a level, despite the possibility of saving, you can only exit at will by unlocking said portal. The progression in the game therefore takes place in the typical Nintendo style: the more stars correspond to a greater number of unlockable doors, which in turn will make us get new stars. The progression takes place vertically on the development of the level, which in each room offers crossroads or further game environments or sub-games, including the shop where you can buy items. These include the Tube, which blocks the ball from falling and the consequent loss of an attempt, the mushroom that increases the size and power of the Mario-ball, the shrinking mushroom, the invulnerability star, a Yoshi egg that can be used to trigger Multiball at will, and so on. In the process of re-ludizing the pinball machine, the level selection menu has also been made into a playable part: on the home screen you can ~shoot yourself~ towards the levels or enter the introductory pinball fairground environments, where you can access secret areas (such as the classic SuperMarioWorld Ghost House) or special bonuses. The levels are full of bonuses, such as a tower of targets that can be activated with a Yoshi egg that with each shot drops one level up to the hefty final bonus; or patterns of enemies to hit in a certain order. Rendered flipperamas and progressive unlocks The visual presentation is excellent, with vibrant colors, well-crafted rendered backgrounds and shades, smooth and rich animations and an excellent depth effect - all combined with the minimalist beauty of the rendered-style Mariasque aesthetic style. The music, although not excellent, do their duty, underlining the action in a pleasant way. But then, what is the problem with Mario Ball? As suggested at the beginning of the piece, it is control. It is clear that Mario Golf did not want to be a simulation title, and it is not a defect. The game explicitly renounces to produce an analog simulation of the shots given to the ball, and doesn't even try to make up for the excessive power of the shots, perhaps making the paddles longer to vary the effect. Even the control, it is evident in the design of certain levels, renounces realism and is calibrated on the objectives. For example, some circular arenas require you to be able to spin the ball whirling, with a clear adjustment, by the CPU, of the imprinted directions. This is a legitimate choice, and indeed works well with some bosses, for whom the characteristics of the arenas and this style of control provide a valid fusion between pinball action and attack and defense strategies. But the control remains imprecise, throwing Mario in arbitrary directions and always at full speed, frustrating the player with the goodness of the levels and graphical presentation. One of the most annoying effects of imprecise control is the fact that one tends, due to some improbable bounce of the ball, to involuntarily exit the screen where a star has finally been unlocked (both against enemies and against imprecise control): at that point, the CPU will inexplicably reset thescreen, condemning us not only to have to go back but also to redo it from scratch. If in the early levels these structural flaws only build doubts in the player still intoxicated by the beautiful graphics and the original concept, later in the game, as the complexity and difficulty of the boards and enemies progresses, it translates into a sense of dissatisfaction and frustration . It's a real shame: Mario Ball has an original concept, which tries to graft the progressive mechanics of games from a completely different genre onto the pinball machine: but it completely ruins it due to a superficial control system and some very little choices spot on in terms of game design. Pokemon Pinball and Pinball of the Dead weren't that ambitious, yet they both provide a level of simulation goodness and precise control over the medium by targeting different players: just what Mario Ball lacks, which could have easily established itself as a innovative and original title. It remains a discreet title, but decidedly disappointing compared to the potential of the concept and recommended only for fans of electronic and non-electronic pinball machines. Pros: A good attempt at a different pinball game Power-ups, subgames, original mechanics Excellent aesthetics and graphics Cons: Inaccurate game physics Poorly finished progress in levels Lack of attention to game design Mario Ball is primarily a pinball game. It is one of those cases in which the cannibalistic capabilities of the video game are dedicated to the electronic reformulation of a classic game formula, pinball or pinball, which indeed has an ancient history of encounters and clashes with the video game. But Mario Ball is not a canonical pinball game. Rather, it is an attempt at hybridization between the pinball machine and the play structure that unites Nintendo productions that are also very different by genre, and usually with Mario as the protagonist: bonuses and power-ups, minimal puzzles and reflection elements, mini-games and variations on the theme, progressive unlocking of areas. The result is certainly not brilliant, not for the ideas but for the execution. The visual presentation of Mario Ball is excellent, as is the audio proposal and the idea of conceiving a pinball machine based on progress through the levels and original mechanics, such as the strategies to adopt to defeat enemies, having to collect stars necessary to obtain new portions of levels and the purchase and use of powerups taken from the marisco universe and adapted to the pinball gameplay. But Mario Ball's real flaw is a too simplistic control of the medium, which makes the experience quite frustrating, soon unsatisfactory in the face of the validity of the missions and capable of ruining the good amount of valid ideas, which remain badly playable. Precluding the game from a judgment that goes beyond the advice for the remaining (few, unfortunately) fans of the evergreen pinball machine.", "date": "2004-12-24", "grade": null}
