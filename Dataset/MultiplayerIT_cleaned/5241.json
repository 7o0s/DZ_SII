{"name": "Action platform d'altri tempi", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/174998-dan-the-man-action-platform-daltri-tempi.html", "text": "A village is attacked by a criminal organization and the protagonist's girlfriend, Josie, ends up being kidnapped and locked up in the castle of an evil king. The heroic Dan immediately sets off in pursuit, and relying on his knowledge of martial arts decides to defeat the enemy army through twelve action-packed stages and platforms. After the original Fruit Ninja and the endless runner Jetpack Joyride, the developers of Halfbrick Studios have decided to try their hand at an action platformer with traditional connotations, which closely resembles some 90s coin-ops and uses a solid combat system and varied, whose moves can not only be upgraded but also unlocked to be able to draw on an even wider set of shots. The touch controls support this system very well, with two arrows (perhaps a little small) on the left side of the screen to move the character and three buttons on the right side for throwing punches, jumping and using any thrown or firearms collected in tour. The progression of the stages is made up of increasingly tough and numerous enemies, which change type as you enter the adventure, as well as retractable platforms, secret areas, coins to collect and even huge bosses to defeat. Dan the Man is a traditional action platformer, but terribly solid and fun ~To be the man you gotta beat the man~ The gameplay of Dan the Man, as mentioned, draws heavily on the classics of the action platform genre, without introducing substantial innovations or original ideas but trying to bring something to mobile devices that other development teams have not been able to offer, for one reason or another. The approach to the freemium model of the game is also very elastic: the download from the App Store and Google Play is free and you are never required to spend real money, provided you watch short trailers from time to time, sometimes in exchange for a medkit or an item to use, or at a checkpoint. It is possible to get rid of ads by purchasing a special package, but in fact the adventure can be completed without ever putting a hand in the wallet. There is also no shortage of extras: beyond the additional characters that can be used in Dan's place, all equally equipped with upgradeable skills, you can try your hand at the daily challenges and a couple of survival modes. In short, the campaign is not very long but is supported by a side dish capable of entertaining for a long time. However, the strength of Dan the Man is the mix between gameplay and controls, which works perfectly and allows you to fight to the best of your ability, hitting your opponents with the basic combo, with the charged shot or with flying kicks to take your time in situations where you are heavily outnumbered, perhaps when faced with enemies who can open fire from a distance. The graphics are excellent and offer an excellent mix between the pixel art of the 16-bit era and the characteristic style of Halfbrick Studios productions, with cartoonish characters, a good variety of settings and a clever use of colors.", "date": "2016-10-12", "grade": "8.5"}
