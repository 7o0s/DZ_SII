We are obviously talking about the Career mode, the highlight of the production of the English software house. The press is the litmus test of our performances: initially it will ask us a series of useful questions for the basic settings of our driver, such as the name and nationality, and again through the beautiful journalist it will be possible to select the level of difficulty among the four available; then he will submit us to the inevitable pre and post race questions. Once the basic settings have been decided, we will choose which team to take on our journey towards the top teams. In fact, it is not possible to immediately sit aboard a Ferrari or Red Bull, but as it should be, real lungs are made available to us such as the HRT, the Lotus or the Virgin, cars that are only good for showing off during the season , therefore aspiring to a more profitable contract with other teams, but above all to placements at least close to the points zone. Last row One of the strengths of Codemasters production is therefore the management of career seasons (from a minimum of three to a maximum of seven years). Very intelligently, it's not just about winning, which is practically impossible with an HRT, but above all about finishing ahead of your teammate, both in terms of fastest laps, in pole position and, obviously, in the race. This translates into the possibility of directing the development of the car, selecting what to look for and therefore effectively building one's driving style over time. In practice, the first season, given the lack of high-profile objectives, is an internal struggle with one's partner constantly to be beaten to be the top driver of the team, directly in the pits, sitting in our single-seater we can always keep an eye on the evolution of the challenge. This system works really well, practically forcing us to never save ourselves, even in free practice and above all it gives us an extra stimulus in the initial moments when it is very realistic to see ourselves being lapped after a few laps by the leading cars. The objectives are therefore well structured, between the minimum race position and the ~team~ position, the race weekend, be it short or long, will never be short on emotions and conditions to overcome, all put to the whip by a a race that is always a lottery, especially in the moments following the start, when the tussle at the first corner often becomes a real bumper car. Another of the variants brought into play by Codemasters to make career evolution more realistic is the relationship with the media, in the form of short multiple choice interviews. For example, questions ask for our views on the race, short- and long-term goals, and the merits of our performance. Being modest, down to earth and never forgetting to thank the team is a good encouragement to have good relations with the team, which is supposed to be important in terms of car development. Unfortunately, the questions tend to be repeated quite often, and even if we want to be braggart with the press, if the race objectives have been achieved, there doesn't seem to be a strong impact of our thoughts on the continuation of the season. This will not be a fundamental feature in terms of gameplay, but it certainly works to make the staging of the season even more realistic and ~television~. Brawl on the track! What many may be wondering is whether F1 2010 is a simulation game or not, whether this search for pre-race verisimilitude is matched by punctual and credible car behaviour. In the game, the search for simulation fidelity is given by a multiplicity of factors, not only those strictly related to driving physics. In the paddock, and to be precise in our motorhome, which as in DIRT acts as a central hub from where we move through the various game modes, it is possible to establish how to play the title. By playing with the aids activated, for example ABS and Traction Control, deactivating the damage and ~automating~ the stops and entry to the pits and keeping the invasiveness of the race judges to a minimum, with the penalties discounted at the end of the race, the title it can be played with great ease, without however falling into excessive ease of use. As justifiableor that both the physics of the car are more forgiving of excursions on the grass and sudden opening of the gas on the curbs, but more generally it is not possible to race lightly: going long at braking, cutting corners or hitting the cars in front of us translates into precious extra seconds that make us lose the position gained in the race. It is possible to ~rewind~ up to a maximum of four times the time to repeat a section in which you made a big mistake, but more generally you never have the sensation of running with the autopilot activated, and thanks to the objectives of race you will literally be glued to the monitor, fully concentrated so as not to make a mistake, arriving safely at the finish line. The situation changes completely if you decide to play realistically, both in the behavior of the car and in the regulation, with damage and wear of the mechanical parts that compromise performance. The first thing that catches the eye, after the first physiological skids caused by the traction no longer softened by the electronics, is that the damage is not as realistic as the setting of the title might suggest. Ailerons and noses break, the tires jump and get punctured, but in fact, probably due to a not too punitive design choice to avoid throwing the pad towards the monitor too often, the clashes seem to stage consequences not so traumatic compared to what happened. There are breakages, but bumps at maximum speed don't lead to retirement, the impression is that everything has been undersized to still be able to complete the races. From wet! Going back and talking about the behavior of the car, we can't help but be satisfied with the work of Codemasters. First of all, unassisted cars require a good period of settling in and practice, making us forget the immoderate opening of the throttle when exiting the curve. In this sense, the pad succumbs to the precision of a good steering wheel with pedals. Secondly, but not least, tire and engine wear, not to mention the incredibly dynamic weather, play a major role in the race. The driving model provides a credible representation of the different grip conditions of the car: the tires need time to reach temperature, they get damaged and dirty on the gravel and running at full speed with nice bubbles on the tread leads us to make mistakes which under normal conditions we would never have done that. The dynamic weather is the variant that makes the leap in quality to the game. In practice, the race strategies, which can be completely automatic if we have recourse to our engineer who decides when to stop for the obligatory tire change, risk being completely upset by the rain that arrives, more or less suddenly on the track, and which it forces us to make decisions that will have a major impact on the race. The ballet is well known, put on the intermediate immediately hoping it will rain soon, stay inside with slicks hoping for good weather or give it a go with heavy rain hoping for a good storm? The choices are risky, but above all each compound needs its own conditions to run at its best, therefore, for example, with the intermediate or rain tires fitted, with the track almost dry, before returning to the pits, it is better to go through the wet areas and so away, a sort of push and pull that will grill our nerves. If we then want to feel even more involved in the evolution process of the car, whether we are playing it in simulation mode or in the ~facilitated~ one, in the pits we can dedicate ourselves to the meticulous tuning of the car, with many parameters to modify . Fortunately, the developers have foreseen that the various settings can be saved and loaded, so as to avoid long sessions of recalibration of the single-seater. Our judgment on the career mode can only be positive therefore. The impression of being part of the Circus is really strong, in short, the ~outline~ set up by Codemasters to feel part of the life of the competition works, and in this sense the actual race is only the tip of the iceberg of a always satisfying gaming experience at whatever level you play it. The discreet artificial intelligence also contributes to this sensation. Aggressive, especially in the top drivers, without reaching the counters anyway, rather normal without particular peaks neither upwards nor downwards that of the remaining drivers, who limit themselves to doing their homework by following the trajectories. Not everything, as written above, is free from defects, the damage that is sometimes only mentioned is the most fitting example, more generally, however, it is possible to say that theattempt to renew the career mode has certainly been successful. Playstation 3 trophies F1 2010 rewards the player with fifty trophies, distributed in both the single player and multiplayer campaigns. Most are obtained with progression in Career mode, others are certainly more interesting and particular, such as the one that requires us to win at Monza with Ferrari, or the one that commits us to breaking Shumacher's record of forty victories from pole. More generally, F1 2010 doesn't require particular numbers to unlock trophies, just a lot of dedication to the game. Rains! Bernie thief! All those who want to relax during the ride towards contracts with Ferrari and McLaren can still benefit from other game modes. The Grand Prix mode allows us to go directly to the race, choosing how many and which events to participate in, and obviously with which car, no more Cosworth lungs in short. There is very little to say about the timed mode, while on the online side Codemasters has foreseen three types of game for twelve people at the same time, the fast one, the custom one and the Endurance one. The last two are particularly interesting for several reasons: with the custom we can act on different racing parameters, while Endurance puts us in the race in real duration conditions, with all the annexes and connected. From a technical point of view, F1 2010 pushes the potential of Codemasters' Ego game engine to the max. The sensation of speed is very high, both in the ~higher~ views and in those from the cockpit which are truly immersive, perhaps a little too low. Driving from the eyes of the protagonist is sometimes a terrifying experience, the moment of braking trying not to crash into the other competitors is something that in the first moments, in the first races, will really put us in difficulty, damage or not, and we won't forget so much quickly. Looking for a more objective examination of the cosmetic qualities of the title, the work done for the modeling of the cars is certainly to be commended, truly indistinguishable from the real counterparts, thanks also to textures that only in some situations give way to small criticisms, for example for some stickers applied to the bodies, a bit lower resolution than the rest. But where the game excels, and we've already talked about this in terms of gameplay, is in the weather. The rain, whether light or heavy, is rendered on the screen in an extremely realistic way, so real that when racing in a full storm it is advisable to abandon the view from the helmet, given that the water raised by the cars in front of us makes us practically blind . Scary and thrilling, and at the same time a feast for the eyes, with the plus of the believable refraction of the puddles on the environment. It would seem a game of 10 and praise, obviously not everything is perfect. The frame rate runs fixed at 30 FPS: this value for a driving title could already have some repercussions on the simulation fidelity but to make matters worse in the most agitated situations it tends to miss a few shots, no clicks, but a small decrease in speed is perceived . Good, but not at the level of the car, the surroundings; the same thing goes for the NPC models in career mode, mechanics, journalists and so on, who do their job without excelling. Finally, certainly a side detail but no less interesting for true enthusiasts, telemetry is completely absent, an element that could instead increase the simulation value of F1 2010.", "date": "2010-09-24", "grade": "8.7"}
