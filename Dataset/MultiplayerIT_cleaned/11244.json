In 2017 the spin-off Life is Strange: Before the Storm was published, on which the US studio worked, proving to be able to manage a narrative based on facts and characters that did not belong to it. Although unpublished, it was still a story that would have told the past of Chloe Price and Rachel Amber, two key characters from the original Life is Strange. It's never easy to go to work on something that hasn't been thought of firsthand, but the developers have been able to present us with a pleasant game that is faithful to what Dontnod has done. A few years later, Deck Nine had another not exactly simple task, namely to take the reins of the series after a not exactly brilliant Life is Strange 2 - and Tell Me Why, based on the same concept of out of the ordinary protagonists. Life is Strange: True Colors is the result of their efforts. A much more intimate experience than the previous ones because it touches the very delicate theme of emotions but, above all, a game that has managed to faithfully follow the path traced by Dontnod with Life is Strange and from which the same authors then deviated in favor of chapters supported by social themes and nothing else. The review of Life is Strange: True Colors allows us to discover the game in its PS5 version. The weight of other people's emotions Life ie Strange: True Colors, Alex has the power to sense other people's emotions The problem that always emerges during reviews of this kind of game, and with Life is Strange: True Colors in particular, is always the same: how to tell a narrative video game which, in the end, is nothing if not an introspective journey built on single player basis? How can we explain to you how much and why we were struck by the construction of characters and scenes, without being able to go into detail? Or how did we feel close to a situation, which out of respect for you we won't talk about? Simple, you can't. We cannot accompany you in the core of Life is Strange: True Colors, in the essence that captured us leading us to appreciate it so much, but yes, we can spend a few words on the journey. Alex's and ours, because, despite being a character with his own well-defined personality, Alex invites us into his world: to put on his shoes, to control a power that must make us omnipotent and instead brings us to our knees, because it doesn't exist nothing more intimate, unstable and dangerous than the human soul. What to do when, unknowingly, people are all in the palm of our hand? When are their secrets, emotions, most intimate thoughts there, ready to be browsed? Here, Alex's adventure in Haven Springs has taught us above all this: the value and respect for emotions, even when some choices seem easy, obvious, discounted - right. Right and correct, however, don't always go hand in hand and faced with life's injustices, often the best choice is simply to accept it. Deck Nine slams it in our faces: justice is just an expectation destined to remain disregarded, or a revenge to which it is decided to assign a more noble and higher value. Can we pursue it and make it concrete, manipulating others in our favor? Of course, the important thing is to live with the inevitable consequences. Journey to Haven Springs Life is Strange: True Colors, Alex and Steph Alex Chen is not a girl like any other. Since she was a child she has been affected by a curse: to perceive the emotions of others to the point of being conditioned in turn, if they prove too strong to bear. Imagine what it could mean for a person who was orphaned from a young age, having to deal with herself, but above all with the weight of other people's emotions. Alex spent a decade moving from house to house, family to family, never finding his place in the world. At least until her older brother Gabe manages to contact her and invites her to the peaceful, laughing Haven Springs: a town surrounded by greenery, where everyone knows everyone, where they can start over - or perhaps it would be better to say begin, because a real life Alex doesn't he still had it. Her powers haunt her, however the presence of Gabe and the benevolence of the inhabitants make inroads right away: at least until an accident causes Gabe's death, leading Alex towards a new, personal hell. Refusing to surrender to the evidence, or that he can really having been a tragic accident, Alex will give all of herself to discover the truth, using her powers and finding herself in the difficult situation of deciding whether to ask someone for help and therefore reveal this part of herself. The five chapters into which the game is divided I enjoyalmost all of an excellent writing, despite the simplicity of the plot, because it is the construction of the characters that makes the everyday life of Haven Springs realistic: despite the presence of the paranormal dictated by Alex's powers, these are not the fulcrum of the events. They are a means of exploring herself and those around her, enabling us to discover other people's secrets and decide what to do with them. There is tragedy, yes, but there is also the knowledge that life goes on even when the ones we love are gone. Herein lies the beauty of Life is Strange: True Colors, in the ability to paint real, plausible scenes which, in their avoidance of dwelling exclusively on mourning, do not clash at all. Alex always pursues his hunger for justice, and at the same time is a twenty-one-year-old girl who hasn't known the serenity of a normal life for a long time. For this reason it is easy to empathize with her and with her surroundings. In a climax made of seriousness and lightheartedness, which slips and gets dirty only in the final bars, speeding up some passages, that of Alex in Haven Springs is a realistic cross-section where everyone tries to come to terms with their emotions - fear, suffering , concern, regret, unaware that we are always one step ahead. Our supposed omnipotence, however, is the worst weakness. A gameplay capable of surprising Life is Strange: True Colors, intense emotions can lead to a Nova In terms of gameplay, Life is Strange: True Colors remains on the path traced previously: you move freely around Haven Springs, you use the powers to probe people's emotions and possibly do something for them, you go in search of objects which preserve the memory of whoever handled them in their time - a pleasant ploy to delve into the history of the town and its inhabitants. All things we have already seen, a formula that given the nature of the game it makes no sense to change. However, this does not mean that Deck Nine has really remained idle and there is a specific point of the game, an entire chapter indeed, which reaches its peak both in terms of narrative and for the gameplay it offers: the developers have built around a single concept, coming to mix two completely different genres. We won't tell you anything else, but we were surprised and genuinely amused by how they managed to implement one genre into another without making it feel forced. Heaven Springs, the city featured in Life is Strange: True Colors Indeed, to be honest we would have been disappointed if they hadn't done it, given the narrative premises: yet they still managed to surprise us at the end, creating the right context for us to take a breath and then resume the story following the normal flow of the gameplay. Life is Strange: True Colors remains a narrative adventure, accompanied by at most a couple of mini-games in retro arcade form, but that unexpected splash of color is what makes it different from previous games. Just like in the past, Alex can make decisions that will drastically change the narrative but in this case, by virtue of his powers, the mechanics of the Nova are added: those emotions are so called so powerful as to transform the world around them and allow Alex to trace the nature of the trauma, helping to overcome it. In very rare cases, it is even possible to absorb the emotion that is corroding the person in question, once again acting on the story and its consequences. If on the one hand these occasions are really rare, on the other it is also understandable they are, both for the number of characters involved in the events and for the nature of their emotions. Not to mention the fact that, by absorbing them, Alex becomes a sort of time bomb and this would have led to inconsistent management of the character and probable emotional schizophrenia. The developers have played the card cautiously, but overall it doesn't feel as weak as it might seem. Technical compartment Life is Strange: True Colors, Alex dabbles in the guitar Thanks to the performance capture, Life is Strange: True Colors is aesthetically the best product of the series. The characters finally enjoy a genuine and convincing expressiveness, capable of speaking for them, often leaving the task of characterizing them and conveying their mood to gestures and expressions: Alex's inability to relate to others is dictated from his sometimes shifty gaze, from occasional tics in his hands; Steph (taken from Life is Strange: Before the Storm) is impetuous and cheeky, attitudes perfectly readable by observing her carefully. Each of the characters has some traits that his proxemics expresses, more or less clearlynte, allowing the game to bring to life a compelling and diverse cast. The supporting characters do not enjoy the same care but we have not seen one equal to the other and even those few with whom we interact to reveal their emotions manage to stand out in their own small way. Then there is the soundtrack, the backbone of the Life is Strange that had been lost in the last works of Dontnod and here it returns in a big way: no track is ever really out of place, whether it's from the plot or linked to those moments of pause that Alex can take to reflect on herself and what surrounds it.", "date": "2021-09-08", "grade": "8.3"}
