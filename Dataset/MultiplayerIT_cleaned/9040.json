The same development team took care of the first sequel, albeit under a different name after Take-Two's acquisition of the studio, which also secured the rights to publish the series. All this to then arrive up to 2009 and to a new publisher, Kalypso Media, with which Tropico 3 was entrusted to the hands of Haemimont Games, a development team based in Bulgaria. Also called to work on Tropico 4, the guys from Sofia were thus able to offer the series the first moment to enjoy real continuity between one episode and another, despite the fact that the count of chapters has reached four in the meantime . After this brief introduction on the origins of Tropico, let's answer those who are wondering at this point what it is about in practical terms: imagine being on an equally imaginary Caribbean island (even if the reference to Cuba is evident); in this wonderful earthly paradise the command is entrusted to El Presidente, committed to running the economy, society and politics of the so-called Banana Republic existing on the site, obviously leveraging on the power guaranteed to him by his totalitarian office. All this between corruption, ideologies of all kinds and the need to properly satisfy one's people, giving them a way to be happy without being forced to suffer the armed force of the dictator and the rebels. More of the same When we find ourselves talking about a sequel, we often end up dividing our attention between the comparison with the previous chapter of the series and the considerations of the game itself, thus benefiting both old and new players of the series. In the case of Tropico 4, such an operation is not only a habit but practically becomes an obligation, given and considering that those who already own Tropico 3 will find, all in all, few differences waiting for it, mainly as a side dish to a gameplay that is remained the same in substance. Compared to the 2008 game, the innovations introduced by Haemimont Games in Tropico 4 are in fact marginal: there are several new constructions in agreement, but all for their own sake, in the sense that they do not expand any game element already seen in Tropico 3. The same can be said for the elements already existing in the past but slightly changed, such as the ministers' palace where it is now necessary to hire one's own collaborators individually for internal, foreign, education, defense and health care: if it would be reasonable to expect possible upheavals, all this translates into only a few small differences with respect to the already known system of edicts, without this being therefore expanded in any direction. And it's a real shame, because on balance it would have taken very little to make Tropico 4 also a succulent prey for lovers of its predecessor. Life as a President As we said, however, we must also see Tropico 4 through the eyes of those who have never had the opportunity to approach the series before, finding themselves playing with a mind free from possible comparisons. The result is an absolutely enjoyable title, even if perhaps lacking in long-term appeal: after having faced an exhaustive initial tutorial, the campaign allows you to play through twenty different missions of increasing difficulty. Once these are finished, a sandbox mode remains at our disposal in which to play freely, plus the possibility of creating custom maps with the game editor, sharing your own and downloading those of other players from the web: on balance, a little make sure we keep ourselves as El Presidente for the long haul. In the same way, however, it is undeniable that Tropico 4 makes fun its trump card, especially in the early stages of the game, mainly thanks to the well-chosen sense of humor that constantly advances the campaign in a mixture of simulation and parody of reality, including the most bizarre quotes from the sentences spoken by new and old politicians (including ours). The simulation aspect sees us engaged in managing the society and the economy of our island, designing apartments and building farms that can feed its inhabitants, possibly tending to improve their quality of life by providing them with work and education: easy to said so far, a little less done, given that not all citizens have the same mentality and the same needs, so to be truly successful it is necessary to navigate between the requests of religious, environmentalists, communists, capitalists and whoever has more , the more you put. Thethe result coincides with a quite pleasant city builder, even if in line with the classic canons of this genre and with a not exaggerated depth. From the point of view of difficulty, Tropico 4 behaves in a generally normal way, sometimes reaching some slightly higher peaks in the various tasks entrusted to us by our advisers: it sometimes happens that we have to give binding answers without having the possibility to give a look at the related statistics to understand which of the options to choose, thus risking ruining relations with some foreign state. The development team has also thought of making a ~social~ dimension of Tropico 4 available to the player, including full integration of the social networks Facebook and Twitter for posting photos and game achievements. Earthquakes and other disasters Returning for a moment to the additions compared to Tropico 3, we now find some new natural disasters ready to shatter our plans as President, but above all our buildings: earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes happen in real time thanks to the game engine, which thus allows the player to witness their effects live. Speaking of graphics, Tropico 4 offers the level of glance that one might expect from a title of its kind, giving ample power to zoom on the streets of our beautiful town to see what the inhabitants are doing: every single person is in fact, it can be selected to see his thoughts and intentions, and if necessary, to undertake repressive actions, more or less hidden. The sound is particularly pleasant and therefore worthy of note, at least in the English version in our possession which perfectly follows the parodistic line already mentioned, with marked accents and inevitable clichs. In the background to our vocation as a charismatic leader we also find a series of more or less salty motifs, certainly pleasant to hear even if not exaggerated in variety and number.", "date": "2011-10-04", "grade": "7.5"}
