The life cycle of Call of Duty Infinite Warfare, however, is far from being concluded and to remind us of it comes like a bolt from the blue Continuum, the second of the four downloadable contents scheduled for this year. Unfortunately, a bit like it was for Sabotage, the DLC doesn't seem to have managed to bring anything really innovative, limiting itself, as often happens in these cases, to throwing meat on the fire of dubious quality without however found details that could bring the players closer together less assiduous. As always, therefore, this addition is designed exclusively for those who still spend their days on Call of Duty and will hardly be able to stimulate any curiosity towards those who have already abandoned the title for a few months. Let's see together which are the best contents of the package and which instead those that could have been made with more attention. Three new maps, a remake and a new zombie map are no longer enough One map is as good as another Continuum does not offer any particularly exciting maps but at least three out of four of the ones present are quite pleasant to play. Turista's structure is simple although not symmetrical: three huge main corridors guide the flow of players for clashes that are often resolved over short distances, while not denying some positions from which to take enemies in the distance. The map therefore offers a good variety of situations, but the fun is sunk by respawn points not cared for enough and an exaggerated size, even for those who usually use wallruns and double jumps frequently. On the other hand, we didn't miss Rust frankly and finding it in this package under the name of Excess certainly didn't make us jump for joy. Excess is a rather small square map, the central tower dominates the whole area and represents the fulcrum of the fighting, the area where players pile up to get some easy kills. It's also the only area from which snipers can have essentially 360-degree command of the area below, making ground level hell. Having practically nowhere to hide under makes ambushes very easy, especially now that soldiers can double jump and wallrun in total freedom. Speaking of wall racing, Infinity Ward seems to have greatly lowered the mobility on these maps, limiting the surfaces on which it is possible to move freely, a curious choice that somewhat betrays the soul of Infinite Warfare by giving instead a slightly less hectic than in the past. Scrap instead substantially changes the type of approach. From the total opening of Excess we pass to having only two lines in an elliptical map, where the frontal clashes on the medium and long range are the masters. There are great places to lurk but also several covers obtained from the quartered containers so as to protect yourself and cut the play area in two, for a balanced and quite pleasant map to play. Even the setting, a lunar base with the earth as a background is not bad at all, and to give it more charisma so as to make it memorable, or at least try to, a mega magnet takes care of it placed right in the middle of the hottest area which substantially reverses the gravity allowing you to fight upside down or perform unpredictable actions. For us, the best location of the whole package. Finally, we close with Archive which instead wants to represent the usual map with narrow and narrow spaces, designed for those who love fast firefights, mainly based on reflections. Outdoor areas are scarce and everything is played out inside a nest of rooms and warehouses where the lines of fire are often disturbed by works of art or strange ornamental objects, including a huge shark that emerges from the floor. Four maps therefore that do not distort the way of playing this Call of Duty but which, at least qualitatively, beat those presented in the previous package. Strike of the Rising Dragon! The new zombie map tries to offer the classic content we are used to by now. Shaolin Shuffle brings new zombies, new traps, a new sub-plot and, of course, a few additional hours of gameplay for those who love this specific mode. The first thing that catches the eye taking the first steps in the new location is the dlower difficulty than in the past, a situation that makes it much easier to be able to get to the final areas to complete the game. We don't know if this was a weighted choice or simply due to the conformation of the map, or perhaps to the new powers, but compared to past contents, where blood had to be spit right away so as not to be torn apart, the difference is palpable . Personally, also given the lack of assiduity with which we play now, it is an element that we did not mind at all but veterans instead may not particularly appreciate the choice, sought after new exciting challenges in the DLCs. Anyway, whatever your opinion, it will be the 70s to welcome you this time with classic weapons that leave room for very dangerous Kung fu moves! That's right, the first waves of zombies will be shredded by your fists, flaming shurikens, and even Chi-powered special moves that summon Chinese dragons, tigers, and other spirit guides to your rescue. It's all very Bruce Lee, a bit like a second-rate film, but it must be said that the atmosphere that you breathe works quite well, resulting at the same time light-hearted and in line with what has been offered up to now. You will have the opportunity to exploit different powers thanks to which you can freeze enemies or set them on fire or even perform flying kicks charged to break through the wall of brain-eaters that will appear in front of you. As you pass the various scenes, things will get complicated and you can decide to put martial arts aside and switch to the classic guns, very useful for fighting the new types of zombies added for the occasion. Given the martial arts theme, our brain-eating friends will also have some new strikes to show you and you can expect the undead quickly jumping on the walls or throwing backhanded kicks: the apotheosis of trash. As far as the location itself is concerned, the work done is more than discreet, with a good variety of environments and situations and an intricate tangle of portals and shortcuts that make the setting particularly dynamic. You go from a subway stop to a square with burning cars, up to respectable streets on whose sides stand huge buildings decorated with neon and light bulbs, to then continue with passages and scaffolding that will take you to play directly on the roofs. An appreciable variety that will accompany you for the duration of this new adventure, hoping that the content described up to now will be enough for you until the next DLC.", "date": "2017-04-22", "grade": null}
