{"name": "The Club", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-club_b.html", "text": "There are no doubts, Gears of War has ~cleared~ a certain type of third-person action game, full of elements taken from first person shooters, and some developers have only been able to follow in its wake, trying to provide their own interpretation on the matter . The Club is based precisely on this structure, with our character who must eliminate a certain number of enemies within each stage, trying to deliver his shots with style and speed to obtain the respect and acclaim of an audience of very well paying spectators. The starting theme is not very original, let's say that on a film level we were able to witness such a story in ~The Running Man~, a 1982 film based on a novel by Stephen King and strong in the presence of a young Arnold Schwarzenegger as the protagonist . Clearly, on PC and console The Club can count on next-generation graphics... and on mobile? On mobile, let's face it right away, the SEGA title immediately presents itself as a ~normal~ product, from every point of view. Not being able to replicate the original structure, the developers of Rockpool Games have opted for an ~imaginative~ approach, transforming everything into a two-dimensional shooter on rails. You got it right, ~on rails~, in the sense that we cannot directly control the movement of our character, but influence his choices as much as possible when crossroads arise, while we focus on the fundamental element of this mobile version of The Club: shooting . Each stage is organized as a more or less long path, littered with opponents and objects that can be destroyed (often to obtain upgrades or money), and our only task is to make our alter ego turn in the right direction to fire with his machine gun. Automatically. Visually, it's simple: the range of the weapon is represented by a series of waves, so you have to rotate it by pressing the joystick left and right to ~frame~ enemies, crates and explosive cans. It is possible to collect upgrades that expand the range of action or make our machine gun more effective, but we don't have who knows what control over these elements. In the end everything translates into identifying the dangers quickly and rotating the crosshair accordingly, eliminating the threats before they inflict damage on us (which can still be recovered thanks to the medical kits hidden in the boxes). Once a level has been completed, you can watch a replay of the action (complete with special keys) and decide how to manage the points earned, cashing them in immediately or ~betting~ on the success of the next stage. The graphics of the game do not cry out to a miracle, let's say that it falls into what could now be defined as the ~old generation~ of mobile gaming: small and poorly animated sprites, scenarios with no personality and repetitive elements, scrolling just enough. There are enough things moving on the screen and there is no slowdown, that must be said, even if the fifteen locations are too similar for the player to want to ~see what's next~. Unfortunately, the sound sector does not help raise the average: there is very little music (perhaps only one), decidedly anonymous, and some sampled effects that leave the tempo it finds (but above all create slowdowns on certain terminals).
