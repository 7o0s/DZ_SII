However, the world of video games is an unpredictable world, and if on the one hand a title costing millions of dollars and programmed by an entire team can disappoint (every reference to Mighty No.9 is purely coincidental), on the other a single person can have the talent necessary to develop a remarkable project using some money set aside and one's free time. There aren't many examples - after all, it's not exactly easy to catch single individuals gifted with such ability to be able to carry out similar projects in solitude - but when it happens to find one in front of him, his passion for video games always manages to inspire us and leave us speechless . Francisco Tellz de Meneses, a developer based in Barcelona, had already given us proof of being part of this tiny Olympus with his Unepic, a video game strongly inspired by Metroidvanias and the very distant The Maze of Gallous, so we approached his with good expectations second project: Ghost 1.0. It is a poorly advertised product, almost ignored by the ~YouTube that counts~ or by specialist sites, and barely advertised, yet deep down we were convinced that it was yet another unjustly underestimated title. Luckily we were right. After Unepic, Francisco Tellz surprised us with a metroidvania: here is our review of Ghost 1.0 Digitized agent The premise of Ghost 1.0 is rather classic and rests on a sci-fi background that seems to have already been seen, but is still not without interesting ideas: we are in a distant ultra-modern future, in which the Nakamura Corporation has become one of the main world economic powers thanks to the sale of super intelligent androids called Naka. Were it not for their obedience to orders, the Naka would be indistinguishable from humans, and it is precisely to investigate the origin of these androids and on the Nakamura that two reckless nerds named Jacker and Boogan hire a special agent called Ghost. However, Ghost is no ordinary soldier, as she is able to take control of any robot by projecting a sort of digital spectrum. It is thanks to this ability that our heroine manages to be ~sent~ without problems within the space base of the megacorporation, blending in with the robotic workers. From there begins an adventure full of humor, quotes, and with some interesting twists, which while not reversing the genre is well written and exciting enough (and is also well translated into Italian). Tellz has the gift of not taking himself too seriously when writing the plots of his video games, so it becomes easy to become attached to his characters, especially the clumsy hackers who guide Ghost's actions by dint of remote communications. However, this is not a narrative game, but a metroidvania, so the narrative is only a small part of the package. We are talking about an ancient genre, rarely taken up in today's videogame industry and it is not easy to manage, therefore the success of a product that refers to it depends on innumerable factors. The fact that the good Francisco managed to get almost all of them to the brim is further testament to his skill. The inverted turtle test The fulcrum of a Metroidvania is exploration: they are titles with extremely complex maps full of secrets, where you progress by unlocking passages, and you acquire skills and weapons by defeating enemies. Ghost 1.0 does not abandon these bases, but revises them slightly to give everything a more unique and personal imprint. In fact, here there is no shortage of backtracking and initially unreachable areas, but much of the gameplay revolves around Ghost's ability to ~possess~ enemy robots equipped with fairly advanced artificial intelligence. This allows the heroine not only to overcome certain encounters without having to enter battle directly, but also to activate switches and remote platforms by temporarily moving enemy worker robots or soldiers. Tellez obviously didn't ignore the potential of this ~power~ and therefore filled his creature with puzzles related to robotic possession, which in some cases we found really pleasant. Towards the final stage, perhaps the developer abused the thing a little (a particular section in our opinion is drawn out too long), but it is clear that the idea adds variety to the adventure. Normal combat, howeverand, it does not offer particularly atypical cues: Ghost can direct projectiles in 360 degrees and move with a certain agility after acquiring enhanced jumps and aerial shots in the shops scattered around the Nakamura base. In the shops the player can also upgrade both the agent's armor and his weapons, as well as buy support drones, activatable items and powerful secondary weapons. The most interesting element perhaps lies in the possibility of upgrading Ghost in a ~classic~ way (even if you lose all credits when you crack) or of tackling the campaign like a roguelike, with a much faster gain in energy cubes and usable weapons, but the downside of losing everything with each death. More skilled players will certainly appreciate this second option. Robots with a hard core Not that the challenge level of the title without modifiers is actually low, quite the contrary. Ghost 1.0 is a game that doesn't give big discounts to its users, offering a long series of challenging shootings, timed alarms of increasing difficulty, traps that kill the protagonist on the spot and bosses to be faced cleverly in order not to be defeated. The originality of the bosses, for example, has positively impressed us in some cases, despite their rather small number. However, certain poorly calculated difficulty peaks cannot be exalted in the same way: especially towards the end, even if concrete time has been spent enhancing Ghost, it can happen to encounter really brutal alarms or rather irritating phases. Nothing insurmountable, but the gradual escalation of battles and situations could be handled a little better. Even some game design solutions aren't exactly the best, and while on the one hand we really appreciated the fixed save points with attached teleportation, it's also true that in some areas they're annoyingly rare. Then the presence of ~souls~ to be recovered in the rooms once certain actions have been completed, in order to obtain extra objects, is a nice gimmick only at the beginning, which quickly becomes tedious when you have to flutter around in ghostly form just to take an active repair plus or an object magnet. Finally, we noticed some repeated areas with armored enemies that were probably initially built around some side quest, but then remained without purpose, demonstrating that perhaps the good Francisco has developed this game a little more in a hurry than the his previous creation. However, these are trifles when you evaluate the overall quality of the other aspects, and especially when you consider how many people worked on the title.", "date": "2016-07-13", "grade": "8.2"}
