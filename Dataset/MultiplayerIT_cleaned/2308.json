After the discreet conversion of Metal Gear Solid to PC, a Microsoft title arrives on our beloved console, among other things one of the most acclaimed and internationally critically acclaimed video games. Will the famous Age Of Empires 2: Age Of Kings be able to win in a practically virgin market of Rts (Kessen and Ring Of Red aside) or will the average console user snub the video game programmed by Ensemble Studios? The age of kings Although the title is quite well known, it is good to explain the structure of Age Of Empires 2 in detail: you will have to help the various civilizations that you will gradually have to deal with in the long journey of progress, be it the era of Genghis Khan , that Joan of Arc will move its steps, or the era where France will have its say in the military field. First of all, it is very important to keep an eye on the rice available to you: feeding your men is as important as finding food, a fairly simple task at the beginning, just take it from the trees, which can then be used as wood to build houses! Obviously your task certainly does not end here, given that from some house you will have to evolve an entire city, defend it from your enemies (and wars are frequent, even too frequent) as well as administer it with care. It is important to note that at the beginning of any mission you will only have a few men at your disposal, therefore the initiators of your rise to power! In addition to the main game mode, you can choose the tutorial, highly recommended if you are a beginner in the rts genre and to better practice with the game controls; if you are tired of the main game mode and you are still not satisfied (the other game modes do not add much, the one with the randomly generated missions aside), you can always call a Playstation 2 owner friend of yours and challenge each other for hours and hours with campaigns designed for multiplayer mode. In all, up to 4 players can challenge each other, provided you have enough hardware and peripherals. The age of kings Of course, the question every astute reader asks is: isn't the Dual Shock 2 a bit limited when used with a strategy video game? Let's say that those who own a computer (perhaps with the title of Microsoft and Ensemble Studios), will not take long to cry out to the scandal, saying that with a joypad you lose a lot of the practicality of use, inherent in the ~mouse & keyboard~ combination , the same speech that a PC user makes when playing Unreal Tournament and Quake 3 on consoles. Still, after about ten minutes, it's not that difficult to move your units, look at the characteristics of your settlement and so on. The difficulties come when you want to move the view, there the flaws cannot be overcome: the undersigned has lost, on a couple of occasions, almost half a minute just to find his part and position the camera exactly above it, being this last elusive as an eel. However, the programmers did not hesitate to include the possibility of using a USB mouse, thanks to the two ports located on the front side of the Sony console. Obviously the game gains in playability, it being understood that the good implementation of the controls via joypad is reaffirmed after a minimum of learning (apart from the mobile camera, sorry). We don't know if it's also possible to use a keyboard, the documentation attached to the CD-rom (multilingual, including Italian) didn't mention it, but since there was no mention of the possibility of using a USB mouse either (we tried our luck for you! ), it is not possible to confirm it here. Graphics and sound Age Of Empires 2: Age Of Kings is now a rather old title and on Playstation 2 it amply demonstrates it: although the conversion work had to be practically resolved in little more than a formality, the color palette has been slightly resized, the animations have been a defaced miccino, it snaps at times conspicuously (since it loads data continuously) and the low resolution used doesn't help much. The biggest problem, however, in an Rts (which does not necessarily have to have a killer cosmetics to attract), lies in the camera, too ~nervous~ at times to follow, a problem to which are added some annoying slowdowns when there are battles (without forgetting the shortcomings mentioned above during the conversion). Despite this however, it is always nice to see an uncultivated field give way to an urban settlement with an obviously different architectural style from era to era, as well as armor, clothes, flags and so on.ndo. Of course, however, seeing graphics like this on the same console that runs Gran Turismo 3.. Graphics and sound From the point of view of the sound, we have the same music as the original version, pleasant and that go well with the game action; the sound effects are definitely appropriate to what is happening on the screen and the digitized voices as well as being convincing, are present in good numbers. Only note: the quality is decidedly lower than the computer version, not necessarily equipped with SB Live.. Conclusions Age Of Empires 2: Age Of Kings is a product that should be part of the video game collection of only Rts enthusiasts who don't have a personal computer, given that the pc version is in fact much better, as well as cheaper (since it is no longer a new) and equipped with online multiplayer mode. Graphically it is embarrassing for a Playstation 2 (also because it clearly loses the comparison with the release for OS Windows) but it has enormous longevity, in which case you are passionate about the game. However, there will be many users who, joypad in hand, will feel frustrated and give up, but, like everything, a little practice never hurts. If you have a USB mouse at hand, know that things improve and a lot, in the same way if you have a friend to play with often in link. Conclusions A niche game therefore, for a few, not perfect and with various gaps here and there, but those who don't have a PC and know how to be patient, will play it for a loooong time! Pros: it ranges from one historical era to another many elements to take into account (wars, territorial resources, food, etc) enormous longevity Cons: bad graphics few will get used to the use of the pad An Rts on Playstation 2? Generally a gamer, when making his choice when he has to buy a gaming machine, weighs some variables: hardware price, security over time that this will be supported, a good choice of different videogame types and the widest possible array of software house, ready to sweat in the snow, just to churn out video games that are as beautiful to see and hear as (above all) to play. In the specific case of Playstation 2, the user knows he is faced with a console where he can find conversions of Sega-branded coin-ops (Crazy Taxy and 18 Wheeler, for example), Namco (Time Crisis 2), he will have no doubts which machine to opt for in terms of football simulations (Pro Evolution Soccer and Fifa), nor for role-playing games and, even less, fighting games but .... in case you are a fan of strategy video games, or rather Rts? The choice would almost certainly fall on a PC, but it is the writer's opinion that few would buy a Personal Computer just for a few video games. So what to do? Well, perhaps the agreement that Microsoft and Konami signed last year to convert their games to each other on the Sony and PC black monolith could be a good idea!", "date": "2001-12-18", "grade": null}
