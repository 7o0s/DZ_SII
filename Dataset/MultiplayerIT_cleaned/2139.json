{"name": "NBA Live 2002", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nba-live-2009.html", "text": "Let's analyze the initial interface As soon as you insert the DVD you will be greeted by the symbols of the main teams participating in the NBA and by the initial movie (we will analyze it in more detail on the next page) which will immediately give you an idea of what kind of graphics will await us in the game. Once you get to the main menu, the language used by default will immediately catch your eye, which will be (and also the only one) English, but obviously this thing will only minimally affect the playability of the title. The first selectable option will be PLAY NOW: choosing this mode you will be immediately catapulted into the game (obviously first you will be asked which team you want to use) and you will be able to immediately test your skills, if instead you choose the second option, i.e. GAME MODES another menu will open in front of you which will show you all five modes you will be able to play. The first of these modalities will constitute the simple and classic championship in which you can decide which group among the 4 available (Pacific, Central, Midwest and Atlantic) to undertake, and certainly this will be the longest competition that you can undertake as it will even reach 82 dating. The second option you can choose will be the Play Offs: here you will compete against the strongest teams until you win the prestigious NBA title. The third mode will probably be the most challenging that only the most experienced will be able to undertake. The remaining 2 modes, on the other hand, will respectively share the place for the 1 vs 1 challenge where two players of your choice will collide and the first to reach 12 baskets wins. and the practical mode useful for seeing your dunks made to the fullest. We create our own Michael Jordan One of the best taken care of in this game is definitely the physical aspect of the players. You just need to see how complete the character creation menu will be to understand what I'm talking about, in fact if you check the game options you will also find access to the create character mode. In this section you will have the possibility to give a name to the player, to choose the team he belongs to (already an improvement compared to the fifa series, in fact here we will not have to replace any old player but we will create our champion from nothing) to decide his age , the college of origin (over 150) ) and how many years he has been in the NBA, all of this however will only be a small part of what we will be able to do. If you put your finger on the right trigger you will see that a new screen will appear in which you can choose the ~clothes~ of your player, here you can make him wear bands on both arms and both legs, you can decide to give him a tattoo and you can opt for long socks or short socks, combined with a pair of shoes of your choice...ah I was forgetting that you can also put glasses on. Pressing the right trigger again you will find yourself in front of another section and another multitude of options, relating to the physical appearance of the player and his build. You will have to decide the type of head, nose, hair and eyes to give to your new champion, in addition to this, however, you will also have the task of deciding on the build, height and weight, but be aware that these last 2 characteristics will affect the 'skill of the player in the game, in fact the higher he is and the more easily he will stop the balls, vice versa if he is too heavy he might not even move and pierce the parquet ^_^ In the last section you will be given the possibility to choose the skills of your player . You can get up to a maximum of 99 points per skill so as to make your player practically unbeatable (but be careful not to get carried away because you risk making the game not very simulative and very arcadey) Once with the ball in hand When you start the game you will be greeted by a surprising intro, which will show the players of each team entering the field in a festive and frenetic way, as is now customary in all EA sports productions. Once with the ball in hand we will immediately notice that the player will have perfect movements and very similar to reality, as he will be able to perform many of the typical moves of this sport, not to mention the sleight of hand that he will be able to perform with extreme ease and fluency. For free throws instead it must be said that the ~scoring~ system was created following tradition, in fact we will have a cross on whichthey will move two balls, we will have to be able to put both balls in the center of the cross so as to make a perfect basket. However, it must be said that the two balls will move faster if the player is poor at free throws and slower if he is a champion in this specialty. The control system will be very simple and immediate, with a key to pass, one to shoot and one to run (obviously plus those for games), also by pressing the white key you can throw the ball to the basket and make it fly from one of your players in such a way as to make them perform a spectacular alley op. In the game there will be opportunities to penetrate the opponent's defense by feinting past the last defender, to then leap in the third half towards the basket and win the necessary 2 points (if they then foul you, you can also score 3 ^_^ ) Arcade or Simulation? The title is purely a simulation in which the fouls will be counted (after 6 you will be forced to change player) and in which all existing rules in this sport will be respected. However, the developers have decided to make available an option called arcade that pays homage to all those who prefer a more gruff and violent style of play, the NBA Jam to be clear. I take advantage of the paragraph to tell you a little about AI (artificial intelligence); this is not particularly high, given that on standard difficulty the opposing players will not have the ability to beat a medium-level human. Sometimes it may happen that the characters controlled by the cpu will make a dense network of passes even when they could simply shoot for a basket without problems (btw they do it anyway^_^). However, it remains to be said that although it does not reach human levels (God forbid) it is able to give the player some good games which, however, will certainly be more exciting if made with people in the flesh. Multiplayer what a passion As I said before, if you play in multiplayer it will be a completely different story, and you will be able to set up real tournaments with your friends. At the beginning of each game you can decide whether the 2P will be your ally or your enemy, in both cases the game acquires a lot of fun as if you play against him you will be able to play a much more fought and exciting match, but if you line him up by your side you can give life to more spectacular and ramified actions (then if he misses the basket and makes us lose the game we'll know how to punish him...). Playing against a friend, the game will be more balanced also in terms of fouls, in fact, like you, he too will often hinder you in an incorrect way so as to force the referee to concede you the foul, which instead often does not happen against the team. cpu playing in a much more correct way. In short, if you have a friend (I hope so...) the game is soooo much more fun than played individually (City Hunter mops it like nothing heheh) In a world of polygons As already mentioned in the previous paragraphs, the graphic aspect has been treated with obsessive attention, to say the least. The thing that immediately catches the eye when seeing the initial intro is the care with which the movements and the anatomy of the players are made. I can assure you that if the video were seen by someone unaware that this is only the intro of a game, for the first few moments they could mistake it for a real video. In addition to the very high number of polygons that make up the players, it is also necessary to analyze the real-time effects that we will find in the game. One of these is due to the brightness of the parquet on which you will play, in fact, in addition to glimpsing the players, you will also be able to see the light of the spotlights reflected on the roof of the stadium which will change position depending on your movements. While you play, your team substitutes will be treated in the same way as yours, in fact they will have the same bright colors and the same perfection in the details, unfortunately this has not been done for the public who, compared to the rest, seem detached and absent (it's in 2D), although it moves and cheers. English is starting to make itself felt The lack of localization, with consequent use of the English language only, begins to be felt especially in the commentary phase of the match. Regardless of the knowledge of English that each of us may have, this is certainly a significant flaw, in fact, despitente you are able to understand a few words (such as ~three point shot~) most of the sentences are lost, until you reach the point where the user is no longer interested in them and stops listening to them. For the rest, the audio compartment moves in the average with the usual choirs of fans and American background music that will accompany you during the challenges. Even the noises of the players and the ball are made very well, in fact it will be very common to hear the noise of the shoes on the palquet and the noise caused by the ball bouncing. Everyone in the locker room Once again EA has succeeded in the arduous task of making some small changes in a game structure that has never known substantial changes for five years. Definitely a must-buy for stars and stripes basketball fans, for everyone else the advice is to save these 60 euros in view of the avalanche of titles that will invade the Xbox market this month. Pros: Breathtaking graphics. Perfect animations. High realism. Official licenses. Cons: Poor longevity A story that continues Back in 1996, a basketball simulation destined to become one of the most famous and sold in the world made its debut for the first time, obviously I'm talking about NBA Live by EA Sports. I still remember the first PC version, obtained after various pleas and threats from the Miramonti brothers (our Mark and City), and having this 2002 incarnation at hand, I can't help but praise this team for their perseverance and continuous attempt to improve ( not always successful) which is the basis of these productions. Even NBA Live 2002 does not betray this tradition and offers the player a series of improved animations, a great variety of dunks, and breathtaking graphics typical of titles of this genre, which however are highlighted more by the performance of the Microsoft console. But now let's analyze more carefully the characteristics of this game that will surely appeal to both those who love pure simulation and those who prefer a more arcade style of play...", "date": "2002-05-05", "grade": null}
