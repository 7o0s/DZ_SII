{"name": "Wii Scacchi - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wii-scacchi-recensione.html", "text": "There are cases where the game reviewer is in great embarrassment. It may happen that you are faced with a game so full of ideas and things to do, not necessarily well done, that in its description you don't even know where to start. And vice versa it can happen to find yourself faced with a game so essential, so devoid of characteristics that go beyond the simple basic structure, that you don't even know how to occupy the minimum number of characters that good journalism requires. Wii Chess fully falls into this second category, indeed it is perhaps one of its most sensational standard-bearers, with the result that despite a very worthy engine one cannot but be disappointed by the new Touch title! Generation, which by the way is also exclusive to Europe Loop Express At this point we could tell you about the history of the game of chess, its rules, how the chessboard is made, the movement of the individual pieces, the objectives, just to lengthen the story, but we won't do it so that it is even more evident that , once Wii Sacchi has started (and after the very brief installation of a Wii firmware update that no one knows what it does), you will be faced with the only possibilities of creating a profile, playing against the computer by choosing from ten levels of difficulty, play offline and online multiplayer (choosing to look for an opponent of the same level, of any level or relying on the usual Friends List), choose between various piece and board designs and analyze, with statistics and replays, the games already played. There are no tournaments or variations of any kind, there is no tutorial (quite a serious shortcoming for a simulation of such a complex game), there are no virtual personalities  la Chessmaster, there isn't even one, and here we really border on the ridiculous, the control of the pieces via cursor, the addition of which would have required yes and no two minutes of programming Wii Chess is controlled digitally via d-pad and buttons, which is absolutely inexplicable Loop Express Wii Chess is controlled digitally via the directional cross and buttons, something absolutely inexplicable given that the Wii has based its raison d'tre and its commercial success precisely on the new control possibilities offered by the Wiimote, and offers only straight games. In practice, the differences with a set of real pieces and chessboard are just that here you will always find, thanks to the AI, opponents to compare yourself with. Artificial Intelligence is controlled by the Loop Express, a scaled-down version of Loop, a little-known and relatively new commercial chess engine for Windows, but precisely for this reason it is constantly evolving, and which is beginning to score its first international awards. Loop Express is, as we said, a sweetened revision, and this is well noticeable at the first difficulty levels where the computer easily falls victim to gross errors and often lacks initiative; at higher levels, however, the challenge becomes of a certain level and can cause various problems even for the most seasoned players. We are not at the level of Chessmaster, the paradigm of commercial chess simulations, but at least from this point of view Wii Chess knows how to defend itself well. The unbearable lightness of non-being For the rest, however, we are near-disaster. We have already talked about the shortcomings, some of which are really too obvious and glaring, but the shame continues considering that even what little there is, apart from the actual game, does not offer who knows what quality standards. Graphically, the game is understandably minimalist and very little researched from the point of view of design; the same thing goes for the sound, with music and effects that are there just because they have to be there, but that's not what bothers you in a game of chess. Annoying, however, is the fact that even where one could indulge more, or in the presence of various designs for pieces and chessboard to be unlocked by winning games, and ranging from post-modern to conceptual, from vintage to ~realistic~ , all of which is rendered quite useless by the fact that the chessboard takes up little more than the meta screen, the rest of the screen presents the data of the two players, and a perhaps beautiful and convincing design comes out very resized, it is simply not noticeable. The unforgivable thing is that for all this we are asked for the beauty of 30 Euros The unbearable lightness of non-being Wii Chess, then, has the online. But in addition to the fact that here too there is nothing beyond the straight match, and the usual problems deriving from the inconvenience of the Friends List, we would be lying if we said that the search for opponents is fast and functional. Very Frprobably everything derives from the scarcity of owners of the game and from the fact that its release was limited to the European market (But why then? Mah), but the fact is that nine times out of ten the search for an opponent, our own level and not, ended, after several minutes, in a nice ~error code~. At least, when we were able to play online, there was no sign of lag; in such a poor game, it really seems the minimum Do you want, finally, the icing on the cake? Wii Chess does not support the 60 Hz mode. If we do the math correctly, it has been exactly six years since we have seen a Nintendo game that must necessarily be displayed at 50. Wii Chess, let's be clear, isn't bad: the choice of engine is good, the game is well simulated and a victory gives the right satisfaction. Wii Chess is simply one of the poorest games ever seen. Around the Net there are many chess simulations, some even free, which have little or nothing to envy to this game, and which are also much more widespread and therefore easier to play online, and with much more immediate mouse controls. The unforgivable thing is that for all this we are asked for the beauty of 30 Euros: if it had been included in the Wii package as Wii Sports, or perhaps distributed through the future WiiWare for 5 Euros, nobody would have found anything to complain about, but as it is is marketed Wii Chess is a good joke. Are these the exclusives that Europe deserves? Pros Simulation is limited but solid Um Different designs? Online? Cons Digital controls Simply not worth the asking price", "date": "2008-02-08", "grade": null}
