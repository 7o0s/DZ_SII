Yet Captain Scarlett and her Pirate's Booty, this is his name, is already available to all Crypt Hunters obviously on Xbox 360, PS3 and PC. Damned pirates! Captain Scarlett and her Pirate's Booty is content that adapts quite well to the level of one's character, although it is already accessible starting from the fifteenth through the rapid transport stations; the setting is centered between Oasis and its surroundings, and is characterized by a pirate flavor despite the fact that there is (almost) not a drop of water but (almost) only sand and rocks. In reality it takes very little to go from a desolate and arid desert populated by giant worms to a lush cavern full of waterfalls and ponds until finally arriving inside a refinery full of aggressive robots; a variety that is very good for this expansion, and keeps it enjoyable for the 6-8 hours required to complete it. The Scarlett that gives the DLC its name is the captain of a galleon in search of a wonderful treasure, and is obviously also the one who will provide the player with most of the main missions; it is a rather successful character, interesting and in full Borderlands ~style~, therefore absolutely spot on. The same cannot be said of most of the other bizarre personalities that populate the areas around Oasis, almost never incisive or underdeveloped, except for the hilarious Hermit. Despite this note, there is actually very little to criticize in Captain Scarlett and her Pirate's Booty; provided you don't expect big surprises or news, the content produced by Gearbox succeeds in offering a few more hours of gameplay while maintaining a quality level that is absolutely comparable to that of the basic package. And let's be clear, the US team has certainly not thought of aiming for recycling; on the contrary, for example, the only means of transport that can be used in the DLC is new, being a kind of agile hovercraft and very fun to drive. Not surprisingly, among the numerous missions that make up the adventure in the Oasis area, there is also one that makes it the protagonist of a sort of speed race, between ramps and jumps. Apart from this parenthesis, the rest of the tasks to be collected are based on the typical development methods of Borderlands, often and willingly with requests to collect objects or kill characters; nothing particularly innovative as we said previously, but the rhythm is always more than sufficient and the density of the sections avoids the presence of dead times or too long walks. The judgment on the enemies present is also positive: in some cases they are only ~reskinned~ versions of others already encountered for Pandora, but there are equally more original solutions. And being chased by the Cursed Pirates, who recover energy by taking it away from the player with each shot, or thrown into the air by the chains of the Presenters is really no fun. Finally, it goes without saying that, of course, the final mission of Captain Scarlett and her Pirate's Booty is focused on a challenging fight (although not really that much) resulting in a large loot prize. Ultimately, Captain Scarlett and her Pirate's Booty offers Borderlands 2 players an expansion that satisfies without taking great risks; new settings, new missions, a new means of transport for a product that fits perfectly within the world created by Gearbox.", "date": "2012-10-23", "grade": null}
