In fact, the EA Sports series puts a slow and reflective action on the plate, which hides numerous strategic implications, together with an excellent physicality of the contrasts and a series of dynamics that are anything but inflated, able to show us completely new ways of finalizing an attack maneuver. For its part, Pro Evolution Soccer 2011 appears more traditionalist, for better or for worse, presenting itself with a respectable technical sector and with a large number of modalities, while showing the side to some uncertainties regarding the interaction between players and ball handling. In many ways, in short, the two titles compensate each other and offer a fundamentally different vision of football. But let's proceed in order. Once the game has started, as already mentioned, the modes available to us are varied: the simple friendly match, the Champions League with its official license, the novelty of the Copa Libertadores, the World Player mode, the Master League, the ~ Become a legend~ and the consequent ~Myths~ to play matches and tournaments using ~mythical~ teams and players, the Championship, the customizable Cup and the Training session. Unfortunately there is no online multiplayer (it is only possible to challenge a friend locally), an inexplicable serious gap that unites PES and FIFA in their latest incarnations on the PSP. Sin! The teams take to the field... Once on the pitch, the differences compared to Pro Evolution Soccer 2010 are immediately felt: the rush of players appears fast but not ~ethereal~ like last year, the pace of play is very slightly slower (but still much faster than FIFA 11) and the difficulty generally seems to have increased: even at the intermediate difficulty level, imposing yourself on the strongest teams is not a simple undertaking. The developers have evidently vetoed the most abused maneuvers, and in fact the various filter passes are punctually intercepted even by the most modest defenses, but unlike the EA Sports franchise, no real alternatives have been offered. And so the fight for victory is resolved mostly on the episodes, on the dribbling that miraculously succeeds (it is appropriate to say it, given the unreliability of the PSP analog stick, especially at these speeds) and sends us to the net, on the inspiration from the champions who manage to cover the whole half field from the sideline, penetrate the small area and bag in the corner, on the header from the corner which for once we manage to make because the defender forgot the marking. As usual, the fine tuning of formation, individual positions and strategy contributes substantially to our success and the number of shots on goal. One wonders why each team's default settings don't ~work~, but in the end it's nice that victory comes when we really take charge of our technical responsibilities. From this point of view, it is nice to find the excellent management of fatigue and physical condition, a factor that has always been lacking in FIFA and which constitutes a very important element of the gameplay, forcing us to apply the turnover especially if we are leading a team of low end. Contrast action In the face of a series of important advantages, albeit inherited from previous editions of PES, unfortunately we must point out some limitations that are far from negligible. In the first place the management of the tackles and, in general, the sensation of physicality of the players. From this point of view, we observe an evident supremacy by the defenders, who always win over the ball carrier and trigger odious situations in which our player finds himself dazed and wanders for a couple of meters without being able to make him react . The tackle is much less effective than in the past, but the difference is especially noticeable compared to the ~major~ versions of the game, where the same maneuver gives far more convincing sensations. There are still some problems in the automatic change of players (as well as in the manual one...), in the sense that sometimes we are not assigned the one closest to the action, and the resourcefulness of our teammates appears at least questionable, with insertions often made in delayed (or not carried out at all) despite our strategic indications. The physics of the ball, a distinctive element of the Konami series, is much less convincing than usual, especially from eleven meters: the usual sensation of impact is missing, the first shots often leave us disappointed and in general the conclusions on the net give little satisfaction. FromFrom a technical point of view, the comparison with FIFA 11 for PSP is merciless: the polygonal models of PES2011 are better, their resemblance to their real counterparts is indisputable and it's not limited to the most famous players. The audio commentary is also better, with the usual Pardo / Altafini couple who recycle phrase after phrase but is in any case more pleasant than the now unlistenable Caressa / Bergomi duo. Of course, both franchises from this point of view need a strong renewal. Finally, PES surpasses FIFA also from the point of view of the graphical interface, in particular as regards team management, which is much more readable and immediate.", "date": "2010-11-12", "grade": "8.0"}
