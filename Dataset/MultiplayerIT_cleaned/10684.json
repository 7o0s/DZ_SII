{"name": "Tora! Tora! Tora!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/battlestations-pacific-tora-tora-tora.html", "text": "Version tested: Xbox 360Battlestations: Pacific is a naval battle game halfway between an action and a real-time strategy game: the main campaign, divided into two parts, makes us relive the events of the Second World War from the view of Americans and Japanese. Across 28 missions (14 per side), we battle through dramatic events ranging from the attack on Pearl Harbor to Midway, as far as the Nipponese point of view is concerned, and from Midway to the conquest of Okinawa from the eyes of Yankee ships. December 7, 1941 Battlestation: Pacific is produced by Eidos and developed by the team stationed in Hungary, already authors of the first chapter. Compared to the latter, decisive steps forward have been made both from a purely aesthetic point of view and on the gameplay side, with numerous improvements and innovations. Pacific represents, for those who have appreciated Midway, a powerful ~more of the same~: a better, more refined, calibrated, varied and heterogeneous game. Numerous models of warships, submarines and fighter planes have been added such as the experimental Kikka and Shinden, or the Kamikaze Kaiten and Ohka. The campaign, very long and difficult, crosses almost five years of wars in the seas of the Pacific Ocean, retracing numerous real events with great detail and historical accuracy. Thanks to the game, the latter will be able to have a development and an ending different from the one we all know well. We can command many types of war vehicles: planes, ships, submarines, bases, with the possibility of managing our army, calling for reinforcements, changing attack positions in real time. The strategic elements of Battlestation are many, and must be assimilated well in order to achieve victory in advanced missions. Battlestation: Pacific, however, is also a game that deliberately pushes the pedal of spectacularity and action, with cinematic-style cut-scenes and good use of game visuals. The internal one of fighter planes has been introduced, through which we can fight by looking at the ~cockpit~. The first-person view of missiles and torpedoes is also very spectacular, which can be activated by holding down the fire trigger. The commands are many and vary according to the use of planes, ships, submarines: before starting, it is strongly recommended to read the instruction booklet in order to master your own fleet in the slightest. Xbox 360 goals Battlestation: Pacific is giving away the usual 1000 points to unlock, through 50 objectives. About half of these will come out automatically by progressing with the various missions and carrying out particular maneuvers (sinking an enemy ship in a given time, for example), while the others are destined for online play and the experience to be had in multiplayer games. It is not a game that from this point of view offers particular joys, but the points will be earned one by one. Kamikazes flew on the horizon The game takes place on two alternating and closely related floors. The first is that of naked action, through which we directly command the means of the US Navy and the Japanese Empire. The controls resemble those of many fighting games such as Blazing Angel, Ace Combat or Hawx. The difference, however, is that on the edge of the screen there are menus and icons which imply the possibility of being able to interact with the entire fleet and issue particular commands. First of all, it is possible to repair the damage suffered, which has a variable severity based on the areas affected. Then it is also possible to set the level of aggression or defense of the allies, or to order attacks and retreats. The commands are really many, and often not at all intuitive and simple to impart. By pressing the back key you access the strategic part: through a vast game map you can select the vehicles and give them a destination, just like you would in any RTS. Also in this case the methods of managing ships and movements are not exactly well explained and intuitive, on the contrary, they are often arbitrary and confusing. Even the artificial intelligence of the enemy is not well calibrated, and although for most of the missions the learning curve is gradual and soft, one can come across some that are really difficult and almost impossible to overcome, due (often) to badly balanced elements. For example, in a bombing level it is almost impossible to even get close to the target due to the all too effective flak, which systematically shoots us down even before we have a chance to release the missiles. And in these cases the skill of the player has very little to do with it. Luckily there is Live! It's ownor the case to say it: Microsoft's online service is able to enhance, elevate and give new life to almost all games that exploit its potential properly. Battlestation: Pacific offers Xbox 360 players five online modes, among which certainly stands out ~Conquer the island~, a sort of ~capture the flag~ adapted to the case. Two teams of four players are formed and you must try to destroy the opposing base, while preserving your own. In this case, the group strategy is satisfying and really fun, even if the problem of the imbalance of forces is always lurking: whoever has unlocked the most powerful ships has more chances of victory. Playing with random users, it is impossible to know in advance which team we will end up in: one favored by the Iowa war cruisers or in the weak Japanese destroyers? Playing with your friends is the best solution, and the range of possibilities is wide. In addition to improving the variety, the developers have also evolved the 3D graphics engine, now capable of showing detailed polygonal models, more convincing water, equipped with transparencies, effects and physics, as well as decidedly vast and well-choreographed landscapes. The general look of the game is ok, even if it doesn't reach impossible heights and of absolute excellence. Setting a game in the middle of the sea obviously doesn't give many possibilities to set up a polygonal scene to make your jaw drop to the ground, but in any case you can appreciate the variety of settings, the light effects and the level of detail of the elements on the screen (on the ships you can see the military intent on carrying out maneuvering operations, for example). The sound sector is excellent and includes a vast sampling of well-digitized effects. However, a more incisive and extensive set of accompanying music would have been welcome, as well as a more convincing and charismatic dubbing, given that it is still a war game and not a cartoon. Battlestation: Pacific is ultimately a good game, but certainly not suitable for the palate of all gamers.", "date": "2009-06-19", "grade": "7.2"}
