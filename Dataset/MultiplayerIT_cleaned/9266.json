You can consult it by following this link. It took us some time, it's true, but the need to finish the game entirely and to experience at least a couple of alternative paths in the continuation of the main plot was too strong and the strange decision of the developer and publisher not to allow specialized journalists to test the game in advance, has certainly not helped. The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings thus arrives on the market more than three years after its predecessor with a huge load on its shoulders: being able to at least match the success achieved by an RPG born practically from nothing, developed by a software house unknown Eastern and based on equally unknown novels by a Polish author. In short, the hype for this sequel has never died down but, we can tell you with absolute tranquility, the return of the witcher will only satisfy your every need. Court amnesia and intrigue The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings perfectly follows the story told in the first chapter of the series by taking advantage of a small time gap of just six months. Geralt, the protagonist, is no longer human raised with magic and mutations whose original goal is to hunt and kill abominations and monstrosities, also thwarting any curses. All in the pay of regents and wealthy families who request it. He is a witcher, Italianized with the word strigo, extremely competent in the use of swords, strong and resistant to wounds and with a particular ability to handle a particular form of magic, the signs, which populate the imagination of a fantasy world from particularly dark look. Dwarves and elves are ghettoized, kept away from city and court life by humans while wizards are barely tolerated within an ecosystem held up by weak balances and ruthless power games where a huge empire manages with the iron fist the known southern lands and five different kingdoms compete for the management and domination of the northern part of the world. The sequel therefore opens with a particular tutorial which, through brief flashbacks, on the one hand makes us familiar with the gameplay and on the other tells us what happened to Geralt immediately after he foiled the attempted assassination of King which ended the first episode. The protagonist is still in the grip of an amnesia that seems to leave him only small remnants of lucidity towards his past, and is intimately linked with the beautiful sorceress Triss, adviser to the King. Of course, at the end of the prologue, the events can only precipitate in a whirlwind of ruthless events and the three acts that make up the game will be essential, together with a very brief epilogue, to understand what upsets the world of Temeria. But we tell you right away that the abundant thirty hours of gameplay necessary to complete The Witcher 2 for the first time will not be enough to answer all the questions regarding Geralt and his gang given that a third chapter in the series appears absolutely inevitable once the adventure. The plot, as in the predecessor, remains extremely adult in tone, language and scenes represented (there are numerous and daring sexual encounters as per tradition) with the indisputable plus of putting the player in front of numerous behavioral and moral choices where there is no never a clear division between acting for good or for evil, but rather on the basis of one's mood and the empathy that is created with the various supporting actors that Geralt will meet along his way. In fact, the game will start in four different ways (depending on whether you choose to import a save from the first The Witcher or start a game from scratch) but it can end in sixteen different ways, offering on many occasions not simple plot crossroads with different quests , but even areas that can be explored differently and completely different situations in terms of activities to be carried out. Therefore, if longevity could leave all those who expected a sequel at least as long as its predecessor doubtful, we can guarantee you that you will not disdain to start the adventure at least a second and even a third time to admire a different point of view of the narrative canvas . For many but perhaps not for all A peculiarity of The Witcher 2 that has certainly left us amazed is the enormous narrative link of the sequel with its predecessor and more generally with the universe outlined in the writings of Andrzej Sapkowski. Unlike an atypical habit of this generation in fact, having played the first chapter represents a great added value to identify with the story told and, at least on a couple of occasions, it becomes essential to really fully understand what is happening in Temeria and why the various characters they behave in certain ways when grappling with certain events. This, we want to point out, could initially displace the player who approaches the series for the first time starting from this second title; this factor, combined with a plot that only begins to take off after eight, ten hours of play, risks making the approach to the adventure tiring. But grit your teeth because we guarantee that your effort will be well rewarded. At the same time we seemed to notice a strange acceleration towards the end of the story and the third act is strongly scaled down compared to the other two, sometimes even disconnected and excessively approximate. It almost seems that the developer suddenly found himself short of breath and with the need to leave a narrative arc open to stimulate players to eagerly await the third episode but probably greater coherence in the story would have been good for the entire narrative system . The title is also strong in a huge number of dialogues, all strictly multiple choice and where it is always clear which answer will keep the adventure going and which ones instead serve as insights for the lore-hungry player. There are some timed responses especially in situations of greater ~anxiety~ and a handful of additional options represented by the use of persuasion, force or deception that will allow you to resolve some more complex situations sometimes leading to the completion of some quests while avoiding fights or conversely by quickly killing an opponent. If everything changes, nothing changes But that's not quite the case with The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings. So let's start with the main new element of this chapter: the combat system. In the prequel Geralt was controlled by the combination of mouse and keyboard: in particular sword strokes were managed through the rhythmic pressure of the mouse keys in a rather artificial and certainly not very involving combo crescendo. The choice made by CDProjekt in the sequel is decidedly more drastic with a much more frenetic system and with obvious action connotations which, we say, running the risk of attracting numerous incredulous glances, make the use of the Xbox 360 pad practically mandatory. In fact, the action is managed through two different types of stroke, the classic slow but powerful and the fast but weak one, a button to perform the somersault which also acts as a dodge, another for the parry, a button to launch the selected sign and yet another for the use of thrown weapons and traps. All this is joined by another command that leads to the appearance of a particular radial menu that allows the player to select the predefined sign and ranged weapon, to unsheathe one of the two white weapons or to access meditation. All strictly in real time with only a slow motion effect to allow for a slightly more reasoned selection but miles away from the typical tactics of a real tactical break. We strongly recommend the use of a pad not so much because the game may be less intuitive through the combination of mouse and keyboard, but precisely because the type of action, the frenzy inherent in the constant dodging and hitting by alternating speed and power, reacts better to pressing the keys of a controller. Indeed that strange lack of feedback, the evident approximation in the management of collisions and a certain heaviness in the animations which in some situations cannot be interrupted which had already left us doubtful in the preview phase, seem to attenuate a lot when the control is carried out through the joypad. What has been said for the plot just above, seems to also apply to the fights: the first hours of the game are the worst, almost the most frustrating and we advise you not to go beyond the medium difficulty level (the second of the four selectable ones), under penalty of constant death as soon as the number of enemies faced simultaneously exceeds three units. In fact, The Witcher 2 does not forgive: it is no longer possible to drink potions during combat and the regeneration of life points is extremely slow. As if that weren't enough, initially we find ourselves without talents and special combat skills and equipment reduced to a minimum. The result is therefore inevitable, no more mistakesplow the road as you enter the forest surrounding Flotsam, the first real city encountered, which in an instant becomes food for the plants. This rather aggressive challenge rate then tends to dampen going forward and by enhancing Geralt, and fortunately it is always possible to vary the level of difficulty so as to never make them a walk. Perhaps also thanks to this apparent defect (we are no longer used to dying so easily), the title gains a lot of bite and often manages to keep the player in suspense thanks to both an automatic and manual save system which however cannot be used during a fight. Where, on the other hand, the gameplay clashes loudly is in the clashes with the larger monsters, fortunately a minority within the gaming experience and managed in part with boring and obvious quick time events. The same also applies to the fistfights in which we will sometimes find ourselves involved (they are one of the three mini-games included in the title, together with arm wrestling and dice, all frankly forgettable) and which will be resolved by pressing the indicated key at the right time. Frankly redundant and completely unrelated to the rest of the gameplay. How much role is there in this game? It is essential to spend several lines also in the degree of personalization of the protagonist of the adventure, or in the freedom offered to the player in playing a role. The Witcher 2 presents itself, especially if you haven't played the first chapter, as a rather atypical RPG. The protagonist, Geralt, is set in stone: his physical appearance cannot be customized and there is no real class system. The witcher is in fact a rather classic warrior capable of using two white weapons, in particular two two-handed broadswords (even if theoretically it is possible to wield axes, hammers and maces, which is never recommended due to the low power of these weapons), not competent in the use of the shield and with the ability to cast five different spells. As a result of this, the choice and management of equipment are rather limited even if they are very versatile thanks to a system of runes and upgrade slots for swords and armor and a rather deep and extensive crafting system. Through the recipes and creation schemes it will in fact be possible to forge your own weapons, sew pieces of armor or obviously indulge yourself with potions, bombs and traps, the real flagship of the series, essential to get the better of when the fights start to get complicated. Returning instead to the management of the character, we find a system of talents divided into four branches: one rather short and generic and the other three focused on combat with white weapons, on the use of magic and on enhancing Geralt's alchemy skills. Each of these talents can be upgraded twice by spending the points you earn as you level up (there doesn't seem to be a cap and in our gaming experience we've reached level 33), in some cases they can be ~muted~ by applying genes Collected from slain enemies to gain access to more power-ups. Furthermore, by reaching the higher-end specializations, the road to adrenaline management opens. The latter is represented by a bar that is filled using the skills in which you are specialized and, once full, it can be discharged by starting special moves that usually kill instantly all the enemies surrounding Geralt. While in our opinion the system does not compensate for the lack of real class specializations, it works very well and guarantees great flexibility to the player who will find himself quite free to customize the witcher according to the fighting style that best suits him. We conclude the discussion by talking about magic, or signs. These are five, available from the start of the game and upgradeable through the dedicated talent branch. They can be used during combat by spending vigor, which is also consumed by parrying and is subject to rather long recharge times. Going into detail we find two offensive spells that incinerate or throw the enemy to the ground, a protective barrier that protects Geralt from a couple of enemy blows, a trap that can be left on the ground to paralyze the enemy who steps on it and finally a sign of deception which bewitches an opponent and makes him fight temporarily alongside us. It goes without saying that their use is absolutely crucial for the witcher's survival in combat and, together with bombs and mechanical traps, they represent the tactical component of this role-playing game.
