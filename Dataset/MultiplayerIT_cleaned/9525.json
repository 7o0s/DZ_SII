The sequel, just released in theaters, sees former protagonist Jeff Bridges projected back into the digital world of his own creation, and his son on a difficult rescue mission to recover it. TRON: Evolution - Battle Grids for Nintendo Wii, however, presents itself as a tie-in only in part: while representing the world seen in the film and some of its characters, it does not follow the events to the letter and indeed offers us a sort of spin-off in which we play the role of a ~digital athlete~, who together with his team competes in the sports disciplines of the virtual world. A sort of ~Olympic Games~ taken very seriously by the programs, and in which Tron excelled, having broken every possible record. After his retirement, however, the population is looking for a new, great champion to glorify: will it be us? Digital races... The game has three different modes: ~network games~, in which it is possible to freely try out any of the sports present; ~championship~, which allows us to compete in an entire tournament made up of several events; ~history~, to follow the events of our character in his climb towards excellence. Before doing anything, however, we're asked to create an alter ego using a simple editor. We will be able to modify its physical appearance, equip it with a more or less flashy suit and accessories that have a purely aesthetic value. At that point we will be linked to our avatar, who will receive a certain number of bits for each game played, with the possibility of leveling up more or less quickly, depending on the successes obtained, and at the same time unlocking new objects and vehicles. There are seven sports in the game: ~energy discs~, ~chariot challenge~, ~motorcycle race~, ~speed race~, ~hypersphere~, ~holo-car arena~ and ~motor maze~. ~. ~Disks of energy~ sees the four participants in the game compete in a scenario that develops ~surprisingly~ vertically, thus making ~aim~ more difficult. Our goal is in fact to hit the opponents with energy discs until their health bar is completely emptied. At the end of the allotted time, the player with the most points wins. ~Challenge between tanks~ is a sort of top-down shooter in which we find ourselves aboard a tank and we can fire at enemies using the conventional cannon as well as a sort of bomb that falls from above. The arenas are full of walls and obstacles, so to hit the enemy it is essential to take the measures well and resort to the energy shield as soon as we expose ourselves too much to fire. ...or virtual sports? ~Motorcycle race~ and ~motor labyrinth~ are two sides of the same coin. Riding the most representative vehicles of TRON, the famous luminous motorcycles capable of making right-angle curves, in the first mode we will have to challenge our opponents in a speed race dominated by the presence of power-ups and traps along the way. In the ~motor labyrinth~ mode, however, the action takes place inside arenas and our goal is to exploit the energy trail released by the vehicle to make you impact the other competitors. Too bad that the control system, entrusted only to the Wii-mote, makes the experience very close to a nightmare. Similarly, ~speed race~ and ~holo-car arena~ see us boarding virtual cars that can attack each other via a machine gun and must challenge each other along a course or closed in an arena. In this case the controls, although not very precise, are less difficult given the greater degree of maneuverability of the vehicle. Finally, ~Hypersphere~ is the sport par excellence in the TRON universe: a sort of squash in which you have to throw a ball of energy against the ~ceiling~ so that it bounces towards the platform on which our opponent is standing. The aim is to destroy this platform, however the performance is once again mediocre due to controls that to define as inaccurate and cumbersome is an understatement. The exploitation of the Wii-mote is, in general, the most deficient part of the product: the developers have tried in every way to transform the experience into a party game for four players who used as many controllers, however further sacrificing an already itself bordering on simplistic. And things don't improve thanks to the technical sector: the cartoon graphicssca has its own reason, as usual, but it is really too poor and bare in the scenarios, while the discreet Italian dubbing does not correspond to noteworthy music.", "date": "2011-01-14", "grade": "4.5"}
