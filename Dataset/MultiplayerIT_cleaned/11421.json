{"name": "Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pinball-hall-of-fame-the-williams-collection-recensione.html", "text": "Like any successful video game series, Pinball Hall of Fame comes out with a second episode dedicated, this time, to Williams pinball machines, covering a time span that goes from 1970 to 1990. Like Gottlieb, we are faced with one of the companies protagonist of the diffusion of pinball machines worldwide: founded in 1943, Williams began to ride the pinball boom in 1967, with Shangri-La and Apollo. In the following years she was responsible for creating a large number of other tables, until in 1988 she acquired, among other things, the gaming division of Midway. However, pinball machines remained the main passion of the company, which continued to produce successful tables until the late 1990s. Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection is based on an identical structure to that used for The Gottlieb Collection, with a virtual arcade to explore its two floors, up and down, to access the various pinball machines. It is possible to play in a free mode, participate in the Williams Challenge, organize a tournament or watch interesting slideshows of the various tables. The Williams Challenge consists of a series of challenges that involve obtaining certain scores on a sequence of tables, while the tournament sees us face as many human opponents as we like, alternating with controls. From 1970 to 1980 The oldest device in the lot is Jive Time, produced in 1970. It is a pinball machine whose aesthetics make clear references to the world of music and psychedelia of those years, distinguished by very large spaces and by the presence, therefore, of few elements for the rebound from the ball, present only in the upper part of the table. The paddles are positioned at a certain distance from each other, which often results in an inevitable loss of the ball as it descends vertically. The same thing can happen due to the openings above the paddles themselves, beyond the bouncing surfaces, since the classic lateral ~traps~ too often end up making us lose the sphere. One of the main objectives of the table is to hit a switch placed in the center, in the upper part, which activates a sort of ~fortune wheel~ on the board that allows us to multiply the score. Corgar, made almost ten years later (1979) does not introduce particular innovative elements as regards the arrangement of the elements inside the table, but it is the first talking pinball machine in history, capable of pronouncing as many as eight different sentences. With a huge demon drawn in the center, under which the figures of a man and a woman stand out, the fixture certainly refers to biblical elements. With a completely different ~visual~ theme, Firepower (1980) shows off bright colors on a black background, also in this case with a table poor in elements but with the palettes positioned at a decidedly ~human~ distance, such as to allow the player to avoid losing the ball. Firepower is also the first pinball machine that introduced the game with multiple balls at the same time, which is activated when particular bonuses are obtained. From 1980 to 1984 With Black Knight, from 1980, Williams introduces a series of very important innovations, which will have a sequel on all the devices produced subsequently. Firstly, the table has not two, but four paddles: two at the bottom, in the classic area, two at the top right, in a sort of independent ~small pinball machine~. The whole upper part of the table is raised, and to reach it you have to make the sphere travel on two ramps, also a new element. Finally, the ~targets~ are also present for the first time, i.e. elements that must be hit in succession to unlock bonuses and which return to the table once the impact occurs. Always remaining in the fantasy theme, the Sorcerer pinball machine, from the same year, has three paddles (the third is positioned in the middle of the table, on the left) and a series of ramps. It is a table characterized by very fast ball bounces, which sometimes make it difficult to recover from the most agitated situations. Space Shuttle, from 1984, is the first pinball machine that has to contend with very strong competition in arcades, represented by video games and their boom. A very nice table, inside which there is the reproduction of an entire shuttle, positioned in the upper part of the device: easy to play and very fun, it sometimes allows you to play with multiple balls and is equipped with a good number of ramps . From 1986 to 1990 Released in 1986, Pin*Bot is one of the most popular pinball machines of all time, with a great aestheticvalue as well as innovative elements. In the upper part of the table, in fact, there is a sort of ~treasure chest~ that can be opened by the player through the achievement of certain bonuses, and inside which the balls can be placed. Following the trend inaugurated by Space Shuttle two years earlier, probably in an attempt to attract even a younger audience, this device is very playable and quite simple, with games that last even several minutes. From the space travels of Pin*Bot we move on to the metropolitan reality of Taxi, from 1988, a pinball machine characterized by a large number of voices and sound effects, very playable and fun. The upper part of the table is extremely rich in elements, therefore the sphere often stays in that area for several moments before descending. The trend of ~easy~ pinball machines stopped in 1990 with Whirlwind, a device inspired by vortexes both in terms of its aesthetic appearance and the presence of three rotating discs positioned on the table. There are three paddles available to the player, the problem is that their arrangement is often problematic, in the sense that in cases of vertical fall of the ball it is not possible to recover it in any way. Whirlwind is also equipped with a sort of side menu, which lights up indicating the scores and bonuses achieved. The last table in the lot, also from 1990, is Funhouse: very colourful, it refers graphically to the world of the circus and puppets, so much so that there is a puppet head in the upper area of the apparatus, moreover equipped with some animations. It is an easy and playable pinball machine, equipped with two ball launch zones and three flippers. Technical realization Already with the compilation dedicated to Gottlieb's pinball machines, Crave Entertainment had shown that it could reproduce the devices with absolute fidelity, using polygonal graphics through an engine capable of managing it in the best way. All the pinball machines present in this new Hall of Fame are beautiful to look at, and although results of this kind have already been achieved on even less powerful systems than the Wii, one can only appreciate the commitment made by the developers, who in addition to offering us ten tables perfectly reproduced, they also include a series of extras such as flyers, period advertisements and so on. The sound sector also does a great job in terms of fidelity, creating the typical atmosphere of the arcades of the 80s. Finally, the controls are the same adopted for the previous episode of Pinball Hall of Fame: the Wii-mote / Nunchuck combination allows us to promptly control the paddles and literally ~shake~ the table, if necessary. Comment Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection is a great collection of pinball machines. It is certainly a niche product, but its merits must be recognized: all the tables have been reproduced in great detail, with clean and fluid graphics, with original sound effects and with a control system that lends itself very well to this type of applications. In short, pinball enthusiasts and those nostalgic for the arcades of twenty years ago will find something precious in the new Crave Entertainment title, a fun experience that can make us reflect on the many factors that have also led the video game market to be what it and today. Pros: Ten perfectly reproduced pinball machines Technically well done Good control system Cons: Only for fans of the genre Not all tables are equally fun Modes of game not very appealing", "date": "2008-05-14", "grade": null}
