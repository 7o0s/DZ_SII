{"name": "LEGO Tower", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lego-tower-recensione.html", "text": "About eight years ago, NimbleBit launched Tiny Tower, showing the world an excellent example of organization and integration of micro-transactions, idle mechanics and excellent cosmetics, almost a cross-section of what would have happened in the immediately following years as regards free monetization -to-play and micro-transactions. Although decidedly simple in terms of game mechanics, Tiny Tower was in fact rather ahead of its time, showing how the development team had very clear ideas not only as regards the concepts on which to build their titles but also for the use of the new monetization and content management systems. We don't know why NimbleBit took so long, but in fact the game is being revived these days under the new incarnation of LEGO Tower, which we analyze in this review. It is essentially the same Tiny Tower but entirely rebuilt in the form of a LEGO-based video game, but maintaining the same basic concept and game structure. The gameplay is substantially the same as previously seen, or rather a very basic management system that allows us to build an ever-expanding tower upwards and control all its activities within it, only that in this case everything is inserted within the LEGO world, with consequent characters taken from the famous themed toys, objects and structures. Considering the importance of the Bitizen, or the inhabitants of the tower in the original version of the game, and the amount of customizations that the progenitor already hinted at, it is clear where LEGO Tower is headed. In fact, the management mechanics that already worked quite well are now joined by the passion for LEGO and the collecting spirit that can give further impetus to wanting to unlock new floors, new characters and further customizations. The idea works perfectly, even if the game is practically the same seen in the distant 2011. From Bitizen to LEGO characters LEGO Tower takes place inside a constantly evolving tower: each floor is used for some activity, which can be commercial, service or simply residential and the meaning is to give order to everything in search of a sort of vertical micro-community, in this case with a LEGO theme. New characters continually show up at the elevator and request to be able to go to a specific floor: initially to take advantage of the shops or services arranged on the few floors available at the beginning, but soon new potential tenants or job seekers also show up . With the money earned from the various activities it is then possible to expand the tower with new floors, to be used for the numerous possible activities, which are in continuous expansion. It is necessary to balance the residential floors (which can be built thematically to attract new tenants) with the commercial floors which form the core of the tower's internal economy. There are so many jobs that can be carried out: ranging from shops of all kinds to clubs and restaurants, up to more particular services such as museums, cinemas and various entertainment, each located on a floor of the tower. Going deeper, each individual character has a specific characterization, composed of the aesthetic aspect but also of its own specialization and a dream in the drawer. The ideal would therefore be to find the perfect location for each tenant of the tower, both in terms of housing and the work to be done, but obviously it is not a question of simple management and therefore in many cases it is a matter of finding compromise solutions that they can lead to positive or negative changes in the mood of the various characters. The addition of LEGO features determines further possibilities in terms of customization: each individual character can be radically modified in appearance with the application of new ~pieces~ with which to compose it, which obviously stimulates the collecting spirit and makes LEGO Tower particularly suitable even to the youngest, given the familiar appearance of the characters and elements of the scenario, even with the reference to the product code of the real catalog of LEGO pieces for each single modifiable element. Another addition given by the new LEGO characterization are the secondary missions, often linked to specific vehicles to be unlocked: these work as a sort of treasure hunt, in which we have to find specific objects or characters inside the tower, which can become complicated when the structure reaches considerable dimensions. These missions allow you to collect Bux, which is the in-game currency that can be purchased with real money ma which is limited to speeding up the breaks for the construction times of the floors or can be spent on buying LEGO pieces, but in both cases these are elements that can still be achieved by playing. The money needed to purchase new plans, however, can also be collected by keeping the game in the background through a convenient idle system.", "date": "2019-07-09", "grade": "7.0"}
