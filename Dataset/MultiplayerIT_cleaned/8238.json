The enemies are not the classic soldiers but huge zombies with equally huge machine guns, flying skulls wrapped in flames and Beholders straight out of the nightmare of an indigestioned role player. Absurd demonic monsters sent to destroy us as we try to save humanity from the dark presences that haunt the depths of Mars. The third chapter, while maintaining the imagery and plot, changes its setting, also due to the more expensive technical system compared to Doom I and II which forced the developers to reduce the number of enemies on screen. To maintain the balance idSoftware has increased the level of tension, already present in the first chapters, implementing a rich play of light and shadow, functional to hide enemies, and wrapping everything with a complex sound sector. Even the first Doom managed to touch the right strings with an audio sector that between breaths and moans left the player always at attention. But in Doom 3 mechanisms, hydraulic pumps, doors that close, sighs, jolts, footsteps and screams follow one another in a continuous nightmare of sound, fatally confusing the player's perception. Obviously the breathing of the hidden creatures has been replaced by more advanced scripted scenes and the sudden appearance of monsters has become a recurring and fundamental element to keep the tension constant. Also, while the old hordes are now limited to a few creatures, the responsiveness of monsters makes them dangerous even in groups of four or five. On the other hand, losing health and armor points is not a small occurrence given that in Doom there are neither rechargeable energy nor eternal shields. They come out of the fucking walls The gameplay is the classic one of pure and hard shooters with medikits, treatment stations, armor and keys needed to unlock some doors. Searching in the corners, with the fundamental torch, is important and also allows you to find secrets and diaries that can hide codes to access accessory supplies. Doom 3: BFG Edition introduces some innovations compared to the basic version by cleaning up the graphics, introducing a new lighting system and changing some gameplay details among which we find the checkpoints. Fortunately, the additional checkpoints are not so recurring as to facilitate the experience too much. However, we often find ourselves forced to eliminate several creatures before a boss and death, as in the best representatives of good old hardcore gaming, forces us to repeat the path trying to conserve more energy. On the contrary, the greater number of bullets simplifies things considerably, making plausible that type of gameplay that involves pulling the enemies along by pouring a lead madness in the direction of the path in which we have attracted them. On the other hand, sometimes, the greater availability of lead makes us too confident and plunges us into situations where firepower is not the only important element. Sprinting can help escape in some situations, but Doom 3 mostly takes place in narrow shafts that limit movement. To this must then be added the classic trap rooms which provide for the closing of all the doors and the exit, in grand style, of demonic space beasts probably bloodthirsty and certainly very irritable. In these cases it is advisable to carefully select who to hit first and, at high difficulty levels, it is absolutely not recommended to launch headlong. The extra dose of lead isn't the only element that smooths out the gameplay. An apparently marginal change concerns the flashlight which is now mounted directly on the weapon and no longer forces us to lower the weapon. The modernization of Doom 3, therefore, passes through a recovery of that frenzy of the past which sacrifices, in part, the survival horror soul adopted with the third chapter to renew the series. However, in the world of high-voltage shooters, Doom 3 remains a leading title, capable of collecting the best of the space horror genre between smoking pipes, creatures that emerge from the walls and harrowing diaries left to posterity by those who have already been engulfed by the darkness. The play of light and shadow that hides the enemies from our perception is made with extreme care and in the new edition various situations have been modified or enriched to improve the playful performance. In addition, Doom 3: BFG Edition also includes the first two chapters, the expansion Resurrection of Evil and seven new missions that fill the gaps, in terms of longevity, of the original. Unfortunately not everything is perfect. The graphic engine, fundamental point of idSoftware productions and key elementof shooters, he's eight years old and everyone can hear each other. The graphical cleaning has improved considerably and the lighting system is still extremely effective, but what were once prominent models are now polygonally trivial and end up making the repetitive design of the maps stand out even more. Some shapes and animations, in the more complex creatures, are still appreciable, but the overall result is heavily affected by the washed out textures, shiny faces and glassy eyes. Luckily, the loads are quite fast and, even if the need for visual excellence is not satisfied, the sci-fi structures, the mechanisms and the lighting system are more than enough to sustain the atmosphere full of tension which, among other things, it is even more effective when we are surrounded by darkness. Finally, for fans of stereoscopic 3D, the reissue of the idSoftware shooter includes full support for the most modern three-dimensional technologies, including that Oculus Rift tested in Cologne which, although not yet released, is already on everyone's lips thanks to a outstanding visual performance. Xbox 360 goals Among the novelties of the BFG Edition there are the now inevitable objectives that reward both progress and skill. Most of the achievements are simple to obtain while the progress objectives related to the Nightmare difficulty, which must be unlocked by completing the game and the two expansions to one of the previous difficulties, require a fair investment in terms of time. All roads lead to Hell In Resurrection of Evil the most substantial modification is the now classic magnetic weapon inspired by the Gravity Gun of Half Life 2 and also present in the new expansion The Lost Mission. It is an ultra-tech tool that can capture objects and some types of energy projectiles and allows them to be sent back to the sender. The first boss of the old expansion focuses precisely on this mechanic which, although already seen and castrated by the lack of interaction with the surrounding environment, enriches the gameplay and also guarantees a goal. Conversely, the demonic heart that we find at the beginning of the expansion is not particularly useful. Also capable of slowing down time, the artifact could be an interesting support object, a bit like Dead Space's stasis, but it is fundamental on very few occasions while for the rest of the expansion the bare skill is much more effective. The additional content The Lost Mission introduces seven new missions complete with an intro, unfortunately concise, and Italian dubbing. The number of enemies that suddenly appear at the back is really high and the gameplay is good. That said, the seven new missions, which can be completed in a couple of hours on normal difficulty, don't add anything really new to the overall experience by reproducing the gameplay of the base title in a condensed version. The plot sees us engaged in deactivating a teleportation device that has ended up in the demonic dimension and which could be used by the forces of evil to arrive directly on earth. To solve the crisis it is necessary to cross the sub-levels of Mars City, listen to the ravings of the inevitable desperate scientist and launch back into the infernal realm to defeat the classic boss in waves. The multiplayer in Doom 3: BFG Edition is a mere accessory, devoid of the complexity of modern FPS or the inimitable physics of Quake and with the points rankings as the only point of interest for lovers of competition. Despite this, the weapons make it a relatively satisfying experience even if for a limited period of time. Even those who have never played Doom but have played Rage get an idea of idSoftware's care for weapon feedback. Feedback means the yield of the hit, the fullness of the impact and the satisfaction of the sound. But in Doom, the shooting distance is also calculated with extreme precision. The shotgun rose isn't sketchy but does accurate damage based on range scaling. The full effectiveness, which makes the shotgun the most powerful weapon among those available, can be had only a few centimeters from the enemy and given the short-range speed of the creatures in the idSoftware title, which can often make sudden shots, a continuous footwork that in many situations, given the tight spaces, becomes the gravitational center of the gameplay. Paradoxically, the weapon with the worst performance is the BFG 9000, the iconic destruction tool of the series that gives its name to this new edition. On the other hand, the green globe that destroys everything was already antiquated at the original launch of the title due to the absence of physical interactions and uan aesthetic rendering of the shots unable to enhance the power of the weapon. Controlling Doom 3 via the pad is nice if you're already used to console shooters. Feedback is good and weapons work as they should.", "date": "2012-10-22", "grade": "7.5"}
