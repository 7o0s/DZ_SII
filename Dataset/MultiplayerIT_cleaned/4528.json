But the arrival on the scene of what is one of the most loved role-playing games of all time dates back to the now distant 2011, the year in which titles such as L.A. Noire (also recently revised) and Batman: Arkham City, just to give a dimension to the time that has passed since we first saw the fifth chapter of the Elder Scrolls series. An episode much loved by audiences and critics, and for this reason it returned to being seen at any time the opportunity presented itself: from the inevitable edition with all the additional contents to the equally inevitable remastered version, released a year ago for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. 2017 then offered two more succulent opportunities for Skyrim to be seen again, firstly thanks to the Nintendo Switch version which very little anticipated the one for PlayStation VR. A second return to PlayStation 4 therefore, which anticipated the PC scheduled for 2018 as an exclusive timescale and was eagerly awaited by fans of virtual reality, eager to be able to immerse themselves in the epic story narrated by the Bethesda RPG. With what result? Let's go find out! The Scream of VR What Skyrim is and what its plot tells has been talked about in every sauce, to the point that it seems pointless to go back to it here, stealing space from the real novelty of Skyrim VR: the virtual reality experience. In case you want to know more about the game, in addition to the articles listed above, you can obviously also refer to the review written in 2011, in which the situation in the land of the North of The Elder Scrolls is properly gutted, shaken by a civil war and the return to life of dragons, until then thought to be extinct. It really makes no sense to go further, also because from the point of view of content Skyrim VR remains one hundred percent identical to the one known to date, including the additional extras Dawnguard, Hearthfire and Dragonborn. But it was precisely knowing everything that led us over the last few months to wait for the arrival of Skyrim VR, fantasizing about dragons, settings and powers already explored, but potentially able to take on a completely new dimension with the virtual reality. The first choice to make when starting to play Skyrim VR concerns the control system, compatible with both the double PlayStation Move and the DualShock 4 controller. We tell you right away that in both cases there are strengths and weaknesses, which make it difficult to advise which of the two alternatives to choose: these are too subjective assessments, especially when, as in the case of virtual reality, an extremely variable factor such as motion sickness comes into play. However, this is not the only evaluation parameter, given that with two PlayStation Move used as motion controllers, the doors are opened to what we have always dreamed of playing Skyrim: throwing sword slashes by moving the hand as if we were actually doing it, raising the the other to raise the shield to ward off blows, cast spells using two hands to locate different targets, or finally nock the arrow into the bow before letting go. An experience that, as we said, gives Skyrim VR a completely different flavor, held back however by the well-known limitations of PlayStation Move: especially in the most agitated phases, ending up putting the body between the PlayStation Camera and the controller is a matter of a moment, while the absence of analog levers forces the player to use the teleporter to move around the world of Skyrim, thus losing a piece of that aforementioned involvement. Not that this is automatically a bad thing, especially if the normal fluid movement causes motion sickness: luckily Bethesda provides us with options to control field of view and speed of camera changes, which have now become standard for taking care of more sensitive stomachs. In any case, the important thing is not to rush, avoiding sudden jerks and other types of movements that in reality would make us seem tarantled, but in virtual reality we often persist in wanting to do. As imaginable, the DualShock 4 closely recalls the use made of it in Skyrim, limiting itself to a few modifications to integrate it with the use of PlayStation VR: the final result also allows you to count on a superior aim based on head movement, as well than on better management of the fluid movement thanks to the levers. Playstation 4 trophies Skyrim VR inherits exactly all seventy-six Trophies offered by the adventure already seen in the Special formatEdition. The fifty-one of the base game are therefore joined by the other twenty-five from the three additional packages included in the collection, for a total of one of the platinum type, one gold, twenty silver and fifty-four bronze. To obtain them, you must complete certain primary and secondary quests, or fulfill requests such as absorbing a certain number of dragon souls, buying a specific artifact, starting a family, entering the Academy of Winterhold, and so on. Joy and pain The original Skyrim wasn't without its flaws, and inevitably these are accentuated by the projected eye in Skyrim VR. Close combat, for example, has never been the strong point of Bethesda's RPG, which complicates things further with the visor on the head. The cumbersomeness of hand-to-hand combat can be remedied by lowering the game difficulty, until you find a level that puts you at ease: the chances that you have already done everything in difficult mode in these six years are high, so there is no it's no reason not to kick back and enjoy what Skyrim VR has to offer. In fact, virtual reality puts the player at the center of the majesty of The Elder Scrolls V, giving completely different connotations even to operations that in the past took place almost mechanically: walking among the imposing mountains makes us feel small compared to the vast world created by Bethesda, as well as climbing them makes us really feel that we are on top of it. Experienced in the very first person, even the dungeons appear more claustrophobic and dangerous, right from the first encounter with the spiders after having escaped execution. The spectacular effects of the powers, which until now we were limited to watching on the screen, now completely envelop us, as well as the map of the constellations that appears in the skill menu. Skyrim VR is a game that must be experienced in the true sense of the word, getting involved and surprised by the encounter with a dragon as if it were the first time, thus turning a blind eye to the technological limits imposed by PlayStation VR in terms of graphic downgrade. Being a 2011 game it was difficult to expect anything else, which is why the presence of textures in some cases bordering on sufficient should not be surprising, as well as the accentuation of the pop-up effect already encountered in the past. All this also affects the game dynamics, when you try to hit a target from a distance whose graphic quality quickly degrades. There are also all the bugs we knew, including the possibility of leaving the play area or seeing characters suddenly levitate. Even the audio sector remains practically the same, with some stumbling blocks in the management of spatial audio which with a helmet and headphones is inevitably noticed even by a less attentive ear.", "date": "2017-11-27", "grade": "8.0"}
