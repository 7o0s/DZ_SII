After all, seeing new titles developed by teams already at the peak of the genre year after year is certainly not an abnormality and, although there are less prosperous years when it comes to virtual beatings, the community can practically always count on at least one new entry from a certain level. In the last period, however, together with high-level games such as Guilty Gear Strive and King of Fighters XV, some publishers have seen fit to withdraw rabbits of a certain age out of the hat, in other words proposing games never arrived in the West, or old glories still full of potential. It happened a few days ago with Phantom Breaker Omnia, for example, and now it happens again with the return of a fighting game much loved by anyone who dabbles in the so-called ~anime fighter~: Persona 4 Arena Ultimax. There are two cases: either we are experiencing a strange contingency that has seen some developers wake up in the morning and decide by pure chance to remaster their favorite fighting games, or someone begins to smell the hidden potential for flashbacks of this type, especially in a era of gaming where competitive titles are increasingly populous. Yet, if we consider the two options, we must curiously lean towards randomness, because the strategy followed seems anything but brilliant to us. In fact, where a good part of the main productions have fully embraced that evolution of the netcode (and therefore of the whole online competition) called rollback, these returns have not done it, ignoring the complaints of a community that in many cases sees this implementation as a must for the survival of the game (and it's hard to blame him). With the re-release of Persona 4 Arena Ultimax, however, the voice of the fanbase has been heard at least: the game has already been launched with its classic netcode, but in the summer the developers have promised that the fanbase will finally be able to take advantage of a more modern network experience thanks to rollback. The version we tested of the game, therefore, is not the definitive one. If nothing else, the promise made has given us some optimism for the future (provided that the community holds up until the summer). Even with a temporary netcode, in any case, this work by Arc System remains a very rich title and worthy of a good dusting off. We therefore explain to you what awaits newbies and longtime fans, in our review of Persona 4 Arena Ultimax. Content and news: Lots of modes in the midnight channel Persona 4 Arena: Stop Teddy before he covers you with items Let's start with something very simple but not to be underestimated: this new version of Persona 4 Arena boasts all the contents of both Arenas, a ~new~ mode, and a significant rebalancing work, all at a reduced price that stands around the thirty euros. It is perhaps the bare minimum for many users when it comes to operations of this type, but we must consider that the aforementioned titles were already truly remarkable in this aspect at the time, therefore we are dealing with a fighting game capable of offering a lot even outside of the dear old man online. The narrative is already a distinctive point of the title, because - as with other Persona spin-offs - also in this case we are faced with a very accurate story directly related to that of the JRPGs, complete with dedicated characters with excellent characterization. Of course, the formula is always that of the pseudo visual novel, with lots of text to navigate and static images rarely interspersed with movies; far be it from us to criticize a similar operation in a genre where the plot is often neglected, especially when the quality is this. Persona 4 Arena Ultimax: shadow characters are creepy, but also very dangerous when they have the bar available Even the Arcade Mode is more accurate than the norm and has multiple exchanges between the fighters involved. The package then adds challenges - always very useful for better mastering the various characters - a complete and well-managed tutorial, and a new ~RPG~ mode called Golden Arena, with a progression that recalls that of ~real~ Personas. In practice it is a question of completing battles to obtain experience points and skills, which can then be used to enhance one's character (complete with the choice of a companion based on the desired passive bonuses). It may seem like an exceptional novelty to many, yet it is actually comparable to other similar experiments by Arc System, so much so that it closely resembles the M.O.M. Mode seen in the Guilty Gear series. A pleasant addition, which is unlikely to revolutionize your wayto perceive fighting games. The last gem? The balance of the game is not that of the last console version. In fact, it seems that this edition of Persona Arena maintains the changes to the system made in the Japanese arcades. Thankfully, most of the usual will barely perceive the difference, but anyone who has followed the game a bit should be aware of the big changes in the field, especially related to the shadow characters (which we will discuss in more detail shortly). Overall, Arena remains a fighting game with enviable content and this reissue, while not doing who knows what in terms of novelty, has what it takes to occupy a lot of your free time. Gameplay and netcode: ware wa nanji... nanji wa ware... Persona 4 Arena: Junpei in plastic pose To tell the truth, even with the latest patch available, it's not that the title today is a bright balancing beacon in the panorama... Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is a 100% anime fighter after all, a mass of complex mechanics applied to an extremely frenetic hub, where ~touch of death~ combos (which kill you after a touch) are the order of the day at high levels and with the right resources. Just as they do not spoil a myriad of other titles that follow the same philosophy, however, even in Persona Arena these characteristics fail to break the solid foundations on which everything rests. We are still faced with an extremely flexible system, which contains multiple mechanics already seen in other ~Made in Japan~ fighting games, adding a touch of uniqueness to the whole more than enough to give it a personality. To the classic attacks that are easy to connect in combos, for example, are added attacks linked precisely to the Personas available to the various fighters, who not only can be used in often truly creative ways, but also possess a positioning subsystem that allows - especially with certain characters very dependent on them, like Margaret - to execute combinations from long distance or dominate spaces with cunning and timing. It's even possible to temporarily disable Personas by repeatedly hitting them based on the cards possessed by characters, and the reliance on these or other specific mechanics creates a roster that is diverse and fun to say the least. The variety increases further if the basic warriors are added their shadow versions, which are based on a completely different system, while often retaining practically all the special moves of the original version. In the original Persona Arena, the shadow fighters did not have some of the main defensive maneuvers available (as well as having a malus of life and damage) such as the Burst, however they could use it to activate a ~Shadow Frenzy~ during which it was possible to use a burst Enhanced and Super Special Moves. However, the balancing patch of this reissue is the last one, and now the shadows have been modified to guarantee more or less the same options as normal characters, with a revised frenzy system and greater effectiveness in the absence of a bar. Of course that doesn't mean that some absolutely brutal characters in the original game don't remain today, but if nothing else there are few characters on the roster that are truly disadvantaged compared to others, and the fact that everything is geared towards the top makes it more balanced than it seems. should. The cast of Persona 4 Arena Ultimax There would be a mass of other mechanics to analyze, but we are not dealing with a new fighting game, and we believe that you have already got an idea of what a strange beast Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is anyway. Overall it's not an easy fighting game to master at high levels, because it has very high rhythms, requires a fair amount of precision in executing complex combos, and usually reduces the aids to extra mechanics such as autocombos (however better integrated here than in other games , it should be specified). In any case, it is unlikely that it does not amuse, even if played at random: we sincerely believe that it is still today among the best exponents of its niche. The real problem of this return - obviously outside of the direct port without major graphic upheavals (the pumped resolution is a practical certainty and more could have been done) or content - it is the online experience, which as mentioned at the moment is based on a classic netcode. We managed to play several matches on the net during our test, and calling it all up and down is an understatement. As often happens with netcode delay based fighting games, you can go from very solid games with other Europeans, to disasters with unacceptable latency despite connections taken for granted by the game. Obviously, playing decently against overseas users is out of the question. Let's hope the arrival of the rollback fixes it, even if you have to wait a bit; for now, unfortunately, we don't believe that this netcode can sustain the online community for a long time.", "date": "2022-03-18", "grade": "8.0"}
