Sony platforms have always had a somewhat controversial relationship with games based on the world of Formula One. Both the first titles released for PSX, again by the legendary Psygnosis, and those landed on the monolith by Studio Liverpool (which is a team born from the ashes of the house of the owl) have met with fluctuating success with audiences and critics, mainly due to the annoying tendency to resemble each other, offering little innovation from one year to the next. This new episode is certainly not a revolution from this point of view, however it introduces some new elements for the series, such as support for online, in an attempt (unfortunately not very successful) to vary the game structure a bit. Among the modalities in which we will be able to participate are the canonical single, timed and championship races, with the added novelty of the introduction of a career section, in which you will have to make your way, starting from scratch, from grand prix to grand prix, up to sign up with some competitive team to launch your way to the world title. On closer inspection, this new entry becomes the new heart of the game, being the decidedly more fun and engaging mode, able to capture the player's attention much longer than the others are able to do. The game has been updated with all the innovations introduced in this 2004 season, including (and we would have missed more) the two new circuits of Shanghai and Bahrain and all the new rules. Once the game has started we will have the possibility to choose whether to play in arcade or simulation mode: the latter, despite the name, does not differ much from the first, adding a slightly more realistic behavior of the single-seater, flags and penalties, and a rather controversial damage management. In fact, the car can be damaged only in the event of violent collisions with the elements of the scenario, remaining absolutely intact in the event of collisions with other cars, which are instead the most frequent, influential, and precisely for this reason, the ones to be penalized the most. The control system proposes as an optimal configuration the use of the left analog stick to steer, and the right one (in the absence of triggers) to accelerate and brake, while still allowing the use of even the more canonical buttons. Given the arrangement of the two levers, the grip is not exactly the most comfortable, however it is possible to have a fair amount of control over the single-seater, which however tends to always remain a little too nervous to manage, especially in rapid changes of direction. A new star in the circus? From a technical point of view, this F1 2004 shows some interesting elements, but also evident gaps and lightness. The graphics sector is one of the strengths of the game, boasting a very accurate reproduction of the single-seaters and in general an always satisfactory detail for the tracks, with rather clean textures and ladders reduced to a minimum. The graphics engine manages everything nailed to 60 frames, guaranteeing an exceptional sensation of speed, essential given the racing cars we are dealing with. As far as the sound is concerned, however, the speech is decidedly less positive: although the roar of the engine is well done, as well as all the ambient sounds in general, the technical commentary (historic Achilles' heel of the series) that accompanies our races is absolutely disastrous, repetitive ad nauseum and most often lagging behind or in error with respect to what happens on the screen. Even the interpretation, despite the presence of two icons such as Andrea De Adamich and Claudia Peroni, is not very incisive and realistic, leaving the player no choice but to deactivate it after a handful of laps. Finally, the artificial intelligence of the adversaries, another somewhat critical element of all the F1 made in Sony, certainly does not take giant steps in this new appointment, proving to be not very combative and evolved even at the highest level of difficulty, allowing you to do without too many worries portentous comebacks from the lowest step of the starting grid up to the triumph at the finish line. F1 2004 is a solid product, in all probability the best Formula One title available for consoles, yet it is far from perfect. Either for its excessively arcade structure, or for the limited AI of the opponents, the fact is that the title of Studio Liverpool fails to effectively reproduce the feeling and charm of Formula One, despite the good graphics sector and an exploited license perfectly. Some absolutely incomprehensible decisions, such as the choice to limit the online mode to a ghost car exchange, ncan only overshadow the few interesting innovations (see in particular the introduction of the career mode), for a title that in general still offers too little compared to previous appointments to fully convince. Who knows, maybe next year Pros: Graphically well done Introduction of the career mode License exploited to the core Cons: Excessively arcade structure Disastrous comment Artificial intelligence not cared for The online should be exploited better Now that the fate of the 2004 Formula One world championship has been established, with the overwhelming victory of Michael Schumacher and the Ferrari team, wouldn't you like to be able to try and relive the season from the beginning, trying to fight the monopoly of the German champion in the role of some outsider pilot? Or simply trying to emulate their records, whizzing aboard one of the two jewels of Italian pride in Maranello? Sony offers us these and many high possibilities with F1 2004, the official game of the world now running out, thanks to an exclusive license that until 2007 binds every title based on the most prestigious car competition to the Japanese giant.", "date": "2004-11-03", "grade": null}
