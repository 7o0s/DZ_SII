The complete series consists of five English-language episodes. Spoiler alert. Now that Tales from the Borderland's journey is over, we can say we've had a few genuine laughs in the company of often charismatic characters. Telltale has fully captured the spirit of Borderlands and has somehow managed to grow a story where there was only desert and massacres. The series gives its best when the protagonists give vent to the most moody part of their character, mixing hyperbolic action and self-irony. It's not Mad Max: Fury Road, but it's still an action story that, at least in this last episode, always keeps a good pace. The fact that he knows how to laugh at his own clichs demonstrates the mastery of the authors for the genre. The final confrontation between Rhys and Handsome Jack, which is actually only the incipit of this last chapter, is a funny exchange about how typical what they are about to do or say is. And it also allows a villain without much substance to add some side reflections before leaving the scene. The sequence in which Rhys has to decide whether or not to sacrifice Yvette, is instead like Scooter flying away into space, that is, it leaves little or nothing in the player. There was no time to bond with either of these secondary characters, so their departure is quickly forgotten. On the other hand, it allows us to define a small trait of Rhys's personality, who in fact will have to decide whether to follow in Handsome Jack's footsteps, right his wrongs, or simply let go of any dream of power. Not bad for a character who didn't seem to have much to say until the penultimate episode. However Rhys is the focus of the action, but not its end. After the death of Handsome Jack and the fall of Helios, our friends find themselves again on Pandora, but with the possibility of finally opening the Vault for which so many disasters have occurred. But first, the game reveals the identity of the mysterious cybersamurai that we have seen since the first episode, the one in which Rhys and Fiona alternated in the role of unreliable narrator. Well, for us it was one of the most welcome and unexpected twists. We could imagine that it was anyone, but not the faithful Loaderbot, looking for the truth about the reasons that led his friends to sacrifice the little robot Gortys. Except that Gortys is not dead at all and indeed reaches its final form of battle megarobot. What do our heroes make of such a colossus? Well, as you well know for every treasure a hero covets there is a dragon ready to defend it, and in this case the dragon is a rock giant known as a Traveler. Only after defeating him will our friends be able to close the loose threads once and for all and experience their own catharsis. Rhys even lets a few tears slip from his cold cybernetic eye. Or what's left of it. Tales from the Borderlands closes the season on a high note, but the series' flaws remain Action without participation The production quality of Tales from the Borderlands has always been very high. From the art direction to the voice acting, you can tell Telltale has put a lot of faith (and budget) into this game. Considering the commercial potential of the brand, it is no surprise that the finale opens the door for a second season. But despite being beautiful to see and listen to, the series has never won us over. The last episode does its duty well, answers every question and closes the narrative lines satisfactorily. Yet something is not right. We often had the impression of being secondary actors to whom we give a sop every now and then. For example, before the final showdown, we need to assemble a second team of four to attempt to kill the Traveler and open the Vault. The shortlist includes all the most relevant secondary characters we've met, but whether or not they're selectable depends on the choices made in previous episodes. We don't know what you think, but it seems to us a very small consolation to know that we will be able to bring one character with us rather than another. Sure, different teams produce different lines of dialogue and a pinch of extra insight, but that's not enough to make us want to reflect on the consequences of our decisions and play the series all over again. If this is the maximum plot that can set the player in motion, there is only one good animated film left to pass on to the Movieplayer.it editorial team. Then there is the question of the fights. Again, and precisely because we loved the final showdown,the prevailing sentiment was disappointment that we couldn't really enjoy fighting, as we might have done if this had been Borderlands, or another action game. So instead of feeling the adrenaline flowing, we just felt the urge to play for real. It's not a criticism of the genre: there are cases in which Quick Time Events add tension to the interaction, such as during a dialogue on which an important choice depends, but there are also cases in which they remove any flavor from the interaction. Unfortunately the fights of Borderlands fall within the second possibility and this, for an action-packed adventure, is a big problem. Too bad, because Telltale has great storytelling talent. Perhaps if he finally tried to innovate his game system he would be able to express it at its best. Maybe just next season.", "date": "2015-10-23", "grade": "7.4"}
