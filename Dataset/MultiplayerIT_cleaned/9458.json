Although a hit and run experience like that of Super Meat Boy, simple, instantaneous and damningly satisfying, seems designed to be enjoyed in total mobility, how can you do without that precision that only a physical control system can ensure ? Yet League of Evil, the iPhone port of the Flash platform of the same name, replicates all those elements that characterized the pearl of Team Meat: from millimeter jumps to levels full of traps, passing through rapid and timed actions to the sound of walljumps between the walls full of enemies. To increase the dose of skepticism we think the certainly not remarkable pedigree of the developers, who with the previous Cave Run have shown that no, Canabalt clones are not exactly their strong point. Luckily we were wrong to start biased. Here we are if we were wrong. Hunting for bad guys If one bad scientist can do some damage, imagine what happens if all the bad scientists in the world band together and decide to take over the world. The plot of League of Evil is all here: at the end of each level there is a bad guy to reach and take out with a punch, after which it continues like this, scientist after scientist, until the unexpected ending. The player finds himself facing a total of 54 scenarios of increasing difficulty, while seeing increasingly diabolical traps slamming in his face: circular blades, assassin ninjas, turrets, lasers and the ever-present quills are just some of the obstacles which, through lightning-fast shots and sequences of elaborate jumps you have to overcome. Just like in Super Meat Boy, the player has an infinite number of lives, but with each failed attempt he must necessarily start the level over. Not that it's a big deal, since the scenarios are so short that they can be completed in about fifteen seconds. From this point of view, in fact, most of the challenges are too poor, short and sometimes trivial, increasing the level of difficulty only in the much more advanced levels: completing a level therefore gives much less satisfaction, and this is probably the one one of the most obvious weaknesses of League of Evil, because in fact, although several trial and error sessions are required, the more savvy player is able to finish the game with his eyes closed and in a very short time. Making comparisons with the successful title by Edmund McMillen and Tommy Refenes is almost unfair, but those who have had the pleasure of trying it know well how excellent level design can make a difference in a platform of this type. This time, however, each scenario is decidedly anonymous and tasteless, not at all capable of turning into a complex puzzle or putting the player's intuition to the test. From Super Meat Boy, the developers have also borrowed the idea of collectibles: each level hides a suitcase to be collected, most of the time surrounded by traps, while based on the speed with which you reach the scientist on duty you are rewarded with one, two or three stars. In this way the game tries to lengthen the stock and be replayed even once all the levels have been completed, but the absence of unlockable extras, secret levels or additional content discourages the player from getting busy, although there is no shortage of online rankings and some unlockable achievements. The touchscreen controls, while not predictably the best choice for a game like this, still do a good job, and it's very rare to end up miscalibrating a jump or moving by accident. Let me be clear, sometimes you miss an analog stick and two physical keys, but with a little practice you can reach the end of the racing level and without too much difficulty. A note of merit then goes to the audiovisual creation, because with its retro graphics and chiptune music, League of Evil seems like a real tribute to Mega Man and other old glories for the NES.
