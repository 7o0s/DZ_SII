{"name": "Pocket City", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pocket-city-la-recensione.html", "text": "The city builder enjoys a sort of elective affinity with the mobile platform, yet it is difficult to find one in this area that can actually replicate the typical experience of the genre on PC. In one way or another, the fact that this type of game marries equally well with the typical mechanics of free-to-play with micro-transactions has ended up corrupting its original spirit, so much so that we are led to look suspiciously at any title of this kind that presents itself as specially designed for smartphones and tablets. Precisely the fact of not pertaining to this generalized degeneration is a first extremely positive element in Pocket City, whose greatest surprise lies, paradoxically, in being a simple and traditional game, with well-studied gameplay and no hidden traps. It is precisely what one might expect from a mobile adaptation of a traditional city builder, with several similarities to recent titles such as Cities Skylines and an obviously simplified structure in order to meet the fundamentally different type of use. What is surprising, however, is the depth of the game, which renounces the more particular and complex elements of its competitors on PC but somehow manages to keep the fundamental elements intact, introducing us to the action with perfect gradualness, which leads us to discover the different aspects in a progressive and stimulating way. In addition to following the instructions of the inevitable assistant, the gradual discovery of the various elements of the game also emerges from the particular quest structure, with a series of colorful characters who offer us different commitments which have, in principle, the purpose of expanding and improve the city in various aspects, in a more pleasant and engaging way. The plenipotentiary mayor The interface is perfectly organized for use on smartphones, although there are a couple of improvements that the developers could apply, considering that equaling the extreme comfort of the mouse in this genre is still impossible. In any case, the organization of the buttons, icons and menus appears to be precisely designed to provide an optimal gaming experience on the move, which is truly remarkable in a title based on options to select and sub-menus to navigate. Obviously those more subtle and numerous details that make the difference in the highest-level simulations are missing, such as the deep management of the economic aspects or the precise design of the infrastructures, but as you progress through the game, you are amazed at how many elements have been included in Pocket City anyway and modeled to be easily usable on even a very small screen. In addition to the city construction phase, we are continually challenged by unforeseen events and situations, ranging from the simple organization of parties to the management of sudden crises such as natural disasters of various kinds, always in the wake of the historical SimCity tradition. This counteracts the repetitiveness that is inherent in this genre of games, once you reach the maximum level of evolution, all building possibilities are unlocked and the city is basically complete, but the limit is still reached at a certain point, considering also the absence of additional modes such as multiplayer. It must be said, however, that as long as we are in the expansive phase, Pocket City is really difficult to abandon, triggering that typical city builder addiction that relies on what must be a latent desire in every player to build and manage increasingly complex cities. In intense use, the desire for some small modifications to the control system just arises, such as the possibility of being able to move the shot while we are in the construction phase or greater freedom of modification in real time without having to resort to canceling the action to start it all over again, but these are really small imperfections. The stylized and clean graphic representation also makes it best on portable screens, resulting on the one hand very pleasing to the eye and on the other hand optimizing performance based on a level of detail that shouldn't weigh too heavily on the most up-to-date hardware.", "date": "2018-08-10", "grade": "8.8"}
