{"name": "Mugen Souls", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/108223-mugen-souls-le-sette-amiche-del-dr-jekyll.html", "text": "That Mugen Souls is an extremely Japanese-style game can be seen from the first seconds, when an introductory film sees the two young protagonists dancing the para para in the company of small animals, while the camera, predictably, lingers several times on close-ups alluring and vicious. To tell the truth, many were surprised that this new jRPG developed by Compile Heart and published by Nippon Ichi has left the Japanese market, since although it has several elements in common with Disgaea and Hyperdimension Neptunia Mk2, it is much more focused on the themes ~ecchi~ and sensual content featuring a cast of characters made up mostly of buxom girls and petite lolis. While never resulting in hentai, it is therefore clear that the title's target audience is a niche of hardcore otaku, but behind a cascade of fanservice and seductive situations, an RPG unexpectedly full of interesting and original ideas is hidden. What a character! Particular and crazy as you would expect from a Nippon Ichi game, Mugen Souls stars the young Chou Chou, a pink-haired girl who wakes up one day in the middle of the Galaxy and decides to find a new hobby: conquer seven planets that make up the Underworld. The improvised plan plans to enslave all the most powerful inhabitants of the seven worlds by transforming them into little creatures called Shanpuru and exploiting the protagonist's ability to change appearance and charm those who oppose resistance. Chou Chou thus leaves aboard a huge space vessel in the company of his companions Ryuto and Altis, traveling from planet to planet in search of the heroes and demonic lords who inhabit each world. Full of gags and all in all amusing dialogues, the plot almost never manages to offer big twists, resulting very predictable due to a simple aesthetic detail: only the key characters have their own artwork within the dialogues, and so it becomes super easy to recognize heroes and demon lords once you meet them in the respective world. As already mentioned, the risqu and sensual situations will be innumerable and will often be based on Chou Chou's ability to change appearance and behavior, covering the entire spectrum of female personalities typical of anime and manga. The seven versions of the protagonist range from hyperactive to self-centered, from sadistic to introverted, each with a design of its own. Yet, unlike many jRPGs in which ecchi themes and sensual characters only serve to raise the libido needle between battles, in Mugen Souls they have a very strong link with the game mechanics and the combat system. Those who have played Hyperdimension Neptunia MK2 will be faced with a fairly similar basic structure, with each character who in his turn can move freely in a delimited area and attack one or more enemies within range. Even several elements of the interface are similar, but the new Compile Heart title has much more substance and brings into play many more variables to take into consideration, including the possibility of amplifying the damage by crashing the enemy against objects of the scenario or other opponents. Obviously there is no shortage of special skills, objects that can be used in battle and combined attacks between the various characters, but the most characteristic novelty of the combat system is represented by the Moe Kill mechanic, a technique that allows you to remove a monster from battle and transform it into a Shanpuru servant. In order for it to be successful, however, it is essential to keep an eye on the personality and mood of the enemy, choose the right transformation of Chou Chou and select three behaviors (for example insults, smiles, whines...): all for the purpose of earn the sympathy of the opponent, but in case the Moe Kill fails the enemies will become angry and will become stronger and more difficult to eliminate. Considering that the same action can have opposite effects depending on whether the monster is happy or sad, self-centered or hyperactive, it is certainly a difficult and often frustrating mechanic to master, but obtaining a large number of minions leads to various benefits during the adventure, as well as exponentially enhancing a very useful special attack against bosses. Playstation 3 trophies Mugen Souls offers about fifty Trophies, many of which must be unlocked simply by continuing in the main adventure and reaching the end of the story. There are some more challenging ones, such as those that require the collection of dozens of different shamporu or the execution of a 10 million point combo. Seduction without conditioner In a moVery similar to Hyperdimension Neptunia Mk2, in Mugen Souls there are no random encounters, but it is possible to see and avoid any monsters while exploring the scenario; Enemies will start chasing the player if they get too close, but a well-timed blow gives a decent early combat advantage. The seven versions of Chou Chou also come into play during exploration, and at certain times you have to conquer parts of the planet using the same mechanics at the base of the Moe Kill system. In this case clues are given as to which is the most suitable personality, but it is precisely here that Mugen Souls proves to be a title that is not very accessible to a very young audience: a clear example is the suggestion ~bring whip, chains and boiling wax with you ~, an obvious reference to sadism which however should escape the younger ones. The continuous alternation of exploration and fighting is occasionally broken up by space battles on board the vessel, which are based on intuiting the opponent's move and neutralizing it through a typical rock-paper-scissors system. However, in addition to being the center of monotonous clashes between the stars, Chou Chou's vessel also serves as a central hub where you can buy items, customize your party's equipment and take part in some pastimes. In the Japanese version there was also an extremely alluring and hentai-esque mini-game, in which you can use bathroom objects to wash and tease the protagonists in seductive poses, amidst a thousand screams and reproaches. Predictably Nippon Ichi removed the mode in question to avoid the 18+ rating in the west, but considering the questionable taste and lack of impact on gameplay or story, we're sure few will miss it. Unfortunately Mugen Souls suffers heavily from the aesthetic side, as it combines the splendid illustrations and the fantastic character design by Takehito Harada with a bare and obsolete polygonal graphics, while the soundtrack is composed of often subdued j-pop songs; always as regards the sound component, from the options it is possible to freely choose between the US or the Japanese dubbing, where the subtitles are only in English.", "date": "2012-09-11", "grade": "7.0"}
