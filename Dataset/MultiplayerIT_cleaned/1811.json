{"name": "Tomb Raider: The Prophecy", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tomb-raider-the-prophecy.html", "text": "The Misadventures of Lara Croft Therefore, from the incipit of this piece we hope that one thing is clear to you: Tomb Raider, from being a revolutionary game, is now a mere commercial phenomenon. And this means that Lara Croft ~must~ get everywhere, even where it could not conceptually exist: in this case, on the Gameboy Advance. Let's be clear, the genius of programmers and their imagination are always able to achieve the unthinkable, but a particularly intense effort is expected from those who want to adapt a product that, by its nature, to a console incapable of fluidly managing the three dimensions it must guarantee the freedom of movement that only 3D can provide. Well, it seems that the designers of this adventure in the Advance version didn't try too hard, applying the simplest possible 3D to 2D conversion: the isometry compromise. And here is that this Tomb Raider becomes absolutely unplayable. It is difficult to move Lara in the little intricate labyrinths created by the programmers, and even more so to engage in furious fights with enemies of all types (which are always the same usual mix of wild animals, human beings and supernatural creatures), performing the daring stunts that have always distinguished the actions of the Croft (in this case reduced only to the aerial backflip). Of course, the creation of a simpler and more immediate control system, based on the few keys granted by the GBA, is appreciable, but in the end this only complicates things further, where the performable actions are so limited. However, the classic war equipment intervenes to help us, this time miserably reduced to only three types of double pistols, which can be recovered slowly as the game progresses... Femme fatale We said that Lara's new adventure is isometric. If we think of the isometric games available on GBA (Megaman Battle Network, Spyro, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater) it's impossible not to make a comparison and notice how Tomb Raider shows little care for its graphic design. Let's be clear, we are not dealing with a bad game, graphically speaking, but just a little cared for: the details of the environments, however present, inevitably get mixed up in a vortex of multicolored pixels with a confused air, which makes it impossible to correctly visualize the game environment and its proportions. Fortunately, the locations are varied and different... but not well structured, rather simple and at times terribly repetitive: the classic puzzles and pitfalls of the series are all there (time levers, rolling boulders), but obviously simplified and sometimes even mortified... On the other hand, we can't complain about the animations of Lara and the vast majority of her opponents: fluid, convincing, even if perhaps a little few do their duty perfectly. The music that accompanies the adventures is just discreet, sometimes annoying, as are the anonymous sound effects... not that Tomb Raider is a game that bases its atmosphere on music, but an extra effort would have been extremely welcome. Comment It was a matter of time, not even the GBA could escape the umpteenth raid of the gamers' favorite grave robber. Only this time he raided very little, certainly not positive opinions. The technical realization and the playful structuring denote a great listlessness and little inventiveness on the part of the creators, who have simply re-proposed already tested mechanics trying to adapt them (unnecessarily) to the capabilities of the GBA, with results, if not fluctuating, just mediocre. It's a pity, because there were all the possibilities to play a little pearl. In particular, the biggest and most confusing flaw of this production should be mentioned: the incomprehensible password system. Leaving aside the fact that in 2003 such an obsolete save system shouldn't even be taken into consideration, it's incredible to think that there are games like the two Castlevanias that offer about eight save slots, while this Tomb Raider relies on long and complicated codes that also do not save the found items: exactly, it doesn't matter how many medical kits you save in a level, since as soon as you enter a new password they will disappear. A very nice touch. In short, if you are madly in love with Lara Croft, you will be able to overlook the many flaws that The Prophecy presents; if, on the other hand, you have smelled the commercial smell since Dagger of Xian (the second and worst episode for PlayStation, in short), this title will not make you change your mind. Pros: NoLara's charm can't be resisted Beautiful animations After all, it's a pleasant adventure Cons: Technically, much better could have been done Too simplistic and monotonous Password?!? Lara Croft is a character who has now entered the collective imagination: videogame, comic, cinematographic, social. A book could be written on the reasons for this mythicization of the buxom archaeologist, but we don't want to entertain you with tedious and long-winded psycho-sociological studies, so we'll just take a step back... oh well, more than one step: in 1997 Tomb Raider made its first appearance in the PlayStation game library, with an entirely three-dimensional action/adventure that recalled, at least initially, the historic Alone in the Dark or the contemporary Resident Evil. Initially, because the substance of that first Tomb Raider (and all its sequels/clones) was totally different, and it is so well known that it is even useless to explain it. The boom, however, was due to her, Lara Croft, the alternative heroine, masculine and fierce like Indiana Jones and at the same time feminine and sensual in her own way. Four sequels, a pocket version (for Gameboy Color), a film (less than mediocre), a (beautiful) comic series... commercial success was served. Now, while Angel of Darkness, his first next-generation adventure for PlayStation2, is preparing to invade the disc-trays of countless users, Ubisoft offers us this miniature adventure for the Nintendo laptop...", "date": "2003-01-13", "grade": null}
