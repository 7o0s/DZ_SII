{"name": "Final Fantasy Fables: Chocobo Tales - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/final-fantasy-fables-chocobo-tales-recensione.html", "text": "Big trouble in Choco-Town Just as reported in the title itself, the game has the structure of a fairy tale, whose plot is interwoven with many other fairy tales: a sort of meta-tale, where the fairy tale is the subject and form of the narration. But let's go in order: the protagonist of the game is obviously a chocobo, to which we can give a name as we like, who lives his life as a gallinaceous animal peacefully on the farm. Once upon a time, one could say, there was this quiet and dreamy chocobo, who loved to listen to the stories told by Shirma, the farm's nurse. One day, Croma, the troublemaker wizard, arrived shaking the tranquility of a normal morning with a new book, apparently endowed with strange magical powers. Despite the bad omen, the wizard opened the book, unknowingly releasing a terrible spirit hidden in it, a certain Bebuzzu, who in his new form of a runaway magical tome began to suck all the chocobos of the farm and the surroundings, one by one. This malefactor had actually been summoned previously by Irma, a girl with a rather gothic style and haughty ways of doing, animated by rather malevolent intentions (conquest of the world and things like that). Bebuzzu, in order to fully fulfill his role as a bad guy, however, needed more power, and the only way to collect enough was to recover the 4 elemental crystals scattered around the world. The little Chocobo, the protagonist of the story, therefore only had to roll up his sleeves and, with the help of Shirma and Croma, recover all the kidnapped companions and try to stop the shady plans of the criminals. Three games in one The aim of the game is therefore to recover all the missing chocobos and stop the evil Bebuzzu. To do this, we will have to explore various areas contiguous to the farm (village, volcano, forest, etc.) in search of the books and pages in which our friends have been imprisoned, and in the meantime collect a good amount of battle cards, in way to create a deck powerful enough to defeat enemies. The structure of the game is apparently simple and childish, but it actually turns out to be quite complex and stratified, which lends itself to different interpretations. At first, Chocobo Tales may seem like a simple collection of mini-games, but it doesn't take much to realize that these are simply variations on the gameplay firmly installed on the adventure substrate that amalgamates the whole game. Within this, the ~card game~ element is also inserted, the true cornerstone of the title in question. Three different videogame modes, therefore, however rather merged with each other, and somehow justified in each other. The main phase is the exploratory one, which closely follows what has been seen in the various Square Enix RPGs, in particular, approaching significantly Final Fantasy III: in a world entirely reproduced in 3D, we guide our chocobo using only the stylus (or , optional) by tapping the direction to follow on the Touch Screen. The interactive elements are highlighted by a little hand that points to them, and by clicking on them we obtain different effects: we examine objects, we converse with the characters, or we activate fights and mini-games. The latter are connected to the various books scattered around the game world, which each contain a different story, usually based on some famous fable (often taken from the repertoire of the Brothers Grimm or Aesop) such as ~The Ugly Duckling~, ~James and the Beans Magic~ and many others, with various endings depending on the level of difficulty with which we conclude them. The mini-games are all based on an extensive use of the stylus and the touch screen: structured on a theme with the story narrated in the respective book, they are mostly sorts of races against opponents managed by the CPU, in which the ability to use the stylus and the glance are fundamental. Some are absolutely elementary (like drawing a leaf on the touch screen to make the chocobo bounce on the upper screen), while others have a more complex concept (like the Bremen Town Musicians, where you have to press the right musical instrument in time). Many are simply boring or frustrating, but some are really funny and original: in any case, they are well designed to last just a few minutes. Scattered throughout the game world we also find ~micro-games~, which differ from the aforementioned mini-games for an even more simplified structure: they are small puzzles which, once solved, will provide rewards proportional to our performance (read: higher is the score and the rarer the combat cards released are). Books and mini-games The various game-books disscattered around the world they have multiple functions: each of them contains a different story (generally some reworking of famous fairy tales in a Chocobesque key) which has more or less direct references to the main game. Each book has several objectives to unlock (generally five), linked to the selectable difficulty level or the time taken to complete it or even the score to be achieved. The various objectives unlock different results: more or less rare combat cards, objects necessary to advance in the game, or the liberation of missing chocobo friends. Often the stories are connected in some way with the game world, and the conclusion of the tests changes the surrounding environment, allowing access to new areas (for example, the conclusion of the magic beans story causes a plant to grow in the vicinity of the book that allows you to continue to the next area). There are then different epilogues for each story, to be discovered by completing the mini-games in various ways, which explain different endings of the plot. Paper Wars So let's come to what should be the beating heart of the entire game: the card-based combat system. In the combat phases, Final Fantasy Fables transforms into a typical trading card game, with the upper screen illustrating the animated battles between the summoned creatures and the lower one dedicated to the selection of the cards to be used. Each card is characterized by a color, which gives it particular powers. A second subdivision then takes place according to the summoned creature, each creature has different cards referring to it, with effectiveness directly proportional to its rarity. The cards have attack and defense zones, represented by shields and swords arranged on the four edges: when the two cards collide, they have different effects depending on the arrangement of these zones. If a card has an attack in a zone, and the opposing card has a defense in the corresponding zone, the latter takes no damage; if the zone is itself occupied by an attack, the damage is halved but if the corresponding zone is empty, the opponent suffers the full potential of the attack. The use of each card also has various other effects: normally the card of a certain color causes a crystal of the corresponding color to appear on the upper screen, at the end of the turn. During the fight you get to fill a bar made up of 8 crystals, all corresponding to the colors of the cards gradually used. Many creatures have the ability to exploit the summoned crystals in different ways, amplifying their power through more devastating attacks, or recharging the character's energy in correspondence with crystals of certain colors. At the beginning of the battle, three cards are chosen at random from the deck: the player who attacks first is the one who decides faster, within the time limit, which card to throw. At the end of the turn, the used card is placed back in the deck and another one is drawn, which adds to the previous two unused ones. It is clear that, as happens in every game of the genre, in addition to strategic skill in using the cards, it is also essential to have a good deck to draw from, which can be obtained by collecting the cards (there are about 100 different ones) through the careful exploration of the game world and the ability to complete the mini and micro-games scattered throughout it. Once you have put together a battle deck, made up of 15 cards, it is possible to embark on multiplayer challenges, which can be carried out through a wireless connection with multiple cartridges, or online, using the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. The beauty of chocobos Technically, this Final Fantasy Fables looks like most Square Enix products on the Nintendo DS: a little gem. The care with which graphics and sound accompaniment have been created demonstrates once again the ability of the Japanese publisher with regard to the exploitation of the Nintendo portable hardware. In the exploration phase, the world of Chocobo Tales is decidedly beautiful: detailed, colorful and with beautifully animated characters. It is not easy to find polygonal graphics of this caliber in the current production for the console: also by virtue of the greater restriction of the explorable world, the scenarios are perhaps even superior to Final Fantasy III itself, with which this game largely shares the setting graphics and style. More particular, and in some respects even more beautiful, is the graphic style adopted within the game-books: with a particular polygonal effect that simulates 2D graphics, these books are leafed through before our eyes, making the figures rise from the pages as in books for bchildren. A paper scenography unfolds on the two screens, in a feast of colours, with an effect that amplifies the fairy-tale atmosphere that characterizes the whole game. The soundtrack confirms the excellent levels to which Square Enix has accustomed us, with pleasant tracks and various cheerful remakes of the historic Uematsu melodies that have always been connected to the RPG series. A mix of both styles (the ~polygonal-solid~ one that characterizes the exploratory phase, and the ~dreamy-paper~ one of the mini-games) instead animates the moments dedicated to the fights: while in the bottom screen we have a simple representation of the to be selected, a lively battle rages above between the two contenders, in which the characters and the scenario are drawn directly from the situation in which we find ourselves in the exploration phase, and the various summoned creatures are instead represented with the characteristic ~paper~ style . A special mention should be made to the excellent Italian adaptation of the game, which free from the seriousness often imposed by the tone of normal RPGs, gives us witty and carefree dialogues, anything but flat, despite the more infantile target to which the game should to tend. Comment In evaluating the game, one cannot ignore considering this Chocobo Tales as a title aimed at an audience made up of young and very young people, as is normally suited to the new trend of trading card games in the style of Yu-Gi-Oh! However, the well thought out structure, with the three blocks of gameplay well interlocked with each other, makes it a solid and interesting title even for those who are not normally interested in the genre. Certainly, in order for the game to be at least lasting, it is necessary to have at least the desire to engage in a trading card game, otherwise it is difficult to go on only with exploration and mini-games, fun at first, but whose thickness ends anyway to get bored soon. However, it remains a good meeting point between RPG and card game, highly recommended for fans of the latter genre, but which can also represent a good introduction to the environment for those who have not yet had the opportunity to try a trading card game . The ability to play online via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection is obviously a fundamental plus in such a game. All in all, it is another demonstration of the excellent relationship established between Square Enix and Nintendo DS. Pros: Excellent style and technical realization Three different styles of gameplay amalgamated together Possibility of playing card fights in online multiplayer Cons: Short-lived for non-card game enthusiasts Only microgames work in game sharing Fluctuating quality of minigames And so, the gallinaceous companions of a thousand Square Enix adventures have finally found their way to success. In fact, the publisher seems to ride them frequently, when it comes to experimenting with new concepts or creating alternative games to major productions. So here comes Chocobo's Mysterious Dungeon on the market, in response to the increasingly frequent Japanese RPGs based on the exploration of labyrinths and the capture of monsters; Chocobo Racing has gone to fill the void of Mario Kart-style racing games from Square Enix, while Chocobo De Dice has turned Monopoly into a subsidiary of the award-winning firm Final Fantasy. In essence, the feathered creatures act as pioneers for the exploration of new videogame territories, expanding the boundaries of the most famous series of oriental role-playing games beyond the now narrow limits of normal JRPGs. Final Fantasy Fables: Chocobo Tales has been assigned the task of linking the universe of the famous RPG with a collectible card game, a genre that is now basic in the Japanese videogame market and beyond. The move is in fact particularly apt, almost due, given the enormous amount of characters and creatures that populate Final Fantasy from which to draw, and their iconic power. The result is a game that, despite being decidedly dedicated to an audience of young and very young, lends itself to multiple interpretations, however distinguishing itself thanks to the touch and care typical of Square Enix.", "date": "2007-07-19", "grade": null}
