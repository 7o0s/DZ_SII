{"name": "XEL: la recensione di uno Zelda-like che non trova la propria strada", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/xel-recensione.html", "text": "Over the years, the independent games market has revived many genres that had partially disappeared or at least lost their centrality. One example (among many) is that of isometric Zelda-likes, i.e. those inspired by the classic Nintendo adventures. Now, a new project that is clearly the result of the developers' passion is trying to make its way onto the market: XEL. However, passion is not always enough and this little adventure of Tiny Roar struggles to convince, as we will explain in the course of our article. Creating a Zelda-like means much more than taking back its fundamental characteristics and unfortunately XEL is unable to do much more, also putting a series of quite serious problems in the middle. Here, then, is our review of XEL in the PC version. The game is also available in a Nintendo Switch version. The PlayStation and Xbox versions will only come later. Amnesia Reid and one of the first characters of XEL XEL starts from one of the great classics of video games: an amnesiac protagonist. Our character no longer has any memory of her past and of where she is and she only knows that she survived an emergency landing with her own spacecraft. The young woman then makes her way through the rubble and joins the little robot Chap (the Navi of the situation), together with whom she discovers that there is a rural community that lives among the remains of a large structure in the past dominated by a much more advanced civilization . Reid, this is the name assigned to the protagonist by her new allies, will therefore join a pleasant but all too classic cast of characters, becoming their armed wing. The story of XEL struggles to excel and from the beginning it seems like a set of clichs that fail to attract the player's interest. The game world is more pleasant, at least on a stylistic level, which seems alive and large, perhaps even too much to be honest. The settings are in fact often too large and the pace of the game suffers. Often, XEL would have benefited from a cut, with the elimination of sections that donate little to the adventure. Yes, there are chests to open in every direction, but sometimes it feels like you have to walk too far to get very little. Arm and mind A snowy area of XEL Another problem with XEL is the combat system. Reid has a sword, a shield and some additional tools, such as an electric trap, which can be used to deal with various types of enemies. However, the trivial combo system, combined with a somewhat woody dodge, fails to create interesting action sequences, also due to poorly elaborated enemy attack strategies. The bosses slightly improve the situation as they offer slightly longer-lasting fights, but the battles are tedious, especially if you manage to accumulate many healing resources and are not interested in using dodging to attack head-on. The game isn't all about combat, however. Like any good Zelda-like, XEL also offers various puzzle sections, which blend with the exploration of the game world. We will have switches to press to activate passages, batteries to collect and position to open doors, but also various keys to find inside chests to overcome blocks. Even Reid's tools are used to overcome certain sections: an easy example is the electric trap, which for a few moments gives current to specific doors. More important, however, is a special ability of Reid, which is also linked to the plot: through a strange stone set on the forehead, the girl can travel to the past. This possibility is limited to specific sections of the game, where the puzzles reside. Acting in the past affects the present and you must understand how to move boxes and open doors in order to get to your destination. For example, in the past we can move a crate under a walkway so, in the present, it won't collapse and will allow us to pass. The puzzles are discreet and vary the cards on the table a bit, but they are not enough to make XEL an exciting experience. Technical Problems A green area of XEL XEL doesn't even excel on a technical level: unfortunately the Tiny Roar adventure is full of problems. There are various graphical bugs, bad animations and character placements and some places on the maps where it is possible to get stuck. This last problem could be quite annoying among other things, as XEL does not have an automatic save: you have to save manually in front of the statues and, in case of death or blockage, you risk losing various progress. It doesn't end there, in addition to the graphical problems there are real design errors, with visual elements that are positioned in front of the cameramere isometric and prevent you from seeing the game action well. Let's add a very short loading distance, which causes the sudden appearance of various graphic elements and we have a visual sector that often annoys and ruins the pleasant artistic direction. All this is combined with a somewhat dancer frame rate, which loses its shots every time the situation gets a little bit busy.", "date": "2022-07-24", "grade": "5.0"}
