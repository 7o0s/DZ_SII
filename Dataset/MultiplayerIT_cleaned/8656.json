Christoph Minnameier's game has the advantage of captivating us from the very first screen, immediately inserting us into its mechanisms within a few minutes of starting it up, just like a Zelda from times gone by. At first sight it is a sort of RPG-style adventure , but it soon becomes clear how its structure is set more on puzzle characteristics, although it always maintains a particular degree of hybridization that makes it difficult to frame and consequently very fresh and enjoyable. Surely it draws inspiration from the old action adventures or computer RPGs, but this concerns more the aesthetics and the general spirit than its structure, while in terms of gameplay the closest example could be Legend of Grimrock, and the assonance between the titles it might not be exactly random. History A Dungeons of Dreadrock dungeon The story is introduced in a matter of seconds of dialogue and narration: each year, a young boy is chosen to challenge the King of the Mountain, after having faced the fearsome dungeon that leads to the creature's crypt. The protagonist is the sister of the chosen one, who has the task of simply accompanying him to the entrance to the Dead King's Gate, but something is definitely not going the right way. The choices made by the village wise men turn out to be inaccurate, and the girl finds herself having to face the terrible test of the King in her brother's place, advancing into the depths of the mountain from level to level until the final challenge. It all takes place on the different floors of the dungeon, with the levels each occupying a single screen and requiring you to solve some puzzles and fight the enemies present to reach the exit and progress along the path. Puzzles and RPGs Dungeons of Dreadrock: The story begins at the entrance to the mountain, in this image The aim of Dungeons of Dreadrock is to complete the levels by reaching the exit, usually passing through traps, enemies and trying to find keys and solve puzzles with a simple setting but increasingly complex solution. It is a dungeon crawler RPG as a concept, but its structure resorts to puzzles and hybrid elements that also recall turn-based role-playing games: for example, the movement of the protagonist takes place in boxes, as well as that of the enemies, which imposes a certain strategic setting in the movements allowing you to dodge threats and attacks with the right timing and exploit the position to have advantages over the enemies. The combat is extremely simple: it is simply a question of being in the square adjacent to the enemy and moving in his direction to deliver a blow, but more often it happens that one must try to avoid direct confrontation and simply flee or use traps and other enemies present in the level to your advantage, eliminating opponents in alternative ways. From this point of view, the control based on quick touches and swipes is not always accurate and can cause accidental errors. This tactical approach paves the way for a considerable number of situations, also given the continuous introduction of new game elements between enemies of different types, new traps and scenario objects with which to interact. Dungeons of Dreadrock: Levels are packed into single screens but are often brilliant There is obviously a certain repetition of gameplay solutions during the 100 levels that separate us from the Dead King, but each level is so concentrated and full of features that we never abandon ourselves to tedium, also given the brevity with which they run out, such as small bursts of gameplay in quick succession. All this is then represented with a simple and clean style from an audio-visual point of view, classical in its 2D manner but not too pimping and equipped with a remarkable level of detail and convincing animations, with small touches of class that embellish the characterization. Dungeons of Dreadrock is distributed as free-to-play with the presence of advertisements: these appear infrequently and do not annoy that much but it is still possible (and advisable) to unlock the version without promotional spots at the price of 2.39 euros .", "date": "2022-02-26", "grade": "8.2"}
