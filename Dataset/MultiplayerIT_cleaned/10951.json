{"name": "Tomb Raider Underworld", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tomb-raider-underworld.html", "text": "Closed the Tomb Raider Anniversary parenthesis, the saga based on the origins of Lara Croft continues: after discovering that her mother is not dead, but is trapped in an unknown place, the beautiful archaeologist looks for any clue to find her. Her father's studies about the island of Avalon come to her aid, but traces soon appear on her path that have little to do with British legends, and which rather refer to Nordic mythology. Of course, in its mobile reduction TRU doesn't count that much on the contribution of the plot, which is told exclusively through textual dialogues between Lara and her friends; but the settings are roughly the same, just as the pitfalls that the protagonist will face both in the 3D and in the 2D version of the game are very similar, the latter created to meet the needs of those who own a less accustomed to polygonal graphics. To all intents and purposes, they are two different products: the more ~evolved~ one clearly refers to the Symbian version of Tomb Raider: Legend, with the same visual and a similar setting; the other is a two-dimensional platformer of the classic type, moreover very similar to the mobile reduction of Tomb Raider Anniversary. In its 3D version, the game is strongly bound by ~rails~ that allow Lara only certain movements: movement within the locations is pre-set, and at most you can decide to do it the other way around or to take alternative routes if they are available. We will often find chasms to jump (key 5) as well as walls to climb, sometimes by performing a simple mini-game based on reflections. There is no shortage of enemies, represented by unidentified humanoid monsters: in their presence, Lara will pull out her guns and an automatic aiming system will allow us to hit them without too many problems. The energy bar, located at the top of the screen, empties depending on the damage we suffer and can only be restored by collecting the medical kits scattered along the stages. Much of the time is spent identifying the doors to open and collecting the relative keys, in a context that is unfortunately rather banal and weighed down by the almost total lack of freedom. Let's say that in the specific case of Tomb Raider Underworld the 2D version is presented in a decidedly more sympathetic and accessible way, in the form of a classic platformer in which you have to find the exit from the stages above all by climbing. Controlling Lara is very simple and intuitive, with a good number of actions that can be performed, interspersed with the same puzzles that distinguish the 3D version of the game (which can be accessed directly from the start screen, once unlocked). Moving on to a purely technical discourse, Lara Croft's new adventure appears discreet but far from spectacular. The version with polygonal graphics makes use of fairly simple models, with woody animations, which move within scenarios that are often dull and devoid of particular charm, even if quite varied in aesthetics. As far as the 2D version is concerned, things are much better: Lara's sprite is well designed and has very fluid animations, while the locations appear much more accurate, with greater attention to detail. The sound is mediocre in both cases, while the control system responds promptly to inputs, without any particular problems. PRO Discrete graphics, better in 2D Good number of internships Challenging enough... AGAINST ...but boredom is just around the corner Subdued sound 3D version too limited and cumbersome", "date": "2008-12-23", "grade": "S.V."}
