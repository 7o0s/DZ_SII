It certainly cannot be said that the reception given to the debut of Valhalla Game Studios has been the best, with the first hands-on (including ours) which highlighted serious doubts about what the value of the product might have been. Nonetheless, many continued to have faith in the project, certain that something good had to come out of the creator of Ninja Gaiden: our task, in this review, is to try to explain how unfortunately it didn't go like this ... Few ideas but well confused If what Itagaki has always maintained is true, ie that it took two years just to develop the concept behind Devil's Third, then we would really feel like advising the Japanese designer to make better use of his time. It is in fact from here that the first serious problems of the title start, starting with a setting that messed around in an almost childish way with the elements that compose it, despite being able to count on basic intuitions that are anything but contemptible. In fact, the story behind the game tells of a pro-Soviet terrorist group that decides to implement the so-called Kessler syndrome, destroying all the satellites orbiting the Earth with a chain reaction, thus putting the communication network out of action. and the weapon systems of the main Western powers. Not knowing what else to do, the US government decides to appeal to Ivan, a former member of the criminal organization responsible for the plan, sentenced to 850 years of imprisonment in the maximum security prison at Guantanamo: among the (few) Taking on the role of this hero all muscles and tattoos, the player will therefore have to face his old comrades in an attempt to save civilization from their mad intentions of a new world order. The development of the plot is narrated with a superficiality and a lack of care that literally leaves you astounded: characters full of clichs enter and leave the scene without a minimum of introduction or deepening and the events are nothing more than a cheesy copy-paste of B-movie situations (there are martial arts, genetic experiments, political intrigue, military operations, all blended into a mix of which it is literally hard to find the meaning), in a picture made even sadder by what the game takes itself tremendously seriously, convinced that it is telling a story truly worthy of the name. It will be said that the narrative component has a relative importance in an action game: true, but it is a pity that in terms of gameplay Devil's Third even manages to make the situation worse, reaching levels of videogame baseness that we have rarely encountered in a product intended for store shelves. Valhalla Game Studios' intention to combine the mechanics of a first-person shooter and a third-person slasher has led to the disheartening reality of a title that plays both roles very poorly, highlighting gross design gaps and embarrassing technical flaws . Constantly plagued by huge technical and design gaps, Devil's Third is a bad action game Once upon a time Ninja Gaiden Devil's Third is certainly not the first game to offer a combat system that blends the use of firearms with that of melee tools: nevertheless, Itagaki and his companions have created a product that seems to come from a past geological era , how primitive the elements that make up the gameplay are. At the commands of Ivan, the player is called to face nine extremely linear levels, characterized by a design that rarely goes beyond the reiteration of the antediluvian pattern composed of large areas full of enemies connected by empty corridors. Taking up one of the two firearms that the protagonist can carry with him, the game proves to be a shooter in which practically nothing works as it should, starting with aiming: you can shoot directly from the default third-person view, however having to deal with very little precision, or you can press the right trigger to switch to Ivan's point of view using the rifle sight, a solution that dramatically reduces mobility and proves to be totally incapable of providing a feeling even remotely comparable to that of a shooterworthy of this name. And this is just the tip of the iceberg of structural problems related to firefights that range from very serious to disastrous: the automatic cover system is completely unreliable and it often happens that you get hit even when you are behind a wall of reinforced concrete; the effectiveness of the various weapons is totally biased in favor of the assault rifles, rendering 90% of the other tools recoverable in the field basically useless; last but not least, the enemies are equipped with a ridiculous artificial intelligence that precludes them from the most basic behavioral patterns such as taking cover in a sensible way or dodging if they find a grenade in the way. If shooting in Devil's Third does not give satisfaction (to put it mildly), switching to cold weapons proves to be an even disheartening experience, especially if you consider that a certain Ninja Gaiden has come out of Itagaki's hands. Ivan can use his service katana or collect a variety of objects (from lead pipes to fireman's axes to tomahawks) to attack enemies using two buttons on the GamePad dedicated respectively to fast and powerful ones: there is no semblance of technique in hand-to-hand combat, which prove to be wooden and penalized not only by the aforementioned incapacity of the enemies, but also by an incredibly limited set of moves which makes them monotonous from the very first bars of the game. To further bury the situation, a substantial baggage of technical deficiencies intervenes, ranging from the poor implementation of the blocking and dodging system, to the total absence of a lock-on mechanism up to the complete anarchy of the camera, which especially in clashes with more than an opponent tends to always assume the worst possible positioning. With these assumptions, it seems almost superfluous to state that the single player campaign of Devil's Third is a succession of unappealable ugliness, an adventure as boring as it is frustrating due to its inability to offer the slightest glimmer of quality or spectacularity, not even in the sequences board vehicles or fixed locations (some so insipid as to almost regret the normal game action), not to mention the boss battles, capable of arousing involuntary hilarity for how badly conceived they are. Never a joy The faint hopes that Devil's Third could redeem itself thanks to its online mode are swept away by yet another load of absurd design choices and antiquated technical realization, two real constants of Itagaki's latest work. Credit must be given to Valhalla Game Studios for having made an evident effort in the development of a multiplayer component that is in some ways original and equipped with some innovative ideas, in short, full of good intentions which unfortunately leave the time they find. By connecting to the internet, it is possible to create your own digital alter ego, buy weapons and equipment and participate in free games by selecting from ten different modes (described in detail in our latest test) or jump into the so-called Siege section, or a persistent war scenario in the which each player can decide to join a clan or fight as a mercenary by defending his team's fortress and attacking those of others. On paper, this is a rather attractive prospect and seasoned with potentially very intriguing nuances: it is possible to weave various diplomatic relations with the other clans (by forging alliances or non-aggression pacts), expand and enhance the stronghold using a special editor and even elaborate and build special weapons to call upon during battles. Too bad that the developers have really done their best to make everything as intricate and cumbersome as possible, with an overabundance of redundant and unclear menus that alone would be enough to remove the desire to delve into the contents of the mode. The definitive push that also pushes this element of Devil's Third towards the abyss however comes - as it is easy to guess - from a gameplay that carries with it all the macroscopic defects that we have listed in relation to the single player, and which indeed prove to be amplified when they face each other other human opponents. Playing Devil's Third online means having to come to terms with a scary targeting system, a totally unrealistic weapon balance and hand-to-hand combat which here becomes confusing to unthinkable levels. Defects that kill in the bud any attempt to enhance the effective creativity of some solutions proposed by the multiplayer component, which collapse like houses of cards of front to an unsatisfying gameplay action to say the least. In order not to miss anything, then, Devil's Third also includes hateful microtransactions in the calculation of the negativity of its online structure, relating to golden eggs that can be purchased to quickly access the most exotic items in the shop's catalogue. Back in time With Devil's Third, Itagaki has made a real en plein, bringing to the market an absolutely despicable title from the point of view of narrative, play structure and also technical implementation. If we exclude the valid polygonal models of the main protagonists, there is nothing that can be saved in the work of Valhalla Game Studios, capable of bringing back to the screen the spectra of aesthetic unpleasantness that we considered buried for years. The environments are bare, covered with textures that almost always load late and even when they do they appear terribly undefined, the interaction with the elements of the scenario is almost nil, the color palette used rarely goes beyond the nuances of gray and brown (a brilliant multiplayer map at night in this sense in which asphalt and water share a shade that makes them practically indistinguishable) and the lighting effects and explosions seem to come out of a Nintendo 64 title. It doesn't get better when you look at the characters on the screen: the types of enemies can be counted on the fingers of one hand and their design is the most anonymous imaginable, and to make matters worse these sad figures are even deprived of the right to die with dignity, as their limbs affected by Ivan's attacks detach as if they were pieces of LEGO. Not that our hero is a sight to be seen in action, with his woody and unrelated animations and his tendency to produce interpenetrations with any element of the scenario that happens to him. Despite this disconcerting poverty, Devil's Third is not even able to guarantee a stable frame rate at 30 frames per second, showing the side of even considerable slowdowns that do not occur only in the most agitated situations, but which sometimes even involve the cutscenes. Speaking of the latter, it should be noted not only the cheesy direction with which they are represented, but also the English dubbing which on several occasions gives the impression of being the result of an amateur work. Finally, Devil's Third can boast of being probably the title capable of exploiting the GamePad touch screen in the worst possible way: during the single player the display remains completely black, available only to host the game action if the TV is busy, while in multiplayer there is only room for a few ancillary lobby functions, such as a (bad) text chat or the display of warnings and statistics.", "date": "2015-08-26", "grade": "4.0"}
