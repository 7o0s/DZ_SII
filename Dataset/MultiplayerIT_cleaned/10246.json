The prospect of a futuristic racer halfway between wipEout and F-Zero seemed tempting, but as soon as the game was shown to the public, criticism literally rained down. Wheelspin, moreover, embodies all the fears associated with the production of a video game: take a big name in the industry (which has signed both classics of the past and interesting novelties), put it to work on a futuristic racing game (genre on Wii not yet shown) and give them the support they need to make something spectacular only to realize that the goal hasn't been achieved. In fact, it didn't even come close. In terms of numbers, the product developed by Awesome Play does not miss anything: thirty tracks, six cars that can be upgraded, three game modes and the presence of multiplayer for eight players in split-screen (using both Wii and GameCubes). There is no online multiplayer, of course, but once a game has started that will be the least of our worries. Boom! The first impact with Wheelspin is contrasting: on the one hand there are the sixty frames per second widely announced before the release (but still subject to drops and uncertainties during more complex situations); on the other hand, a completely styleless level design, characterized by a general desolation and a use of monotonous colors, which in no way contributes to buffering what has always been the technical limits of the Nintendo console. There's something for all tastes: just discrete polygonal counts, interpenetrations, rendering defects that show up when our car ends up off the track (often) and literally lowest quality textures. In most cases you find yourself racing alone or against a single opponent, who, unlike us, demonstrates right from the start that he knows each track in detail and can take advantage of each of the acceleration ramps present. To unlock a new track, it is generally enough to complete all the laps by reaching a certain objective (turn at the maximum for a certain number of seconds), so we are not told to win right away. On balance, this proves to be sensible: without purchasing a good number of upgrades, it is practically impossible to keep up with the other pilots, beyond the objective limits of an unreliable control system and an at least imaginative physical context, which gives life to unexpected and almost never predictable reactions when curves and jumps are involved. At the wheel The Wheelspin control system provides for the use of the Wii-mote horizontally, better if inserted into a special adapter in the shape of a steering wheel. The key configuration is classic, with the d-pad for the use of weapons (when we play in battle mode) and the handbrake, the use of which in tight corners often proves to be more harmful than useful. You can also play by connecting the Nunchuck, but you still have to rely on the accelerometer, tilting the device in various directions to control the car: a nightmare. Resorting to the Classic Controller or a GameCube joypad improves things substantially, because in this way we do not have to deal with a chronic lack of precision, but the problem of the vehicle's behavior remains, which to be a vehicle on four wheels steers and holds the road in its own way, reacting to stresses in an often unpredictable way. The conformation of the tracks does not help, in particular due to the lack of barriers capable of keeping us on the road: we rush often and willingly, losing precious seconds and systematically resorting to ~regeneration~. At least this does not happen during battles, and although the combat system appears simplistic, it turns out to be better at the end of the exclusively course phase. The circle is closed by a sound sector which from the point of view of the effects is extremely poor and from the point of view of the music it plays the card of ~wipEout~ techno songs, which however only work for a few minutes due to excessive repetitiveness.", "date": "2010-01-18", "grade": "4.3"}
