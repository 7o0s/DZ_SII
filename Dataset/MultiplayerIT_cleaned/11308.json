Not as many as they deserved, perhaps. It is clear that one cannot freely kick a prime minister in the gums who is pissed off, but it is equally clear that video games often serve precisely to make us do ~virtually~ what would be impossible in reality. In the case of Mena the Politician! Super Boxing, you don't ask for the moon... just to find yourself in a ring and to face, in boxing matches, a series of more or less sympathetic politicians. The protagonist of the game is once again the mysterious and anonymous KO Kid, and the setting is the same seen in Super KO Boxing. Only the adversaries change: Berlusconi, Zapatero, Putin, Brown, Angela Merkl and the obvious George W. Bush. There are two game modes available: the tournament and the versus mode. The latter simply allows us to fight a single match with an already defeated opponent, so it is the tournament that represents the most substantial part of the game. The politicians we will fight with are divided into categories, according to which the level of difficulty is in fact regulated: each character has specific characteristics, which must be carefully studied in order to achieve victory. This is precisely the most important element of Mena the Politician! Super Boxing: the elementary strategies that allow us to defeat the first opponents will be immediately questioned, and we will be faced with always different tactics and attack patterns, which we will have to memorize to find any weak points. The control system is quite simple and well organized: by pressing the joystick up we pull hooks to the face, with the FIRE button we switch to direct ones to the stomach. Pressing the joystick left and right allows us to dodge shots, while pressing it down will make us close in defense. At the bottom of the screen there is a bar that indicates the possibility of throwing a special punch, and it fills up by landing hits: when it's full, just press the asterisk key to launch a devastating blow. As in any boxing game, opponents boast a different level of stamina, making them stand up even after multiple falls. In case we happen to go down, we will have to press the FIRE button not repeatedly, but only once for each count, as in a sort of ~rhythm game~, for our character to get up. This new Glu-branded title makes irony its strong point, there's no doubt, and the graphics are certainly ironic, with a very successful representation of the various politicians, each with their own set of movements. Unfortunately, things have changed very little compared to Super KO Boxing, which is a two-year-old title: the fluidity of the animations is barely acceptable, the background scenario is always the same and the general sensation is of being almost in front of an amateur product, in some cases. The sound doesn't improve matters, with awkward silence during matches and mediocre music during breaks. Nothing to say about the control system, however: the organization of the commands allows us to play with just the joystick or with the numeric keys, depending on how you feel better, and the response to the inputs is always immediate, with rare cases where the movement ~gets stuck~. PRO Very nice basic idea Good number of opponents Encounters full of depth AGAINST Graphics far from spectacular Mediocre sound Sometimes frustrating", "date": "2008-07-08", "grade": "S.V."}
