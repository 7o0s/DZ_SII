{"name": "Winter Challenge - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/winter-challenge-recensione.html", "text": "Stamina or Accuracy Once we understand what is there (actually it takes before understanding what is missing), let's go and take a closer look at it. Basically the disciplines present can be divided into two categories: those of resistance and those of precision. The former include cross-country skiing and biathlon: they require limited dexterity on the part of the player in favor of a greater strategy in dosing the athlete's efforts. The latter embrace all alpine skiing and bobsled, and on the contrary, are based almost exclusively on manual dexterity, given that the athletes must be physically ~guided~. Over the years, Cyanide has developed an excellent experience in representing endurance sports and all this baggage has been fully transported in the Winter Challenge Over the years, Cyanide has developed an excellent experience in representing endurance sports (Cycling Manager docet) and all this baggage has been fully transported in the Winter Challenge. Thanks to it, cross-country skiing and biathlon are extremely intuitive and easy to learn, with the only flaw of becoming too easy as soon as the player has gotten a little carried away with the controls. To turn, just use the side arrows, while the vertical ones allow you to increase or reduce the power of the effort applied by our skier. In the case of biathlon, the shooting section is completely entrusted to the mouse: the sight shakes more or less according to the heart rate, and with the mouse you try to bring it to the targets. So everything is very simple and predictable. Stamina or Accuracy Analogous keyboard controls are found in disciplines that require greater precision. This unfortunate choice implies that movements always take place abruptly and jerkily just when smooth and progressive movements would instead be needed. It thus becomes almost impossible to avoid scratching the bobsled against the sides of the track, and you constantly run the risk of falling over when skiing. To partially remedy this shortcoming we have the useful ~back in time~ option available which allows us to go back in time by 5 seconds in order to retrace the parts in which we have made mistakes or in which we are convinced we can better. If the movements are at least awkward and awkward, the system used to represent the choice of tempo in certain moments is very interesting, such as the start, the take-off from the trampoline and the approach of the shooting stand in biathlon. In those moments a bar with notches appears which gradually fills up: the closer to these notches you press the space bar and the better the results will be, i.e. a better start, a more powerful sprint or a greater reduction in heart rate before shooting. Unfortunately, the sequence of the notches is always the same, and a good idea soon turns into a trivial exercise in mechanical memory. [C] A typical example of how the timing system works. Change the bar but the principle is always the same, only that this bolt must be pressed when it is ready. all full. Ski jumping is a must. the only thing that is operated by the mouse. [/C] Technically speaking Winter Challenge certainly doesn't shine from a technical point of view. The graphics are outdated and often show their limitations, such as the hideous shoulder joint that makes a fine show every time the athletes raise their arms to cheer. Furthermore, the models of the skiers are all identical, and it often happens in the event of a group start in cross-country skiing and biathlon that you are no longer able to distinguish your athlete if you find yourself among others with the same color suit. The music and special effects are barely enough, and often we even forget their existence. To top it all off there are some annoying bugs ranging from the hateful crash to the desktop, to windows with the off-screen close button that forcefully forces them to close, to the indication of improvements to the characteristics of our athlete that do not reflect those that are seriously applied. There is a patch that should solve some unspecified problems (it is not said that they are these), but as soon as it was installed, Starforce no longer recognized the game code that had been provided to us as valid, therefore we are not able to confirm or not the its effectiveness. The number of tracks that you have available is very limited and consequently the number of tests to be carried out during a season, a deficiency that the possibility of trying your hand at a kind of miniature Olympics and the multiplayer option cannot compensate for. Beware Starforce! Warning: this gioco uses the now famous Starforce protection. It is now in the public domain that the latest versions of the aforementioned protection, due to a rather invasive procedure, can cause malfunctions or, worse, breakage of optical devices. Furthermore, it seems that they do not guarantee sufficient compatibility, both hardware and software, which can cause incorrect recognition of the disc, even if it is original, and therefore the failure to start the game. The manufacturer has denied, declaring that it is slander, but the affected players do not seem to be of the same opinion. So far, both developers and distributors have not yet decided to indicate the presence of this protection in the technical specifications. For this reason we, to be honest, prefer to inform you. Every decision is up to you. Final comment Winter Challenge is a budget game, despite this, however, it is really too limited. The decision to release it precisely to coincide with the Winter Olympics, instead of acting as a springboard, further highlights its limitation. And it's a shame, because with little effort a much better result could have been obtained. Almost all the disciplines excluded, in fact, have many components in common with those present. Just think of the bobsleigh: once you've made the effort to create everything from scratch for the four-man bobsled, why not apply the same mechanics to the two-man bobsled, luge and skeleton? Cross-country routines could then easily be ~recycled~ for speed skating, and the bar used for timing effectiveness would very well represent the quality of freestyle or figure skating performances. It is therefore natural to be annoyed when faced with a game like Winter Challenge which could have been much more varied and fun with little effort, and which instead is little more than a commercial operation, suitable only for those looking for an occasional, undemanding pastime that don't commit more than 10 minutes. Pros Good idea used to represent athletes' timing choices Cons Only 6 disciplines Too simple once you get the hang of it Repetitive in the long run Abrupt and imprecise keyboard controls The Parish Winter Olympics This year's Winter Olympics have had a success that at first would have been thought unthinkable. It must have been because they were held right here in Italy, or perhaps because after so many years we were finally hearing talk of a possible heir to Alberto Tomba, who was very favorite for the gold medal in the special slalom, or perhaps again because it was assumed that he already had at least three gold medals before even starting. Those of the various Giorgio Roccas, precisely, in the slalom, of the very young Kostner in figure skating, and of the Fusar Poli-Margaglio couple in figure skating in pairs, all inflated by the media and who instead ended up rigorously with their butts on the floor (my apologies , thinking about it, it seems like a ridiculous coincidence to me too, but it really happened...), so much so that in the end the medals for our national team came from those sports that TV and newspapers had least advertised, not to mention completely ignored such as speed skating, cross-country skiing and tobogganing. Cyanide has churned out a game with only 6 total disciplines, compared to the 15 that were seen in the two weeks of the Olympics Incredibly, Cyanide made the exact same mistake and churned out a game with only 4 (four) disciplines, compared to the 15 (for a total of 84 competitions) that were seen in the two weeks of the Olympics: alpine skiing, albeit with all its competitions (downhill, super giant, giant slalom and special slalom), trampoline jumping, 4-man bobsleigh and cross-country skiing. This is what is in Winter Chalenge, to which, for the record, we must add the two ~variants~ of the biathlon and the Nordic combined (for the uninitiated, it is a question of jumping from the trampoline followed by cross-country skiing), which I have deliberately called ~variants~, even if in reality they are autonomous disciplines, because they exploit the engine and graphics of the rest of the game in an almost complete way. You ask yourself: what about all the rest? Just to make a small list: - the combined (there are both downhill and special slalom and forget the combined!) - snowboarding (cross, parallel giant slalom and halfpipe) - freestyle (skis and snowboard) - the figure skating - speed skating - short track - luge (single and double) - double bobsleigh (there's the 4-man bobsled, why not the 2-man bob?) - skeleton (these are crazy to me!) - curling (a real media surprise this year) - ice hockey (which among other things awards the last medal of theWinter Olympics) Where is all this stuff? It simply isn't there, cut away by choice or lack of time or funds. Obviously, after such a prune you certainly can not expect a full game. [C] These are all disciplines present. Very little!
