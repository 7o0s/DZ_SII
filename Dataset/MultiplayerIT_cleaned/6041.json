Despite having pulled the oars in the boat with regard to most of its investments in the video game sector, Disney has instead chosen to keep the point with Disney Infinity, giving the green light to the publication of the third episode in as many years: a choice actually entirely predictable given the importance of the investment made on the franchise, the popularity of the toys to life genre and the more than appreciable sales results of the previous chapters. However, understanding how much the latter were determined by the appeal of the brands involved rather than by the real value of the title developed by Avalanche Software is more complicated: between Pixar, Pirates of the Caribbean, Marvel heroes and classic Disney characters, it is obvious that Disney Infinity has always been able to enjoy of a gigantic driving effect, even more towards a mostly adolescent and tendentially casual target. From our point of view, in fact, the first two episodes were not able to capitalize on the potential of the basic concept to the fullest, stuck between game design naivety and a general lack of that cleaning and optimization that is typical of the most valuable titles. Nonetheless, we have followed the development of Disney Infinity 3.0 with curiosity and interest, especially given the charm and value of the name chosen as the protagonist of this new release. Disney Infinity 3.0 is undoubtedly the best episode of the series, but there is still a long way to go A long time ago... As you already know very well, it is in fact the Star Wars universe, also owned by Disney since 2012 and currently in great turmoil given the upcoming release in cinemas of the highly anticipated Episode VII, subtitled The Force Awakens. Disney Infinity 3.0 is therefore positioned within the colossal marketing machine connected to the film as the only official video game destined to appear on the market: a great responsibility therefore, which the guys from Avalanche Software have well thought of sharing with a whole series of other teams involved in the development, to support in the realization of different components of the finished product. We are talking about a total of eight groups: Studio Gobo, Ninja Theory, Sumo Digital, United Front Games, Blind Squirrel, Panic Button and Heavy Iron, in an absolutely remarkable production and coordination effort. On the other hand, just look at the amount of content guaranteed by Disney Infinity 3.0 to understand how it is a mammoth job, impossible for a single team to manage by respecting the annual cadence imposed by Mickey Mouse's house: in addition to the guaranteed support for all characters and Power Discs released in the past and to those foreseen during the life cycle of this chapter we find in fact an improved and partially revised Toy Box and a series of Play Sets which include Twilight of the Republic (for Episodes I-III, in Starter Pack), Together Against the Empire (for the classic trilogy, a temporary Sony exclusive until November) and The Force Awakens (in December, simultaneously with the film) for Star Wars, together with Inside Out (at launch) for Disney and Marvel Battlegrounds (2016). Each of these worlds allows, as in the past, to access a real adventure with a minimum duration of about five hours. Simply being able to list everything gives you a headache, let alone making it piece by piece trying to make them fit together in the best way. The fact is that the estimate for the cyclopean organizational work obviously cannot be a mitigating factor in the face of the gameplay and design problems that we had identified in the past with the previous episodes, and for this reason we have analyzed with a particularly critical eye the work carried out in this occasion. Let's immediately clear the field of doubts: Disney Infinity 3.0 is still a game very far from perfection, nevertheless it is decidedly evident how the programmers have listened to the observations made in the past trying to remedy the problems, or at least to smooth out the most obvious edges. The starter pack includes two statuettes (Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano) and the miniature of The Twilight of the Republic, with the latter which, as per tradition, represents the ~key~ to access the relative adventure. The use passes through the portal, or rather the platform connected via USB necessary to allow the detection of the various toys; the peripheral is the same as in the previous episodes, in a continuity that it would have been nice to break perhaps by introducing wireless communication and thus eliminating the inconvenience of cables. Boxes and sets Where improvements are distinctly perceivedti compared to the past is right in the whole of The Twilight of the Republic, an episode placed in the timeline during the Clone War and which has Anakin, Ahsoka, Yoda and Obi-Wan as protagonists: an adventure with strong action colors and in which the combat is the master, which still manages to amuse by flowing rather pleasantly to its conclusion. The greatest merit is undoubtedly the combat system created by the Ninja Theory experts, which guarantees a certain depth through a good variety of moves and an appreciable combo system. The considerable variety of enemies - albeit still equipped with a very basic artificial intelligence - then helps to reduce the inevitable repetitiveness of the progression, which would have in any case benefited from greater brilliance in the design of the missions and levels. The exclusive abilities of the Jedi however, obviously starting from the use of the Force, expand the range of actions available by enhancing a richer and more structured skill tree than ever. Particularly valuable is the presence of four explorable planets (Coruscant, Geonosis, Tatooine and Naboo) which consequently offer as many totally different settings. To go from one planet to another you have to face space travel aboard a fighter, to be chosen from a small list of available options; Avalanche Software also wanted to give dignity to these phases by inserting secondary missions and fights between rebel and imperial ships, which prove to be welcome interludes capable of effectively breaking the habit of the ~normal~ game phases. A lot of irons in the fire therefore, in an abundance that manages at least in part to overshadow the not excessive refinement of the gameplay, with different design ingenuity and the laziness of the camera that still maintain a certain distance between the Disney Infinity offer and that of higher level games. It should also be noted that the greater complexity of this new release in the series inevitably increases the level of general difficulty of the adventure, and consequently also the minimum age for which the product is advisable. Technically, the inevitable need to continue to support older generation consoles has forced us to maintain a cross-gen graphics engine which certainly does not fully exploit the potential of more modern hardware: despite this, the version we tested on PlayStation 4 has brought with it a clear improvement compared to last year's chapter, especially as regards the variety of settings. The depressing and bare Manhattan of version 2.0 in fact leaves room for planets reproduced with good care and attention, and even capable of offering remarkable glimpses thanks above all to the amount of elements on the screen and the good use of lighting. Let me be clear, the polygonal complexity is never remarkable, but also considering the cartoon style that is the leitmotif of the entire Disney Infinity experience, all in all, one cannot complain too much. Of course, there is a noticeable gap between the excellent non-playable interlude scenes and the gameplay sections, but in general the effort of the programmers in an attempt to convey the atmosphere of the film saga is evident and largely successful. The weakest component of Disney Infinity 3.0, from our point of view, remains the Toy Box that has always been proposed by the publisher as the spearhead of the entire experience. For the uninitiated, it is basically an editor that offers the possibility of creating settings or interiors from scratch by drawing on a whole series of ~pieces~ from the various Disney brands represented throughout the series. Special tools then allow you to add playful elements, creating real missions or short adventures also going to represent different genres such as racing, platform, puzzle or shooter. An interesting idea that again this year clashes with the enormous awkwardness of the interface, anchored to a very inaccessible management of menus and sub-menus. The gigantic amount of content and the weakness of the tutorials then make the approach for a novice often overwhelming, requiring a dose of commitment and patience destined to cut out a good portion of the potential user. Certainly you can limit yourself to ~exploiting~ the creations of the community by playing within levels created by users scattered all over the world, but the average quality of the contents is rather questionable, and in any case light years away from that of the official Play Sets.", "date": "2015-09-14", "grade": "7.8"}
