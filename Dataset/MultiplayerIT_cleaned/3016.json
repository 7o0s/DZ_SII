Of course, if to date, you have not yet played one of the most particular titles of the decade, it is definitely time to change your mind. When Atlus, still independent, released Catherine on old-gen in 2011, it became clear how much the P-studio, the Persona team, wanted to have its say in a generational context that was not simple. Persona 5 would have been released 5 years later and a few years had already passed since Persona 4; it was obvious that an eccentric and crazy visionary like Katsura Hashino was preparing one of his most elegant and irreverent titles to please the Japanese lovers of that time, unfortunately not pampered by Japanese publishers. 9 years later, Atlus and SEGA close the circle by also bringing to Switch that Catherine: Full Body which already delighted old and newcomers a year ago, thanks to a new character and many small additions to the menu that threw it back into the spotlight . What does it mean today to unplug it from the dock and carry it around? Extremes touching Catherine is a sublime game, always has been. Moreover, it was released over the years in the name of an island, the Japanese one, at the time left out of the great media and opinion games, the victim of unfortunate times dominated by a questionable but false pro-Western videogame thought. They were years the result of a transition to high definition that was maturing but had already done irreparable damage to the foundations of the medium, in which it seemed that if a title came from Japan it was minor regardless because it did not have the graphic refinement of a Hollywood pseudo-film . Today we can afford to look at such an authorial product with more relaxation because on the one hand SEGA has put Atlus in more solid financial conditions, on the other the P-studio is on top of half the world's esteem for that incredible title that bears the name of Persona 5. Do we want to say that Persona 5 was born from Catherine? Come on, let's go on this journey of opinion which is actually more detailed than you think. Catherine represents the missing link between the path started by Hashino with Persona 3, a work of rejuvenation and relaunch of the brand, continued with Persona 4 and ultimately matured with Catherine, a delightful expression of a development approach based on a gameplay dichotomy - storytelling taken to the extreme. Vincent's story, on Switch like previous platforms, is a raw fairy tale of our times but perhaps always belonging to our humanity, a parable of the man-woman relationship, of the obsessive search for professional affirmation, of sensuality and perverse temptation, much freer today than in the past to come out, to be accepted. Narrative, dubbing, soundtrack by the ubiquitous Shogi Meguro and cel-shaded stylistic frame caress flashes of playful genius, which is paired with surreal characters, but not too much, and love triangle situations (now square with the new added character). Hanging out with Vincent The truth is that Catherine Full Body is a product to be enjoyed with a good wine in the narrative parts and with a sedative in those frantic climbs of the towers. Catherine perfectly conveys Hashino's end of the situational sphere and Studio Zero has done a great job of porting it to Switch. stable framerate, acceptable resolution, absolutely watchable textures and very little aliasing in portable mode, while a step above in docked mode, which loses the resolution challenge with the competition but keeps the playability value and response to the commands intact. The additions already present a year ago remain unchanged and it is nice to experience Catherine on the sofa as well as on the bed, even if this time we do not consider it a travel or park bench title, therefore that of Switch is an exceptional added value but according to the writer not free to fully express the audiovisual potential of the product. Catherine's first situations flow away with enormous pleasure but it must be said that the heat of these days is not a panacea for playing the title on the move, given that the internal dissipation struggles quite a bit to keep the console cool, a sign that the title requires however non-trivial resources to run on the small kyotense console. Therefore, a dispassionate advice remains: it is good to carry it around but it is very good not to do it and enjoy this marvel on the screen and a good audio system, so you do not heat your fingertips further and you can climb the levels with a nice Pro Controller. Come on, help Vincent reach one of 13 different endings.", "date": "2020-07-03", "grade": "8.5"}
