The contrast between two opposing elements has always been one of the aspects that has fascinated man the most, and it is certainly not the first time that this ancestral contrast has also been used in the world of video games. The latest example is this Pixeljunk Shooter, the fourth chapter of the series created by Q-Games which after Monsters, Racers and Eden returns to PSN with yet another excellent quality product. When I grow up I will be a firefighter Although the title and a cursory glance at the images may suggest that we are dealing with a shot'em up with a ship inspired by the arcades of the 80s, in reality Pixeljunk Shooter is a product that mixes different genres in a rather original and certainly d 'effect. The player takes control of a ship to be maneuvered using the two analog sticks, one dedicated to the direction of movement and the other to the rotation of the ~bow~. The basic objective is to be able to recover all the miners scattered within the levels through a practical retractable pliers, which can also be used to collect precious diamonds and interact with some objects. Each level is divided into five sections; to access the next one, initially closed by a massive electronic door, it is essential to bring the poor workers back on board safely. To be able to track them down, it is essential to carefully explore every corner of the stages, often with the help of cries for help coming from their temporary shelters; the exploratory phase therefore constitutes a fundamental element in Pixeljunk Shooter, in which the user is stimulated to meticulous research both by the presence of secret caves often full of extra bonuses, and by the invulnerability of the spacecraft to impacts against rock walls. But the real turning point within the mechanics of the game is certainly linked to the coexistence of elements to combine with each other, an aspect on which the puzzles present in each level are based and which stimulate the user to continuous and exciting experimentation. In the first world, for example, incandescent lava and water are the masters; the shuttle can freely sink into the liquid without any problems, but on the contrary the proximity to the magma causes an increase in temperature which can soon be fatal. So how to overcome, for example, an entire expanse of lava placed right in front of your road? Simple: just bring it into contact with water, perhaps by destroying the banks of a nearby lake, to see it solidify and then disappear under the blows of the weapons supplied. Enhanced by the fluid physics applied by the programmers in an excellent way, this operation therefore becomes a sort of fascinating and irresistible ~game within a game~, which recalls the spirit of experimentation and discovery of when we were children. Miners, I save you! Fortunately, the Q-Games designers have had the ability to keep the interest high and constant by inserting new aspects and playful solutions during the progression as one enters the 3 worlds that make up the product. Then flammable gases come into play, ice that solidifies the water, possibly to be melted again with lava... and so on. The battles with the final bosses are also absolutely brilliant, epic and often reinforced by ingenious gameplay insights. All this is also supported by a high-class graphic component, strong in a very personal characterization and an impeccable use of colour. The main, if not the only flaw of Pixeljunk Shooter is therefore, as often happens with titles distributed via digital channels, brevity; the 3 worlds can be completed in a few total hours, and the local two-player mode does not change the cards on the table much, as do the online rankings. The greatest incentives come rather from the desire to repeat the levels to obtain 100%, a slightly more demanding undertaking and capable of significantly lengthening the overall longevity. Probably, as per tradition for the Pixeljunk series, however, there will be a future expansion destined to add a few more levels to the initial package.", "date": "2010-01-05", "grade": "9.0"}
