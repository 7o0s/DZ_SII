{"name": "Pirates - The Legend of Black Kat", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pirates-the-legend-of-black-kat.html", "text": "History Sailing, looting, fighting, in short Katarina de Leon was made to be a PIRATE. The adventure that will lead her to 5 different lands and against hordes that want to kill her will only show her the way to her destiny (I hope even more, a treasure never hurts:-)) Katarina is one of the most beautiful women who have ever sailed the seas, but besides being a pretty face, our female pirate is also independent and has sea water in her veins Perhaps the thing that haunts her even more than the sea is the mysterious death of her mother, who died when Katarina was still a few years old Katarina was then cared for by her father, but what she didn't know was that she had inherited her mother's adventurous spirit, who had founded the legendary gang of Skull Cove, who ruled over the seven seas, however, the location of the treasure they had accumulated was only known by Mara (katarina's mother), who took this secret to the grave without ever revealing it to anyone (now that there is a treasure involved, the story gets interesting). Katarina decided to embark on this new adventure, to find her way, to fulfill her destiny and to avenge her father, killed by Captain Hawke Technically speaking And here the first painful notes. Although the ship sections are quite well done, with well-crafted water and rather rich and convincing polygonal models, the same cannot be said of the section on foot. Poorly detailed characters (albeit very many and very varied), with a very limited range of movements and very bare settings in general (some plants are two-dimensional! ) ruin otherwise rather evocative settings. Normal music and effects. Problems Almost immediately, however, you will notice the presence of gross errors in the game play that heavily undermine the judgment on an otherwise vast and innovative game. Among the very first missions you will realize, for example, that you have to free your father's fort. Now, explain to me why you have to cannonade it about ten times, counting that the loading time of the cannons is about a minute. There's no difficulty: just fire, wait for it to reload, and fire again! Why ? It would have been enough to make a less resistant bastion and the game would have gone away more fluid! Well, things like this will happen quite frequently in the game. You ran out of money but you need to repair the ship? Land on any island, kill some crabs, take the money and repeat endlessly. The main flaw of Pirates is in fact precisely this: it is rather dispersive, vague, sometimes frustrating. A wasted opportunity Too bad, because with a more convincing technical realization and a little more play testing it could have become a really good game. As it is, I recommend it only to enthusiasts and Lara-maniacs looking for an alternative. Pros: Interesting ideas It's the only one of its kind on Xbox The adventure takes place both on land and sea Cons: Dispersive graphics Sometimes frustrating Materials: Preview Movie (10.19 MB) Tips Set Sail Third-person action-adventure was one of the still unexplored genres in the x-box landscape. Now things are about to change thanks to Kat, the Lara Croft of the seven seas. After a quick intro in which your daddy is brutally murdered and you discover that your sweet mommy was actually a ferocious pirate, you decide to follow in his footsteps and avenge your father's death. And so, you will set sail. And here one of the most significant innovative elements of the game immediately catches the eye: Pirates in fact alternates sections on foot and sections on the boat, thus helping to vary the action. Naturally, the sea will soon prove to be crowded with other ships that will not prove exactly friendly towards you. It will be up to you to try to sink them by alternating spurs and cannon shots while avoiding their attacks. Your ship will then, over time, be upgraded with additional cannons, more crew.... Driving the ship will be simple and intuitive, as well as quite fun. Then you will land on the ground, and here the action will take place in the simplest of the tomb raider games: explore, find the key, open the chest, kill the monster. Nice variation on the theme, the fact that certain speakers are not immediately visible, but as you get closer to them the pad will begin to vibrate all the moretensely the closer you are (water, water, fire...). Friendly! . The controls are simple to master as well as the combat, rather simplistic. The game is very vast and there will be many islands to explore, with frequent changes of scenery (sand, ice...)", "date": "2002-04-22", "grade": null}
