{"name": "Aaaaarr!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/94011-rage-aaaaarr.html", "text": "Version tested: Xbox 360id Software is one of the very few software houses that has managed to survive the gaming upheavals that have swept through our industry over the past two decades. Founded in 1991, exactly twenty years ago, the company of John Carmack and partners has been able to revolutionize the genre that is probably experiencing its golden age today, especially from the point of view of sales. Thanks to three franchises known even to those who have not played them at the time, the Texan company has been able to carve out its own vital space that no event has ever managed to limit or jeopardize, despite the fact that this generation has not seen id Software among the its protagonists. It took the loss of independence, with the acquisition by ZeniMax Media, a company that also controls Bethesda Softworks, to forcefully move the waters and give the final push to the most ambitious project born of the golden couple John Carmack and Tim Willits. And so after Wolfenstein, DooM and Quake, it's the turn of RAGE and its enormous load of expectations that it carries on its shoulders. A story... do you feel the need for it? Let's start with one of the three elements that best highlight id Software's desire to break with the past: the central presence, at least on paper, of a narrative arc. In fact, RAGE opens with an unoriginal but at the same time quite interesting incipit. In the near future humanity realizes that the asteroid Apophis will hit the earth within a decade causing a huge climate cataclysm and jeopardizing the survival of mankind. An international team of scientists then sets up the Eden project with the aim of creating thousands of arks where to lock up and protect the most deserving exponents of humanity thanks to assessments of genetic traits and attitudes. These people will be put to sleep through a hibernation procedure that exploits nanotrite technology, special cells created by man capable of managing neural impulses and vital functions, to then be awakened a few years after the impact with the goal to colonize the Earth and recreate civilization. Obviously something doesn't work properly and the protagonist awakens, as the only survivor of his ark, in a world populated by mutants of unknown origins and by a few handfuls of men organized into clans and factions, some of which are not particularly friendly. Through the long journey that will lead us to discover something more (little) of our past and different elements (many) of the new inhabited world, we will meet two large fortified cities and we will slam our tough face against the Authority, a militarized and advanced technology that is trying to crush the last pockets of organized resistance with an iron fist. And guess what side we'll take? Unfortunately, however, the plot always remains rather sketchy, thanks to the total absence of interlude sequences or narrative moments capable of carrying on the story which instead remains completely linked to the numerous dialogues with the various non-player characters present in the world. Dialogues, however, almost always focused on concrete things to do to complete the various missions and always rather devoid of historical elements. In short, id Software has respected its sad custom by offering the player the bare minimum to give a logical thread to what happens on the screen and the credibility of the entire game world with its multiple scenarios, its variegated inhabitants and the unstable balance of power it remains only potentially, relegated to a background that is unlikely to arouse emotions in the player. And unfortunately all this is strongly perceived especially starting from the second half of the game, when the novelties of the gameplay have run out and the narrative stimulus should be to push the player to continue. You don't get out of breath to see the rambling and really unsatisfactory epilogue, but the 14-18 hours needed to complete the campaign in one of the four difficulty levels available would certainly have been more engaging with a noteworthy plot . Xbox 360 goals The game offers 50 achievements for the usual total of 1000 points. At least half are dedicated to the various killings of enemies using the paraphernalia available and above all the built gadgets. While there are a dozen achievements related to the various collectibles and the completion of all the mini-games in the title. Then there are the objectives related to the completion of the single player campaign and the driving component and the circle closes with a mega goal of 75 points for those who reach 100Game completion %. On our first pass, we collected just under half of the achievements. But when you shoot ... how wonderful! RAGE has been seen and heard a lot in recent years and many still today wonder about its gameplay. The id Software title is in all respects an extremely classic first-person shooter that combines the exploration of levels focused on indoor scenarios with the navigation of a large-sized outdoor hub, the devastated area, where it is possible to wander around on board vehicles to reach the aforementioned environments. The FPS component is however absolutely predominant and relies on a varied and successful level design that manages to properly characterize the various dens and destroyed remains of civilizations that our protagonist will have to cross sometimes even several times to solve his missions without ever running the risk of falling into excessive backtracking. The missions highlight the second element of breaking with the tradition of the software house and act as a forerunner to a hybrid gameplay that also offers a minimum of role-playing experience. In fact, within the friendly cities, we will be able to collect a whole series of quests that will make the exploration of the various levels indispensable and will allow us to earn money but above all components. In the style of what was seen in BioShock, RAGE pushes the player to do a real scavenger job by continuously collecting objects scattered around the scenarios and looting the bodies of enemies. In this way it will be possible to stock up on ammunition but above all the activity will be essential to build a whole series of secondary gadgets and advanced projectiles through a system of schemes or recipes that we can buy from various NPCs or earn from completing quests. The system manages to stimulate the player to manic exploration of the game environments and at the same time regulates a market economy where we will really have to sweat out the best upgrades. We only feel like moving a note to the looting system which turns out to be too precise in targeting: we will always have to aim with great precision at the object to be collected: in practice there is no area interaction but only an automatism that leads to collecting with a single press of the button also the objects bordering on the selected one and this partially slows down the fluidity of the action. However, there is no experience system, nor is it possible to gain levels and the role-playing component in addition to quests and crafting is extended to the inventory alone that allows you to manage the eight weapons that we will collect during the game, the numerous ammunition that allow us to make them work by often altering their characteristics as if it were a real alternative fire and obviously the various gadgets. So if on the one hand we will be able to equip electric bullets capable of getting the better of armored enemies, darts for mind control or explosive buckshot for the shotgun, on the other we will be able to use grenades, the famous and sharp boomerang wingstick, radio-controlled explosive machines , guard turrets and small mechanical sentries that will give us a hand during the most chaotic fights. And then there are the bandages. RAGE in fact if on the one hand it offers the classic automatic recharge of energy while remaining sheltered after being hit, on the other it tends to ~stress~ the player with sometimes very intense fights where the possibility of dying is really around the corner. To avoid this eventuality it is possible to use the bandages on the fly to make the classic ~red effect~ disappear but if you really lose your life, no problem, since the game allows you to resurrect on the fly and stun all nearby enemies through a mini-game that simulates the defibrillation of the protagonist's heart. This extreme option which is available at most twice and is subject to a long cooldown, also tends to counterbalance an overly rudimentary checkpoint system. In fact, the game automatically saves only at the beginning of a level or in some very advanced sections of the same and everything is left in the player's hands through the classic manual saving. Needless to point out how often we have forgotten to record our progress and then sensationally end up on the ground with the defibrillator discharged and with the need to start over. We are not able to understand this choice by id Software which, if on PC, can also be accepted, for a console audience so accustomed to automatisms it is certainly anachronistic. All (together) aboard! And thus we come to the third and final element of break with the typical deg gameplayid Software's shooters: the driving component that intersects perfectly with the action of RAGE. In fact, the title offers the dual possibility of boarding a vehicle to explore the devastated area, the large hub that serves as a connection point with the various levels, or to face a series of races through the appropriate NPCs present in the friendly cities. By doing so we will be able to earn the so-called race certificates, a sort of currency used to buy upgrades for our racing cars: we go from faster engines to longer lasting turbos, to get to tires and suspensions. Too bad, however, that the selection is extremely limited (there is only one upgrade per component) and the change of vehicle class (there are four in all) is relegated to the progress of the campaign. The weapons are also minimal and range between a machine gun (later in a pulse-enhanced version) and a rocket launcher and some secondary gadgets such as shields, repairers and mines. The game modes in the racing component are few and range from the classic race against three other vehicles or timed solo, to some melees with armed cars. Also in this case, as for the story, in short, it seems that id Software has gone ~saving~ by offering only the bare minimum to make this particular section of the game attractive which then, paradoxically once you are on the track, also works quite well thanks to a highly arcade-like driving system with light physics and classic shoot and run action that PlayStation 3 players will tend to approach what was seen in Motorstorm. Things are slightly better when roaming freely around the wasteland, thanks to the streaming loading of the entire area which helps to offer an excellent incentive to continuously explore the area by blowing up the raiders encountered on the path between one level and the next one. We conclude the paragraph also talking about the multiplayer offer of RAGE. On the one hand we have an interesting cooperative section with nine missions that act as a prelude to some events told later in the single player campaign and can be tackled in the company of a friend, even in split screen and with two difficulty levels. On the other hand, we have a decidedly light and borderline competitive component entirely focused on vehicles. Yes, that's right, there isn't any kind of competitive multiplayer dedicated to the FPS component of the game. There are six maps available for the four game modes, all of which offer support for up to four players. We therefore find Meteor Series where it will be necessary to collect the fallen fragments of asteroid to bring them to one's base, the so-called Checkpoint Rally where the winner is whoever touches the highest number of goals and its Triad variant where the point is obtained only by touching three checkpoints in a row and finally the Carnage, a sort of free for all deathmatch obviously always dedicated to vehicles. By facing the challenges you earn the classic levels that are used to unlock the various upgrades of both armor and equipment of the vehicle and the paraphernalia. The coolest thing RAGE arrives like a bolt from the blue as soon as Xbox 360 finishes loading to start all that goodness on screen. The game astounds for its incredible fluidity: it always runs strictly at 60 frames per second and never suffers from any slowdown for the entire single player adventure. As mentioned above, the entire wasteland map is loaded in streaming and the game only stops at the entrance to a level or a friendly city. Wandering around in the vehicle admiring the change of light and scenery completely in real time is stunning, and it is something that is very rarely seen on consoles. The counterpart of such beauty is a practically omnipresent pop-in effect of loading the textures on the polygons and which is only slightly dampened by the installation of the game on the hard disk. A huge applause for what concerns the models of the NPCs, the various mutants and enemies in general. Even if there is a certain lack in terms of variety (not infrequently we will see duplicate character models even within the same city), the quality of the details, their animations and the great facial expressiveness leave you speechless. As if that wasn't bad enough, id Software has managed to do a very unique job with the artificial intelligence and routines that handle opponents. In fact, the soldiers of the various clans and of the Authority tend to behave in a rather classic way, alternating the use of covers with the throwing of grenades and the tactical approach when sheltered by shields or by particularly comrades.", "date": "2011-10-04", "grade": "8.9"}
