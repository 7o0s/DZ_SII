After all these years, launch Gran Turismo 7 is like coming home after a long journey. For those who have lived the series since its origins, the effect is truly extraordinary, and it's not just our nostalgia: the game does it on purpose, emphasizes the historical importance of the matter, and teleports you ten, fifteen, twenty-five years ago. depending on when you first encountered Gran Turismo. It is a blast from the past, but made up of the most advanced technology. Newcomers, the youngest, don't despair: Gran Turismo 7 thinks of you too, not to mention above all of you. Polyphony Digital has created a perfect introductory product, able to introduce even the less experienced to the world of motoring with extreme effectiveness. A few hours after the expiry of the embargo, Sony has published an important corrective patch (version 1.04) which concerns numerous aspects in the balance and in the experience. We tested the game both before and after the update and the impressions below take into account the changes introduced. The return of career Gran Turismo 7: the new map is clear and functional, as well as very beautiful Like its illustrious predecessors, Gran Turismo 7 revolves around a main map that brings together all the content offered by the game on a single screen. It is a splendid corner of the world, an imaginary world where you can breathe together Asian, Mediterranean and American scents, and at the center of this perfect postcard, in the greenery of a docile European forest, stands a renowned and elegant caf, as well as the heart of the new career mode of Gran Turismo 7. It is not a simple screen: like every function of GT7, the room is perfectly rendered and outside it it is possible to see the car that we will be using at that moment, parked in the shade of the tall trees trunk swaying wearily in the wind. The lighting also changes, and sometimes we will be able to enjoy the same atmosphere even on what seem like warm summer evenings, colored by elegant external lights and scented with leather seats and Tuscan cigars. Gran Turismo 7 is also this: there is very little engine oil on the menu, when you are away from the track you are a wealthy amateur who talks to professionals and legends of the sector, possibly sipping Chardonnay from the best vintage. On the track, things change, but not in the way you would think. Gran Turismo 7 does not try to make you feel like a driver, for once this deception is not used as the status of the series is now so consolidated that it no longer needs it. In Gran Turismo 7 you really are a Gran Turismo player, grappling with the Gran Turismo campaign. Before many races, or while we try to get the different licenses that will allow us to race at higher levels, we will often interface with international and local GT Sport champions, real people with a name, a surname, a face and often good advice. Would you like a GT Caf? Gran Turismo 7: in the distance the lack of detail is felt, but a great job has been done on the side of the track Through the Gran Turismo Caf we will have access to more than ninety literally  la carte races, divided between single events and championships, which will alternate from time to time with simple requests dedicated to the new functions that will be unlocked, such as taking a photo in the Scapes or changing the oil in your car for the first time. The races proposed by the Caf will populate what is represented on the map as a sort of Colosseum, where you will find all the circuits of the game and related competitions, including new ones. Amazon offer Gran Turismo 7 - Standard Edition - PlayStation 4 70.99 See Offer Usually, if it's not a championship, the challenge is made up of three single races that will allow us to unlock as many themed cars, starting with the compact Japanese cars, continuing with the European hot hatch, then it's the turn of three Different Camaros and so on, slowly climbing in class and speed. When we have collected the three cars, these will be described to us in detail and through historical notes by the expert on duty, usually a figure linked to the automotive industry. Even the cars with which we will visit the Caf will be able to attract the attention of the local's expert clientele, such as Chris who has just told us about the precious heritage of the new Mustang. Gradual map Gran Turismo 7: The rain varies in intensity and forms more and more pools of waterthey are large and dangerous The growth process is very gradual. After the first victories we will finally be able to access the dealership reserved for new cars, as well as the one dedicated to used cars (but no less precious and rare!), and subsequently the first sport modifications will be unlocked which will give us access to control units, mufflers, filters and better performing brakes, in addition to the different sets of tyres. It will take a few hours before accessing more intriguing mechanical parts, and greater dedication to unlock the extreme tuning that allows you to add nitro, implement four-wheel steering, or simply buy a new engine or bodywork. These parts are necessary because, like in reality, certain changes will be permanent, and over the course of the game we may need or simply want the same car but in a different category, or built around another type of speed and balance. Driving license and booklet A few more victories and GT Auto will also appear on the map, a workshop overlooking the sea where you can do maintenance on the cars and customize their bodywork, a process that with the same editor we can also apply to our driver's overalls and helmet. Soon the challenges of the Caf, or the new races that will have sprung up between the World Circuits, will begin to require the achievement of certain licenses, which are also inevitable in this Gran Turismo and are increasingly better conceived, explained and rewarded. Continuing to play and amassing cars in the garage will also unlock the mission mode: six different settings that will be the backdrop for challenges already seen in the past but no less fun, such as overcoming a pre-established number of cars before the finish line, trailing an opponent for enough seconds and other races, which never hurt. No uploads Gran Turismo 7: ray tracing can only be activated in sequences in which we will not directly drive the car Slowly, but racing ever faster, Gran Turismo fills up with things to do. You could play for an hour without hitting the track once, just working on calibrating the car, changing the oil, visiting the used dealership to see if there's anything new and valuable. It's also extraordinary just to load it to let the Scapes images go automatically, which will insert our polygonal cars on real scenarios as Gran Turismo itself has already done several times, but with decidedly superior results. Then everything is super fast, colored by a soundtrack made up of an insane number of pieces: choose what you want to do and you will do it in a few seconds. AI still weak? Gran Turismo 7: among the changes that can be made also the enlargement of the bodywork and the possibility of embossing stickers on the windows Without even considering the essential online modes, which we hadn't unlocked yet, so far Gran Turismo 7 was really exciting us, to the point of starting to talk about it as the probable perfect Gran Turismo. Too bad that once again we find ourselves faced with rather bizarre design choices, which perhaps will not harm all game buyers in the same way, but which really hurt in a product that had all the credentials to satisfy our every need . Each race has specific characteristics and rules, and is marked with a value that indicates the average power of the cars that will participate, in order to let the user understand how many chances he has of winning after his driving skills. The problem is that the average value is useful, but a maximum value would also be needed, to avoid making us take to the track with a racing car that reduces every opponent to ashes after just one lap. Hot Chili! Gran Turismo 7: Sport mode is practically the end game of GT7, and where the game gives its best It's true that this is a common problem with all classic Gran Turismos and that upgrading a car too much can also make it very difficult to keep on track, but why not scale the AI cars in order to close the gap with the player? Or precisely put a limit, which is what happens in the Sport mode of Gran Turismo 7, where among other things there are also various penalties that are completely absent here, and which discourage the user from throwing opponents off the track, or cutting the curves. To overcome this limitation, the game introduces Hot Chili races with more stringent rules and a more aggressive AI, but they are a minority; Wouldn't it have been better to create a specific difficulty? To this we must add an initial selection of the difficulty that does not seem to have any impact on the gameplay of the career. To make matters worse, this need to constantly gift new cars to the player, thankfully not like this e.gtrembles as in other games, thinking of doing him a favor but in fact ruining the pleasure of sweating it all the way. Final straight Gran Turismo 7: Musical Rally is a new mode designed for casual and unpretentious games This does not mean that there is not an element of challenge, despite everything the progression remains extremely pleasant thanks to a rather basic AI but which has undeniably made progress. But that's not enough, especially in light of virtually no up or down scaling. During the career it is not possible to change practically nothing of the difficulty, except by choosing a customized race where, however, some options, such as those relating to mechanical damage, do not provide any feedback to the pilots. We have no problem giving up aesthetic damage, we understand the many reasons for their absence and we can easily make a scratched side suffice, but mechanical damage cannot be missing, especially if they exist as an option but once activated they don't seem to lead to anything radical . In the career, things will start to get really challenging towards the end, when the game has already entered the final straight. GT Sports Gran Turismo 7: even in tuning we will have to wait before we can get our hands on the most extreme modifications You will find real competitions once again in the Sport mode, which in Gran Turismo 7 is in fact the endgame of the game. This is where the Polyphony Digital game comes alive, transmitting the strongest emotions, pushing for the most precise tuning and when you're in the lead it makes your heart pump beyond the guard limits. When you enter Sport, you understand that the career up to that moment has been nothing more than training, a long journey to get to compete online and at high levels. Once your career is over, Sport will also become the only real source of credits, provided you don't want to buy them through very classic microtransactions. If you are looking for a more casual approach, there is always the classic multiplayer, very well organized with its dynamic lobbies and full of options. They are unexpected slips that do not allow Gran Turismo 7 to shine as it should and deserves. Wheels on the rain. Gran Turismo 7: driving, this new GT amazes from the first lap In terms of handling, the game has made great strides in aerodynamics, in the distribution of the car's weight, in eliminating the unnatural slipperiness present in GT Sport, in differentiating each single car in order to guarantee it mechanical but also character characteristics. Behind the wheel, Gran Turismo 7 is truly the best Gran Turismo possible also thanks to the weather conditions that finally live up to expectations. The rain is really well done, and it's fantastic to understand the intensity in the behavior of the car, in the noise and vibrations of the DualSense, divinely exploited and with very high definition effects. Even the wind changes the scene, with clouds of dust or tires that will slowly thin out towards the direction in which it blows. However, GT7 does not seem to take into consideration any dirt on the track, clearly visible graphically but not dynamic, unable to influence both the vibrations and the driving model. Showcase on tyres Gran Turismo 7: racing until nightfall, is there anything better? Graphically, Gran Turismo 7 has improved dramatically since the very first trailers. The cars are impeccably crafted as always, clearly the best around, and a great job has been done trackside, with lots of moving elements and more than a good amount of general detail. The game saves on the horizon, even if sometimes this horizon gets particularly close, with some macro details that are unacceptable in a game that is so well-finished and elegant. Even the clouds, despite being generated through mathematics and real atmospheric data, are not totally convincing, but the glance is always guaranteed and where it really counts, Gran Turismo 7 is pure entertainment. Ray tracing is an extra that could not be renounced in a game focused on very shiny bodies, but in order not to damage the gameplay this will only be activated in all those moments and modes in which we will not be directly driving, therefore in replays and cuts -scenes, as well as in the seconds and in the shots that anticipate the departures of each race. The detachment can be seen graphically, but most of the time especially in the framerate.", "date": "2022-03-02", "grade": "8.7"}
