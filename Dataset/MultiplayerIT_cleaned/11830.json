{"name": "Cosmic Family - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/cosmic-family-recensione.html", "text": "The game features all the members of the Cosmic Family as protagonists, a funny little family made up of Mom, Dad, Elder Sister, two Little Brothers as well as a dog, cat and various little monsters. To guide us in the game there is a very nice yellow elephant with pink polka dots - is he the brother of the polka dot zebra? - while the ~bad~ part is represented by the Sausage Monster. This is really a huge purple sausage - wait for the Nas to catch you! - which in some way recalls Jacovitti and which appears when something is wrong. The charisma of the characters fluctuates and everyone definitely knows they have already seen it, but they do their job and in the eyes of a child they should also be nice. You can immediately choose whether to take on a rich adventure or directly choose one of the twenty mini-games. The main modality takes place in the various rooms of the Cosmic Family rocket - which is so called precisely because it lives and navigates in space - from the living room with kitchen to the ~basement~ passing through bathrooms and bedrooms. These locations all have a number of active on-screen elements that come to life when you aim with the Wiimote. You can indulge yourself by pointing them and activating them all with the A button or follow the vocal instructions provided by the Elephant. The pachyderm, in fact, indicates to the child, more or less covertly, what to choose to win a petal. The aim is to fill colored flowers that allow us, completed, to reach the next floor. Animated objects lead us to a series of small videos, entertainment, skits or mini-games, without apparent logic but with a pleasant and varied result. The games are therefore not, in fact, the focus of the game being heavily supported by everything else. However they represent the most interactive part and are practically all based on the pointing system of the remote control. Most likely shrugs or sudden movements were considered inappropriate, perhaps unfairly, for a title intended for children. As a matter of practice, they range from the simplest ones, such as putting together a puzzle, to the more complex ones that make, for example, choosing, washing, mending or cleaning socks and shoes for funny characters You have to put together a dress, furnish a house as requested or simply look at photographs or how the doctor reacts to the appearance of pets and the like. All obviously of a disarming simplicity! Don't think you'll be able to be attracted to or passionate about this title if you're already halfway through elementary school! An applause must certainly be made to the excellent dubbing in Italian. The elephant's voice is already known to anyone who watches TV as it is provided by the voice actor of many children's programs. The professional worked really well and will not fail to shout ~you are a champion, you are a champion!!!~ when the child manages to complete a mission. All clues, requests and explanations are also in excellent Italian and very well interpreted with only some sporadic and annoying repetition. There is also a nice female voice which is also prodigal in variety and well characterized. Technically the title is extremely colorful, well designed and varied even if it almost seems that the scales have been placed on the characters to make them more ~Mobile~. The effect is not pleasant and clashes a bit with the cartoony look. How some parts that seem to be at very low resolutions or afflicted with hypercompression are out of tune. Everything is clear and simple. An ~adult~ finishes it in a couple of hours without stimuli, a child could even waste some more time, going to look for all the skits and repeating the nicest ones, or having fun coloring the characters in a simplistic ~Paint~ or create skits with the figurines. It all ends here. Cosmic Family is a children's game that rightly does nothing to please adults and that is a well-maintained and well-packaged product. It can certainly be a nice diversion to spend an afternoon with the children during the cold winter or in the evening when dad is late and dinner is already ready... Certainly it is not even to be taken into consideration if you already have only a few more years to understand a Wario and the like. Pros Excellent dubbing in Italian Colorful and nice Technical realization good or adequate Cons Suitable only and only for the little ones Some questionable stylistic choices Cosmic Family is available for Nintendo Wii To understand this title, you have to venture into an age where you are already old enough to play football, but not old enough not to cry, calling your mother, when you fall and scrape your knee. Titles for such young children, the packaging reports an optimisticfrom three to seven years old, they have always existed, perhaps falling under the great genre defined as ~edutainment~. In this case we could eliminate the suffix ~edu~ and see it just like a real video game designed for the little ones. After seven years, however, the title offers absolutely nothing. It is therefore useless for those who do not have kindergarten-age children or grandchildren to whom to give a gift if there is a Wii in the house. Undoubtedly this is the result of the new course of Nintendo consoles - only partially and we all know it - towards casual and large numbers, and it is useless to point out that without the Wii remote it would not have been so accessible for children.", "date": "2007-11-15", "grade": null}
