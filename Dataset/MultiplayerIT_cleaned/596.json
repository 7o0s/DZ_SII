Furthermore, the game takes biblical times to calculate the movements of the other characters on the map (on an Athlon64 3200+ with 1GB of RAM, which may not be lightning, but it is not a mule-drawn cart either). Even the simplest battles end up lasting hours due to the time you have to wait for everyone to act: you pass for enemies and allies, but twiddling your thumbs for tens of seconds waiting for a civilian to decide to stand still and do nothing is really frustrating! The AI itself is also very weak. The aforementioned civilians who stand still and wait for who knows what, our allies who shoot each other with disarming ease, or throw themselves into attacks that are at least questionable (not to mention completely insane), and the same enemies who manage to win only thanks to sheer numerical strength or an all too favorable initial positioning. In fact, it often happens that to compensate for an AI that is not at all brilliant, the developers make us find ourselves at the beginning of the mission completely surrounded by enemies and in a very desperate situation. The result obtained is a game on the edge of unplayability, which forces the player to save continuously and to have to try again dozens and dozens of times every smallest step to grope the right combination of actions or hoping for an astral conjuncture fortuitous. A way to increase longevity, otherwise scarce, decidedly underappreciated. Final comment The idea behind Hammer & Sickle is undoubtedly valid, what is wrong is the way it has been put into practice. Long story short: there is not a single aspect of the game that achieves any semblance of sufficiency. Slow, short, frustrating, monotonous, outdated: a few tens of minutes of play are enough to incinerate all the good expectations of the eve. A real shame, because an excellent opportunity was thrown away. Pros Cool idea Cons Poor execution in all areas Great intentions Hammer & Sickle is set in 1949, at the beginning of the Cold War, when it was enough to drop a pin in the wrong place to start a new world war, and we will play a Russian spy with orders to infiltrate Federal Germany under the control of allies and, in fact, prevent the outbreak of the Third World War. To carry out this vital task we will have at our disposal a combination of game elements typical of strategic (both real-time and turn-based) and role-playing games. In fact, at the time of the creation of our digital alter ego we will have to indicate his profession and this choice will have enormous repercussions on his abilities in the various fields (ranging from combat, to repairs, to explosives, and so on). All in a similar way to a role-playing game, even if decidedly simplified. the catalog of the dozens of actions that we will find ourselves carrying out includes infiltration, theft, sabotage, placement and deactivation of explosives and much more, all seasoned with the indispensable massive dose of healthy violence Great intentions The game phases are divided into two: the non-combat and the combat. In the first we will move freely as in real-time strategy games. Instead, as soon as the bullets begin to fly (or the blows, or the stabs, it depends on the situation...), the game instantly switches to a turn-based system in which all the characters are characterized by a certain number of Action Points and can continue to act only as long as they have available, then they have to give way to others. In these few points we will therefore have to include all the actions that we intend to have our alter ego perform, and this will force us to make important choices on the way in which we intend to set up the fight: better to go on the assault shooting like crazy or look for cover and maybe in the meantime offer our enemies an explosive candy? The catalog of the dozens of actions that we will find ourselves carrying out includes infiltration, theft, sabotage, placement and deactivation of explosives and much more, all seasoned with the indispensable massive dose of healthy violence. but poor execution Full of expectations we start a game. First we have to decide the appearance of the protagonist, of which we can change every aesthetic feature to our liking. So you passa to the choice of his specialization and characteristics, and immediately we realize that a lot has been pulled away: we can only edit the three basic characteristics, the skills modify themselves accordingly, and we have no control over them, thwarting any desire to customize the character and with it a large part of the role-playing component of the game. Once seriously in the game, we soon realize its valid aspects (very few), and unfortunately also those faced with superficiality (far too many). Among the first we can mention the fact of being able to decide the type of movement to perform (running, walking, crawling and crawling) which allows us to face the same situation in different ways. Added to this is the presence of the daily cycle, which it is essential to take into account given that the possibility of success of some actions is enormously modified by the light conditions (going unnoticed is a real feat in broad daylight); without counting the actions that it is not really possible to carry out at certain times of the day because they are linked to specific times (such as the opening hours of a structure or the presence of people in a building). once seriously in the game, we soon realize its valid aspects (very few), and unfortunately also those faced with superficiality (far too many) but poor execution Everything else falls into the second case! The plot should be non-linear, in order to allow for unforeseen twists and ensure good replayability, too bad that all too often we fail to understand how the events are related to each other as well as the actual influence that the choices of the dialogues have on them. In theory factors such as clothing, permits (real or fake) and information should play a fundamental role in carrying out the missions, however in practice it is not possible to leave a map until all enemies have been eliminated, so much it is worth starting immediately to the massacre, at least to save time... moreover, once a map has been cleaned, there is no longer any reason to go back to it, except to sell the equipment recovered from the enemies of the following areas. Speaking of equipment, the developers have included a large number of weapons and various objects in H&S, a pity that this godsend turns all too quickly into a plague when you find yourself managing inventories, moving objects from one member to another of the team or even just to recognize the magazines of the various weapons, in order to decide what to keep and what to leave on the ground. Wanting to remain more tied to the technical sector, the graphics are abundantly outdated and acceptable at most three years ago, while the music is few and unlistenable. The dubbing (in English) is poor, barely passable, and the translations often leave something to be desired; moreover, the phrases with which the characters respond to orders are at least uninspired, such as the main character saying ~Stop it~ (stop it) and other similar amenities to enemies when they are shot. To this then add a good dose of bugs as you like (for example, it happens that objects indispensable for the mission disappear) and the dish is ready. Beware Starforce! Warning: Hammer & Sickle uses the now famous (to say the least) Starforce protection. There is no classic logo, but we compared the protection launch files with those of other games that use Starforce, and the results were similar. It is now in the public domain that the latest versions of the aforementioned protection, due to a rather invasive procedure, can cause malfunctions or, worse, breakage of optical devices. Furthermore, it seems that they do not guarantee sufficient compatibility, both hardware and software, which can cause incorrect recognition of the disc, even if it is original, and therefore the failure to start the game. The manufacturer has denied, declaring that it is slander, but the affected players do not seem to be of the same opinion. We, to be honest, prefer to inform you. Every decision is up to you. When the going gets tough... we bang our heads against the wall... Many flaws could be overlooked, if only the combat was done properly. Too bad that's not the case. The main drawback is the movement system: you can't tell when you're in sight of enemies and when you're in cover. It seems like a minor detail, but in a game focused on the ability to go unnoticed, not understanding where to go in order not to be seen forces you to try and try again hundreds of times until you accidentally take the right path. Worse still happens in fights: you think you have foundor a good cover and instead the enemies see us very well and as soon as their turn comes they reduce us to a sieve.", "date": "2006-03-06", "grade": null}
