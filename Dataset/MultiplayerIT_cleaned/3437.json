{"name": "Frostpunk", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/frostpunk-recensione-console.html", "text": "This management software is not the usual sandbox management software, or at least it wasn't initially since for some time now the game has been enriched by a mode designed precisely to fill this apparent gap, and which we will discuss later. Frostpunk whose review you read is different because there is a narrative that binds each scenario, and the player must get to the end of each chapter by overcoming pre-established obstacles, which are repeated in every game in an almost identical way. Yet that's not a problem, this is because Frostpunk, like the smaller Banished, ventures into survival mechanics that make each game a sort of puzzle to decode. Ok, probably everything will go wrong the first few times, but each time we will have learned something new that will allow us to go a little further in the next game, allowing us to survive more days than before. The purpose? Get to the end of the scenario with a community still united, and it won't be that easy. Management and survival An experience similar to the typical offer of the genre to which it belongs, but also different enough to calibrate the gameplay on new frequencies. In the other games, for example, the aim is to have more and more citizens, more structures, while in Frostpunk already remaining stable is a discrete victory, nor is there any money to spend and borrow. The frozen world, in ruins, which is the backdrop to the vicissitudes of our poor survivors, is a lethal cemetery that offers extreme temperatures and from which it is necessary to defend oneself. The epicenter of the gameplay, for those who have not followed the development and debut of the version released in April 2018 on Windows platforms, is New London, a new conglomerate of desperate people fleeing a slow but inexorable glaciation, built around a shabby reactor steam that grants energy and, more importantly, heat. For this reason, in Frostpunk you build in a radial pattern, displacing the different buildings starting from the central reactor, and gradually moving away. During the dramatic epic, the temperatures will not even slowly become more extreme, making it necessary to build mini reactors to be located along the territory and improve the homes of the survivors, to make them warmer and more comfortable. It is also possible to activate the heating in public buildings, in order to minimize the risk of illness, but all this steam-powered gadgetry is as indispensable as it is problematic. To survive, to find and collect enough coal whose consumption will rise quickly, to do the same with food and all other basic necessities, new inhabitants will be required which consequently will lead to new problems to be solved. human and political Help can be found by exploring the rest of the frozen lands. To do this, it will be necessary to build various structures, as well as take away some manpower from the city to make a caravan. Exploration takes place by moving the pawns on the map, and waiting for the shipment to arrive at its destination. Once in place, a screen will be shown with text that will describe the events or findings of the case, or will put us in front of a tactical crossroads that could lead to new surprises, positive as negative. Exploring it will be possible to find new survivors and technologies, even set up base camps to further extend the search. Through research, as well as dozens of discoveries capable of improving every aspect of the settlement, it will of course be possible to optimize the capabilities of the caravans by equipping them with sledges, for example, capable of dramatically speeding up the initial movements in the snow. As we progress through the game, Frostpunk will even allow us to build huge automatons, useful for replacing the inhabitants in the most dangerous jobs. But Frostpunk has become famous also and perhaps above all for its enormous moral choices that it poses to the user: child labor or not? How to behave in front of a terminally ill person? What to do with the bodies of the deceased, bury them or keep them in the snow? It's easy to say no to something that in our society would be aberrant to say the least, but sometimes you are forced by the situation, furthermore certain choices that are unpopular at first sight could prove to be rather advantageous in the future. Frostpunk is this dramatic ice slide that always leads to more tense situations than the previous ones, and we are called to curb this fall as much as possible, allowing the people enough time to put on the parachute that will save them, at least for another day. Intact and fast The console version looks immaculate straight away. Good graphics quality, without hesitation for most of the game the frame rate, even if when our city starts to expand it will emergesome harmless uncertainty. The peculiar structure of Frostpunk, especially its map with clear borders, allows it to always remain ~light~, not to greedily consume memory, also making the transition from mouse and keyboard to joypad rather easy. The Italian translation and the presence of all the updates released on PC to date, including a more than decent sandbox mode (which can be set on creativity or challenge, complete with randomization in exploration to improve replayability), make this new version of Frostpunk is a mandatory step for all management lovers.", "date": "2019-10-10", "grade": "8.5"}
