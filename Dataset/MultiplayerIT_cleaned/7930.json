Although it was a very skimmed version of the Blizzard game, Order & Chaos Online still managed to satisfy those who for years have hoped in vain to be able to explore the lands of Azeroth on their smartphone or tablet. After a different multiplayer experiment called Heroes of Order & Chaos, the transalpine giant has awakened the orcs, elves and undead of its fantasy universe to offer this time a trading card game along the lines of Magic: The Gathering. And it is precisely from Magic that, as we will see, Gameloft has drawn a large part of the ideas and mechanics that underlie Order & Chaos Duels. Rubamazzotto A not too original fantasy plot forms the backdrop to a single-player campaign whose main purpose is to allow the player to become familiar with the rules of Duels and start building his own deck capable of competing in online challenges. Curious is the possibility of choosing your hero at the beginning of the adventure: the classes and races range from wizards to rangers and from undead to humans, each of which is characterized by its own special ability to be used during a match. Escaping from a prison with the help of a mysterious elf will be the occasion for an exhaustive but never boring tutorial, especially thanks to game rules that immediately appear familiar and which in some ways appear even more simplified than many other card games collectibles. In a match, the aim is always to reset the opponent's Hero's health points by attacking with the summoned creatures. From the management of Mana to the characteristics of the summoned monsters, everything proves to be very derivative. Each creature has a specific cost to be summoned, has an attack strength and resistance to opponents' blows, but above all their skills are very reminiscent of those of Magic: Speed allows a card to attack as soon as it is summoned on the field of the game, without having to wait a turn, while there is also the equivalent of Trample, thanks to which to inflict on the opponent the difference between the strength of the attacking creature and the constitution of the defender. However, there are several innovations and changes compared to the Magic formula, although even in this case it is evident how Gameloft has drawn here and there from the numerous alternatives already present on the App Store and Google Play. When summoned, the creatures must be placed in one of the available slots and, barring special abilities, they can only interact with the card they are facing: if two cards are facing each other then they will resolve a battle in the phase combat, otherwise the damage will go directly to the opposing Hero. This, if on the one hand introduces a whole series of simplifications, on the other it gives the game an interesting strategic imprint: above all in the light of the mana limit, the player must decide well if, where and when to summon his creatures, since they can no longer be moved from their slot. There are also cards that interact with adjacent spaces, and later in the adventure it is possible to develop a deck capable of making the clashes even more articulated and complex. Nice but expensive Also with regard to the management of Mana Gameloft has managed at the same time to ~simplify without taking away~. Unlike Magic, there are no specific cards, but the indicator automatically recharges each turn, and the limit of points that can be spent increases by sacrificing one of the cards in one's hand. The need to increase one's mana points to summon more powerful creatures therefore collides with the indecision of discarding an important card from a lucky hand. If the first matches can be easily won by dropping as many creatures as possible before the opponent, the more advanced clashes put in front of a more difficult opponent AI and which, above all, has decidedly more unpredictable decks from its deck. An almost won game can be overturned with a couple of right cards, not to mention the Hero's special ability, which can be activated on rare occasions during a match and is able to influence the creatures on the field in a more or less evident way. Unfortunately the management of the deck, which should be the beating heart of Order & Chaos Duels, is largely ruined by the freemium model through which Gameloft tries to encourage users to use real credit. Except for a fewmore powerful creature obtained during the campaign, most of the time you are rewarded with common cards, while to get the Uncommon, Rare or Epic ones you need to spend the usual special currency, more difficult to accumulate and which can be purchased by putting your hand to credit card. Unless playing for a senseless amount of hours, those who don't want to pay for more powerful cards not only find themselves in great difficulty in the more advanced sessions of the single-player campaign, but above all cannot compete on equal terms against those online players who instead have upgraded their deck with some in-app purchases. However, where Duels stands out over many other card games is in the care for the presentation: between animated backgrounds, very pleasant settings and lively graphic effects both on the cards and on everything that surrounds them, Gameloft's game is undoubtedly one of the graphically richer. It's a feature that in a genre like this shouldn't be the priority, but after all, as they say, ~even the eye...~.", "date": "2013-03-27", "grade": "7.5"}
