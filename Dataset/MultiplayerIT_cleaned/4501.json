We assume that you have completed the main Breath of the Wild adventure while writing this review, and as a result, there are some spoilers. Breath of the Wild's DLC was announced at launch, and right from the start, despite few details, there was a feeling that the ~big~ update would be the Christmas one. Sensation that (wrongly?) persisted even after the spring publication of Le Prove Leggendarie, a DLC that proved to be more valid than one might expect. Fujibayashi, creator and director of Breath of the Wild, has been working on The Ballad of Champions since February, when the main work was completed: in short, it was normal to expect something great, even considering the adamantine quality of the original game. Certainly, we anticipate it immediately, we are faced with a great DLC: however some may be partially disappointed, above all due to the high expectations that circulated. From Le Prove Leggendarie little was expected and we received a lot, from La Ballata dei Campioni we expected a lot and we got... a lot. Video games, and also DLCs, must be evaluated for what they offer, not for what we would have liked them to offer: however Breath of the Wild had partially deceived us. Because in the game there is a mountain that is topographically registered but not scalable (unique), and this mountain is in the snowy areas that dominate the Gerudo desert: the same areas shown in the mini preview of The Ballad of Champions. In addition, it must be said that, was this really the last Breath of the Wild expansion, no clear words were chosen to conclude the main adventure: at the end of the game, having collected all the memories, Zelda says that there is some problem with the Zora behemoth, anticipating that she would go there. More than one clue therefore hinted that this DLC would be set after the defeat of Ganon, and that it would propose new areas. Well, that's not the case: The Ballad of Champions, like all the rest of the adventure, takes place before facing the Calamity. And it's immediately Game Over We have said that this new adventure begins before the fall of Ganon, to be precise just before the final battle. In fact, the Ballad of Champions begins after having tamed the fourth and last Colossus: an almost obligatory positioning for obvious playful reasons, but which is questionable from a narrative perspective. Many of you at the time of starting the DLC will have already beaten Ganon, and therefore will not even consider the problem, however the same cannot be said for all those who will buy Breath of the Wild from now on (and, we bet, there will be many ): just beat the fourth colossus, finally ready and prepared to face Ganon, the voice of Zelda, of that same Zelda who has been waiting for you for a hundred years, informs you that, if you want to know something more about the past of the Champions, you could go to the Shrine of the Renaissance. Here, you understand that, evaluated in the original narrative flow, it is certainly not the most contextualized of introductions. Having accepted this little idiosyncrasy, all that remains is to lead Link to where he has risen again, a place where, once the DLC is activated, he will find a very, very particular new ~sword~: a four-pronged weapon, one per champion, capable to start a new challenge. Basically, once the Tetrallama has been challenged, the plateau (the initial area of the adventure) is immersed in fog, and four new points of interest appear on the map. Your task is to reach them and defeat every enemy present in that area, so as to reveal new shrines. All this is very interesting because Link's new weapon not only has the ability to defeat any opponent in the first attack, but also condemns its owner to the same fate: if Link is hit, it's Game Over. Thus every enemy is potentially dangerous, even the weakest. Nintendo made a strong choice, certainly not a typical start, but in our opinion it was a commendable decision. Both for the interesting mechanics and because it is a rather difficult passage, mandatory to see everything else: a sort of initiation into the DLC. Once the four unpublished shrines have been completed and the Tetralblade (which cannot be carried around, predictably) has been placed away, everything falls into a more appropriate context for the main game. The Path of Champions Having concluded this atypical introductory section, the DLC embraces the purest essence of Breath of the Wild: one could even say that it represents a miniature version of it. Four focal points in the same regions as the main quest, explorable in the ~usual~ arbitrary order. Without going into futile deIn addition, the DLC unfolds - in every area - in a harmonious marriage between exploration and action. Three images per area that suggest the destination, to be compared and recognized on the map, which lead to as many missions connected to the discovery of a Shrine. Guardians to exterminate, magic circles to cross riding the shield-snowboard, real Malnedotter to be killed: a varied sample, stimulating and challenging tasks. Which, as mentioned, lead to the opening of twelve new Shrines: among the most difficult, beautiful and complicated that Breath of the Wild has proposed. In this regard, The Ballad of Champions reiterates an uncomfortable but ineluctable truth: this latest Zelda boasts the best puzzles of the three-dimensional saga era. Because they are interpretable, and rarely dual. Those who contest the dungeons of this game are actually criticizing their recursive setting, rejecting their fragmentation, not accepting their lack of centrality: placed on a scale, the puzzles of this Zelda stand up to any predecessor... all the more so after this DLC. Speaking of dungeons, the one that concludes the Ballad of Champions is probably the best in the game (rivaled only by the camel Gerudo): small, ingenious, cerebral. A blatantly Nintendo distillation of intelligence, which celebrates the absolute excellence of the Breath of the Wild engine. An underground Colossus that flows into one of the most particular bosses of the game, challenging in any case but demonic if faced in Master Mode. You know (almost) everyone the reward, and it is frankly a narcissistic habit (both Fujibayashi and Aonuma own a motorcycle) and decontextualizing: we hardly forgive them, both for the general vulgarity and for the ~shots~ that the vehicle causes in the villages. There would be other elements to deal with, the most interesting of which is the ancestral saddle that allows horses to be recalled, but essentially the value of the DLC lies in what we have already said - certainly not in the t-shirts, albeit amusing, inspired by The Wind Waker.", "date": "2017-12-12", "grade": "8.3"}
