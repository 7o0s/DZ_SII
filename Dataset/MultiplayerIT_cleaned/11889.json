{"name": "Assassin's Creed Valhalla: L'Assedio di Parigi", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/assassins-creed-valhalla-assedio-parigi-recensione.html", "text": "We have to be honest: we couldn't wait to try our review of Assassin's Creed Valhalla: The Siege of Paris. After a somewhat disappointing first DLC, which didn't invent anything new on the structural front and attempted an unsuccessful supernatural turn, we were convinced that Ubisoft had bet heavily on the second expansion, determined to offer game owners a solid experience, spectacular and varied. The assumptions were all there, after all: the unprecedented French setting, a new and powerful adversary represented by Charles the Fat and finally the representation of a battle that really took place in 885: the second siege of Paris after that half a century earlier by Ragnar Lodbrok, who saw the Viking troops again attacking the capital of the Kingdom of the West Franks in order to obtain part of its wealth. History Assassin's Creed Valhalla: The Siege of Paris, Eivor must decide whether or not to leave for France The setting of The Siege of Paris will be extremely fascinating in the eyes of Assassin's Creed fans, who have always loved the intertwining of historical reality and fictional events, which in this case materialize with the arrival of Eivor in France to lend a hand to the Sigfred's army and discover that even in the kingdom of Charles there is a sect of religious fanatics who kidnap and kill people accused of worshiping the devil. The adventure begins when two of Sigfred's emissaries, Toka and Pierre, come to visit Ravensthorpe to ask for the help of the strongest warrior of the Wolf Clan. Charles's ambition could in fact push him to expand towards the English coasts in the future, and it would therefore be wise for Eivor and his men to face the threat immediately, together with Sigfred's troops, so as to avoid problems later. The arguments convince Morso di Lupo who, having landed in France, immediately realizes the cruelty and oppression committed by the king and his soldiers. He therefore decides to get to work immediately, but not to face Carlo or the Count of Paris, Oddone, but to try to negotiate a truce with them. This narrative forcing forces the player to make little sense and reluctantly choices, which only in the final phase of the expansion return to the tracks of well-justified violence. In the meantime, however, we will have to identify and eliminate the Bellatores Dei, the members of the sect we mentioned above, who are actually presented in a linear manner and without the need to carry out any inquiries, nor do they have the traditional display board that can be consulted from the options, being in the end only a handful of warriors. Unfortunately their characterization appears hasty and so the brutality of Eivor's actions towards them appears even exaggerated. DLC structure Assassin's Creed Valhalla: The Siege of Paris boasts some stunning scenery, provided the skies are clear Set aside the traditional concept of a sect to be discovered, which was frankly a little tired when reproposed in the aforementioned Wrath of the Druids, the structure of Assassin's Creed Valhalla: The Siege of Paris turns out to be relatively dry and stingy with content, so much so that we found ourselves completing the main story in less than seven hours and also all the side missions in another three hours: a substantially shorter duration than the previous expansion. Assassin's Creed Valhalla: The Siege of Paris includes stealth-based infiltration missions The map has small dimensions, with some cities that can be visited but which obviously cannot boast the architectural design of Renaissance France, rather posing as medieval villages that all look a bit alike and arouse very few emotions when walking through their streets. In short, do not expect anything remotely comparable to the splendid revolutionary Paris of Assassin's Creed Unity. For the rest, there are only two abbeys that can be attacked but management mechanisms such as those seen in The Wrath of the Druids are completely missing, therefore any materials collected we will be able to use them only to enhance Ravensthorpe, once we return to England. Some assignments involve some investigation or the exploration of dungeons, with the small novelty of the hordes of rats in the style of A Plague Tale: Innocence but used in a much less brilliant way: they must be driven away with a few blows in order to overcome certain areas. Gameplay Assassin's Creed Valhalla: The Siege of Paris, one of the boss fights that we will have to complete On the gameplay side, there isn't much to say: in addition to the bosses, who finally offer different fights than usual (especially the last one), two new enemies have been added thatthey target from a distance and can be very annoying, but the balance of difficulty remains questionable: if you have completed the basic campaign your Eivor will probably be able to eliminate anyone who stands in front of him without much effort, even if in theory the level of opponents should automatically adapt to ours. This in practice does not happen, the challenge is laughable and our suggestion is even to weaken the character (it is possible to do it at the blacksmiths) to ensure that this adventure in France does not reveal itself what a trivial walk. Even more unlockable talents and some extra skills have been added that further enrich the already extensive and devastating repertoire available to Eivor. Assassin's Creed Valhalla: The Siege of Paris presents some choices that will influence the course of events The most relevant novelty, however, is represented by the eventuality of assassination, i.e. situations that we can create to eliminate certain enemies in a silent but at the same time blatant way. A kill that the protagonist can pull off during the course of the story and which even seemed exaggerated in its ruthlessness with respect to the context, falls precisely into this category, even more so considering the very forced diplomacy shown in other moments. Returning to the secondary missions, it is difficult to categorize them in the field of novelties: these are often very similar tasks, in which we are often asked to eliminate one or more targets by acting alone or with the support of some rebel soldiers. We will also be able to spend the cash rewards to strengthen these temporary allies, making our impromptu battlemates more numerous and stronger. Technical realization Assassin's Creed Valhalla: The Siege of Paris will see us riding in suggestive scenarios Anyone who has played Assassin's Creed Valhalla knows well that the real protagonists of the game are the splendid landscapes that can be traversed on foot or on horseback, enjoying absolutely incredible views in combination with a dynamic lighting system that changes according to the time of day and weather conditions. Well, from this point of view, the portion of France that can be visited in The Siege of Paris moves between ups and downs: there are areas perpetually shrouded in an annoying mist, poorly lit by the sun, which in this way they lose a lot in terms of visual rendering, and others that can instead count on excellent lights that enhance the colors of the meadows and the sky. As for the characters, an excellent job has been done in the interlude sequences, which as we know use much more sophisticated and detailed polygonal models than the actual in-game graphics, but in general the new additions appear well characterized and interesting, especially Toka and Charles the Fat. Too bad for the animations of the run during some phases and for a less spectacular visual representation of the siege than we expected. On PC the game performance remained the same as always: using an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 we were able to run Assassin's Creed Valhalla: The Siege of Paris at 4K and 60 FPS stable with all the settings at maximum but with a couple of sacrifices: the resolution scaler set to 80% (therefore 1728p real) and the antialiasing set to the low preset. The music and the Italian dubbing are excellent, with the very valid introduction by Mario Zucca (it's him, isn't it?) in the role of Carlo il Grosso.", "date": "2021-08-11", "grade": "7.5"}
