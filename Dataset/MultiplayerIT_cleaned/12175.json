{"name": "Death Jr. 2: Roots of Evil - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/death-jr-2-roots-of-evil-recensione.html", "text": "Hammerless sickle The story behind Death Jr. 2 is rather sparse, just like in its predecessor: at the base of everything is the usual mess caused by the two protagonists -DJ and Pandora-, guilty of having freed the evil Furi, which immediately begins to get busy by imprisoning Death Sr. and causing havoc throughout the world. In addition to being unoriginal, the plot is deliberately put into the background, relegated to a few cutscenes which, especially considering the charisma of some characters, would have deserved much more space. Flying over the narrative, Roots of Evil offers a novelty from the beginning of the adventure, when the user is asked which of the two heroes to play: the influence on the actual gameplay is almost nil (DJ and Pandora in fact possess the same abilities ), but the impossibility of switching characters during the game still appears as a lack. In any case, Death Jr. 2 offers that mix of platform and action that also characterized the prequel, with a palpable imbalance towards the latter aspect: the stages leave a certain space for exploration but above all abound in enemies, a quantity to which the work Backbone fails to oppose an adequate support on a playful level. Put simply, in Roots of Evil there is a lot of fighting and badly. Control system and camera don't do their job as they should, but these are not the only weak points of the game. Shooting down enemies soon becomes a boring or even frustrating operation, due to the continuous respawn of the same and the limited actions that can be performed by the user: in addition to the attack with the white weapon (which can be upgraded during the adventure but which does not evolve in substance), DJ and Pandora have various firearms at their disposal, penalized however by somewhat imprecise aiming methods. Also in this case, an imbalance situation arises again, with some devices so powerful as to overshadow all the others. It goes without saying that, in light of these facts, the search for upgrades for guns and the like goes from what the developers intended as a robust sub-plot to a completely useless activity... Kill them A department in which Death Jr. 2 is absolutely unassailable is instead the technical one, which stands out particularly for a more than good graphic realization. The Backbone guys confirmed what was remarkable they had shown in the prequel, raising the bar as much as the PSP hardware allows. Roots of Evil offers rather elaborate and above all varied scenarios to the eye, which rarely lead to the banal or the ~already seen~: the polygonal constructions are discreet, the visual effects remarkable and the frame rate always constant, even if the textures sometimes leave one desire. Death Jr. 2 pays tribute in what are the most subtle elements, such as the design of the menus (far from brilliant) and the connections between the various animations of the characters, often too approximate. The result is in any case a product of undoubted cosmetic value, accompanied moreover by an up-to-date sound sector: the effects therefore prove to be quite varied and convincing, but it is the well-chosen music and the speech (in English) that raise the qualitative level of some point above average. Considering how Death Jr. 2: Roots of Evil is packaged so well, it is even more frustrating to observe its ingenuity from a playful point of view, which inevitably lead the title to an evaluation that is certainly lower than its potential. Unfortunately Backbone has not been able to take advantage of the opportunity to remedy the mistakes made with the prequel, repeating them systematically in this second episode: and if problems relating to the control system and camera can all in all be tolerated (in similar respects, you know, PSP it is not among the easiest hardware), the same cannot be done with the obvious playful shortcomings that afflict Roots of Evil. It will be for the third chapter... Comment Exactly like its predecessor, Death Jr. 2: Roots of Evil isn't a bad game, but it's simply a somewhat naive product under several aspects, mainly of a playful nature: but if this could easily have been a justification for the first episode , the same cannot be said of a sequel that had every chance to right the wrongs of the past. In short, with Roots of Evil, Backbone did a ~homework~ where a much deeper restyling was needed, arriving at the usual result: a playable title but far from being intriguing. Pros Valid from a technical point of view Character and level design successful Cons Control system and camera to forgetThere are a lot of ingenuity on the sketched Storyline playful profile Despite the not exactly striking success of the first episode, the guys from Backbone Entertainment have decided to give a new chapter to the adventures of Death Jr., the teenage son of Death himself armed with a sickle and a great predisposition to get into trouble. So here is that this Roots of Evil comes armed with the classic ~sequel equipment~: a new playable character, new graphic trappings, new gameplay elements ... and the same old problems.", "date": "2007-06-22", "grade": null}
