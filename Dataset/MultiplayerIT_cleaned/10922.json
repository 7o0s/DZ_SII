{"name": "Castlevania: Advance Collection", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/castlevania-advance-collection-recensione.html", "text": "Considering how much there is a desire for Castlevania and how little has been done for this series for so many years now, being faced with a review of Castlevania: Advance Collection, a collection that brings together some of the best ~recent~ chapters, is already a very good thing in itself. Furthermore, it is a collection that fans of the series have been requesting for some time and it arrived with the addition of an extra chapter and within a well-kept frame, carrying on an excellent trend started by Konami with other operations similar, as we have seen with Arcade Classics Anniversary Collection and Castlevania Anniversary Collection itself, which in a certain sense represents a ~first chapter~ compared to this new collection. Considering Konami's current situation and short-term prospects, the fact that at least one tries to recover the traditional Castlevania with a certain criterion is already something positive, especially when this operation has been carried out with considerable care. Castlevania: Advance Collection contains Castlevania: Circle of the Moon, Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance, Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow and Castlevania: Vampire's Kiss,. The latter is a sort of extra addition, given that it is the chapter originally released on the SNES as an adaptation of Rondo of Blood, also known as Dracula X. The adaptation operation, as in other previous cases, was entrusted to the team M2, now a real guarantee when it comes to recovering games from the past. Also in this case the work done is commendable. It is the perfect reworking of the titles released on Game Boy Advance (and SNES) without any sensitive changes made to the code, but with some tricks designed to make the old chapters look their best on modern platforms, including three different display options and a good amount of extra content. Castlevania: Circle of the Moon Castlevania: Circle of the Moon, Nathan Graves fights with whip modified by the use of cards Released in 2001, it was one of the launch games for the Game Boy Advance, able to immediately demonstrate what the new Nintendo machine was made of. It is a substantial evolution for the series in the portable field, presenting graphics that exceeded even some of those seen on 16-bit for richness of sprites and animations, moreover based on a very particular characterization. Castlevania: Circle of the Moon is distinguished by particularly dark tones, also from a graphic point of view, which made it rather difficult to play on a non-backlit screen but which still makes it very fascinating and perhaps, paradoxically, even more enjoyable aesthetically on modern platforms. Its main peculiarity is the card system: killed enemies can leave cards, of different rarity and power based on the creature's level, which can be combined in pairs to give protagonist Nathan Graves a special ability. Considering the not very high drop rate, this system encourages the clash with the greatest amount of enemies possible and also stimulates backtracking in search of all the cards. It still remains today one of the chapters least linked to the somewhat abused tradition of Symphony of the Night and also for this reason it is perhaps one of the most interesting to play now. Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance, a scene from the opening intro Considered one of the best of the GBA era, seeing it again today it is even clearer how Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance was a bit of a response from Konami to those who wanted a real sequel to Symphony of the Night given what it draws from the famous title released on 32-bit. On the one hand, this is obviously a positive characteristic, given the indelible value of the game in question, but on the other it somewhat determines a deficit of identity and characterization which now appears perhaps more evident than before, when the enthusiasm for a SOTN laptop was still a lot. More refined and balanced than Circle of the Moon, it also corrected the shot in technical terms trying to counteract the poor visibility of the laptop display with a brilliance of colors and brightness which, although functional at the time, is now even more too prominent on modern displays, resulting in tones and color choices that are a little too bright. In these respects the chapter could be aged a worse, precisely because it is specifically calibrated on the hardware of the GBA. However, it remains a very large and multifaceted Castlevania, equipped with a considerable variety of settings and situations, in addition to the very solid action structure with RPG elements that we know well and represents ifalways a guarantee. Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow, Soma Cruz uses the system of tactical souls to enhance their attacks Another heir to the tradition of Symphony of the Night, Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow at least differs from it for atmospheres and for some peculiar ideas, such as the characterization of the main character, Soma Cruz, the setting placed in the future (at least as regards the line thunderstorm of the protagonist) and some game mechanics such as the possibility of absorbing the souls of enemies to use them as secondary weapons and modify the protagonist's statistics, recovering in this sense the idea of the Circle of the Moon cards. Although it only came out a couple of years after the console's launch, it's already a game in the GBA's maturity stage, making full use of its hardware with truly impressive graphics. identity, so much so that it has a direct sequel on Nintendo DS which recovers most of its ideas with Dawn of Sorrow. In this sense, it represents a cornerstone for the history of the series, a new starting point elaborated by Kojima Igarashi to evolve the Symphony of the Night experience following a slightly different path between characters, setting and introduction of ~tactical souls~ , which like Circle cards have the advantage of stimulating confrontations and backtracking. As a balance of the parts, between level design care, hybridization of RPG elements, bosses and more, it can still be considered one of the best chapters. Castlevania: Vampire's Kiss/Dracula X Castlevania: Vampire's Kiss, the level with the flames in the background is still a beautiful sight Descendant of the most classic tradition of the series, Castlevania: Vampire's Kiss clearly demonstrates its belonging to a decidedly different era. The game is a real 2D action game of the 16-bit era, still looking good thanks to the excellent adaptation made by M2 also in this case. It has a somewhat controversial history, as it is a rather different adaptation from the original Rondo of Blood for the PC Engine, in many respects inferior: in fact, some innovative features of the original in the management of objects were removed and the level design is modified in incomprehensible way, with a somewhat unbalanced balance that makes it a very selective challenge, especially to reach the positive ending. However, it remains very interesting also as a testimony of the old school of Castlevania, compared to the style that has come to define following the great watershed represented by Symphony of the Night. Detached from the adventure ambitions of Castlevania 3 and less dizzying than Super Castlevania 4 with its daring use of Mode 7 but artistically richer and more coherent, in this collection he represents an excellent outsider, able to compensate for the hybrid mechanisms of the more recent chapters with a dose of healthy classic platform action, ideal for detaching a bit from the GBA trilogy which can seem too cohesive in stylistic and structural terms. The operation of collection and adaptation Castlevania Advance Collection, the clash with Death is practically a classic Konami and M2 continue with the positive approach also seen in previous collections, offering the games in the collection with a remarkable completeness. From the initial menu it is possible to choose the version to be used for each of the chapters between Japanese, USA and PAL, with specific saves for each edition, a choice that certainly goes in favor of the most demanding enthusiasts. Technically, the reproposition of the games is almost perfect, with an excellent response to commands and a good job of adapting to modern displays: the choices for all chapters provide for the possibility of stretching the image to cover the entire screen, absolutely not recommended, the ~pixel perfect~ mode which precisely replicates the original format and an intermediate mode which expands the screen by implementing a filter capable of maintaining the proportions and avoiding excessive pixel prominence. Among all three, we would like to recommend the ~pixel perfect~ mode, especially if you use Nintendo Switch in portability, while the standard one can be ideal on larger displays. The excellent technical adaptation also includes content such as ~documentary~ present in the collection, which substantially enrich the value of the package. For each chapter we can see packaging, original instruction booklets in all three versions for each game and above all an enormous amount of illustrations, concept art and various drawings that deepen the knowledge of the series.Castlevania Advance Collection, some bosses still look impressive, like these dragons Through a technical menu ~external~ to the games it is possible to record sequences and review them, save the state of the game separately and also access a sort of useful encyclopaedia which explains in more detail the functions and characteristics of objects, weapons and elements belonging to the four games in question. Basically, it's like having a strategic guide included and always available. Among the main options, there is also a music player that allows you to listen to all the music from the various chapters separately. This good implementation also allows us to talk about this aspect: although the tracks are of a good standard, as per tradition for the series, the Game Boy Advance hardware has never particularly shone in terms of audio quality and direct transposition of the music it only confirms the not so positive memories in this respect, but the option itself is interesting.", "date": "2021-09-26", "grade": "8.4"}
