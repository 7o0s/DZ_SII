A period of time, the one that elapsed between 1998 and 2010, which allows us to notice macroscopic differences within the life of a man, even marking the passing of several generations of software and hardware when we turn our gaze towards a young medium like that covered in these pages. If the writer cannot make any guesses about how everyone occupied their days then, it is possible to have some more certainty about the evenings: those twelve months were glorious in the console environment, with the birth of Metal Gear Solid and Xenogears on Playstation, as well that of Zelda: Ocarina of the Time on Nintendo 64, but perhaps even more for those who dabbled with mouse and keyboard, intent on juggling the various Half Life, Unreal, Thief, Grim Fandango and, of course, StarCraft with its expansion Broodwar - released a year later in Europe. At the time it took Blizzard six months to release the two campaigns, in the following period enjoying the growing popularity of what would become the champion of its genre, a success that would not impose any subsequent race, leaving free to focus on the masterpieces that came later, Diablo II and WarCraft III, before World of WarCraft came along erasing all other priorities. However, today, faced with a completely different panorama, the time has finally come to start delving into one of the most engaging plots that have appeared on our monitors and get back to mastering a multiplayer sector of extraordinary depth, enjoying the first of the three campaigns that will mark this rebirth and explore the infinite possibilities of online; with StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty the king of strategy is back, and he did it to stay. Homecoming What is most impressive as soon as the installation is finished, simply browsing the menus and before discovering how good the work has been done down to the smallest detail by the Californian software house, is the amount of content inserted, with a campaign for the single player from excellent structure, narrative and playful, as well as a multiplayer refined with many tools designed to accompany even the inexperienced player. At the base of everything, however, there is the typical formula of the series: that mixture of extraction and therefore management of resources and units that mixes with a rather unique rhythm, always on the attack or in any case with the greatest possible expansion in mind at all times. inside the game map, with three completely different races as approach to gameplay and an infinite amount of possible developments. Now it could be said - and someone said - that StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty is a mere update, an update that boldly plagiarizes itself to sell itself again in stores. Even putting aside for a second the campaign, completely new in its approach, or the many new options for competitive play, and therefore wanting to stay with the raw mechanics, the affirmation starts from a wrong assumption: aspects such as intelligence artificial units, both in terms of fire and optimization of movements on the map, or the management of structures and commands, with the possibility of collecting the former in groups and creating queues of the latter, have not distorted the approach to the macro and to the micro management of one's forces, the peculiar soul of the series, but they have made them several times more modern and enjoyable, asking the expert player to put his effort back in order to master the virtually infinite learning curve but also making it very sweeter for the newcomer. A similar discourse has been made in recent years for Street Fighter IV, a splendid return to the origins, but in both cases the revolutionary echoes are canceled by the simple evidence that certain excellences, over the years almost never directly challenged and never really achieved, they can very well evolve rather than be distorted, leaving to others the task of inventing new ways of understanding a genre. A man and his ship Four years have passed since the end of the events narrated in Brood War: Kerrigan, the new Zerg leader, has not been heard from since her mysterious retreat, a step back taken just when she could have launched the final attack on the Koprulu sector. while the Protoss are regrouping on Shakuras, a planet once a refuge for the then dissident faction of the dark templar, and humans suffer from the blind expansionist thirst and the constant media pressure of an unjust government, by Arcturus Mengsk. In all this Jim Raynor finds himself first on the ground and then on the bridge of the ship he commands, the Hyperion, busy working as a mercenary for whoever he is.willing to pay the right amount; an inglorious present for a man with a heroic past, who was betrayed and lost everything, but who, over the course of the twenty-nine epic missions included in the campaign, will once again find a way to become central to the events that will decide the future of the galaxy. As known, StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty focuses on the Terran faction, digressing on the subject only during four missions, in which the Protoss must be commanded: the battlefield mixes with the management elements of one's own army, with new units and technologies that can be purchased by progressing in the maze of a long breakneck race, equipped with an excellent narrative that unfolds both between the rooms of the spaceship and once you reach the surface of some distant rock lost in the cosmic void. The scenarios enjoy an excellent variety and, having lost almost any desire to illustrate the very different mechanics that govern the multiplayer, they lead the player by the hand between planets with rivers of moving lava or close to a supernova ready to shine, changing register on occasion of a couple of excursus in command of a handful of heroes and then return to the classic siege, made tastier by the possibility of using laser beams of unprecedented power or ancient artifacts. Furthermore, on three occasions the user will be given the possibility to choose, thus influencing the next task and being able to recover the one left behind through the appropriate selection menu, which you will have to access even if you have missed the beautiful secondary quest secret, obtainable during another expedition. Whether you are attacking trains or you are in space on an ancient Xel'Naga structure, obviously the units are always the masters, many compared to those available in multiplayer - which has fewer for obvious reasons of balance - and made even more varied by the introduction of the mercenary system, enhanced and aesthetically revised versions of other troops. That of the mercenaries, but the same applies to the upgrades and management of the Zerg and Protoss technology that can be recovered optionally along the maps, is one of the aspects managed on board the Hyperion, a complex of rooms which are nothing more than an effective model of menu management. Passing from the Bridge to the Bar, from the Armory to the Laboratory, the player has all the information useful for the gameplay itself, immersed in an environment made up of many dialogues and as many videos and other small gratifications, which properly characterize the characters while contextualizing the Hyperion and what is outside it; between a chat with the nerd who runs the laboratory and a fight at the bar, the game properly manages the times of a plot that does not revolutionize science fiction but fits properly into the continuum of the series and sees Raynor as the absolute protagonist, from beginning to end. end. To the writer to complete the campaign, leaving behind the three ~alternative~ quests and going rather in a hurry, it took twenty hours, but among the secondary objectives, the additional interest brought by the achievement system and the effective diversity implied by each of the four difficulty levels, there's content for twice as long, not counting the nine levels of challenges and the scenario mode.

Pro Gaming for the masses If what was said for the campaign alone would justify the purchase, the multiplayer sector was the reason for the series' transition from the status of simple game to that of legend. In terms of modalities, the offer is quite simple, with matches that pit a maximum of eight users and ranging from the challenge between two players up to free-for-all or against artificial intelligence. From this starting point Blizzard also created for this iterationan excellent competitive environment, where once the game is loaded, users can put into practice the constant improvements due to tens and tens, if not hundreds or thousands, of hours of play. Whether you choose the Terrans, Protoss or Zerg, StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty, like its predecessor, has all the potential to glue you to the screen for years. The five months of beta, the ones on which this analysis of the multiplayer component is based, have been a long ride made up of patch balances and the slow approach to new units, with a constant flowering of ideas for new strategies. In a landscape that is still evolving, as inevitable, what is appreciated, in addition to the quantity and quality of the maps, is the game's ability to gratify the application of a general strategy and all the tactics that it requires , as well as the movements required by individual groups of units. Whether it's choosing the best timing to expand or managing the positioning of your Tanks in siege version, whether you have to decide a technological transition to respond to the opponent's moves or the methods of reconnaissance and incursion into the other's base , the union of a series of qualities that must be developed over time is required, from the speed of execution - no longer taken to the extreme as in BroodWar although still important - to that of adaptation to the map, from the simple review of the replays of some defeat until choosing the best builds based on your own play and against each crossbreeding with opposing races. The latter, taking up what was mentioned at the beginning, have maintained a distance such as to make them totally different from each other, but at the same time they enjoy a balance which, although still not perfect, is already more than sufficient to make them equally adoptable. Given the enormous difference in skill that can be created between players, a matchmaking system was inevitable and in fact in this sense many resources were invested in the development phase, integrating a very fast match search engine to Battle.net , able to find the right opponent in a matter of seconds or, in the case of 2v2, 3v3 and 4v4, to compose teams able to compete on equal terms. Furthermore, the leagues are a tool designed for a dual purpose: on the one hand, to divide the user base - there are five main ones, from bronze to diamond - on the other, to give a continuous stimulus to improve, with single divisions of one hundred players from climbing to the sound of victories, looking for a promotion towards ever more prestigious shores. Some touches of class, then, such as the tank of extra points that can be accumulated in the periods in which you play less, are a plus that without distorting the dynamics of the ladders - binds you to grind positions simply by playing as much as possible - stimulates you to go back online again and again , properly accompanying all the tutorials, information and other goodies made available by Battle.net. Despite the many options, the many unlockable objectives and well-structured services, the portal still has some more critical elements that could leave you less satisfied in the case of specific types of users: waiting for the support for the tournaments, already announced, many would not mind being able to count on a general ranking and by countries, in addition to the never so discussed support for public chats and the game between different geographical regions. By limiting these aspects, however marginal to the gaming experience itself, Blizzard evidently wanted to create an environment optimized in terms of performance and which was not averse to the many newcomers - with, for example, public chats which would be almost impossible to moderate given the numbers of turnout expected - waiting to receive the various feedbacks and possibly moving at a later time to add the requested functions. Overall, the choice seems right, Battle.net is an extraordinary container that invites you to play game after game, single or multiplayer, and at this point we just have to wait to understand what other functions will be added in the months to come. The review is just the beginning... Given the importance and complexity of the title, we thought it was appropriate not to leave players who wish to approach the world of StarCraft alone. For this reason today, with the review, we publish the first article dedicated to the secrets and techniques useful for improving in multiplayer, having us accompanied - or rather, replaced - in the task by the guys from StarCraftWorld.it, the new reference portal dedicated to the strategic Blizzard .
