{"name": "Space Hulk", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/126513-space-hulk-dadi-avvelenati.html", "text": "The Warhammer 40,000 franchise continues to influence the video game industry, with ups and downs indeed. However, it's been years, seventeen to be exact, that we haven't seen a transposition of Space Hulk, the board game that debuted in 1989 and was then revised and corrected until the third edition, published in 2009. It is precisely on this product that the developers of Full Control have based their strategy for PC and iPad, providing fans of the series with an experience as faithful as possible to the original, often with the same maps and the same situations, mixed to an interface that on the Apple tablet is fairly clear and well organized. The transition from mouse and keyboard to the touch screen didn't create great difficulties, that's for sure, and the short tutorial of the single player campaign is enough to understand how to move our Terminators within the scenario, prepare them for the appearance of enemies, attack targets and interact with the environment. An interesting multiplayer mode has also been included in the package which can be played by two on the same terminal or online, both in normal and asynchronous mode. The offer therefore appears quite substantial, although in the face of a not very accessible sale price (8.99 euros) it was decided to leave out three additional missions that must be purchased separately via in-app purchase: ~Messenger of Purgatory~ ( 2.69 euros), ~Sword of Halcyon~ (4.49 euros) and ~Scarred Honor~ (4.49 euros). But what is Space Hulk like once in the heat of the action? In a nutshell: slow and not very varied. Space Hulk is a strategy very faithful to the original boardgame, but slow and cumbersome at the same time The age-old question of strategists in the mobile sector Defining the new Full Control title as a strategic one is actually inappropriate, considering that it is to all intents and purposes a digital board game, complete with the roll of dice (behind the scenes, at least) to determine the success or failure of the our actions and those of enemies, the gruesome Genestealers. At the normal difficulty level (there are three, as per tradition) a close encounter with these dangerous aliens is almost always lethal, which literally transforms the experience into a very tense chess game in which, however, playing attack does not hardly ever pays. In Space Hulk you have to wait for your opponents, spot them once they've come out of the shadows and attack them with everything we have before they get close. The problem is that doing it inside very narrow corridors means coming to terms with a lot of cumbersomeness, patiently alternating the units to spend their action points in the best possible way and therefore running into a large number of limits and edges that make everything except to help make the gameplay more digestible, especially in the mobile sector. In this sense, the excessive difficulty seems almost an attempt to legitimize missions which in the end are terribly simple and almost always involve the passage from a point A to a point B of the map, but which precisely because of the challenge and death Snapshots of the Terminators can become a frustrating sequence of trial and error. The pacing doesn't help, even when we set the speed of the animations to maximum to reduce the dead time. On iPad 2, in particular, the weight of the engine is felt too much and expectations expand further (we would like to clarify that the terminal is indicated as compatible on the game page on the App Store), all against a sector pleasant technical but well below certain productions for iOS, which shows its shortcomings especially in close-up shots. The sound is decidedly better, essential at the right point but capable of biting when necessary thanks to convincing effects and well-acted dialogues (in English).", "date": "2013-12-12", "grade": "6.8"}
