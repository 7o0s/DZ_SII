The progenitor of the modern concept of ~looter shooter~ began his journey quietly, with an immature first chapter and still unaware of the path taken, divided between the desire to innovate, and the awareness of having to maintain an approach close to the classic shooter games first person to survive. Following these guidelines, an interesting but far from perfect game resulted, plagued by a narrative bordering on the embarrassing and by some deficiencies in terms of mechanics that would only be filled with the second chapter. However Borderlands remains a fascinating game, which absolutely deserved a remastered version, which recently arrived on Steam. We got to spend a handful of hours analyzing the main changes and telling them in this review. This is the story of the Vault Hunters As already mentioned, narratively the first Borderlands is a rose water title. The pretext from which it begins, that of being able to reach the phantom Ark, is the incipit of an almost infinite series of main and secondary missions, carried out on the desolate lands of the planet Pandora. In the role of one of the four protagonists, who also correspond to the four different playable classes, we will be called upon to kill a few billion enemies and collect the proverbial ~fantazillion~ of weapons, so as to reach our definitive build. The game develops in a series of small tasks, ranging from killing some creatures, recovering materials, up to the clashes with difficult bosses. Completing these tasks, released by the wacky non-player characters that populate the planet, allows you to receive a reward in cash and experience. While money is useful for buying new equipment and consumables, the latter allows you to level up, automatically becoming stronger and granting you skill points, to be spent on one of the branches of one of the four classes of your choice. Nothing new under the sun, and moreover the system is too simple, not allowing a particular and in-depth characterization. However, what makes the difference in Borderlands is that, regardless of whether you choose the siren Lilith, the berserker Brick, the soldier Roland or the hunter Mordecai, the customization deriving from the (few) pieces that can be equipped is enormous. In fact, each character has some slots through which to create the perfect structure. This is the element that made the fortune of Borderlands and which will be taken up and dramatically enhanced with the sequel. Whenever you kill an opponent, humanoid or otherwise, there is a varying percentage chance that they will drop loot. Approaching it means immediately displaying all its characteristics: level of rarity, any damage done, specific passive skills or elemental characteristics, even up to the brand of the weapon or object. If at first everything may seem unsettling, just a handful of minutes to get into the perspective of the title, soon ending up remembering how fun it can be to play Borderlands. To make everything even more fun, there is a coop of up to four players, which allows you to get lost for dozens and dozens of hours in the devastated lands of Pandora, soon transforming the game into a bullet festival and a war against the compulsive hoarding of booty. The work on the remastered Announced less than a week after its arrival on the market, the remastered of the first Borderlands is something that many expected would arrive sooner or later. As already mentioned, the title suffers from some progenitor ingenuity (both series and genre), which has led it over the years to feel the weight of age. For this reason, although it is still full of people who play the second chapter every day, this is not the case with the original. In fact, this remastering work should have served to get the game back on track not only from a technical point of view. To be honest, graphically Borderlands, thanks to the choice of a very marked cel shading, does not need this great work to be enjoyable even after ten years. On the contrary, some of the gameplay features that we have also talked about previously required a rejuvenation. Therefore, in this new version we find: the mini-map in the style of Borderlands 2, essential for keeping one's movement possibilities clearly visible; a selection of six new legendary weapons; a revisiontotal to the entire loot generation system, so as to give more variety and possible builds; the addition of the mechanics of the shift codes and the gold boxes and, as if that weren't enough, the total reworking of the final boss, unanimously recognized as not very suitable for the rest of the adventure. Precisely for this reason, the team decided to go back to it, rewriting a large part of its artificial intelligence routines, making sure that the challenge proved to be adequate. Reading all this good things, it cannot be denied that Gearbox has made a commitment to rejuvenate its creature. While waiting for the third chapter, to be released on September 19th, this remains a welcome addition on the roadmap. Unfortunately we cannot be equally positive about the technical restoration. If it is true that cel shading holds up on the artistic front, as we wrote a little above, and the reworking of textures and details is noticeable at every step, embellishing the game and making it almost indistinguishable from its sequel, one cannot be equally satisfied with the performance . In some excited phases the framerate tends to collapse, ending up generating annoying sound artifacts, which in fact represent the least successful element of the production. The entire audio mix is substandard, soon leading you to drastically lower the volumes, to avoid going stupid trying to hear something in play. Some problems can also be found from the point of view of the lag, which is often felt in the cooperative, even having all very performing connections. This results in damage being counted late and some weird and occasional ~rubber band effect~.", "date": "2019-04-04", "grade": "8.0"}
