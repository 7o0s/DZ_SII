The World ultimately represented only a taste of the capabilities of Tribute Games. Having archived the experience with Ubisoft, the Canadian development team therefore decided to take advantage of the crowdfunding platform par excellence, Kickstarter, in order to finance the creation of an action platform full of ideas, which from its release to today has been the protagonist on PC of a gradual process of filing and optimization. Just in time for its debut on PlayStation 4, where the game can be downloaded for free for PlayStation Plus subscribers or purchased for 17.99. Although the images suggest a clone of the classic Metal Slug, in reality there is much more under the ~hood~ of Mercenary Kings: the highly recognizable pixel art by Paul Robertson, in the first place, but also and above all an approach to the genre in metroidvania style, a campaign consisting of a hundred missions, many different enemies and bosses to face, as well as a weapon editor that we don't hesitate to define ~huge~. Mission accomplished, then? Not without some collateral damage. Mercenary Kings is a hardcore action platformer, rich and challenging, albeit with some edges Everything and immediately At the end of a sequence that tells the story of our team of mercenaries, literally torn to pieces during a mission but then brought back to life thanks to a secret technology, Mercenary Kings throws us into the middle of the action to familiarize ourselves with the concepts behind basis of the gameplay. Our main weapon has a magazine that often empties quickly, which prevents us from firing continuously against enemies and forces us to pay attention to loading, which can be more or less fast depending on the timing with which we act on the dorsal key responsible for this operation. Yes, a bit like in Gears of War. A second peculiarity is constituted by the physics of the jump, which becomes wider based on the pressure of the relative button but which is also influenced by the weight of the equipment. Platform enthusiasts do not expect an excellent performance in this sense, because more often than not the elevation of the character appears unrelated to the context, a bit ~dopey~. Nothing serious, mind you, while the impossibility of shooting diagonally raises some headaches, which limits our range of action to cardinal directions only. Then there is everything related to the development of the scenarios, which unlike the aforementioned Metal Slug is not linear at all and on the contrary offers a complicated interweaving of platforms, stairs, doors and even secret passages to be memorized as quickly as possible. Among the limitations of the game, a certain repetitiveness of the stages stands out, in the sense that we will often have to replay the same levels and therefore knowing every nook and cranny will come in handy. After all - and here we can say there is another limit - the missions almost always involve the location of a certain number of hostages or enemies within the locations, through a meticulous search which however is made frustrating by the presence of a timer. A bit of a contradiction: on the one hand the guys from Tribute Games ask us to explore as if there were no tomorrow, on the other they order us to do it quickly. This particular aspect of the experience does not go well with a wild respawn concept, which sees the enemies restored to their position not simply when we retrace our steps, but as soon as we change screens or move away a few meters. The biggest problem, the one we would have expected more attention to, however, concerns the sense of progression. We have said of the often repeated scenarios and a certain lack of variety even in the missions, but starting immediately with a very large map, with all those branches, is unsettling and can discourage those who did not expect such a demanding challenge. From this point of view Mercenary Kings is a bit like the scoundrel father who teaches us to swim by throwing us in the middle of the ocean, and although the thing is damned ~hardcore~ (as, after all, Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World was hardcore) it doesn't can say that it is an appreciable gesture. Playstation 4 trophies The twenty-six Mercenary Kings Trophies are not very easy to obtain, as was to be expected. Rather than unlocking achievements by simply completing missions, we will have to eliminate a certain number of enemies, collect a certain amount of materials, activate all skills, earn a million dollars and so on. Weapons and everything around them After the initial impact, we will find that Mercenary Kings reiterates the importance of the explorertion (quick, however) through a very rich and multifaceted looting system, which asks you to collect all the materials that we find around, or that are abandoned by the corpses of our opponents, to use them once we return to the base camp. In fact, together with the money earned at the end of each successfully completed mission, we will be able to exploit the various metals recovered to improve our equipment in many ways, creating weapons made up of numerous ~layers~, with a view to a system that seems to know no bounds and which, in the most advanced stages, allows to put together real instruments of mass destruction. Very powerful cannons that will also serve us to confront the various bosses, also characterized by a nostalgic and traditional vision, with behavioral routines that must necessarily be memorized, weak points to exploit and so on. This system, which on PlayStation 4 shows its side to somewhat too frequent uploads, is supported by a technical sector that plays with the atmospheres of the 90s between pixel art, beautiful animations, blood at will and a musical accompaniment up to par of expectations. Finally, the missions can be tackled alone or in cooperative multiplayer mode, locally or online, although the matchmaking appears a bit rough at the moment, without voice chat (it only communicates with some preset messages) and apparently unable to balance the skills of the participants to ensure matches within the reach of their current level of experience.", "date": "2014-04-10", "grade": "7.5"}
