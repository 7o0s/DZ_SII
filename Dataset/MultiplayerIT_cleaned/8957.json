As you may recall, in its portable reduction the game differed substantially from what was seen on the home console, presenting itself as a two-dimensional action platform which, moreover, only brought into play three of the ~dimensions~ referred to in the title: that of the Spider- classic Man, the past one of the ~noir~ Spider-Man and the future one of the Spider-Man of 2099. Despite these changes, the developers of Griptonite Games (authors of the imminent Shinobi for Nintendo 3DS, among other things) managed to pack a convincing product, with an immediate but sufficiently varied gameplay, as well as an excellent technical realization (in particularly as regards the characters, well drawn and with smooth animation). This year's tie-in also refers to different levels of reality, uses a plot written by none other than Peter David (one of the most popular Marvel authors) and once again on Nintendo DS it transforms into an action platform. The differences, however, immediately catch the eye: the team entrusted with the game, Other Ocean Interactive, despite having previously demonstrated interesting skills (see Dark Void Zero for the DSiWare digital platform) evidently did not believe until at the bottom of this new project and the final result, unfortunately, leaves a lot of bad taste in the mouth. Interactive realities In 2099 Miguel O'Hara, or the Spider-Man of the future, discovers that Walter Sloan, a scientist in the pay of Alchemax, has developed a time travel machine and wants to use it to change reality, moving one hundred and forty years into past and giving birth to his own company and its patents well in advance. Sloan's attempt succeeds and so things are heavily changed in 2011: in place of the Daily Bugle stands one of the many headquarters of Alchemax, which in fact controls the city of New York but not only. Using Parker Parker's DNA, the Spider-Man of 2099 manages to develop a sort of transdimensional link that allows him to communicate with his counterpart from the past, with the aim of working together to thwart this threat and restore the natural order of things. The bond between the two Spider-Man is a basic element in the gameplay of Spider-Man: Edge of Time, as the actions of the Spider-Man of the present affect the future scenario and vice versa. For example, if the classic Spider-Man destroys a barrier in 2011, the Spider-Man of 2099 will not find this obstacle inside the same building and will therefore be able to reach an area previously inaccessible. On the other hand, if in 2011 there is an active defense mechanism with a series of terminals with which it is possible to interact to turn it off, perhaps in 2099 these terminals are already configured correctly and the information can be communicated. These are basically the puzzles that we will face during the course of the adventure, within a structure that is intriguing at first but which soon reveals its limits, above all a mediocre management of the map (displayed on the upper screen, which is quite unusual ) and poor level design. These two elements, combined, unfortunately result in a truly monotonous and frustrating experience, in which it is difficult to identify the position of the two characters despite the possibility of instantly switching from one to the other, and which leads us to wander around the maps for very long minutes, often colliding with the numerous barriers present and with opponents who ~reborn~ even after we have eliminated them. The approach to the fights is very simplistic, with two or three maneuvers to be repeated until the enemy on duty decides to die, and likewise the boss fights do not stand out in terms of ideas and challenge. However, it is the technical sector that immediately annoys, especially when compared with the excellent work done for Spider-Man: Dimensions instead. The characters are in fact represented by two-dimensional sprites designed and animated in an essential way, which move within extremely flat, bare and repetitive polygonal scenarios.", "date": "2011-11-10", "grade": "5.5"}
