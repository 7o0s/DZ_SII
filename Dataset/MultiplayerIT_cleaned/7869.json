Born in 1999, after the uninspiring Arx Fatalis, it went through various not really relevant projects, some of which have never even seen the light of day, such as The Crossing. The following years were spent cutting his teeth helping first Activision with Call of Duty and then 2K Marin in the making of Bioshock 2. A tough apprenticeship which, however, has finally been repaid by a title that has been able to demonstrate the skill of the French team. Dishonored itself is a project that took years of development and sweat and became a reality thanks to the production of Bethesda. All's well that ends well, and after Dunwall Trials the time has come for the first DLC to propose a new story, so much so that it is divided into two parts (the second will be released by the end of the year). Dishonored: The Dagger of Dunwall then leaves the charismatic Raven to focus the action on the assassin Daud, the one responsible for slaying Empress Kaldwin. The idea of impersonating a character antithetical to the protagonist is certainly not new but it is always fascinating, just as the risk of compromising the delicate balance of such a peculiar stealth is high. Coolness and style As mentioned, the story allows us to delve into the story of the impassive Daud, who, without falling into spoilers for those who have not yet played Dishonored, we know has a rather important role in the economy of the main adventure. In this case we are faced with a real side quest unsurprisingly suggested by the Outsider, along three levels of which only the first is unpublished, the other two recover locations already seen in the campaign. It is not difficult to finish the content in less than five hours, even less using a killing-based approach, yet Arkane has managed to open a stimulating parenthesis, introducing a series of innovations that pleasantly alter the game formula. Daud possesses a series of powers that differ from those of Corvo, primarily the ability to summon another assassin, a feature that undoubtedly looks back to the Assassin's Creed saga. This possibility proves to be useful on more than one occasion, but it is the various gadgets made available that steal the show, such as proximity mines and a set of smoke bombs that facilitate elegant escapes. Last but not least, the feature of stopping time during teleportation, a particularly convenient move for better exploring the maps, and beyond. All in all, the control system does not differ radically from what we are used to, an understandable choice after all, and we feel the lack of some Raven power, such as Possession, but the result is in any case satisfactory and manages to give a proper sense of novelty. Frankly, the character development of the character is less successful, based on rather standard clichs, namely those of a resolute, opportunistic and cynical ~villain~ who operates on the basis of his own interests and the brotherhood. Maybe someone will also be fascinated by such an icy and two-dimensional figure, but personally we would have liked some emotional development capable of involving more, even if the second part of this DLC remains to be evaluated for any changes in the story's course. In principle, don't expect fireworks on the plot side. Xbox 360 goals Dishonored: The Knife of Dunwall features ten new achievements for a total of 220 player points. To conquer a large part of it, it is necessary to face the adventure in both the proposed difficulty levels, facilitating the low-profile approach as much as possible, after all we are talking about a stealth game. Good luck! Watch your back Despite the recycling of the scenarios, we must applaud the programmers for the rendering of the unedited one, set in a slaughterhouse, which reconfirms the decisive artistic character of this project. Dunwall itself never ceases to fascinate with its decadent and corrupt atmospheres, an added value that almost manages to compensate, at least in this particular case, for the lack of a solid plot. The developers have also opted for a considerable increase in the challenge rate, taking advantage of Daud's new moves to set up situations that require careful planning, not least the presence of more aggressive and heavily armed enemies, capable of making it particularly difficult mission of our elegant assassin. For these reasons, the structure tends towards a trial and error formula capable of creating potential frustrationto the less persevering, even if the keystone always lies in the correct interpretation and the full exploitation of the resources provided. As already mentioned, the duration ranges from three to five hours depending on the type of approach used, but a product like this has a high replay value and the numerous secrets will invite you to come back to it several times. Arkane has therefore done a good job that we would like to recommend, offering it at a not too high price, just remember that being a two-part project the story will deliberately remain open. For those who simply want another dose of Dishonored, or want to get lost again in the fascinating streets of Dunwall, but with slightly different rules, they can easily proceed with the purchase.", "date": "2013-04-27", "grade": null}
