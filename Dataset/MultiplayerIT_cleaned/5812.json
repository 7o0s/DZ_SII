The protagonists of the game are, in fact, cleaning professionals, who however work in a very unclean environment, given that they deal with arranging crime scenes so as not to leave traces or evidence that could blame their employers for the murders committed. The aim of the game is therefore to make corpses, bloodstains and possible incriminating objects disappear before they are recorded by the Police, obviously trying not to let us be discovered. The first Serial Cleaner was an experimental title based on a decidedly original concept, still a bit rough in terms of construction and presentation, but with a remarkable innovative drive, as we also appreciated in your review. This second chapter is based on the same foundations, but expands its characteristics starting from the presence of a group of protagonist characters, each with specific personalities and skills, who share the same occupation alternating with cleaning the various crime scenes. In short, Bob has extended the business and established a real cleaning company, composing a highly professional and varied team, with employees who are also specialized in various fields. Almost thirty years have passed since the events of the first chapter and the setting has gone from the acids of the 70s to the pulp of the 90s, with a clear change of atmosphere and aesthetics as well as of the geographical location since we are now in New York. However, the general decadence of the environments haunted by Bob is more or less the same. On a cold year-end evening in 1999, the group of cleaners gathers for a reunion and it's time for some historical reenactments, kicking off the tale of Serial Cleaners. The plural in the title has an important meaning, which is reflected both in terms of gameplay and narration, given that now we are dealing with an assorted group of cleaners, who bring different skills, but also different stories and experiences, all from discover. The gang of cleaners Serial Cleaners, a screenshot The introduction of different protagonists also determines a non-linearity of the story, which introduces an additional element of interest in the game and also forms the basis for some replayability. The presence of such different characters has influences both on gameplay and in the narrative sphere: in the first case, the selection brings with it the specific skill set of the chosen cleaner, which may be more or less useful depending on the characteristics of the setting and of the situation we need to fix. As for the story, the insistence on certain characters will allow you to discover their specific background more, just as the choices made in the dialogues will allow you to focus on specific topics. These are features that can push you to new runs in order to discover all the narrative elements that inevitably remain hidden in a single game. The variations on the gameplay front are evident, based on the different specific skills of each cleaner: using Erin Erin ~Vip3r~ Reed is a hacker with great technological skills, which allows you to access terminals and security systems to modify their functioning, or pass through ventilation ducts; Latisha ~Lati~ Thomas is a strong and determined woman, able to count on remarkable athletic skills, but also on artistic skills, with the ability to distract the guards by performing instant graffiti while Haldor ~Hal~ Boen, also known simply as Psycho, he is a meticulous cleaner, but also decidedly insane, able to use a chainsaw to cut up corpses and upset the police, causing the officers to pass out. In short, the plural inserted in the title has important consequences both on the narrative and gameplay fronts, substantially enriching the structure and contents of the original. Gameplay: cleaning and stealth action Serial Cleaners, a rather complex level in terms of structure The game mechanics correspond to that of the first Serial Cleaner, but with new openings for the gameplay, given by the different abilities of the characters and some additional features. Each level requires you to make a certain number of corpses and evidence disappear, taking everything to a designated disposal point, but making sure that we are not discovered by the guards who patrol the environment. The isometric shot fromhigh allows you to have a good view of the surrounding scenario, while with a key we can recall the ~cleaning sense~ which provides an overview of the whole level and the objects and corpses to deal with. Taking advantage of the architecture of the environments, the passages available and the actions of each character, we have to sneak into the rooms and find the best way to make corpses and objects disappear. Each maneuver must be planned with some care to avoid being seen, but also heard: each choice must be weighed because the more silent actions take much longer to be performed, while the fast ones are more likely to attract the attention of enemies. In short, a stealthy movement must be alternated with a more energetic and fast one in order to get to the bottom of situations, as well as having to resort to diversions capable of distracting the guards at the most opportune moments. The combinations are different: it is possible to use hiding places in the level, make noise to attract attention to specific points and free critical areas, turn the lights on and off and find the right keys to open locked doors. There is a certain freedom of action left to the player, also enriched by the additional skills on which the different characters can count, but the amount of elements with which to interact in the scenarios is not particularly large and is, moreover, well indicated in the interface, bringing to a rather guided action, in most cases. There are therefore different paths to follow, as well as different orders with which to achieve the objectives, but the possibilities are not numerous. Action and reaction: the limits of AI Serial Cleaners, a scene full of blood The implementation of artificial intelligence raises several doubts, considering that the shortcomings of this probably represent the weak point of Serial Cleaners. This is obviously a typical element of stealth action: the gameplay itself of these experiences is based on the player's ability to exploit the obvious gaps of the opponents, in terms of perception and deductive skills, but the level set by Draw Distance is perhaps a bit ' too low to provide a truly intriguing challenge. The limited vision, the fact that you can quickly stop any chase once you break eye contact and the lack of credible reactions from the guards to the changes we make to the scenario create a sort of disconnect with the game world, reducing excessively the consequences of even reckless and very little tactical conduct. The problem is mitigated above all with the implementation of a higher number of enemies, who in the more advanced levels patrol the environment in a more meticulous way, forcing you to find complex and make more profound use of the possibilities offered by interaction with the settings. In principle, however, the simple memorization of the movement patterns and the calculation of the travel times of the various guards remains an optimal system for completing the missions, and it is a pity if we also consider the possible different approaches that would be allowed by the various abilities of the characters. An impeccable style Serial Cleaners offers very different environments The transition from the 2D of the first chapter to the 3D of Serial Cleaners has allowed a remarkable evolution of the graphics, which now always appear stylized, but much more detailed and pleasant. Obviously, an impressive polygonal mass is not to be expected, given that we are always talking about an indie title that aims above all at a peculiar characterization rather than spectacularization, but the levels now appear much richer in details, as well as ranging between decidedly different settings , thanks also to the breakdown of the story between the points of view of the various characters. The 70s style of the first leaves room for the re-enactment of the 90s in this new chapter, which perfectly manages to capture certain typical atmospheres of that period, obviously interpreted according to a somewhat pulpy vision given the subject matter. settings and jazz music, it is also the graphic technique that exudes style: from the cutscenes to the actual gameplay, Serial Cleaners adopts a chromatic scale with strong contrasts and a crude dithering technique to display heavy shading, in the style screens used by cartoonists. The result is really very pleasant, with deliberately simple and angular figures as regards the representation of the characters but with an excellent general rendering, given by an artistic direction of remarkable coherence, also strengthened byto various VHS-style distortion and chromatic aberration effects, as well as superimposed writings that emphasize the character of the characters in use.", "date": "2022-09-28", "grade": "7.0"}
