Yet the mobile market and small developers remind us from time to time how it is possible to reduce stealth mechanics to the bone and offer an experience that is both essential and fun. Titles such as Spy Mouse, Tiny Thief and Stealth Inc. are just some of the most successful examples released in recent years, but for those who still can't get enough of sneaking behind enemies or hiding in barrels and bushes, the team of US development Naiad Entertainment has brought its recent Sneaky Sneaky to iOS, a simple stealth game already available for several weeks on PC, but which finds its true home in the tactile interface of smartphones and tablets. Sneaky Sneaky is a curious stealth game that mixes real-time action and turn-based strategy Miniature Stealth Introduced by a small sequence of illustrations, Sneaky Sneaky starts from a simple narrative premise, which sees the player in the role of a hooded petty thief who, after being captured by the Sultan's guards, must find a way to escape from prison, steal all rubies and escape the palace. At the end of the introduction, what we are faced with is a stealth with a top view, in which we move within a grid in an attempt to move from one room to another without being seen. A bit like seen in The Legend of Zelda, The Binding of Isaac and Road Not Taken, each room represents a challenge in its own right, a sort of self-contained puzzle that the player must overcome by exploiting the objects made available by the scenario, constantly careful not to enter the guards' cone of vision. What makes Sneaky Sneaky interesting, at least potentially, is the way the developers have blended real-time action with turn-based mechanics: until you get caught, the action flows smoothly and without interruption, with the player touch can choose where in the room to move, and the guards who make their rounds in a more or less predictable way. However, when you are discovered, things change and the game becomes a sort of turn-based strategy, with the player and his opponents passing the ball to each other after using a certain number of moves. The goal at that point is to reflect and understand what actions and movements to perform to lose the guards and not be discovered; thus it becomes a priority to get out of the visual cone of the guards and reach a bush or a barrel in which to hole up. This really only works on paper, because the combination of a grid map and a real-time game system becomes particularly difficult to deal with enemies that have less predictable and regular paths: it often happens that you are accidentally caught while searching to get behind an opponent, perhaps because the pathfinding system decides that the best route is to pass right in front of the enemy. Furthermore, it is precisely in the first levels that the game suffers a little more, when all you can do is hide and strike with your knife. Things get more interesting as you progress in the adventure, both because the different settings present new traps, dangers and solutions (for example, you can lure enemies into traps), and because there are some RPG elements that allow you to enhance your alter-ego or use potions and weapons from a distance. The guards in the more advanced levels are also able to track down the protagonist by destroying crates and hiding places or by going around the columns and trees that obstruct the view, and it is precisely in these moments that the level of challenge of Sneaky Sneaky undergoes a surge, although never to become overly frustrating.", "date": "2014-12-23", "grade": "7.0"}
