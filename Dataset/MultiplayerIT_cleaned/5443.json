Today, thanks to this revised and corrected reissue, all Sony console owners have the opportunity to make their own a title that, without a shadow of a doubt, resides in the Olympus of two-dimensional action RPGs. Get ready to experience a fairy tale seasoned with Norse gods, princes, princesses and cursed knights, because George Kamitani is back! It's impossible not to get carried away by the beauty and fun of Odin Sphere: Leifthrasir Five is better than One For those who are familiar with Vanillaware titles, it is not necessary to specify that the plot of the title revolves around a series of protagonists. For everyone else, the news can be positive or negative, depending on your point of view. It certainly cannot be considered a defect, it is a precise stylistic and narrative choice that has the double effect, from the gameplay point of view, of giving us a number of hours of play that do not drop below forty - but which are much more greater if you intend to complete all that can be completed; at the same time the need to have to restart the progression every time the journey is undertaken with a different protagonist should be underlined. To each their own conclusions. What is certain is that we are faced with a series of narrative interweaving that outline a story that is certainly not exciting in terms of climax or twists, but undoubtedly well written and enjoyable. Whether you choose the daughter of Odin Gwendolin, the prince of Titania Cornelius, the princess Mercedes of Ringford, the cursed knight Oswald or the princess Velvet of the fallen kingdom of Valentine, what you will face are a series of vicissitudes that have to deal with wars of state, unrequited love or the simple search for a loved one. As mentioned we are in the realm of fairy tales, and it is precisely on those bases that the principles of the relationships between the characters and of the language with which they express themselves and converse are established. Five stories, some intertwined with each other, five campaigns plus a further final. There is a lot of irons in the fire, but if master Kamitani's game does not disappoint on the narrative aspect, it is in terms of gameplay that a small miracle is fully realized. Fun in a handful of keys It's no secret that Vanillaware has been pushing the same keys for the past twenty years, managing every time to add some piece that makes its style of play unique and almost perfect, at least in relation to the competition. It is a mix of elements made in a painstaking way, among which the combat system, the role-playing component and the level design are key aspects. The feeling of being faced with a simple ~button mashing~ is palpable the moment you pick up the pad - or the whole console, in the case of PlayStation Vita - but it only takes a few minutes to find yourself in the middle of a combos that are never trivial and made up of sequences of blows, combinations of front and directional keys and special attacks of various kinds. For those who know and have appreciated Muramasa, it will not be difficult to find differences in terms of management of the parry and counterattack, which somehow made the samurai-inspired title more tactical. However, what does not change is the fun in using the various fighters, all different in terms of mobility, type of attack and approach to battle, thanks above all to the diversification of the arsenal. We go from spears to swords, up to crossbows, with all the different approaches that this brings as a dowry. As mentioned above, the normal attacks are accompanied by two different types of special techniques: some are triggered by consuming the ~phozones~; while others through an energy bar that is recharging over time. The phozons represent one of the key elements of the experience: real particles of light, they accumulate by killing enemies, eating certain foods or collecting luminous plants and butterflies. The peculiarity lies in the choice that the player makes, deciding whether to use them to carry out the aforementioned special attacks or whether to spend them on the skill skill tree in order to enhance the main weapon. It is precisely in the context of growth that we notice the first absolute novelty of this re-edition, or the passive skills of the characters, unpublished and acquirable through skill points received at each level-up. These range from increased damage and defense under certain circumstances, toor to the modification of the experience obtained by eating the foods or the decrease in the cost of the objects that can be purchased from the merchants. As if that weren't enough, the game puts us in a position to be able to create a series of potions with the most varied effects. By collecting or buying the different components and combining them with materials - sources of raw energy - it is possible to fill your inventory with healing, offensive or defensive potions, up to the summoning of elemental followers. There would still be much more to say, between the collection of seeds and the consequent flowering; the restaurants, to which he goes alongside a completely new itinerant; and the alchemy recipes and manuals scattered around the map. It is easy to understand how the title is almost immense in terms of possibilities and contents. A Vanillaware game isn't such until its level design is also analyzed, an aspect in which Odin Sphere far surpasses the later Muramasa and menacingly joins the last born, Dragon's Crown, while lacking that stupendous articulation. The maps, all beautiful and very intricate, are always managed by a progression made of linearity and crossroads that are never hidden, with the particularity of being almost all circular in shape. This, combined with the progression in two dimensions, results in a constant circle during battles, with enemies that react based on distance and position. The transparent mini-map at the top right and the ability to call up the entire area map with the simple press of a button eliminate any possible risk of confusion and give even more fun cleaning up each screen. Furthermore, the immediacy of the title shows off which rooms lead to a battle, whether it is against common enemies or intermediate bosses, and which ones are easy to pass, up to the inevitable clash with the boss on duty. If we add to this a granite frame rate at 60 frames per second and totally revised and corrected animations, the picture of Vanillaware's masterpiece becomes more and more colorful and flamboyant. Playstation 4 trophies As far as trophies are concerned, the title does not depart from tradition, on the contrary it is probably easier to reach the coveted platinum. At the end of your adventure, between history-related trophies and various collectibles, it will not be difficult to have 70-75% of the total in your pocket. To these must be added the usual power-ups of the protagonists or certain types of combos, but if you are among those who have completed 100% Muramasa, Odin Sphere: Leifthrasir will be a breeze, especially since completion on the higher difficulty levels is not required. high. A picture in motion It is precisely that painting that definitely leaves you speechless. Odin Sphere is as beautiful to play as it is beautiful to look at. Colorful and adapted to high definition, it is a triumph of artistic direction. Each area of the game world is so characterized and diversified that it truly gives the idea of a fairytale world. Of course, within the individual maps each area is often repeated, but this does not affect the general rendering which is also the trademark of Vanillaware and its extremely talented director. The sprites of the various protagonists, as well as those of the bosses but also of simple enemies, are a joy to behold. And the revised animations we mentioned earlier are not only reflected in the goodness of the gameplay, but make the narration and the expressiveness of the characters almost incredible for a two-dimensional title. Everything is drawn strictly by hand and you won't get tired of looking at it. Alongside such a commendable technical sector, there is an equally beautiful soundtrack. Right from the title screen you will feel drawn to the tunes of Hitoshi Sakimoto, and soon you can't help but hum a particular tune or theme. Odin Sphere: Leifthrasir is all we could ask Vanillaware for this re-release, and if you're not among those who loved it - or even if you already did - the purchase is highly recommended. If you are a lover of fun and artistic taste in a video game, you will be completely satisfied.", "date": "2016-06-27", "grade": "9.0"}
