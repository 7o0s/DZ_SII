The two titles are not alike by pure chance. Mighty Gunvolt, in fact, is not a real stand-alone game, but a sort of spin-off / crossover that evokes the atmosphere of Azure Striker Gunvolt in a decidedly old-school context, a sincere tribute to the Mega Man era 8-bit so dear to the two software houses. Which, needless to say, makes it more suitable for nostalgics than for new players. Mighty Gunvolt is very short, but it's a real love letter to the unforgettable 8-bit era Big Hero 3 Everything in Mighty Gunvolt recalls the games that shaped an entire generation: the essential but colorful graphics, the catchy but repetitive tunes, the aspect ratio of the image on the upper screen, the illustration on the lower screen which succinctly explains the control as if it were the page of an old instruction manual, the score for the maniacs of the competition, the meager screens that separate the levels from each other, and so on. Even the story told - very slowly, however - is practically incomprehensible: it has something to do with young students and mind control exercised by an evil company, but the English texts are so full of blunders and grammatical errors that it is difficult to make one right, also because they are totally voluntary and try to remind us of an era in which the budget for video game localization was extremely small. We said that Mighty Gunvolt is a spin-off/crossover because, in fact, the player is not only forced into the role of the protagonist Gunvolt, but can also choose to play the nice Ekoro of GalGun and Beck, the robotic hero of that Mighty No. 9 which hasn't even come out yet. The three characters control each other slightly differently: Gunvolt can double jump and project a directional bolt of electricity; Ekoro can charge a powerful shot and float in mid-air like Princess Peach from Super Mario Bros. 2; Finally, Beck can slip and slip into tighter passages, as well as hit enemies with a powerful shoulder thrust. Regardless of the character chosen, the five stages that make up the adventure are the same, and the possibility of going through certain passages precluded to the other heroes does not change the horizontal and vertical development of the level in any way. In short, the experience is decidedly linear, and in terms of level design, the five Mighty Gunvolt stages are certainly not surprising, also because anyone who has played at least one Mega Man on the NES will immediately recognize the stairs, mobile platforms and sharp thorns that we have seen so many times in Capcom signed games. Each stage then ends with the canonical final boss, perhaps snatched from Azure Striker Gunvolt and projected in an 8-bit context: Inti Creates has managed to design some fun and frenetic fights, even if the degree of difficulty of Mighty Gunvolt it is set decidedly downwards. In fact, to complete the campaign with any character, it takes barely twenty minutes, and even less once you have learned the patterns of the few enemies and the most convenient routes. Longevity is certainly not the strong point of this production, and this is also demonstrated by the various DLCs that Inti Creates has prepared in the form of additional stages and bosses also coming from GalGun and Mighty No. 9, but it is a fairly negligible flaw since it is a free entertainment for those who bought Azure Striker Gunvolt.", "date": "2015-04-13", "grade": "6.5"}
