{"name": "Star Wars: Knights Of The Old Republic", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic_a.html", "text": "A story as old as the future... The direct contribution of Mr. Lucas himself can be seen, heard and touched. Since the narrated circumstances predate those that emerged from the double film trilogy thousands of years, it was possible to enjoy valuable creative freedom, completely emancipating oneself from the ~known~, shaping an incredibly solid, exciting and perfectly placed story in the Star Wars odor without binding umbilical cords. The order of the Sith is at the height of its splendour, its army (docet clones) a real gem completely new, its fallen followers the most charismatic there is to be beaten in the teeth, and no less is the Republic with his jedi advice scattered everywhere in the cosmic infinity. I won't bore you with the background from which the actual story begins: seeing the story of Revan and Darth Malak unravel will be a bit like sitting in the cinema with popcorn, such is the absolute quality of the script, in a swirling crescendo that not only does not know push-ups or obvious passages, but which surprisingly will even be malleable and moldable around our character. In fact, one of the reasons why KOTOR leaves all the cousins at stake (last incarnation of Jedi Knight permitting) is its own peculiarity of guaranteeing us full behavioral autonomy, at any moment, in any dialogue, in all practical and speculative situations in which we will come to visit. And the storyline will shape itself without you realizing it around your digital alter ego, free to blindly follow the orders of the council, to disagree often while remaining inextricably linked to good (Qui-Gon Jinn rulez), or even to completely yield to the dark side of the force in pure Anakin/Darth Vader style. That said it will sound strange. There is no trick and there is no deception: do you meet a guy in trouble on the street? You can carry on, enjoy it, linger only for an exchange of jokes, stop to help him or even help him just to ask him for Credits (dineros) in return: either the stock exchange or his life, in short. Zac! But where do you find, I wonder, a game in which you can even shamelessly lie to your fellow adventurers? And never forget that the council's jedi are watching everything from their comfortable armchairs! All this will translate numerically into cold ~dark or light side points~ (visible in a special screen) that you will earn or not by directly influencing both the storyline and incidentally the gameplay. If we add to this the fact that it will be possible to select a type of character between Soldier, Explorer and Adventurer, as well as a further and even more radical forced choice between man or woman, you yourself understand to what extent the replayability of the title will inflate in disproportionately an already opulent longevity. The Dungeons & Dragons school frequented by BioWare therefore returns in roughly unchanged ways in this futuristic re-proposition of the warrior / explorer / thief triptych. The inventory is almost infinite and you will spend hours dressing and covering your 9 characters (only 3 at a time will still be usable) as if they were Barbie and arming them to the max, always with the intention of maximizing your offensive potential. defensive. And then there is the Force which, assuming that it flows as fluently in you as in me, will lead you to master 13 basic powers to which 14 additional powers of the light side or 14 different powers of the dark side will be added according to your inclinations ethics and your ability or not to be able to conquer them all. Lightsabers and flashes of gameplay Going into the actual gameplay, it must immediately be said that both in the exploration/movement phases and in the actual fight phases, the 3 characters at our commands (the choice of them among the 9 roster is absolutely free) will always be present on screen and we will be able to skip from one to the other at will with the simple pressure of a button. The commands are remarkably intuitive, which never hurts given the amount of things that you will be constantly called to monitor both on the screen and in the various menus and related submenus. The fights, that is the core of a product of this type, are entirely in real time, articulated in shifts without pauses, and what is at least necessary, they are damned fun to orchestrate, commendably pre-tactical as well as truly spectacular in terms of choreography especially when they involve two or more jedi knights. It is true that towards the end you will be a real fury of nature, but a Jedi who fully dominates the powersdella Forza is not exactly the subject in front of which it is advisable to inflate the chest too much. You will also be invited to participate in swoop competitions in pure F-Zero style, to sit at the lasers of spaceship turrets, to learn the rules of the Pazaak card game and to enjoy a real space FPS of which I won't reveal anything. as if the main dish hadn't seemed rich enough in itself. Lightsabers and flashes of gameplay In short, there is really a lot of irons in the fire, perhaps too much, to the point that the engine is forced every now and then to hit a few hiccups. Nothing serious is clear, to the point that the controversial technical front is what I have decided to leave for last in this analysis. In fact, everything can be said about KOTOR cosmetics except that it is not fluctuating. The beginning is by no means the most encouraging given that the entire title, on balance, definitely offers the worst of itself as soon as it is immersed in the adventure, planet Taris in the first place (rimas). Things immediately improve considerably: the boundless open expanses of Dantooine offer, in no uncertain terms, a glance from the jaw to the ground, the interiors of the buildings are finally rich in details, the sun offers reflections and shading worthy of the host consoles. The same goes for a certain polygonal complexity on which the legendary Tatooine is built. I would almost be tempted to conclude that the first planet was inserted at the last second, in record time, given that so much architectural and stylistic paucity is not reflected in the continuation of the adventure, but it is certain that for only one amorphous background and some very sporadic slowdown cannot fail the entire graphic sector of a title capable of boasting vastness and depth, quality and quantity such as to put the entire production of rpg pitted to date by the next generation consoles in line. On the sound front, on the other hand, it is superfluous to go too far: in this regard, I recommend everyone to watch the intro and credits before full immersion. A praise to the dubbing: each alien speaks its own language in pure Star Wars tradition (everything is obviously subtitled), which contributes greatly to emphasizing that magical world so close to the hearts of all those who continue to love it unconditionally, including me. Comment Pulling a line KOTOR is a solid, deep, big, very big, overflowing title. The perfect mechanics evoked from the ashes of Baldur's Gate, a ~free~ script at least as much as the gameplay that builds the backbone of the product, a damn satisfying and never repetitive combat system make it look more like a basket of cherries from which you can't would you ever detach from a Star Wars-licensed Xbox game: one game leads to another and so on until the end, without reckoning in your pocket for a very necessary replay value. The diesel-style cosmetics, which start slowly but manage to offer excellent performance over long distances and the maniacal care used by the coders to fully convey the atmosphere of that magical universe, represent little more than a corollary for a playfully perfect product, capable of giving seriously addictive. For true Star Wars lovers we are facing a new reason for living. For the record I warn everyone that some versions are afflicted by a bug by which the game crashes on the final bars: mine was free from defects, but you know, strength flows fluently in this man. Pros An almost perfect game Graphics evocative and important like a distant story Perfect synthesis between complexity and accessibility Longevity is great Completely translated into Italian Cons Some slowdown of the engine, but fully justified I hate rave reviews almost as much as blatantly biased ones Almost. Yet it seems reasonably inappropriate to talk about KOTOR without treading a little on what it actually manages to do, that is to slam the entire Star Wars universe in your face with all the nuances of the case, like no memory tie-in man had ever done, or perhaps had only partially done which does not change the substance of our discussion. In short, the BioWare product is unique, and it is no small thing if you think about it for a moment. With excessively redundant doctrinal brutality, the title tells all the films and much more than the films from which it comes to life. And at least, screened today, superimposed on cornerstones such as the Jedi Knight series of Rogue Squadron or the more historic X-Wing/Tie Fighter, it shows us how old and obvious they arethe fascinating toys that take their cue from the same brand. Afilmic, courageous in the small liberties that it takes, full of poor graphic smears and transgressions all entrusted to the conceptual virtuosity of the great Baldur's Gate, it is a cameo of capital emancipations, when compared to the driven and hidden carelessness of the entire Star Wars branded production that Lucas Arts has been milking since the dawn of time. Too much deeper than Jedi Knight who in some ways anticipates him by centuries, too less talkative than Rogue Leader who will soon follow him, too more complete than a Tie Fighter only shooting, in KOTOR, the ships chasing each other through the galaxies, the flaming light sabers, flashes and lysergic shocks are elements that only the structure of the RPG has shown itself capable of giving me back in full. In short, Star Wars is today a damned mature, deep and above all complete game like it has never been, for this thank you all Xbox and before that BioWare.", "date": "2003-10-02", "grade": null}
