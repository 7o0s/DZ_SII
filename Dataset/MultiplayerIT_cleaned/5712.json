As we had already pointed out in our previous piece, ABC Murders is a graphic adventure directly inspired by the novel The Infernal Series by Agatha Christie. The publication of the book dates back to 1936 and, as is the case for many other works signed by the British crime novelist, this adventure also places the acuteness and savoir faire of Hercule Poirot at the center of the spotlight, a Belgian investigator transplanted to the land of Albion and with a particularly familiar from parts of Scotland Yard. Assuming that being able to hold a candle to Agatha Christie is not an easy undertaking, in ABC Murders the development team tried to accentuate as much as possible some of the characteristic features of the protagonist, giving ample scope to the investigative nuances and following those same methods of investigation described in the reference novel. Poirot is a subtle individual, endowed with a very rigid professional deontology and absolutely out of the ordinary deductive qualities, to the point of causing a mixture of admiration and annoyance in many of his interlocutors. Although from this point of view the work done has satisfied us, the adventure created by Microids is not free from some defects that we will analyze a little more specifically in the next paragraphs. Three murders intertwined with each other From a structural point of view, the novel La Serie Infernale is based on two different types of narration. On the one hand we have the story told by Captain Arthur Hastings, friend and trusted adventure colleague in every investigation completed by Poirot. On the other hand, there are also some sequences developed in the third person, in which the bizarre Alexander Bonaparte Cust speaks. The latter is central to the narrative context, but it also becomes a necessary means for identifying all those facts on which Hastings himself was not a direct witness. A two-phase structure like the one produced in the novel would certainly have complicated life for the developers, which is why in ABC Murders the gravitational center of the story is supported by Poirot's inner reflections, while Hastings is left to the accessory role that belongs to him during the 'investigation. At the same time the events concerning Cust are limited to a few very short cut-scenes and without the slightest interactive participation by the player. Just like in the novel, the events of The ABC Murders take place in 1935, when a letter signed with the acronym ABC informs Poirot of an imminent crime that will take place a few days later in the town of Andover. The investigator promptly warns Scotland Yard but fails to prevent the murder of tobacconist Alice Archer. Thus begins a dense network of investigations during which Poirot and his trusted Hastings are conducted on the site of three different crimes, preceded by as many irreverent missives in which the mysterious executioner throws down his gauntlet. Poirot won't have it repeated twice and, with the poised style that characterizes him, will be able to extricate himself from a multitude of interrogations, lies and deceptive evidence. From an aesthetic and expressive point of view, Poirot was outlined bearing in mind David Suchet, historical interpreter of the television series inspired by the novels of Agatha Christie. As we observed in the preview phase, Microids wanted to draw attention to very specific circumstances such as the way the character poses, his gestures and language, and to tell the truth, the work done in this sense seemed more than satisfactory, enhanced by colorful expressions in French, acute observations of a gentleman of yesteryear, not to mention the narcissistic habit of curling the tips of his mustache in front of the first mirror within sight. The art of collecting clues In the intentions professed by its creators, ABC Murders should have presented a structure suitable for a wider audience than the traditional niche that still appreciates the point and click adventure genre today. Well, after completing the game we must recognize that this goal has only been minimally achieved. While on the one hand the level of difficulty is on average calibrated downwards compared to the historical exponents of the category, potentially making it more attractive even to a more distracted audience, the game structure has proved to be - we would add without too many surprises - very traditional. The rhythms are very staid, while the interaction is all about exploringaction of small environments and on completing dialogues or solving puzzles. The most successful mechanic is undoubtedly the Brain Mode, or rather the reconstruction of the facts that Poirot charges to the depth of his own synapses, those ~little gray cells~ thanks to which he has an edge over anyone else. After having collected the necessary amount of information, the appropriate menu can be opened in which all the details useful for answering the fundamental questions for the investigations are archived. At the beginning there are few fragments to choose from and there won't be any particular difficulties in making deductions, vice versa near the epilogue things become much more nuanced and you have to proceed by trial and error, keeping in mind what has already happened. Another point in favor of the game concerns the puzzles with which the rhythm of the narrative is broken. Overall, fifteen have been included, mostly focused on opening objects, chests, cabinets and anything else that hides hidden information inside. Also in this case the quantity and complexity of the situations increases above all in the concluding section, when the pieces of the mosaic begin to fall into place. Conversely, neither the observation activities of the characters nor the progress of dialogues and interrogations were able to convince us, for which we could undoubtedly have done better. The exploration of the behaviors of suspects and individuals informed of the facts proves to be weak, not very functional with respect to the trend of the events considered, also due to conversations that do not prove to be incisive. The differences between one answer and another are so marked that it never becomes difficult to choose between two different alternatives. In fact, it is practically always possible to clearly understand which lines of text are the most effective and which ones to be discarded a priori, while in the event that errors of evaluation occur, the consequences will in any case be insignificant for the purposes of the story. The complete inexpressiveness of the faces does not help to animate the interrogations, it is no coincidence that some words have been introduced, near the faces of the characters, in order to indicate the state of mind that arose during the conversation. The function is clearly incidental and the approach is very vaguely reminiscent of that of L.A. Noire, although in this case the deductive component is reduced to a flicker and does not even prove to be crucial for the recovery of the clues. The most successful part of ABC Murders is based on the reconstruction of events", "date": "2016-02-12", "grade": "7.0"}
