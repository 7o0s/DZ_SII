{"name": "Kessen 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/kessen-3.html", "text": "Noble Nobunaga! The Kessen series has always boasted a deep and fascinating storyline which, thanks also to the skilful use of well-crafted cut-scenes, can undoubtedly be considered one of the most exciting aspects of this videogame saga. Kessen 3 is no exception, the story that is proposed to us is in fact of excellent narrative workmanship; will tell us the adventures of a young sixteenth-century Japanese nobleman, Oda Nobunaga, who, driven by the desire to unify a nation marked by constant wars, engages in a fight against the wicked to finally bring peace to Japan. The characters who will support Nobunaga in his campaign, and even those who will face, all have a good characterization (and those who have already played Samurai Warriors will find familiar faces) and their charisma helps to get more passionate about the story; these are the qualities that make the adventure even more memorable, and even if the plot and characters will never reach the quality levels of a Metal Gear, the player will not be able to avoid being captured by the charm of Nobunaga & co. and by the style narrative cinematic. The technique in Kessen 3 From a technical point of view, what leaves something to be desired in the kinematics is the voice dubbing, which is slightly subdued compared to the soundtrack. During the cutscenes, the symphonic instrumental style of the music manages to emphasize all kinds of moments, especially those in which the action reigns supreme; during the battle phases, on the other hand, the music fades slightly into the background, in the sense that the ambient imprint given to the soundtrack ensures that it pleasantly accompanies the game action without however attacking it excessively. The general visual aspect of Kessen 3 is instead positioned in the average. There have been significant improvements over its predecessors, but not radical enough to match the quality of the latest PS2 masterpieces (Metal Gear Solid 3 or God of War). Nonetheless, the style adopted is to be commended, especially looking at the details of the costumes and characters. It should also be added that the battlefield is no longer like that of the other two Kessens (completely bare and flat), but much richer in details (hills, trees, enemy towers and more). This greatly affects playability, because the type of terrain on which you will move your troops and the obstacles you will come across will be a fundamental element that should not be underestimated... it could be the key to victory, or the cause of an eventual defeat. The task of a general! In Kessen 3 there are basically two phases of the game, that of troop management and that of actual combat. The first phase is essential for placing the main and support squadrons on the battlefield, you will also have to give each troop to an officer of your choice. Although it seems like a very simple thing, in reality it is not, because there are many factors to take into consideration: the type of troops (there are different ones, such as archers, knights, infantry with spears or with katanas, etc. ), the officer's ability to manage this type of troops and his skill level (officers level up and learn skills by gaining experience at the end of battles), the officer's equipment (RPG-style you can also modify weapons and accessories worn). It is also possible to manage the AI of the squadrons that will not be controlled by the player in battle and their path with its objective. For those who want to jump right into the action, it is possible to leave the CPU to automatically fix everything, and catapult you right into the middle of the fight. Once on the battlefield you will take command of the main troop, which you can move in real time as in a normal action game, the other troops will instead be managed by the CPU, but with the simple push of a button you can ~switch~ between them to decide which one to use. The fights take place through the use of a key that allows you to make combos, but that's not all, you can take advantage of particular skills of the officers such as increasing the attack and defense of the allied troops or decreasing those of the opponents; even entire squadrons have special attacks available to use in battle to deal more damage to enemies. Both phases of the game are made in such a way as not to be excessively complex, this is because the strategies to be adopted to end Kessen do not require a great effort and can be recycled from battle to battle. However, the fun will not be lacking, managing the teams is very rewarding and nehowever, it requires constant supervision, considering the poor allied AI, and a wise use of the various skills. Once the game is finished (about twenty hours), the New Game Plus option will allow you to enjoy the adventure more, during the second game you will in fact be able to view new scenes and fight battles that were skipped during the first play (there is they are in fact points in which your decisions will influence the clashes to be sustained), all at a higher level of difficulty which will certainly be appreciated by those who find the first play too easy. Kessen 3 undoubtedly proves to be a noteworthy game, which however has a flaw: the combat system is too repetitive, and after a while it could get tiring. All in all, however, it has strong points that should not be underestimated, first of all the plot, very exciting and well constructed, and secondly its original action/strategic structure. However, this particular game system, which places Kessen 3 halfway between an action and a strategic one, is not necessarily to be considered as an advantage, on the contrary it could instead be a defect for the purists of the two genres. If you are a video gamer of this type, it is good that you take a look at the game before making a possible purchase, because you may not be fully satisfied by the hybrid structure. However, Kessen 3 remains a good title that deserves attention and capable of giving truly pleasant moments, even without reaching too high peaks. Pros: Fascinating storyline Well-structured hybrid structure, but... Cons: ...might not be for everyone Game system a bit repetitive For those who have never heard of it, Kessen was at the time a very interesting game that expertly mixed action and strategy in a single formula. Although never having had great success due to a not very convincing realization, Kessen still managed to thrill those players for whom this game was conceived, that is, for those who prefer gameplay that was neither purely strategic nor purely hack'n 'slash. We have reached the third chapter of this saga, the old formula has been revised and corrected to make the game even more exciting, realistic and engaging. The aspect that has undergone the most variations is in fact the gameplay, modified in order to have a more action imprint, but not only that, the feeling and structure of the fights have also been changed: no more wars on huge battlefields with hundreds of warriors, now the battle locations are smaller and more detailed (obstacles and terrain are now to be taken into greater consideration), and the troops are composed of fewer soldiers. We will see later if these changes are to be considered successful or not, but for now let's take a look at the plot.", "date": "2005-06-16", "grade": null}
