In the fifth episode we find our hero a member of a special group called the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance which is responsible for preventing the use and spread of biological weapons (but a quieter job like selling flowers in front of a cemetery?). Something shady is happening in Africa and ours is sent on a mission to find out what's behind it (the famous B-side of things). To support him there will be for the second time a woman (much smarter than him, to be honest), Sheva Alomar (but what a beautiful name for cat biscuits); together they will discover and have to thwart a global plan that threatens to make all the inhabitants of planet Earth and even someone from Mars become fans of De Filippi's programs, and consequently televoters, otherwise we risk being accused of racism. Will Chris and Sheva be able to foil the terrible threat? But above all, why are many of Chris's old acquaintances in Africa? Is it still a survival horror? Resident Evil 5 takes away from Resident Evil 4 both in terms of plot and game mechanics. Having definitively abandoned the traditional setting of the survival horror genre, that is the one with fixed screens with a cinematic cut, we find ourselves for the second time with the character seen from behind and with the possibility of looking around us at three hundred and sixty degrees. In truth, it is difficult to define Resident Evil 5 as a survival horror: a few minutes of play are enough to understand that the action breakthrough is complete or almost complete. There is little left of horror, if not in a general sense, i.e. due to the presence of zombies (call them B.O.W... but they are always zombies) and due to the inclusion of some b-movie finds, which however don't make you jump on your seat. The tension, when there is tension, derives more from the number of enemies, often overwhelming, and never from a use of language more proper to the original genre. The puzzles themselves have been impoverished and brought to the level of those of first-person shooters and action sequences that are difficult to connect to survival horror abound, such as shootings from moving vehicles. Also forget about the shortage of bullets, since there are industrial quantities of them here. Structurally, the game is made up of a long series of action sequences interspersed with some interludes with a narrative connection function, which serves to move the plot forward and to make sense of what is happening on the screen. The turning point attempted with the fourth episode here takes a further step forward, however, risking dissatisfying those players who are looking for a gaming experience more channeled into the canons of the genre. Was it racism? Resident Evil 5 hit store shelves accompanied by a controversy regarding its alleged racism because zombies were originally only black. Without wanting to start the controversy from scratch, let's say that the best thesis is that of those who have seen in the Capcom game not so much racism, but a concentrate of carelessness and an almost slavish reliance on clichs about African populations. In short, if there was a lack, it was a lack of research and in-depth analysis on the subject, certainly not a desire to discriminate. The PC version The important thing, speaking of the PC version, is to understand the value of the conversion and check if there have been any changes and improvements compared to the console counterpart. Let's say right away that there are no novelties in terms of plot. We are faced with the exact same game with the same narrative and action sequences. On the positive side, it is an excellent conversion, in the wake of what was done with Devil May Cry 4, Lost Planet and Street Fighter IV. It seems that Capcom has understood that to bring a video game to PC it is not enough to make them a carbon copy. If technically there are no big differences compared to the console counterpart, from the point of view of the game interface a good job has been done with some interesting additions such as the possibility of managing the inventory by exploiting the greatest number of keys offered by the keyboard. Another important change is that of the viewfinder, suitable for mouse control. So off the red laser, useful for aiming using the joypad, and welcome to a much larger and more practical reticle to use. Apart from these details, the most important change has been made between modes. Obviously there remains the possibility of playing in co-op, the real fulcrum of the game that makes the difference (playing alone the second character is driven by the CPU), while thehe Versus mode has been replaced by the No Mercy one in which you play alone against many more enemies than the starting one. Apart from the initial shock it must be said that this is a remarkable addition, with adrenaline levels higher than even the normal mode, which already offers a lot of over the top action.", "date": "2009-09-14", "grade": "8.8"}
