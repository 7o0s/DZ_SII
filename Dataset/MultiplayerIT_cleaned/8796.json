So Darkness Rush: Saving Princess arrives at the right time, the debut title for Blue Phoenix Games on the App Store, which looks like a running game in which our goal in each game is to get as far as possible, in the hope of reach the evil Dark Dragon and free the beloved princess Freya. Two characters initially available to us, both in love with Freya despite belonging to factions at war with each other: Will Brook, half-blood werewolf, son of the boss of the house and of a human mother; Joseph Carter, a vampire who is rescued by Will and consequently changes his mind about werewolves. To these is added Helena Albom (to be unlocked), Freya's sister, endowed with magical powers deriving from light. With each attempt, gold coins are collected along the way, which can then be spent in a virtual store to purchase various kinds of upgrades, capable of improving the characteristics of speed, agility and resistance of our warriors. In truth, Darkness Rush also indulges in the typical temptations of freemiums, allowing us to spend real money to buy packs of coins and, therefore, significantly speed up our progress in the game; progress that is marked through the achievement of certain achievements, which in turn earn us coins. Still a better love story than Twilight The gameplay is very simple, since it is a running game: having selected a character, we can choose between some upgrades (which cost money, however) and then embark on our endless run, avoiding traps and chasms by making single and double jumps, or even resorting to ability to fly, which however consumes mana. The mystical energy is found in a bar at the top of the screen, which is emptied by flying and can be restored by collecting the appropriate celestial crystals on the way. However, there are also other important crystals, the red ones: once we have found three of them, we will be able to take on the ~beastly~ features characteristic of each character and take advantage of superior speed and agility; at least until we suffer damage, which will bring us back to normal. During the transformation, the game will become even more difficult, in this case the fireballs thrown at us from a distance by the Dark Dragon will increase. The controls are also very simple, with the jump button on the left side of the touch screen and the charge button on the right side. The maneuver is essential to destroy the magical runes that block the path, but it can also be used to not resort to flying at the end of a particularly long jump. Its only flaw lies in the necessary ~cooldown~ between one dash and another, which requires us to be very careful and use it only when necessary. The choice of the Unreal Engine for a running game may leave you perplexed at first, but a few seconds are enough to verify the quality guaranteed by the engine created by Epic Games: the polygonal models are well detailed and move fluidly, while the scenarios are distinguished by the texture definition (not all, but most) and the goodness of the special effects. The sound commentary is also appreciable, which accompanies the action effectively without standing out too much.
