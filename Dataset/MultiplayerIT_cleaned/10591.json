The sci-fi genre, between fiction and cinema, came out reinvigorated by these advances and the colonization of the planets of the solar system seemed like the obvious next step in the imagination of writers and directors. If we talk about science fiction, however, we cannot ignore the fundamental theme of alien life forms: there are those who have represented them in a positive way, while those who invariably identify them as invading forces hostile to our planet and its inhabitants. The old saying ~don't disturb the sleeping dog~ certainly applies to Moon: set in a not so distant future, the new FPS developed by Renegade Kid for Nintendo DS bases its plot on the terrible threats to which one is exposed when creating a space colony without first ascertaining the existence of mysterious and hostile living species towards those who invade their territory. The story takes place on the moon and we take on the role of Major Kane, who finds himself alone facing a terrible threat along the endless corridors of the space base. The attack happens suddenly and surprises everyone, after which the colony is invaded by alien robots and creatures that crawl along the walls waiting for a victim. ~We need more powerful weapons!~ As soon as our colleagues realize something is wrong, they provide us with a high-tech weapon and ask us to investigate. As we move inside the colony, however, it becomes clear that an invasion is underway: several guards have been killed and their corpses lie near areas now under the control of the aliens. Our goal, of course, is to eliminate any enemy that stands in front of us as we explore the base in search of answers. In addition to conventional weapons, Kane's inventory includes a ~radio-controlled~ vehicle called the RAD, which ultimately constitutes the single and most important element of variation of Moon's gameplay. We can activate it in the same way as we select a weapon, but from that moment we will see with its eyes and control it in first person. Given its small size, the RAD can explore the ventilation tunnels with the aim of activating or deactivating switches and allowing us access to areas previously sealed by energy barriers. The vehicle moves quickly thanks to the wheels, but in dangerous situations it quickly reveals itself as a fish out of water, equipped as it is with a small pulse cannon capable only of ~stunning~ opponents for a few moments. The problem is that if the vehicle is destroyed, the game ends immediately: better be very careful. ~They're coming out the fucking walls!~ The control system adopted for Moon is typical of FPS for Nintendo DS: the d-pad regulates the movement of the character on the four axes, while with the stylus on the touch screen we move the view (and therefore the crosshair of the weapon) on the screen superior. To open fire you need to press the backbone L, while all other actions (collecting objects, interacting with the environment, selecting weapons and tools) take place via tap. The map of the colony is displayed on the touch screen, to be ~unlocked~ area by area, and with a quick touch of the stylus you can view the mission objectives at any time, access the options screen, manage the entire map or contact the our colleagues in the command center. During combat it is important to move to the side to avoid enemy fire, and then collect the life energy dropped by eliminated opponents. The aiming system does not appear very precise, let's say that the ~recoil~ of the weapons was represented in a somewhat questionable way and one often has the feeling of not hitting the target even though the color of the crosshair (which changes from green to red when framing a threat) does not give rise to doubts. However, the weapons offer a certain variety (ranging from fast but not very powerful machine guns to ~revolver~ style guns capable of eliminating enemies with one shot) and therefore this aspect can also be managed without problems. In Moon there is no respawn for opponents, this means that once an area has been cleared we can visit it again without worrying about any dangers. The management of saves and ammunition always proves to be sensible, therefore we will not find ourselves having to replay large portions of the game due to a savepoint that is too far away nor will we face the dangerous end-of-level bosses without adequate equipment. From RAD to LOLA Getting around a lunar base on foot may not always be the best idea, for that matterMoon provides us with two profoundly different vehicles: the RAD is a small motorized robot capable of exploring the tunnels for ventilation, while the LOLA is a real vehicle that is the protagonist of some fast-paced and engaging stages. Technical realization Using the same graphics engine as Dementium: The Ward, Moon displays the fluidity and detail that are top notch for the DS. The game moves at a constant 60 frames per second, without hesitation, and the polygon count is more than good, with detailed models and decent animation. Unfortunately there is a clear variety problem in the design of both the scenario and the enemies. The settings are characterized by a questionable use of colors, as well as textures that unfortunately show little imagination beyond the definition. As for the enemies, the matter is even more serious: the standard opponents we meet on our way are almost always the same, or rather flying ~pods~ capable of shooting. And when it comes to the alien creatures, well, things don't get much better. In short, just like for the previous Renegade Kid product, there is a design problem that should be solved to push the Texan developer's titles to higher peaks. The sound sector is a bit controversial, on the one hand it offers decent quality speech (in English), on the other music that recalls the era of 8-bit systems but which does not do much to add atmosphere to the game.", "date": "2009-08-04", "grade": "7.0"}
