We have already talked about Content 1 , the one containing the Liberation and Piazza maps, it is therefore time to review the rest of the offer, i.e. Content 2, the Overwatch map released in February, and clearly the more substantial Content 3 which contains two Special Missions, Black Ice and Negotiator and the Black Box map. Doing the sum is easy, at the usual price of 1200 Microsoft Points we will therefore find a Content Collection Pack 1 containing four multiplayer maps and two Special Missions. Overwatch takes us to the highest point of a skyscraper under construction during the Russian invasion of New York, ideally therefore in the early stages of the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 campaign. The map is quite intricate, compact but not without more spaces wide and defiles, climbs and descents that allow us to avoid hot areas. Being a construction site on several levels, the map is literally cluttered with objects and things to lurk behind, but thanks to constantly fragmented firing lines and multiple access ~roads~ in any area of this small map, even here the snipers will have little space to dedicate themselves to their favorite sport. It being understood that there is no shortage of elevated areas, such as the upper floors still under construction and a crane to climb. A well-structured map that therefore offers many solutions for all types of players (warned champions) to best stage the usual frenetic gameplay of the game made of head-down racing. A veritable labyrinth of reinforced concrete and half-built walls over two hundred meters high. Seas and mountains From a devastated and burning Manhattan to what should be a quiet neighborhood for billionaires in the hills of California and which instead turns into a fiery inferno in Black Box, given the crash of none other than Air Force One. A map that is a nice visiting card for the excellent level design of Sledgehammer Games, built on several levels, between semi-destroyed villas on several floors, terraces and driveways and above all the remains of 747. Remains that, although they are not exactly in the center of the map, undoubtedly constitute the hottest area of the level, being excellent for stalking and sniping both from long and short distances, having a good glance at your disposal. Rest assured all those who fear an excessive ~camperistic~ development of the map. Here, too, each area is well served by numerous defiles and secondary passages, even if as the map is rather full of gradients, the shooting lines are cleaner than in Overwatch. Probably together with Piazza the best map of the package, capable of best condensing the spirit of the game. The first of the two available Special Missions leads us to assault a diamond mine, Makarov's secret base, obviously to be blown up before the timely extraction via helicopter. The mission is divided into two distinct and separate phases. The initial moments see the two players aboard a snowmobile attempting to arrive safely at the base between very high jumps and numerous heavily armed pursuers. Obviously one player drives and the other shoots with an Akimbo machine gun, fortunately with infinite shots. Once at the base you have to make your way through the tunnels of the mine, paying attention to the dozens of soldiers who attack us both frontally from an elevated position and from the sides in light of the numerous secondary doors and entrances. Arrived at the computer room, stolen the sensitive data and positioned the charges, it's time to make the way in the opposite direction as quickly as possible since the bomb's timer runs mercilessly. Once outside you get on the helicopter, but not before having taken out the few survivors who are trying to shoot us from the balconies. Undoubtedly a fast and adrenaline-pumping experience, rather short - about ten minutes - if played on the lowest difficulty level, but which commits us a lot if we want to complete it to earn all the stars and which requires a lot of cooperation especially in the dark tunnels of the mine. Xbox 360 goals The DLC rewards the player with 160 points for 6 objectives, all related to the two Special Missions. The more difficult objectives commit us to completing the missions at the highest level of difficulty, while the more demanding one puts us to the test trying to save all the hostages. Save everyone Cooperation that is enhanced in the second mission, Negotiator, set in India where we are asked, in addition to surviving, to free morepossible prisoners. The beginning is fulminant, we too are a prisoner, but by putting our escapist skills to good use we manage to free ourselves, steal a gun from a soldier's holster and kill the first jailers. All as fast as possible since civilians encountered in the mission are about to be killed in cold blood. Thus begins our run in the narrow alleys of the Indian town - the one seen in Persona non Grata - and by assaulting the first house we will free the second player who will thus join our mission. Really well done here is the entry into the game of the companion who will see the prisoners before him killed one after another with a blow to the head, thus anxiously waiting for the first player to break into the room. The mission therefore continues house to house, not without a rather complicated moment where in a small square several waves of soldiers block our way with grenades, but luckily for us a nice stationary machine gun gives us a hand. The challenge rate is very high, not only because as the difficulty level increases, the alleys, irruptions and blind corners of the town become really difficult, but because a goal commits us to saving all the hostages (watch out for friendly fire!) . Without a doubt the better and more replayable of the two Special Missions.", "date": "2012-03-15", "grade": null}
