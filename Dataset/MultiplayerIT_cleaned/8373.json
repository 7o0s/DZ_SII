{"name": "Unmechanical", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/106921-unmechanical-vita-metallica.html", "text": "The Swedish Teotl Studios, already known for the award-winning The Ball, initially conceived as a mod for Unreal Tournament III, have decided to publish the first work of compatriots Talawa: it is Unmechanical, a puzzle game driven in turn by the engine of Epic, in two dimensions but with three-dimensional graphics. Generally influenced by other independent productions such as LIMBO or And Yet It Moves, the Talawa Games game features a flying robot whose only ~weapon~ is a magnetic ray, activated with the space bar, capable of attracting smaller objects . Leveraging this unique feature, the Stockholm programmers have created about thirty simple-to-solve puzzles, sometimes perhaps a little obvious but never frustrating, which will keep the player busy for a handful of hours. Some of these require you to move and fit boulders, to detonate bombs to clear passages, to use mirrors to deflect light rays. Others instead focus on logic and memory skills, while (fortunately) a small part requires a certain skill in the speed of execution of commands. Puzzles upon puzzles The protagonist robot cannot die nor are there any time limits to solve the puzzles and this makes Unmechanical suitable for practically any user. Unlike Machinarium, to which it owes not only the inspiration of the protagonist but also the name (the fonts used are also very similar), there is no inventory, therefore all the puzzles will have to be solved within a single level. whose dimensions may vary, but remain well defined by the particular game saving system devised by the developers. In fact, upon solving each puzzle, the computer automatically overwrites the previous save, thus making the player understand that in that particular area there is nothing more worth dwelling on. In the event that it is really not possible to get to the bottom of certain situations, it is possible to resort to pressing the F1 key, which brings up a cloud with a clue on what to do: however, these are borderline cases, so much so that we have never had any need during our games. On the other hand, a serious bug deserves to be reported which can occur right in the last stages and which can literally prevent you from arriving at the choice of the game's ending (there are two): not being able, due to the above, to recover the ~good~ save ~ above, it is necessary to start everything from the beginning in order to correct any mistake made. This is the only technical flaw found during the tests: we hope that the guys from Talawa will soon run for cover to avoid the possible discontent of many users. From a technical point of view, the game looks like a classic two-dimensional platform whose backdrops are, however, rendered three-dimensionally thanks to the versatility of a super-tested engine like that of Epic. Although the graphic settings are reduced to the bone, Unmechanical will not be a problem even for medium-low range systems. To be honest, the visual rendering is not exactly breathtaking, however the effort of the designers is denoted in making the original universe in which the little robot moves as coherent and uniform as possible, in which organic elements are combined with steel structures similar to what happened over a decade ago in the legendary Quake III Arena. In some cases the results achieved are commendable, even if we will rarely stop to admire the panorama, continuing quickly towards the rapid conclusion. The sound accompaniment honestly performs its duty without impressing: the rendering of metal noises and the robot's engine is particularly good, the soundtrack is less incisive, however it knows how to be present in the most significant progress of a pretentious plot made even more sterile by the lack of any type of vocal or textual comment. The replayability factor is penalized by the absence of difficulty levels and collectibles, and the objectives inserted above all to show them off on Steam are of little use. However, the presence of two different endings could persuade players to complete the title a second time, which however at that point will no longer constitute a valid challenge. Unmechanical pod The programmers have also announced a version for iOS which, in our opinion, should earn several points both for the introduction of the touch control system which would seem to go well with the game dynamics of Unmechanical, and for the graphic rendering, decidedly more effective on mobile devices, and finally for the casual nature that makes it an excellent pastime between a break and theother. The release for Apple systems is scheduled for the second half of August, while for the PC platform the title will be available, as well as on Steam, also through GOG and Gamers Gate and a physical version that could arrive in Europe cannot be ruled out. on the basis of the one already confirmed for the Russian market.", "date": "2012-08-13", "grade": "7.2"}
