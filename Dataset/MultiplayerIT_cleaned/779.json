On balance, however, we were faced with an excellently packaged product and decidedly fun at first, but very shallow and in the long run rather repetitive and empty. For many a missed opportunity, even before an extreme disappointment. After about 3 years, the guys from Gas Powered Games try again and amaze us again. This time, for the better. Abandoning all the more demanding ambitions and forgetting all the expectations of the public, Dungeon Siege 2 adjusts the shot and, while remaining an adrenaline-pumping and immediate title, immediately demonstrates the (good) will of the designers in offering us side elements or not (stolen from true cRPGs) that enrich the game not indifferently, giving life to one of the best Hack&Slash ever. Here you are. Finished review. Go in peace. All right, the deontological spirit pushes us to further explore the subject. So let's proceed in order... Our characters There is no RPG (or presumed such) without a character growth system. Dungeon Siege 2 could not be an exception and presents us with a very well done system of rules. A character's abilities are divided into four areas: melee, ranged combat, natural magic, and combat magic. Each character will progress in each of the four specializations simply by using them and, by evolving, will be able to unlock unprecedented special powers or new specific objects. Simple, intuitive and effective. At least for a Hack & Slash. Four selectable races: humans, elves, dryads and half-elves. The aesthetic customization of our characters is also decidedly poor. It doesn't go beyond the face, the hair cut and little else. Fortunately, we will make up for it with the numerous armor that can be found along the way. Sic. Assault on the tower The combat system of Dungeon Siege 2 rests on the solid foundations laid a few years ago by Blizzard. For all lovers of the first chapter: know that now the infamous ~auto attack~ is gone. Almost. With one mouse button (left) you move, with the other (right) you attack the selected target. In particular, each click corresponds to an attack, alternatively by keeping the button pressed, our character will continue to slash. All this is seasoned with a series of further possibilities and complications that arise from the promiscuous nature of our party. In fact, during the course of the game we could bring one or more adventure companions with us. The maximum number of party members is 7, and it will be up to us to decide how much or not to rely on external help, considering all the pros and cons of the case. First of all, having a large party means dividing the group's experience points among several people (so you will level up less quickly), secondly having free slots to hire helpers means paying (exponentially and handsomely) the mercenary guild and, last but not least the game can become too easy with the consequence that, for someone, the game could be more or less fun. Each of the different helpers that we will meet for the lands of Aranna will have its own personality, from time to time he will interrupt the game action to expose his ideas to us and, possibly, he could also quarrel with other members of the party he dislikes, if not really leave the group. Friendly. If necessary, after a visit to the creature shop under the house, we will have the opportunity to guarantee ourselves the services of a faithful animal. The (mythical) mule of the first chapter is joined by a series of other creatures with a decidedly more exotic, if not exactly esoteric, taste. Various elementals, giant scorpions and fearsome lizards are just some of the options available to us. Unlike our partymates, pets don't know the concept of experience points but grow (literally) based on what you offer them to eat. Animals aren't picky eaters and will eat anything: magical artifacts, weapons, and various reagents. Depending on the different caloric intakes, our animals will grow more or less quickly and will gain certain special abilities and powers. Going back to the game mechanics, it should be noted that the micro-management required by Dungeon Siege is far from negligible: Taylor's past in the RTS field remains submerged but alwayspreviously mentioned. The player controls only one character at a time but can decide at any time (preferably before, of course) armament and any automatic casting spells (typically healing spells) or not for all party members. During the clashes, it will always be possible to set the group's tactics, decide the activation of particular spells and try to concentrate the group's efforts on a particularly powerful opponent. The artificial intelligence of our enemies will soon be rather anonymous, however the large number of creatures to kill and their differentiation (both somatic and ~semantic~) will mean that the game is able to offer us always rather varied and stimulating clashes. Some creatures, for example, will literally hate characters casting spells and will lash out at them furiously, while others will be afraid of spells and so on. Unfortunately, the considerations on the poor artificial intelligence also apply to our snack companions who will soon be practically immune to any more recondite spirit of conservation. And this, especially during the toughest fights, sometimes translates into frustration and anger. Multidungeons Given the past, a rich multiplayer section certainly could not be missing. Once a character has been created and the first tutorial level has been passed, it will be possible to host a multiplayer game or find already created ones through the now ubiquitous GameSpy (game via LAN is still available). Both the game world and the scripting of the events will be the same as the single player counterpart. It will be possible to command from a single character up to three. Furthermore, due to the structure of the game, it is not even necessary to constantly explore the game side by side. Indeed, if desired, it is possible (although not recommended) to follow parallel paths, as in a sort of small MMORPG. The progress of our character in single player mode can be exported to the multiplayer mode, but not vice versa. Not just fights Dungeon Siege 2, like the rest of the prequel, is a game strongly oriented towards clashes. However, at Gas Powered Games they have thought well of taking inspiration from the more serious cRPGs (?) to offer us some amusement from time to time. Thus, even if the plot is strongly anchored to a track and even if the most important choices available to the player always and only concern which weapon to use to smash the muzzle of the unfortunate person on duty, occasionally we will have the opportunity to use the parts of the brain more thoughtful to solve some side quest. Sometimes we will be forced to read books, rather than pushed to use a minimum of deductive logic. The game world then, although basically one-way in its exploration, does not lack crossroads, secret areas to be discovered with our spirit of observation (or accessible only with characters with certain characteristics), regions to be retraced once we have gained experience or new items. All united by a truly enviable variety and geographical extension. The game interface is practically perfect. Almost. The whole game is designed to not make us waste too much time in secondary and often tedious aspects. The game map will always show us where to go if we want to solve the quest, the NPCs useful for the game will be marked by different icons above their heads, but not forbidding us to talk even with ~useless~ characters just to enter a bit more in the atmosphere of Aranna. Special mention for the game diary: it will be impossible to get lost in the quests, thanks to an implementation that is as verbose as it is thorough and schematic of the summary of the missions to be completed. There is also an encyclopedic section that will be updated as we advance in the game by finding particular books, artifacts or relics, and that will spend thousands of words on the game world, on the creatures that infest it, its history, myths, legends . A streaming world The graphics engine of this second chapter is a direct evolution of the one already developed for the prequel, with the adjustment of the number of polygons, the implementation of more complex particle effects and little more. Someone might turn up their noses a little, but we assure you that the graphic aspect of Dungeon Siege 2 is absolutely top-notch even though it does not require the latest generation systems to run at its best. On the contrary. Most likely it will run more smoothly than Morrowind, just to say ... Once again the game world is unique and its exploration is continuous, you will not see any loading, except during the initialization phase.ion and during the use of the various teleporters (cleverly disguised, however, by a graphic effect of trekkiana memory). Much of the game is set in sylvan locations, but there is no shortage of dungeons, deserts, glaciers, fortified locations and so on. The graphic style is always kept on rather high levels, skilfully combining cleanliness with detail. Only by zooming to the maximum on the details will it be possible to complain about the poor definition of the textures, but after all - except in very rare cases - the range of vision will be such that you will hardly notice it. All the characters are represented with a handful of polygons and yet, even in this case we assure you that you will pay very little attention to it. The animations are practically non-existent, in the sense that they are there but, partly due to the excitement of the clashes, partly due to the usually very enlarged view... very little attention is paid to it. On the other hand, the woods and forests of Aranna seem real and palpable, in their tangle of shrubs, lianas and dangling roots: waiting for Oblivion we have perhaps the best representation of the genre ahead of us. The graphic style is always kept on rather high levels, skilfully combining cleanliness with detail A streaming world For some, it might be annoying that the angle of view is always a little too much over the shoulders of our characters and never directly behind them, partially limiting the visual range. Flaw this, already present in Neverwinter Nights. All the audio commentary is also top notch. In addition to supporting the EAX libraries in an excellent way, the soundtrack takes advantage of the skill of the veteran Jeremy Soul (Icewind Dale, Morrowind, KoTOR) and will accompany us in a varied and never too intrusive way for all our adventures. The saving system is atypical and for many even regrettable: the state of the character is saved but not his position. This means that the player is encouraged to save only after reaching the various checkpoints ... or teleportation points. On the other hand, in the world of Aranna there is no Game-Over, death is just a disappointment between a teleportation and the last checkpoint reached and, in the worst case, the loss of a part of our hard-earned treasures. Excellent localization of both text and speech. Is the story? Well, find out the story for yourself. It has always been one of the cornerstones of role-playing games. Yes, even of those only presumed as such... Final comment We must start with an assumption: Dungeon Siege 2 is not a Fallout-style RPG, nor is it Gothic-style. Maybe it's not even an RPG. That said, Dungeon Siege 2 is a very fun title, cared for at the highest level and unexpectedly deep. Of course, there is no lack of congenital defects of this genre of games, such as the intrinsic monotony of the game mechanics. Yet, an attempt has been made to overcome them - or at least to minimize them - by introducing destabilizing elements capable, perhaps, of breaking the pace of the game. The management of the fights itself tries to go far beyond the usual ~point, crush, kill~ paradigm while only succeeding in half, by virtue of rather questionable artificial intelligence routines. For the rest, accurate and very atmospheric graphics, guaranteed longevity and richness of the background make Dungeon Siege 2 one of the best exponents of its genre. Recommended to all fans and also to all the others... perhaps with the foresight to play it without too many preconceptions. Pros Immediate and fun Atmosphere and variety Not only fights Against Artificial Intelligence almost non-existent Questionable save system Some time ago, during a press conference, Richard Garriot (those who don't know him have the good taste to use any search engine) had the audacity to define Diablo as a perfect RPG. The reaction was as instantaneous as it was predictable and, only after a few moments, a sly smile illuminated the general disappointment: ~I said RPG and not 'Role-playing'~. Again for Garriot, Diablo is the video game incarnation of numerical perfection, of imperfect game balance. After Diablo nothing was the same, for Blizzard in primis but also for the genre of computer role-playing games in general. What was once almost a single and heterogeneous genre, soon witnessed a diaspora that gave birth to a babel of new acronyms, became the subject of discussions and rigid classifications between Hack & Slash, cRPG, Action RPG and so on. Such was the success of the award-winning firm ~The Butcher & Co.~ which risked obscuring, in a single instant, years and years of ~real~ role-playing games, bewitching the most distracted players, the so-called casual ones, and misleading an entire generation of programmers to the point of", "date": "2005-10-28", "grade": null}
