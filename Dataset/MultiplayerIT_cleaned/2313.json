{"name": "Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/jak-and-daxter-the-precursor-legacy-4.html", "text": "Crash + Zelda + Final Fantasy + Mario + Spyro = J&D In the pipeline for more than two years, Jak and Daxter turns out to be at the end of the works a cosmetic show almost incomparable from the rest of the titles existing today for Playstation 2. It offers above all a superb graphic style, characterized by an absolutely spot on fantasy theme and enriched by an almost endless series of small details, a sign of obsessive attention paid to the technical realization of the game. But J&D's luck is that, unlike many other video games, it has managed to combine its excellent aesthetics with gameplay that is, in my opinion, practically perfect. But let's try to analyze everything in a certain order. Described by the team of its developers as a meeting between Crash, Zelda, Final Fantasy, Mario 64 and Spyro the Dragon, this title seems from the first moments an effective ~cocktail~, or rather, an explosive mixture, which may have been obtained only with the contemporary presence of the best qualities attributable to what can undoubtedly be defined as milestones in the history of video games. And the result, as we said, certainly leaves nothing to be desired. In fact, J&D recalls, in its game structure, the never forgotten masterpiece by Miyamoto, Zelda: Ocarina of Time, generally for the skill and inspiration with which the environments are created, and in particular for what concerns the freedom of movement and the freedom to decide what to do. We will therefore have the possibility all the time to explore how and when we want the 15 levels present, given that the missions, already very varied in themselves, do not have to be completed compulsorily before being able to continue towards another area. The main purpose of these missions is to get our two heroes as many batteries as possible: this is the name given to luminous globes capable of supplying energy, and which are essential to be able to activate precise devices capable of opening doors to us. or previously unusable bridges. The whole game is centered both on these batteries and on the existing Eco energy, in addition to the dark and evil one we have already mentioned, in four other forms, which in turn are very positive: the green one, the blue one, the yellow and red. With the first Jak regains energy (represented by a heart of the same color divided into three parts), with the second he runs and can activate switches of vital importance, while with the third he has the temporary ability to strike his enemies, with the aid from a first person view, with very harmful fireballs. The last Echo (also in order of appearance in the story) gives greater power to attacks and increases the area of their action. Typically Jak's normal moves, when unaffected by any kind of Echo, are mainly punches and kicks, both of which are equally effective. But that's not all: the curious protagonist is also able to swim, to cling, as well as to jump. This last action in particular is of considerable help, in fact, with the pressure of the X key while you are already in mid-air, he performs a spectacular double jump, which can also be used, if desired, to end up on the heads of the enemies and eliminate them, just like in the good old days of Mario. Of course, hearing the description of what is possible to do, many will have thought of something already seen too many times, but rest assured that it is not the case at all. There are many game situations and the fun is immediate, thanks to a rhythm that from the very first moment seems to rise more and more, giving the whole a depth and involvement that other products today are hardly able to convey. For example, it is enough to take a look at the many sub-games that break the presumed monotony attributable to this type of video game in due time: apart from small and very curious sections, such as those in which we will have to fish, the lion's share is also held by various moments where we will command a sort of anti-gravity motorcycle (really exciting to drive) without which it would not be possible to complete some levels. Dreams begin to come true As if that weren't enough, the immense playability of J&D is accompanied, not to say supported, by an excellent technical realization to say the least. First of all, the variety of scenarios encountered is immense. During our explorations Jak, with his hapless companion on his shoulder, venture to tropical beaches, gloomy islands shrouded in mist, rivers of lava and submerged cities. To further diversify the settings there is the splendid representation, naturally accelerateda, of the passage of time, through the alternation of day and night on the screen. This will naturally have consequences in terms of graphics (in the different management of shadows and lights), but above all of atmospheres, which are already enchanting and able to give the player the real feeling of being inside a fairytale world. It will often happen during the action to stop for a moment to admire all the small details present, designed to make this game a great masterpiece. The precise color choices, effects such as rain and snow, transparency, heat distortion, are wonderfully accompanied by high resolution textures among the best ever seen on this console. The powerful graphic engine developed by American programmers causes the visual horizon to extend to infinity, thus allowing us, if placed on some hill, to observe places that can only be reached with a few minutes' walk. Notes of merit continue to be there also with regard to the animations of the protagonists. From a technical point of view, they represent a decisive step forward compared to the past. Each creature present is now even composed of about 3000 polygons, which is six times the number of those used in the Crash Bandicoot series. In full Disney style, not a single frame has been omitted, bringing out one of the happiest choices by Naughty Dog, firm in wanting to include in the final version of the DVD the option to select 50 or 60 hertz depending on the television you have available, and very useful for not losing anything of the speed and fluidity of the original NTSC standard. Hence their other ingenious intuitions, so rare in the eyes of us European gamers: the total elimination of the annoying black bands above and below the playing area, and the cancellation of the universally hated jaggies through the abundant use of the anti -aliasing. Finally, even those who own the PS2 Pal will be able to enjoy a full-screen title, without playlists, and which runs at 60 fps! These days (see Devil May Cry) it really seems unbelievable! The artificial intelligence of the enemies is also good, who will not just attack according to predefined patterns, but will adopt different strategies according to our movements, until they follow us wherever we go. The last impressive technical aspect of J&D is the continuous access to the DVD operated by the game code, the so-called ~streaming~ loading, which allows the exploration of the various levels as if they were a whole, without pauses or interruptions of any kind. Perhaps the musical themes are subdued, certainly audible, but placed too much in the background compared to the impact they could have had in a playful system of this kind. However, even this slight imperfection is ~smoothed~ by the excellent implementation of the dialogues of all the characters (of Daxter in particular, since speaking is the only thing he can do for the entire duration of the adventure), dubbed in Italian in a truly masterful. Standing ovation In conclusion, this is without a shadow of a doubt one of those very rare games in which to be able to find some flaws you really need to be cynical and damned cruel in your soul. Fortunately, however, not even with this behavior does J&D's perfect playful architecture reveal even a minimal crack to our careful research. As already mentioned, the background music is certainly not up to par with all the rest, but with a longevity of this thickness (with a total of almost 20 hours of gameplay) and with an average difficulty certainly worthy of a very broad target, I think no one will ever seriously notice this flaw. In short, this latest creation by Naughty Dog seems to be the most concrete answer today to all the insinuations that the underrated hardware of the poor Playstation 2 has had to undergo up to now. Seeing is believing. Pros: excellent graphics on all fronts splendid atmosphere and very addictive rhythm of the game that is never monotonous Daxter will make you laugh Cons: mmm .... not at all charismatic music your girlfriend could force you not to go on with the adventure in her own right absence Don't miss: Exclusive interview with Naughty Dog The return of the Naughty Dogs This Christmas will see the arrival of a series of titles whose development has finally been completed after years of work. Among these there is one in particular, of which we have heard so much especially in recent months, namely this Jak and Daxter: the Precursor Legacy, the latest creation in chronological order by the authors of the Crash Bandicoot series, the Naughty Dog. Having abandoned the orange beast to its fate, the house founded by Jason Rubin and Andy Gavin has given life to a new game universe, designed to go beyond being a simple 3D platformer, and in which it is for the first time his appearance a very bizarre duo, precisely Jak and his friend Daxter. The story is immediately quite engaging and makes us understand what awaits us in the continuation of the adventure. It all begins with the fault of the reckless Daxter, who has turned into a weasel after falling into a basin of dark Eco (an evil force of nature), and who, thanks to Jak's help, tries to recover his original appearance. However, this is possible only by managing to find the wise Gol Acheron, who is said to be able to dominate Eco energy in such a way as to be able to restore his true appearance to the victim. Unfortunately, things seem to get more and more complicated as we go on; we will thus be drawn into events that are much more intricate than we could have imagined.", "date": "2001-12-13", "grade": null}
