{"name": "Gotham a pezzi", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lego-batman-il-videogioco-recensione_b.html", "text": "Watch out for those two But let's go step by step: the structure of Lego Batman is halfway between that of a classic adventure game and a scrolling fighting game. The Batcave functions as a central menu, fully explorable (and complete with a butler) from which you can access the various chapters and levels, as well as the options. The levels always have a very defined structure that begins with the usual platform-fighting part and ends with the battle for the boss on duty. Everything is introduced by beautiful videos made with the graphics of the game and without dubbing: in fact, the characters limit themselves to emitting various grunts and making gestures so that a real dialogue is not then necessary to understand what is happening. The plot of the game is actually rather weak and obvious and sees the various villains of the Batman series, from the Joker to Catwoman via the Man of Clay and the Scarecrow escape from Arkham Asylum and turn the streets of Gotham City upside down. Once the movie is over, the player finds himself in the shoes of Batman and Robin (it is possible to choose which one to use by pressing the Y key) with the aim of advancing through the level by solving puzzles and eliminating the various enemies scattered around it. Combat takes place essentially by pressing two keys: X and B. The first allows a quick attack such as a punch, or by keeping it pressed it activates a sort of boomerang, which can be addressed via an awkward viewfinder to hit objects from a distance or enemies stationed on roofs or balconies. The B key instead has the function of grabbing the enemies, and by pressing a second time to hurl them in the desired direction. As previously mentioned, unfortunately the artificial intelligence of the enemies and of our companion does not allow a worthy level of challenge since eliminating them is decidedly simple, making the fights almost tedious. The puzzles, on the other hand, are proposed in the form of collaboration between companions. In fact, by taking advantage of the various suits scattered throughout the levels, it is possible to give the various characters temporary special abilities, which allow opening passages for the other character in question as well. Often it is also required to build certain objects using the lego pieces scattered around the level, but even here the game does everything automatically, limiting the player to a long press of the B key. The boss battles are the funniest part of the various levels, as each one proposes a different small puzzle to be defeated, but never anything particularly complicated even at the most advanced levels. There are also game levels in which to use the various means of transport supplied to the two heroes, such as motorboats, cars or planes, creating a good diversion from the game structure. The sick side of Gotham City But the best mode of Lego Batman is the one that allows the player to put himself in the shoes of the bat man's enemies and thus see the plot of the game from the ~wrong~ side. The central menu in this mode becomes the Arkham Asylum and the ~bad~ characters turn out to be much more charismatic and fun to use in the end, as they have various powers such as the one that allows the Riddler to control the mind of enemies for example. This introduction also brings an increase in the longevity of the title which thus presents two parallel stories. Longevity which for such a game is decidedly high and increases exponentially when playing with a friend. In fact, it has a cooperative mode (unfortunately only offline) that allows another human player to take control of the second character to stay close to you throughout the course of the story mode. As you progress through the game, various characters are unlocked that can be used in free mode which allows you to replay the various completed levels by choosing the hero or enemy that suits you best. It is also possible to create a character from scratch, mixing various pieces of lego (hair, face, chest, arms and legs) and save it on the hard disk to use it again in the future. This feature that allows you to create LEGO abominations such as a cross between Batman and Joker is particularly fun. No online, no parties From a technical point of view, Lego Batman is not lacking, but neither does it make one cry for a miracle. The environments disappoint enough, as they present a mixture of LEGO objects such as crates, characters, cars and so on, however, combined with a ~realistic~ backdrop and not made up of the usual bricks. This creates a sort of visual contrast to the player who immediately notices which objects are ~active~ on the game screen and which ones he can destroy or not. It would have been better to amalgamate everything by creating a realand the world of LEGO, perhaps less beautiful to look at but decidedly less contradictory. The realization of the characters, on the other hand, is excellent, both in the animations during the game sessions and in those during the various movies, especially in the reproduction of the facial expressions which often amuse by how well they are made. The sound sector instead sins and not a little in almost all its parts. Apart from the few almost always trivial and repetitive music and the total absence of dubbing (but this is negligible) the game is also lacking in sound effects, few and often recycled during the various levels, while those of the movies are saved. The total absence of the online game then in a title like this which makes the collaboration between two players the main pivot of the whole adventure, only increases the regret for what LEGO Batman could have been with a little more attention towards the adult audience. Xbox 360 goals Unlocking Lego Batman achievements isn't easy. In fact, few are related to the story and are unlocked automatically, most of the points must be earned by doing certain actions, combos, collecting various objects or through the prolonged use of some powers. In any case, just finish the game once by reading the objectives page to unlock the fateful thousand points, or at least you can fix it through the free mode.", "date": "2008-11-12", "grade": "7.0"}
