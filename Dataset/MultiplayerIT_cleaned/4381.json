After the titles hit the market at the end of 2017, gamers who own the peripheral have continued to ask for games that were able to offer that extra push to make the purchase. A push that has so far been largely lacking, because if it is true that experiences like that of Skyrim VR undoubtedly deserve to be experienced in virtual reality, it is also true that often the most complex games to arrive on PlayStation VR are those that can also be enjoyed without have the viewer. Ad hoc titles like Statik remain in the minority, and while The Inpatient was half a misstep, we find ourselves constantly looking for a game that can take advantage of virtual reality to show something meaningful. The Swedish team Fast Travel Games tries it with Apex Construct: let's find out what it is. Father versus mother Let's start from the beginning, or from the moment in which the nameless protagonist of Apex Construct is brought to life. To do so is an artificial intelligence that calls itself Fathr, which after providing us with the necessary paraphernalia explains that the world as we knew it no longer exists, following a cataclysm that has upset the physical laws and the conformation . In the new place where we find ourselves moving, there is therefore the need to re-establish the order of things, not without encountering difficulties: in fact, there are some robots between us and success, unleashed by another artificial intelligence. The latter is called Mothr, it is apparently very similar to Fathr and, given the name, complementary to it. Right from the start we are made to understand that the two artificial intelligences are actually opposed to each other, and while Fathr continues to explain to us from time to time what happens by speaking directly in our heads, Mothr actually seems to be the villain of the situation. Soon, however, things begin to appear different from how they seemed in the beginning, thus pushing the player to go forward in the story to dissolve their doubts. From this point of view Apex Construct undoubtedly does its job well, dragging the wearer of the helmet to find out more about the two figures, accompanying the story with notes, collectibles and other elements to be viewed during the approximately five hours necessary to complete the game . Playstation 4 trophies No platinum for Apex Construct. The Fast Travel Games-branded title in fact presents a single gold-type trophy, accompanied by only one silver and thirteen bronze ones: rather strange, considering that it is a game that can still count on a certain duration, as well as a price of 29.99 euros. To get the most out of it, however, it is necessary to discover all the secrets presented by the game, with the very probable need to carry out a second raid once everything is completed. For the rest, we find actions to be carried out during the various levels: nothing particularly complicated. A bow for a friend The game dynamics of Apex Construct have ups and downs, linked to the various aspects that are part of them. Starting with movement, for which both teleportation and free locomotion are available. After trying both modes, you end up preferring the first on a permanent basis, as the second appears too little finished to be used by the player without getting headaches. The absence of support for the DualShock 4 controller forces you to resort to the pair of PlayStation Moves to control your character, thus marrying better from this point of view with moving via teleportation. As often happens, the movement of the view can instead be configured to ensure that it occurs at configurable angular intervals, but even in this case there are problems: to turn in one direction, in fact, you need to press the triangle button of one of the two PlayStation Moves, simultaneously giving direction with it. However, it often happens that the system does not register the lateral movement of the controller, triggering the one hundred and eighty degree inversion set by default just by pressing the button without movement. This is a problem that risks ruining the gaming experience, and unfortunately it is not the only one: it gets even worse when we are dealing with the various alphanumeric keypads present in Apex Construct. Interacting with the buttons means moving the two PlayStation Moves to simulate pressing the keys, but the precision required to perform such movements without worries is probably too excessive for the technology in use. The combat phases are the most pleasant ones, even if they are not without flaws. Forto defeat the enemy robots we have at our disposal a bow equipped with different types of ammunition, to use which it is necessary to mimic the positioning and release movement of the arrow. This is done by using a PlayStation Move to hold the bow, moving the other with a press and release of the back button to initiate and fire. Net of some inaccuracies in tracking movements, the overall experience is undoubtedly positive, as we said, as it allows you to engage in rather interesting distance duels, also thanks to our character's low tolerance for blows suffered. To overcome this problem we also have a shield, to be used with extreme care to avoid death. The problem related to the latter is not a trivial matter, given that in the event of a defeat, all the experience points (which can be used to enhance one's equipment) accumulated up to that moment are lost, with no possibility of recovery. A big bitch, above all because to regain these points there is no other solution than to restart the level. Even the management of the movement during the fight is rather uncomfortable, especially when the enemies pass behind us, thus forcing us to abandon our position by force. Lights and shadows The contrast between what is appreciable in Apex Construct and what instead makes you turn up your nose continues even when you look at the composition of the levels. The game is able to present itself with its own identity, although the setting soon ends up feeling like it has already been seen together with a bit of everything else. The actions to be carried out to advance lead us back more or less always to the same activities, just as the enemies certainly do not shine for their number of types. As far as the purely technical aspect is concerned, the Swedish team has done an excellent job, demonstrating that despite the well-known limitations dictated by the hardware made up of the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation VR combination, it is possible to obtain something more than the first titles as far as it concerns the graphic detail. A normal evolution of things, thanks to the experience gained in the meantime on a general level in the development for this platform. The inventory management is very nice, which with the two PlayStation Moves allows us to scroll and select the objects we want to use. The sound is also good, accompanied by music that encourages involvement, while as regards the language, we point out that Italian is not available.", "date": "2018-03-03", "grade": "7.0"}
