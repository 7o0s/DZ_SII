{"name": "Loop Hero", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/loop-hero-recensione.html", "text": "A core loop, in terms of game design, is a set of linked actions that are repeated several times within a game, of which they represent the fulcrum of the playful flow itself. Basically the core loops are the primary game systems, those that define the gameplay in its identity essence, and around which the entire game experience is built. For example in Super Mario Bros. a core loop is jumping on platforms, while in any Call of Duty it is shooting at enemies. Loop Hero was born from the analysis of the core loops of roguelike role-playing games, of which it is proposed as a true and proper representation, in its essentiality. We can define it as a ~meta video game~, as we will see in the Loop Hero review, which not only manages to involve you in an incredible way despite having essential and minimalist mechanics, but also allows you to reflect on the actions that are normally performed in games of the same genre, exposing them without mediation. History Game artwork Loop Hero tells the story of a world with no memory, erased by the magic of a very powerful Lich. The inhabitants of this wretched land live in endless chaos, unaware of what has gone before them and the cause of their oblivion. However, a heroine endowed with great power arrives to break the plots of the evil creature: knowing how to remember and keep the memory of the world, despite the Lich's spell. Gameplay A loop is basically a circular path Loop Hero essentially consists of two parts: the first, the planning one, allows you to build or improve the buildings of the protagonist's camp, to choose which cards to take with you on a mission, to build objects and equip them to get bonuses, to choose which class to venture into the loop with and more; the second is the actual adventure, in which the chosen character runs several times an initially empty loop (apart from slimes), which must be filled with tiles linked to the selected cards, so as to place places, enemies (the fights are automatic), decorative elements of the scenario, special objects and so on. The player does not guide the hero directly, but manages his expeditions in the loop: using the cards as already explained; speeding up, slowing down or stopping the game time; assigning the equipment found and choosing the talents related to level growth. Progression is tied to two key factors: the first is the loop itself, with monster levels increasing after each loop; while the second is the passage of time, which makes enemies appear linked to the places remembered, at different rhythms depending on the card to which they are linked. Higher-level enemies give higher-level items that grant a better chance of progressing in the game, i.e. not dying. Also, being able to face more enemies increases the chances of finding useful and non-junk items. In all of this, in order for the loop boss to appear, enough cards must be placed on the map, so as to transform the starting camp, the point where the loops begin and end, into the enemy's base. In addition to equippable items, heroes will also find raw materials in their adventures, useful for improving the camp in the planning phase. In case you are killed, however, you will keep only 30% of the materials found. There are only two ways to keep them all: defeat the loop boss or return to camp before it appears. Sounds easy, to put it this way... Pure engagement The deck of cards is essential As mentioned at the beginning of the article, Loop Hero is nothing more than a representation of the core loops of roguelike RPGs, transfigured into a playable form. That doesn't mean that it doesn't offer different levels of complexity and that its formula doesn't work, despite playing in the open. Indeed, the more the adventure continues, the more difficult and exciting things get, so much so that if you let yourself get caught up, it becomes really difficult to get out of the loop created by Four Quarters. Loop Hero has a lot to offer, more than meets the eye at a superficial glance, and despite having played more than forty hours to write this review, we have a strong feeling that there is more to discover. Please note that some of the unlockables have the effect of completely changing the way expeditions are played. In particular, the playable classes are all unique and require careful study of the moves to be made to get the most out of them. For example, after a few hours of play the necromancer class is unlocked which turns out to be completely different from the two that had been used up to that moment, i.e. warrior and assassinno, with its being about summoning a small army of the undead. Even the cards can change the games a lot, as well as the discovery of some combinations (some cards can be combined on the map in order to obtain different effects: for example, by arranging 9 rocks in a 3x3 square, a mountain is created from which harpies descend ), which can greatly simplify or complicate life. Just one note to make The player's camp Despite the almost poetic choice to focus the experience on infinitely repeated basic mechanics, Four Quarters has not forgotten to take care of the other aspects of the game. Technically Loop Hero is very simple and offers well designed pixel art graphics, but made up of very small objects. Not bad, since it is functional to the action and that is enough. On the other hand, the care for the narrative side is interesting, with the dialogues between the characters that often turn out to be unusually deep, focused as they are on the videogame meta nature of the game. It almost seems that some characters try to tell the player what he is actually doing, creating very deep, almost sibylline exchanges in their wavering between the game and what is behind the game. Some dialogues are really deep If we had to necessarily find defects in Loop Hero, we would say that in the long run it can become repetitive and that it is far too punitive on those who do not study its mechanisms in depth, to the point that many will find it difficult even to overcome the first boss. In these cases, the Four Quarters title becomes almost a puzzle game, in which you have to understand which is the best approach to defeat the most powerful enemies, managing the inventory as needed. The problem is that mechanics like these can be really obscure, given that the overall simplicity of the title tends to underestimate the challenge. Other than that, there's very little to complain about.", "date": "2021-03-07", "grade": "8.8"}
