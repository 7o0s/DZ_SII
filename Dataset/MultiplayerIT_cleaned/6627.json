It is precisely with this spirit that the guys from Tapinator present their Combo Quest, a curious cross between fantasy elements, pixel art graphics, a rhythm game structure and a Flappy Bird approach: will it be an interesting mix or an indigestible minestrone? The pace of combat Being a pure and simple arcade, Combo Quest doesn't even try to outline a plot, simply putting the player in the role of a knight committed to defeating all the enemies that stand in front of him. If the premises are not exactly original, on the contrary the gameplay is absolutely fresh and particular, moreover fulfilling with great diligence the duties of simplicity and immediacy typical of mobile gaming. As mentioned above, the title develops as a succession of clashes with white weapons regulated by a game system inherited precisely from rhythm games. There is a bar at the bottom of the screen, with an indicator that goes back and forth, and the user has to try to tap when the cursor passes over blocks of different colors according to their function: yellow ones and green ones allow the protagonist to deliver respectively a light and a strong blow while the red ones allow to block the opponent's attacks, but there is no shortage of variants that give access to different actions, such as for example those of breaking the enemy's shield or instantly freeing the slash from all red blocks. Each successful tap allows you to load a special attack that can be activated after a series of at least 5 hits, the power of which varies according to the length of the combo itself: however, it takes a pinch of strategy to decide when to use it, given that as the value of the combo corresponds to an increase in the speed of the indicator, which obviously makes it more likely to run into some errors, thus seeing the tap counter reset. Combo Quest is a fun mix of genres that risks having a short life, however The blatantly arcade gameplay of Combo Quest is accompanied by some simple but effective RPG elements, such as for example the damage done by the protagonist regulated by the classic virtual dice roll typical of all role-playing games. Furthermore, at the end of each fight the player can decide which parameter to increase among the three proposed, randomly selected from a list that includes minimum and maximum damage, vital energy, special blow power or health restoration. Despite the decidedly nice and friendly look, strong in very pretty pixel art graphics and captivating musical accompaniment, Combo Quest doesn't take long to prove to be a rather tough nut to crack: already the first boss that appears in the tenth battle requires a certain effort, and all subsequent enemies are positioned in a constant escalation of difficulty that soon reaches very high levels. A good incentive for lovers of challenges, but the feeling is that Combo Quest would have benefited from a system that allowed for minimal growth of the character between the various games, which instead does not happen: when you are defeated you simply have to start over from scratch, without the possibility of carrying equipment, objects or skills with you. Only the online rankings remain as an incentive to improve, a system that is fine for pure arcades, but which in a title with RPG nuances like this seems a bit limiting. So here, once the enthusiasm of the first games has waned, Combo Quest risks being reduced all too soon to a simple pastime to be faced occasionally, when instead it could have been a sort of retro-style Infinity Blade. Finally, it doesn't help that the look of the enemies is rather anonymous and that the succession of the same is always the same, when instead an extra touch of randomness would have helped to spice things up a little.", "date": "2015-01-15", "grade": "7.4"}
