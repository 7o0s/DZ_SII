Perhaps also for this reason, its charm remains intact over the centuries, with the magic of those immense green expanses, perfectly cared for so as not to disturb too much the path of the small flying balls, which remains and strikes regardless of everyone's social status. and also by whether or not we are interested in a sport in which one has to try to knock a ball into a hole in the least amount of shots possible. Mini-golf, on the other hand, is based on reflected magic, proposing a small version of golf declined in the most imaginative ways possible, an idea from which Flappy Golf 2 seems to take a lot from in conceptual terms. Obviously the title brings to mind the famous Flappy Bird, but in truth there aren't many references, apart from a certain correspondence in the mechanics of flight, here re-proposed with a winged ball as the protagonist within intricate paths suspended in the style of a imaginative mini-golf. Here too there is something to fly, therefore, and try to keep it in the air regardless of the obstacles that stand in the way of the screen, therefore the reference becomes more solid in hindsight, but the game mechanics of Flappy Golf 2 are then decidedly different, as well as being based on a rather original flying technique, which characterizes the entire gaming experience. There is a lot of Stickman Golf, a previous production by Noodlecake themselves, in this title, to which however the new fundamental dynamics of flight to create something decidedly different. Flappy Golf 2 shows us how it is possible to make a golf ball fly without using a club Golf with wings The structure is extremely simple: it is about reaching the hole in the least amount of ~strokes~ possible, just like in classic golf. Only that the blows are not with a club, but are flapping wings, which can be performed using the two appropriate keys on the screen, one to fly to the left and one to go to the right. Each press of the keys corresponds to a ~wing~, which partially lifts the ball making it carry out an arcuate trajectory, therefore it is a question of calculating gravity and timing to try to reach the goal by flapping the wings as little as possible, possibly also exploiting the particular conformation of the levels that can offer support points, descents and springboards useful for saving wing shots. Sudden changes in direction obviously lead to sudden changes in the trajectories of the ball and these too can be used to reach otherwise inaccessible points, considering that collectible objects are also scattered along the paths that present further challenges to complete. The ability to tackle any level at any time, without necessarily having to follow the expected order, allows you to avoid the frustration of getting stuck somewhere, as well as guaranteeing a continuous variety of scenarios and situations, being able to immediately choose from a large amount of game solutions. In addition to the single player, in which the levels are tackled simply trying to stay below the established par with various rewards depending on the amount of swings made, in Flappy Golf 2 there is also a multiplayer sector that allows you to tackle real online and local racing. The austere simplicity of the gameplay is reflected in the graphics of the game, essential but relaxing and pleasant, with the representation of the levels in 2D in clear colors and an extremely classic side scrolling.", "date": "2016-10-21", "grade": "7.3"}
