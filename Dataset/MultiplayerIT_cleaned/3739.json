It is a revised, expanded and corrected version of the Enderal total conversion for The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim, dating back to 2016, which recently landed on Steam, collecting enthusiastic comments and obtaining a great success with the public. For the record we are not talking about the classic mod that adds a few hours of gameplay to the basic title, but about a completely new and autonomous game, set in a world different from that of Tamriel, which requires more than seventy hours to be completed and to be stripped to the bottom more than a hundred. SureAI, the team that was responsible for making it, has essentially taken the Bethesda title and modified it in everything, including graphics, obtaining something unique that, if it weren't for the need to have it in the Steam account for installation , would only vaguely recall Skyrim, it is so different conceptually. Let's say that here we are from the parts of the Gothic series or Kingdom Come: Deliverance, to frame the game philosophy well. More than an Elder Scrolls Yet the start is typical of the Elder Scrolls: in the role of a clandestine boarded a ship to seek his fortune on a new continent, you soon find yourself alone and lost in a hostile world, awakened by terrible dreams full of death and terror. The first hours of Enderal Forgotten Stories act as a tutorial, while being anything but affordable. Before arriving on the continent and starting to explore it freely, you have to overcome a series of dungeons where you can recover the original equipment and become familiar with the game systems. Defeated wolves and giant insects, and avoided powerful trolls, we enter a world that literally makes your jaw drop, it is so alive and full of things to do. It is not wrong to say that it is much more dense than any Elder Scrolls, at least the last few chapters. The reason is simple: where Bethesda continually resorts to compromise solutions so as not to alienate the mass audience, SureAI does everything to offer a hardcore experience designed for a user passionate about role-playing games. Wishing we are more from the parts of Arena, Daggerfall and Morrowind than from those of Oblivion and Skyrim itself. So we have enemies that aren't leveled with the player, making some places initially inaccessible, living and dynamic cities full of characters to talk to, and gear that truly reflects the efforts put into it. No loot for action RPG rats, then. The progression system of the character itself is designed to favor a more radical approach to the entire experience: the growth of skills takes place by reading tomes that allow you to spend the accumulated experience points, tomes that obviously need to be researched, especially the rarer ones, and which force them on dangerous journeys. In this way a more varied approach to gameplay is favored and, above all, it becomes essential to visit all the beautiful corners of the continent, characterized by a much more varied and rich geography than that of the Elder Scrolls, with places of great beauty, whether they are natural landscapes or buildings with very particular architecture. Enderal Forgotten Stories, where to download it and requirements Downloading Enderal Forgotten Stories is really simple, as you just need to go to its Steam page and install it. The only prerequisite to be able to download it is possession of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (the regular edition or the Legendary Edition). Enderal Forgotten Stories of its own is completely free. If you like, however, you can support the development team with a donation or by giving them money on Patreon. Bethesda, learn Other aspects of Enderal Forgotten Stories are also impressive, starting from the strictly productive ones. The initial objective of the player is to get in touch with a group called The Order, to then unravel the mystery of the terrible Red Madness, a disease that is plaguing Enderal. The story told by the game isn't particularly original, but honestly it doesn't make you regret writing much more 'expensive' titles and as the missions go by it turns out to be really intriguing. Also noteworthy is the effort to dub all the dialogues, which is not often seen even in commercial products. Needless to say, Enderal is also excellent from a technical point of view and doubles Skyrim (the basic version) of different lengths, thanks to the support of the modder community, which made it possible to implement advanced rendering effects and provided great quality, but also thanks to the wisdom of the development team, who worked a lot on the architectures and the plandscapes, to create fascinating places of them, which amazed regardless of textures and light effects. The soundtrack also deserves applause, not very original but characterized by really beautiful and engaging classic fantasy songs; the perfect accompaniment to our adventures. Conclusions If you own Skyrim and are passionate about RPGs, you really have no reason not to download and play Enderal Forgotten Stories: the quality is that of a commercial title, if not better in some respects, but it's completely free. Some ingenuity emerges here and there, but the Forgotten Stories version is much more evolved than the 2016 one and honestly we have seen much worse in triple A productions, both in terms of writing and in terms of game systems. Just think of the latest Bioware productions... If we had to give it a rating, it would certainly have been well beyond nine, to say how much it involved and convinced us. In short, not giving him a chance would really be a crime.", "date": "2019-04-03", "grade": null}
