On air since 2010, it has been able to win over a large chunk of aficionados thanks to its particular style outside of any scheme and the bizarre stories in which Finn, a teenage boy, and his best friend Jake, a dog endowed with magical powers like that able to grow, shrink or transform into numerous forms, they live in the post-apocalyptic land of Ooo. Developed by the popular software house WayForward, already the author of a thousand games among which we mention only the tie-ins of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the remake of Duck Tales, Despicable Me and Spongebob, thanks to the renewed Cartoon Network license they were able to get their hands back on Adventure Time giving a sequel to the adventure already released last year. Like any videogame conversion of a TV or cinematic success, the developers are faced with the fateful crossroads: to satisfy all and for all the fans, or to create something new and innovative to expand the experience and the background of the original series? The new Adventure Time: The Secret of the Nameless Kingdom is a game mostly balanced on this second category, looking for new spaces in which to move, new narrative plots but with an adventurous gameplay very similar to the cartoon. From the first game screen it is clear what his sources of inspiration are. The typical bird's eye view, the little hearts at the top left to remind us how much energy we have, a small sword in hand and lots of bushes to cut to look for hidden items. What does it remind you of? Older people and retrogaming enthusiasts will jump off their seats, it's The Legend of Zelda. In all respects, in a form poised between homage and shameless plagiarism. Plagiarism that wouldn't even be such a negative factor, given the many strengths of the Nintendo saga, even if the sense of deja vu and the general flaws of Adventure Time soon make us regret the original from which it takes hands down. Adventure Time is an action adventure with role-playing game elements, drawn in a cartoon style that vaguely recalls the 80s thanks to the large pixels of the character and the bright colors of the textures, barely hinted at and very simple even if the whole background is high definition like most titles today. The style is well suited to a cartoonish conversion, with uniform colors without many shades and marked tones that recall the television original. Probably drawing the entire game in high resolution would have been more pleasant and satisfying for our tired retinas, now accustomed to everything and its opposite. The protagonists of Adventure Time are back, with a Zelda-style adventure bordering on plagiarism! The weight of the burden on the shoulders When you clone a masterpiece, the risk of crossing the threshold that separates the realization of good ideas from a general sense of the ridiculous is very subtle. It would be like creating a FIAT that looks like a Ferrari, then discovering that the heart of a diesel Panda beats inside a glittering bodywork. To each his own, one would think. But what is Adventure Time, other than a shameless NES clone of The Legend of Zelda? The sense of familiarity that the game gives is obviously a positive factor. The Nintendo title comes to mind not only for the design of the game interface or for the view and movement settings, but also for many other details. Many monsters and enemies, the look of the dungeons, the scrolling of the map and even some sound tunes are borrowed from one of the most famous sagas in the history of video games, but not with a style and ways to pay homage to it but almost with the clear intention of doing a copy-paste of everything that identifies the reference title, but without ever going further to find some alternative solution, some news or some intuition. Adventure Time: The secret of the Nameless Kingdom is also a title from 2014, i.e. eras and centuries after the release of those first Zeldas, in which certain game mechanics and a particular use of the directional cross certainly did not hinder its diffusion and success . Nowadays some solutions appear at least out of place, think for example of scrolling the pages when our character moves from one screen to another on the map, or using the Xbox 360 pad to move the protagonist in just 8 directions rather than in three-dimensional space. Adventure Time is a good video game which, however, curls up on itself, in a spiral involutil, engulfed by the weight and the Nintendo burden that he constantly carries with him. Those who have never tried The Legend of Zelda could find many interesting ideas in the WayForward game, but on the contrary those who know it will only compare everything they see and experience with their hands with the original, the engine of inspiration that moves the whole cabin. The Adventure Time map is large, the enemies are well characterized, the dungeons are nice, but all of this obviously remains unapproachable and unapproachable to what the original The Legend of Zelda proposed. These inevitable comparisons only diminish Adventure Time, paradoxically obtaining an effect opposite to the one anticipated. The title almost never completely captures the player's attention, except in rare moments when the interactions between the protagonist (who has to save three lost princesses in as many temples) and non-player characters are really nice and funny. Xbox 360 goals As per tradition, this Adventure Time: The Secret of the Nameless Kingdom also lets gamers unlock the canonical 1000 points, through 35 objectives that are quite easy to obtain with the natural progress of the game. Most are obtained by simply progressing through the adventure and completing bosses and dungeons. Some objectives are tougher, such as the one that requires you to collect all the objects that exist in the game, or complete it without buying armor and sword upgrades. In certain situations, extreme. Inevitable comparisons Given the necessary premises, Adventure Time is a pleasant, well-constructed, at times engaging game with flashes of comedy all to be enjoyed. Its real problem is the equation between expectations and what it actually offers to the player, who cannot be fed a Zelda clone and then make no effort to improve at least the overly ~vintage~ aspects of a game perfect, but in the 80s. The taste that remains in the mouth is that of a mere copy paste failed badly, with some winning ideas not well developed, an ideal view for this type of game (but with a loading scrolling definitely avoidable nowadays), the way of moving, moving and making characters interact (perfect for a cross and eight-way mindset, much less with a modern joypad in hand). In short, this title is an endless sequence of good opportunities, almost all betrayed by the shadow of a master with shoulders too big for anyone and a mentality in making games that would need some improvement and adaptation in 2014.", "date": "2014-12-24", "grade": "5.8"}
