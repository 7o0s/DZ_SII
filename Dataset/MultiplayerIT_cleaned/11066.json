We have seen it with MOBAs, with Battle Royale and with other genres, but the best example is always that of MMOs with a World of Warcraft capable of capitalizing on the huge fan base and essentially annihilating any competitor. There have certainly been titles that have tried to establish it, some even succeeding like Final Fantasy IV, but the Blizzard universe is still there to look down on everyone. Now, however, something is moving. In the last period there has been an exodus which has also helped The Elder Scrolls Online to grow in terms of player population. People have come to Bethesda's MMO attracted by the quality and quantity of content (with Blackwood leading the way in the last cycle of expansions) and by the absence of a monthly fee, which has definitely made access to the game much more attractive . In order not to slow down this growth, a new update arrives halfway between two major expansions, which does not bring radical changes to the game system but which gives new life to adventurers eager to try new things. The Elder Scrolls Online: Waking Flame thus presents itself with two new dungeons, a series of bugfixes and changes that are not overwhelming, but enough to keep you entertained for a few extra hours. Let's find out in the review of The Elder Scrolls Online: Waking Flame. Two dungeons and little else The Knights of the Silver Rose await you in Red Petal Bastion While we usually find ourselves discussing the continuation of the main plot, the background of new characters and how they fit into the story, with Waking Flame things went a little differently as the two new dungeons are almost completely unrelated to the events seen in Blackwood. We will therefore not find ourselves having to face Lord Dagon and his delusions of omnipotence, but rather to confront ourselves with two new missions determined to stand on their own legs and ready to pave the way for future content planned for Deadlands. In short, an asset for those who do not have too many interests in the plot and are only looking for new things to do on The Elder Scrolls Online, less so for those who crave continuity in the narrative and love having content after content with a single common thread that continues the story of the season , a bit like it happened in the last few occasions. We therefore find ourselves in our hands a simple transitional DLC at the usual cost of 1500 crowns which offers two dungeons that are very similar to each other visually in the initial parts, but well characterized once explored in depth. Red Petal Bastion is located in the Glenumbra region: here the knights of the Silver Rose have defended Tamriel for years even if something dark has been happening lately. From strenuous defenders of the lands, the knights have become barbaric looters, amassing enormous wealth within their bastion. It will therefore be up to the player to enter the fortress and find out what is happening, perhaps recovering some precious relics in the meantime. In Dread Cellar instead we will have to investigate incredible magical forces that are turning upside down what was in fact a prison, in a whirlwind of events between spells and enhanced beings. They are two rather short dungeons and both include only three main bosses, with the need to enter with an organized group or expert players to unlock additional bosses and further secret passages, hidden by the activation of some magical platforms. In normal mode, the two dungeons of Walking flame are exhausted in a matter of minutes and are suitable for those who approach the game in an extremely casual way. Dread Cells is much more evocative Although the two dungeons end quickly, the time to be able to find a group with the dungeon finder is starting to take quite a long time and, unfortunately, with the increase in the challenges available and the addition of new sets, once the first wave of enthusiasm to recover specific mazes is starting to get quite complex. This is a problem that Zenimax Online will necessarily have to remedy over the next few months, in order to avoid that all the contents gradually become excessively diluted, even at the cost of foreclosing access to some old instances. The variety of the two settings is not marked as in the past but rather, as already anticipated we are faced with two bastions that are very similar to each other in terms of panorama. The diversification increases as we enter the dungeon with the scissors ready to open more and more if we take into consideration the opponents to face. On the one hand, in fact, humanoids await us, on the other we will find demons and abominationsof all sorts. The mechanics of the bosses of both dungeons are also fun in normal mode, although they do not represent any revolution in the case.", "date": "2021-09-17", "grade": "6.5"}
