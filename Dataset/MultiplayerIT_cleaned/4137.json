Terrible Posture Games had already tried with Tower of Guns to hybridize the roguelike genre with that of first-person shooters, adding a pinch of bullet hell. Having achieved some success, despite all the limitations caused by the application of random map generation to a type of game that gives its best when strictly controlled by the design, it has worked, in collaboration with Grip Digital, to expand and refine the same formula, producing what we can consider as the ideal sequel to that experience. Game mechanics Mothergunship begins by throwing us right into the heart of the action. We are aboard a spaceship and we must clear the various rooms of enemies to advance to the first boss. Between one section and another some characters explain the basics of the game and introduce us to the thin plot, which serves more than anything else as a justification for the incessant action: there are robotic aliens who have invaded the Earth and we must be able to stop them , attacking their ships in search of information and resources. The first spaceship serves as a large tutorial that introduces us to the basic concepts of the game, including the construction of weapons. Around the levels there are coins and mechanical parts that can be used, in order, to buy the latter so as to assemble ever more powerful weapons using crafting stations. Between the levels it will also be possible to improve the armor we wear during the missions in various ways, in order to increase its resistance, mobility or other characteristics such as the detector of secrets. Once a level has been passed, that is, a mission has been successfully concluded, we return to the bridge of our spaceship, where the rest of the crew welcomes us with jokes and teasing. After all, the situation is tragic, but not serious, as they say. After carrying out the various maintenance operations, the next mission can be selected from a space map. Some missions are for advancing the storyline, while others are for gaining experience and collecting material. It must be said that even if it is up to us to choose, in truth it is often impossible to advance in the story without having reached a sufficient level to face the next main mission or having found the best equipment. In short, sooner or later in Mothergunship a little grinding must necessarily be done. Gameplay So far everything seems to be flowing smoothly and works even better when you take action. If in the first spaceships the rooms are quiet enough, as Mothergunship progresses it becomes a real hell, with dozens of enemies to face simultaneously that come from all directions, bullets to dodge, secrets to find and millimeter leaps to make. In some situations it seems to dance such is the fury of the enemies that surround us. Some missions also limit the equipment that can be used to increase the challenge. Everything seems to fit perfectly during the first few hours of the game, when the rooms always appear new and the crafting system seems to make even the craziest weapons possible. Too bad that some design choices end up making the whole experience worse: let's take the weapon crafting system, which begins to reveal its potential only after many hours, that is, when we are allowed to buy what we want with the coins found. Until then, all our projects seem to have been entrusted to chance, or rather to what luck grants us. Honestly, we would have preferred immediately to be able to keep something of our equipment. Fortunately afterwards, when we have some initiative left, it improves exponentially becoming what we had dreamed of it being since the first hours of the game. Otherwise the main problems of Mothergunship are basically the same as Tower of Guns. The random generation of maps works well as a stand-alone feature, but after repeating very similar rooms for the umpteenth time and facing the same enemies, the gameplay inevitably becomes repetitive, causing the player to lose all taste for exploration. In fact, what should be one of its strengths ends up suffocating it by condemning it to a kind of perpetual exposure of its limits, with some mechanics losing their playful consistency game after game. Randomly generated maps also have another problem: they are stylistically very anonymous. Sure, new graphics are added from mission to mission and some rooms appear more pleasant than others, but there's never a sense of aesthetic unity behind what you see. TOAt first you don't pay much attention to it, because you get caught up in the pace of the game, but in the long run it's inevitable that you'll start to feel the weight of it. Graphics Other alleged flaws of Mothergunship actually fall into the larger discourse of personal expectations. Some have harshly criticized its difficulty, when in reality it is one of its strengths, at least for the target audience. It is true that we die a lot and often (some characters even joke about it) and that when it happens towards the end of a particularly long mission, the temptation to scream curses at the sky is really great, especially for the progress that ends up in smoke, but is a roguelike with bullet hell elements and nothing different could be expected. Those who want it are probably attracted precisely by this intrinsic nastiness, a foundation for the entire experience and certainly foreseen by the design. Mothergunship aims to make the proverbial seven shirts sweat, especially in boss fights and mini bosses. If this is not what you are looking for, look elsewhere, but it is not fair to accuse the title of Terrible Posture Games of not being what it never wanted to be. The technical side also deserves a few words, even if it has already been partially covered. As mentioned, stylistically Mothergunship is an anonymous title. The levels and enemies are far too generic to remain etched in the memory, also because dozens of them are usually faced at a time. The bosses are better, often big and really grim, but never exceeding in visual refinement. Let's say that they express their wickedness well, but that, size aside, they suffer from the same problems as their smaller companions: they are anonymous. They work, and that's all.", "date": "2018-07-21", "grade": "7.0"}
