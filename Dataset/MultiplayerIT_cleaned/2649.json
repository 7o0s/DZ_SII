Initially the classic sequence of television footage is missing to switch to a more modest succession of CG (computer graphics) scenes. Just choose to play a friendly match to be immediately catapulted into the ice arena, with a splendid sequence with which the players come out of the locker room and are cheered by the crowd. Apart from this small introduction, it can be said that the game has really nice graphics with exceptional animations, but with the usual lack of cleanliness of the silhouettes that is found in all the games released so far, all for the not using anti-aliasing. As already seen on other titles in the EA Sports series, also in this game it can be seen how the players and above all their physiognomies are reproduced in a superb and extremely realistic way But how to play ??? It must also be said that the public, which seems glued to the stands, was not made very well; moreover, the graphic engine has some strange slowdowns in case of use of a more ~aerial~ camera, which however would better allow the development of the actions, thus making it almost useless. It is difficult to explain how it is possible that a machine like the PS2 can't handle the game ... perhaps we need to give the programmers some time to understand the secrets of Sony's hardware. For the rest, the game is a lot of fun and even those who don't chew ice and hockey sticks will have a lot of fun setting up actions that will also turn out to be very spectacular. Of course, even at an average level, scoring a goal in the tiny opponent's goal isn't very simple, but nobody likes finishing matches 1000 to 1000, above all because a point scored with difficulty gives much more satisfaction, provided of course that this isn't frustrating and I don't think so. this is exactly the case. Very interesting is the use of a bar located to the right of your team's name, which indicates the additional emotional boost given by having scored a goal or better by the support of the public. This is essential to be able to win the more advanced challenges given that the overall level of difficulty of the game will tend to increase from game to game I don't know! But this is a good game! Word of... Drawing conclusions, it certainly cannot be said that the NHL is a masterpiece, but given the presence of numerous teams and above all the wide choice of parameters, as well as various tournaments and matches, we can say without a shadow of a doubt that we are faced with a good title that will delight all hockey-loving PS2 owners and all those who want to get closer to this picturesque, but very fun (and tough) sport. By BOC Hockey? What is a brand of chewing gum??? Italy is a football-loving country, but this does not mean that sports that are not played 11 against 11 and with a ball are disdained, on the contrary EA Sports thus offers us the latest update of the NHL series, which makes its appearance on the PS2 with chapter 2001. Already aware of the goodness of past products, I actually had a good impression of this title. 1", "date": "2001-01-11", "grade": null}
