Since when do we find it so normal to see titles like Zelda, Castlevania or Advance Wars side by side on store shelves with games designed and created with mathematics??? Yeah, math, the same subject you hated since elementary school, that almost killed you in high school and that you badly digested in college... Now marketing has turned it into a video game. Forty-four cats in a row of six with the rest of... ten! Yes, the power of marketing: being able to get parents to buy a video game thinking that this will make their children less ignorant! But it's always about games... The first was Mathematics Training and, obviously, along the road marked by the latter, the first clones and self-inspired titles begin to appear. Test of Ten: Adventures in the World of Mathematics is one of these, to differentiate itself, however, it focuses on a more playful and less academic aspect and on the intent to interest even the little ones. To reach this point it was decided to create a big and big game world, full of a hundred strange creatures with funny and childish names and divided into zones with even more silly and childish names The pretext for wandering around these lands - desolate? - is given by a story perfectly in line with what has been said before: simplistic and confusing at least for those who may be over ten years old. Hence the need to face the various characters one by one, each specializing in a specific mini-game, up to the final test of the area, after which you can access the next one. Nothing striking or innovative therefore ... The actual exploration of the game world takes place in an outdated way. We are at the start, in fact, still in our tent/shelter and from here we can access the next screen by clicking on obvious sensitive points or by overcoming simple tests. Ten decille for me, may be enough... The world around the tent, however, contains nothing but characters who offer more or less important advice, or ~passwords~ which oblige, pretext, to explore these sections since they are required by some characters in the main game in order to continue. The whole thing is useless and this is also badly disguised. The actual game begins when one decides to face one of the goblins. At that point, just go to your tent to bring up the perfectly ordered and numbered list of bosses. Just select one to start exploring the area relating to that character at the bottom of which we will have to face the various tests. This walk to the minigame happens exactly as described above and is honestly the most boring part of the game as it involves neither a challenge nor an interest, just a simple filler. Everything is extremely repetitive but it can be useful to find some help points to use later in the tests. These can be found exactly like the rest by clicking on the ~usual quite obvious sensitive points~ We therefore find ourselves listlessly erasing on the DS in the throes of boredom! The time has come to tell the real fulcrum of the game: the concept of ~deciglia~. This is nothing more than any operation, stroke of the nib, touch, drawing that results in the numbers ten, twenty or thirty or so on. Four plus six equals ten? Do the blocks of a pyramid lead to the number twenty? A boat carries bubbles to which we must add the number five to reach the result of thirty? Here these are all decillas! All the thirty-six mini-games are built on concepts of this simplicity, which are indeed very varied and some are even very nice, but never of mediocre quality. Baby, how much is four plus six??? The biggest trouble of the game is precisely this basic monotony that pervades it from the very foundations. The genius of Nintendo titles was precisely that ~academic~ aura that managed to attract young and old. Going to weigh down a formula of this type in a trivial and unsuccessful way has not led to good results. The boring exploration manages to bring even the large group of mini-games with it to the bottom of the abyss. Although they don't shine as originality or as fun, they still manage to do their job at the end of the fair. Too bad that some seem to be duplicates, others are simply stupid and another set is so shamelessly intended for children that it is also unsuitable for the latter. There are many examples - some already mentioned - and we can also mention the little game where you cover with a stone the number that prevents the formation of a deciglia, the one where you have to count up toten and, again, the one where you have to write the number which, added to a hidden digit, creates a ten or a twenty or a thirty All thirty-six are on the same tenor, with some obvious upward spurts or downward falls. Technically we don't deviate much from the one already seen a thousand times on DS. Static backdrops, minimal animations, ~hand-drawn~ graphics, bright colors and absent special effects. We are usual ~it doesn't do more than it has to do~... The music, on the other hand, is the most boring and irritating you can hear, above all because of the enormous repetitiveness and the hateful little tunes. No sound effects. Finally, the design of the characters is too closely reminiscent of other series already seen, first of all the Tamagotchi and is therefore obvious and redundant on more than one occasion. Comment This is the classic title that can be defined as suitable only for the little ones. A mediocre realization of its distinctive part, the one linked to history and exploration, inexorably sinks even the most valuable and most interesting part: the thirty-six mini-games. These still manage to be enjoyable in the long run, but the rare flashes of genius and fun fade into a sea of boredom and mediocrity. It's a shame because with a little more commitment and a little more effort in making the mini-games, perhaps to be made in fewer numbers, but of higher quality and complexity, it would certainly have led to a fun and enjoyable title for everyone and not just a school age audience. For the latter it could also be interesting... Pros Some nice minigames The little ones shouldn't get bored It's still a good training in mental calculation Cons Averagely mediocre Technical realization at minimum wage Too much oriented to the little ones", "date": "2008-10-23", "grade": null}
