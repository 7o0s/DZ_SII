If you remember correctly with the proven Disaster Report 4: Summer Memories we had expressed our first concerns about the production of Granzella, while appreciating a certain underlying good will especially at the thematic and gameplay level. So how did it go for this video game based on earthquakes, which is being offered to the world in an already not particularly happy period? Is it a Disaster in name only, or also in fact? We will answer these questions shortly, but not after reminding you that Disaster Report 4: Summer Memories will be available for purchase on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and PC at a price of 60.98 euros. In particular, we at multiplayer.it have had the opportunity to dissect the one for the Nintendo hybrid console. Catastrophic plot, but only in theme The plot of Disaster Report 4: Summer Memories can be defined, with joking and certainly not malicious intent, as catastrophic. Not because the narrative rhythms are badly managed or the characters present (with their respective actions) are not interesting: simply, at the center of the story there is a gigantic earthquake, which hits an unidentified Japanese metropolis. On the contrary: earthquake with aftershocks to follow, decidedly intense and punitive. The protagonist of Granzella's title does not have a precise face: it is the player who chooses him, just as he also chooses his narrative background and his ambitions. Where does the main hero come from? Where was he headed before the earthquake? It will be possible to answer these and many other questions by studying the game world well, as well as by exploiting all the various possibilities present: that is, lines of dialogue after lines of dialogue, during fairly long internal monologues and, after the first hour of play , also quite repetitive and exhausting. On the good side there is a beginning in medias res, which immediately catapults the protagonist into the narrative, and into the living and credible game world of Disaster Report 4: Summer Memories. During a bus trip, the tremendous shock arrives, and the world as it had been up to that moment in the city collapses on itself. From now on, the aim is to get to a safe point and, if possible, try to go home. But not before helping some strangers along the way. Gameplay: lots of exploration From a conceptual point of view, Disaster Report 4: Summer Memories is a dynamic adventure, but not of the type proposed in recent years by Quantic Dream or TellTale Games, just to name two of the leading exponents of the sector. First of all, the production of Granzella, with its gameplay, is a title strongly based on exploration: within more or less contained environments, the hero moves around to talk to everyone, touch everything, analyze every object, read each alert, interact with all the interactable. Without this preliminary wandering operation, any possibility of continuing the story is precluded, because Disaster Report 4: Summer Memories is based on events that are activated apparently randomly, in reality according to a precise logic prepared and calculated by the developers. And here's one of the game's main problems: this logic is unknown, and not easily understood. There is no precise indicator that tells the protagonist what to do, or that gives him at least a vague idea of how to do it: yes, there is a compass at the bottom right of the screen, which can also be customized, but it doesn't really help. From the start there is a map supplied, which indicates the highlighted points through a sort of luminous plasters (or slips of paper? Or lines of color?), but nothing more. The only instantly recognizable place in each environment is the checkpoint, where you can rest and save your game. Dialogues and interaction If we had to stop here, Disaster Report 4: Summer Memories would simply be a Japanese title where you run randomly from one place to another hoping that sooner or later something will happen. Let me be clear, this is also the game, but not only. Fortunately the dialogues (internal and with the other characters) as well as the possibility of interacting with the NPCs make the adventure less monotonous than expected. Not always all of this provides an adequate stimulus for progression, at least not as it would be necessary, but for better or worse, most of the time it stands up. At any time there is an opportunity to talk to the other survivors: from this point of view, Disaster Report 4: Summer Memories represents an excellent way to probe the human soul in conditions of extreme hardshipor. How do people behave immediately after a devastating earthquake? Some will try to save their loved ones and ask for help, other criminals will continue to commit crimes (in the initial moments a bad thug will ask us to indicate where his victim has fled to), and we also met a cursed loan shark who wanted to sell bottles of water at an exorbitant price, without even being the real owner of the shop in question. The lines of dialogue and the possibilities of choice are really many, but most of the time they only marginally influence the narrative progression; it tries more to offer a personalized adventure, than a truly branching story. It must also be said that the title will not be perfectly usable for players who do not chew at least a basic level of English, given that neither the subtitles nor the dialogues have been dubbed, translated or localized into our language. Sin. Technical compartment Sooner or later the sore point had to come. Disaster Report 4: Summer Memories presents an obsolete technical sector on PlayStation 4, forgettable graphics, game environments limited in size and most often bare (although credible), and dated visual effects. This on PlayStation 4: imagine the situation on Nintendo Switch, where on more than one occasion we got our hands in our hair. In closed environments, even continuing to explore is difficult, because the management of shadows and lighting has given way to pure chaos and non-existent optimization. Fortunately, both in TV and portable mode, Nintendo Switch manages to offer a version of Disaster Report 4: Summer Memories with frame rate drops that are most often bearable, in the face of an entire absolutely forgettable visual sector. Our advice is only one: if you want to try Granzella's title, which still offers an interesting narrative and around 60 credible and sufficiently varied characters (but with the Japanese clichs you might expect, see high school girls), then buy it on PlayStation 4 or on PC.", "date": "2020-03-31", "grade": "6.5"}
