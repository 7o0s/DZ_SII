Also in this portable incarnation, great care has been placed in the accuracy of the historical setting: weapons, uniforms and settings are therefore appropriate, and the missions - introduced by real films of the time - fit coherently into the framework of the many battles that took place fought around the world. To tell the truth, Amaze has also done a good job of instilling in The Road to Victory that feeling of involvement that has made the fortune of all the previous episodes, expertly mixing scripted events, impactful sound effects, shaky cameras and the constant screams of the NPCs: in short, even on PSP Call of Duty is an enveloping experience, despite the obvious and obvious technical limitations of the hardware. In this regard, the poor definition of the textures immediately catches the eye, which overshadows a graphics department that is however commendable for the quality of the polygonal models and the stability of the frame rate. Less understandable, and decidedly more harmful, appear instead the numerous bugs that afflict the Activision production, and which can also constitute a serious impediment to the continuation of the game: it is in fact not uncommon to come across invisible walls, polygonal interpenetrations, allies blocking the way or bullets coming from who knows where. Contingencies that become hateful and frustrating when they cause the death of our alter ego, given the unfortunate save system of The Road to Victory, which prevents you from recording your progress in the middle of a stage and which ~compensates~ for the gap with ill-timed checkpoints distributed and items such as medkits and ammo that incredibly do not reappear when you are forced to repeat a piece of mission. (Un)fortunately, the Amaze title is rather short, and the 14 missions distributed among the three different campaigns run away quickly, leaving a few little extras and an ad hoc multiplayer mode standing: which, although complete with various modes ( deathmatch, capture the flag, king of the hill etc.) and support for six players, in the end it proves too little accessible and exciting to constitute a serious source of replay value. Duty (who) loves me The control system is another dark point of the Amaze work, for various reasons. First of all, the default configuration provides that the movements are delegated to the analog stick and the gaze to the four front buttons, with a solution diametrically opposite to what is usually done in these cases; secondly, The Road to Victory offers the possibility of enabling or not an automatic targeting system, which if on the one hand helps to compensate for the chronic imprecision given by the use of the buttons, on the other makes killing enemies too much simple, lowering a difficulty system that is already not insurmountable in itself. Playing Call of Duty on PSP, therefore, you have to make a choice like this: go forward like splinters using the aid for aiming or do without it but trudge with difficulty in an attempt to hit your targets using an inevitably cumbersome control system . In any case, it is significant to observe how, despite all the flaws listed so far, The Road to Victory is one of the most successful FPS for the Sony handheld: a conclusion that speaks volumes about the mutual antipathy between this playful genre and the PSP. Among the brightest merits of the Activision production, the considerable variety of the playful action must certainly be ascribed, made possible by a whole series of tricks operated by the developers in order to divert the user from the classic shootings: we therefore often find ourselves commanding turrets and machine guns, hitting enemies from a distance with a sniper rifle, close-range fighting in trenches, and so on. Beyond what has been said so far, La Strada per la Vittoria is fundamentally a title that can be played despite all its macroscopic problems, and which at least holds up the standard of the series in terms of the goodness of the technical realization and spectacularity, with a eye (or rather, ear) of respect for the sound, which deserves to be listened to through earphones as never before. Comment Call of Duty: Road to Victory is undoubtedly one of the best FPS available for PSP. A statement that would seem to clash with the grade assigned, but which finds justification if we consider how the Sony handheld is one of the systems less suitable for accommodating such a geblack video game. The lack of the second analog stick and the imprecision of the solutions adopted to get around the problem are combined in this case with various bugs and a reduced longevity, which diminish the value of a product not without merits but mainly a victim of a dimension to it not congenial. Pros Good game variety High level sound Cons Crippled control system Several bugs, even serious ones Low longevity and difficulty level PSP has often been the object of criticism of all kinds, often even gratuitous, which accused various aspects: among many, we remember the ergonomics, the UMD support, the natural predisposition of the screen for scratches or even the control system, orphan of the second analog stick. A lack, this, which has objectively made itself felt in various titles, and especially in the (few) FPS available for the Sony laptop, which often proved to be very cumbersome. Now, Amaze tries to reverse the trend with a dedicated episode of the war series of Call of Duty: mission succeeded?", "date": "2007-05-14", "grade": null}
