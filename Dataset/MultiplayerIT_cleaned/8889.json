Faced with these two options, the vast majority of developers now choose the Before. And beware, we are not talking about distorting basic systems that are always much more complex than they appear, because retouching them in order to make them more understandable and usable for newbies is a practically obligatory strategy when you want to make your creature more mainstream. Various excellent recent titles have contributed to making the choice even more sensible, capable of proving without a doubt how the difficulty of execution does not always automatically correspond to a great video game of this genre. However, SNK is a curious exception to the rule. The team has such a long and well-established history in this field that it cannot simply be thrown away, especially when we are talking about its best known fighting game series. With The King of Fighters XV, the Japanese team (more than ever oriented towards the rebirth of its well-known brands in the last five years) has therefore opted for a more ~singular~ answer to the accessibility enigma. Indeed, the latest chapter in this legendary series fearlessly embraces its roots and opts for a small mechanical revolution designed mostly to consolidate and strengthen its systems. Some moves towards a simpler approach have been put in place, of course, albeit not necessarily with great cunning... We, of course, have tried everything for a long time, and today we draw the conclusions in our review of The King of Fighters 15. Gameplay: kurai yagare! The King of Fighters XV: Maximaaaa BEEEEEAAAM It is appropriate to start from the combat system, since that is still the fulcrum of every title of this type, and obviously The King of Fighters XV makes no difference. In fact, where most of the fighting games in circulation have opted for shortcuts, facilitations in execution, less elaborate combos and other aids, SNK's latest work has remained quite faithful to itself, mostly re-presenting the bases seen in the previous chapter. Let me be clear, there has been a general simplification and we are far from the degree in fighting game engineering necessary to master XIII... however the game requires a level of skill and training generally superior to most of the competition, due to combinations that can only be performed with great timing and precision, and a general mix of systems that is anything but basic. One of the primary characteristics of the combat system, for example, is the difficult handling of movement. The King of Fighters XV features four types of approach jumps, which combined with a lateral dodge and the ability to run freely offer quite a lot of options when it comes to positioning and offense. Just jumping in the right way in this title is complicated: an instant touch causes fabulous jumps in attack and difficult to counter (with a speeded up version if you touch down first), whereas the use of the super jump instead of the normal one it can allow you to get behind the enemy and confuse him while on parry. This management of mobility and distances largely distinguishes in the game who is really skilled and who is not, and moreover it is not particularly suitable for a pad with a directional pad (especially for those who struggle with quick precision touches). They are mechanics very suitable for a stick, and we would have liked some facilitation for other peripherals linked to an extra key; we therefore believe it is a pity that SNK has not considered this, since it would have made everything more intuitive and easy to use without diminishing the strategy necessary to use these maneuvers. The King of Fighters XV: Angel is back, and all is at peace in the world In fact, in the field of ~facilitations~, the choice of the Japanese software house was perhaps the most banal in circulation: the inclusion of autocombos. Pressing the keys for the light attack in bursts with series specifications in fact gives way to fast combinations that ensure even those who are not able to perform moves of moderate damage. Once again it seems to us a superfluous aid to newbies, because it doesn't put them at the level of expert players in the slightest (the ~real~ combos do infinitely more damage than the automatic ones), but it can be annoying forr average players when abused during online matches. As mentioned above, shortcuts to the craziest inputs and a system rehash to be more pad friendly are smarter ways to go if you really want to grow your fanbase. Out of this dilemma, however, the combat system is solid as usual, and indeed it is potentially a big step forward compared to the previous chapter, because the changes put in place have generally speeded it up by increasing the options. For example, to partially limit the excesses in attack and offer an extra defensive option to those with the super bar available, players can now perform a Shatter Strike, a sort of parrying counter that throws the enemy to the other side of the screen. It obviously has a cost, but it forces those who attack without hesitation to make some calculations before starting the assault. That wasn't enough, the EX special moves (their enhanced version, which uses half the bar) are now usable freely in a similar way to Street Fighters, and with limited amounts of energy available it is now possible to perform some fairly powerful combos, however having to hold all resources for a single Max Mode blast followed by multiple supers. Speaking of Max Mode, here the use of this temporary power-up is less preponderant than in The King of Fighters XIV, partly due to the aforementioned management of EX moves, and partly due to the usefulness of the Max Mode Quick, which allows d 'interrupt specific normals to perform normally impossible (and often devastating) combos. In short, as you can see there is more meat in the fire, and it is always appreciable. Roster and content: dead or alive I will play with you The King of Fighters XV: Never underestimate Terry Taking into account that once again the system is remarkable, it is appropriate to talk about the roster, because a respectable job has been done here too. As you well know The King of Fighters is a three against three fighting game (single fights are available, but the soul of the game is in teams) and this requires a good amount of choices to offer the right variety of combinations. Well, the game offers about forty wrestlers: a starting number that crushes the vast majority of competitors. Let's be clear, we are talking about historical returns in most cases, with very similar move sets to the past and relatively few variations on the theme , yet there has been a good job of rebalancing and general refinement, and it's nice to see how SNK has listened to the fans by re-proposing some teams that are considered ~dead~ because they are in high demand. It's really hard not to find a handful of fighters that suit you in this soup, and considering that various other teams are planned in future DLC the situation can only improve. The King of Fighters XV, approaching in a jump is not always a smart move On the other hand, the modes are less good, which are basically the classic ones that we usually expect from any fighting game. The story mode, for example, is almost the exact same story seen in the past in the series (and in many other sagas): a series of clashes closed by a big battle against a boss, without any variation on the theme. For heaven's sake, it's played, and if nothing else the developers have inserted sensible closures for the plot of each team (it is necessary to complete the mode with specific teams to see the dedicated endings); it's just not the case to expect who knows what commitment regarding the singleplayer contents in the game. The multiplayer instead is a little more interesting, which in addition to the classic lobbies - thank goodness - the quick matches, and the inevitable ranked, offers a 'interesting VS Draft mode where you run the risk of seeing your favorite characters taken by your opponent, and then eliminated from your selection screen. It is undoubtedly a rather nice novelty, the inclusion of which is particularly suitable for this series. As for the netcode, however, our evaluation must be limited mainly to the beta experience, because during the review we found very few online games. We can confidently tell you that The King of Fighters XV rollback isn't the best out there, and hopefully there won't be any matchmaking issues at launch (an ever-present risk), however we still feel the netcode change is a huge step forward and we are happy with the choice we made. Technical compartment The King of Fighters XV: graphically the game won't be beautiful, but it makes its scene We close with the technical sector, an issue that has been discussed for a long time for the titles of the Japanese team. Since they switched to 3D altogether in fact, the developers of SNK have notexactly proved to be dragons in regards to the graphic impact of their babies. However, we find it quite unfair to compare the work done here with the magic of the Arc System or the resources of NetherRealm: The King of Fighters XV does its dirty work, and still demonstrates very significant progress compared to the previous chapter which bodes well for the future. Of course, it is not particularly beautiful to look at, yet it boasts a healthy dose of spectacularity, everything is more detailed and proportionate than in the XIV, and we also appreciated the detail of certain arenas a lot. It could have been infinitely worse. In addition, the game boasts a respectable soundtrack, with an inordinate number of pieces available for listening. However, it is quite clear how the team has tried to offer fans a package that is as complete and representative as possible for the saga.", "date": "2022-02-11", "grade": "8.2"}
