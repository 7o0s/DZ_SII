Over time, the team behind Demon's Souls has tried to refine the dynamics of the product , focusing on the strategic component and therefore on the need to plan one's actions before throwing oneself head-on into a scenario full of enemies. At the same time, work was done to offer the best possible rendering of the mechs, with different interpretations depending on the episode which significantly changed the prerogatives of the experience. In the specific case of Armored Core V, for example, the ACs have small dimensions (they are about five meters tall, on average) and therefore their approach towards the scenario is almost that of a standard armored vehicle, equipped however with heavy armament and of a form most often humanoid. With this episode, therefore, the developers also wanted to emphasize the online component, creating an interface closely connected to the servers and developing a team concept as broad as possible, in which the alliances that are formed have a value both in multiplayer clashes and in offline sessions. What unfortunately From Software has not yet succeeded, and we will see why shortly, is to make the franchise accessible to everyone rather than a niche of diehard enthusiasts. My robot is bigger than yours Armored Core V's single-player campaign is made up of a fair number of missions and can keep us busy for about ten hours or more, depending on the attempts needed to complete the levels and our tendency to also try our hand at optional tasks . The objective, within the various scenarios, is almost always the same: to follow the path indicated to us by the operator and eliminate the enemies that we find along the way. In certain cases we can avoid the clash with the stationed units, for example the ACs equipped with precision cannons, and find an alternative way to reach the designated target, but in principle the variety does not represent one of the strengths of the From product Software. The credits acquired in battle can be spent to customize the mech, which has always been one of the characterizing elements for the series: by accessing the ~shop~ from the main screen, we have the possibility to modify any component and, above all, create equipment that includes variants depending on the type of mission, preferring mobility when there is a need to be quick or firepower and resistance in case the enemy units are particularly numerous. Unfortunately, the implementation of the interface leaves much to be desired, and so the most trivial of operations ends up requiring an excessive number of steps, not to mention the very numerous waiting times due to continuous synchronization with the servers, a decidedly negative aspect and, unfortunately, able to dampen enthusiasm in the bud. In quantitative terms, the offer of weapons and components is good: we can equip the arms and shoulders of our AC with machine guns, cannons of various kinds, sniper rifles, laser blades and missile launchers, in short, everything necessary to overcome any opponent. Weapons and armor generate a weight that the drive unit must be able to support, so in some missions it is even possible to opt for a tracked lower part instead of the traditional humanoid legs. There are many customization possibilities, even from an aesthetic point of view, but generally the game is not worth the candle, given that even a trivial change such as that of the colors takes a lot of time. Playstation 3 trophies There are fifty-one Trophies dispensed by Armored Core V, in a rather casual way to tell the truth: just complete the most trivial operations to unlock most of them, for example completing the individual missions of the story mode or putting your hand on your AC. However, there is no shortage of ~specialist~ Trophies such as those that provide for the achievement of a certain level of experience, or the completion of objectives to be necessarily pursued together with other users. Who doesn't play together... The main screen of Armored Core V considers online and offline elements in the same way, and therefore allows us to manage our possible team, share objects with other members and try our hand at missions of various types, which in their multiplayer connotation often include the invasion of territories defended by other teams. Unfortunately, even here there are several limits to undermine the goodness of the experience: the absurd territorial subdivision dthe user, which clearly goes to the detriment of European players; the possibility, for the opposing team, to disconnect prematurely and frustrate our efforts; the presence of quite a few ~youth problems~ regarding the quality of the connection; the now classic lack of a headset for most PS3 owners, which makes communication impossible. It's a real shame, because the potential of such a structure in terms of fun is clear, with five-on-five battles and even the possibility, for one of the players, to play the role of operator and therefore coordinate the operations of his own group from a strategic location. The gameplay itself is valid, with a good layout of the default controls and the possibility of targeting one's enemies even from a distance, with the right weapons, while on the technical front the extraordinary quality of the CG interlude sequences cannot but clash with excessively ~dirty~ and dark graphics, which show the side to drops in the frame rate during the most agitated situations and which, in principle, do not make you cry for a miracle.", "date": "2012-04-02", "grade": "6.8"}
