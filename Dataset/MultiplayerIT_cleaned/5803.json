Although the fifth episode is still missing, the story actually ends here. The last one will probably be a bridge to the second season, so we can start drawing some conclusions even before playing it. Let's start, for example, with the fact that this was the most interesting episode of the whole series. After the numerous action scenes of the third chapter, the authors found themselves with a large number of characters gathered together for the typical phase in which the allies group together in view of the final confrontation. Unfortunately, the episode lacks the time necessary to properly resolve all the secondary plots, and characters that seemed fundamental, such as Petra and Gabriel, conclude their narrative arc on the sly behind the scenes. Having made the necessary sacrifices to keep the story within the necessary narrative timescales, the authors managed to play out the inner conflicts of the characters in a series of scenes that are decidedly more mature than in the past. Each of these scenes contains a small revelation that brings us ever closer to discovering a secret that changes our point of view on the story. Soren's touching admission and Ivor's partial rehabilitation overturn the judgment we had made about them and the barbs that members of the Order of the Stone launched in past episodes. In particular we understand why the group had disbanded and its members felt so much impatience with each other. It was the guilt and shame for what they had done that made the sight of his old comrades intolerable. Each reflected to the others the lie they had been living since the day they made the world believe they had killed the Ender Dragon. This revelation came to us unexpectedly, as we sank into the chair convinced that we would have gone through another three hours of a roller coaster between Minecraft blocks and puns worthy of a school trip. The series, which began as a comedy adventure, has evolved into a bittersweet adventure. The fourth episode in fact includes a real loss, one for which there is no remedy. Taken as a whole, the series therefore offers a few more emotions than the individual episodes, but the policy of episodic publication leaves no way out. And maybe this time it was Telltale's proverbial shot in the foot. The fourth installment of Minecraft: Story Mode reaches the climax of the story with an unexpected maturity A world worth saving We all know the game system by now, and it does what it has to, that is to carry on the narrative without interrupting it with cumbersome tasks for the player. If you choose these adventures you do it for the story and the pleasure of making decisions (whether or not these decisions have real weight is another matter), therefore it is useless to insist on the paucity of timed events. Indeed, to be generous, there is a nice section in which you have to overcome a labyrinth. Nothing complicated, but after going through the same situations dozens of times, it's still a welcome change. Let's not forget that the series is inspired by Minecraft, so fans can enjoy numerous quotes about his world. The most ingenious is the transformation of the piglet Reuben after his dramatic end. Our beloved pig closes his eyes forever, and while a tear falls to us, a pork steak appears in its place, spinning in the air. Grotesquely brilliant. Obviously the most appetizing part for fans of Mojang's masterpiece are the buildings, and from this point of view Minecraft: Story Mode is almost always monumental in creating the scenarios. So much so that it could make many want to reopen the toolbox and resume assembling cubes (which is also one of the reasons this series exists). A world of maxi cubes might appear a little too crude for an exciting story, but the series can once again count on a stellar voice acting, accompanied by dialogues that in the last two episodes have proved to be more refined than those endured at the beginning of the season. Probably not even in this episode you will feel as if you have made big decisions, but the judgment that the protagonist gives on the other characters depends on us, and allows us to make some small reflections on the sidelines of the story. That said, Minecraft: Story Mode falls short of series like The Wolf Among Us, and a gamer looking for an adult adventure should look elsewhere. However, if you are passionate about the Minecraft universe, or you want tokeeping company with a younger player, this series, in the end, is not a waste of time. And maybe you'll even end up warming to Jesse and his friends.", "date": "2015-12-27", "grade": "7.2"}
