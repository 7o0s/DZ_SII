Matt Tieger, the director of the project, has become famous in the fandom for having pestered Hasbro for months in a desperate attempt to insert the Dinobots in the series, considered by the renowned toy company as obsolete characters to be canceled. In the end he succeeded, to the delight of those thirty-year-olds who grew up on bread, Grimlock and imagination. The Fall of Cybertron is the sequel to War for Cybertron, an action-game from about two years ago that restored dignity to the Transformers franchise after years of silly games and forgettable tie-ins. Initially conceived as a prequel to the animated series Transformers Prime in computer graphics, it is indisputable that the High Moon Studios proposal has gradually taken on its own shape thanks to the stylistic and narrative choices of a team that has not been influenced by the easy success of Michael's films Bay, preferring instead to be based on the original cartoons of the 80s, in a tasty modern key. The first game worked, both single-player and multi-player. Now High Moon tries again, takes aim and pulls the trigger: hit the target? Countryside The decision to curtail the cooperative multiplayer mode has raised many criticisms from fans of War for Cybertron, but after completing it in about twelve hours we can say with great confidence that it is the only weak point of an absolutely fantastic campaign. Having treasured the criticisms received for the discreet repetitiveness of the already excellent previous campaign, High Moon Studios has corrected the shot by making decisive changes that make the new adventure much more enjoyable from every point of view. First, a bit of history: The War for Cybertron ended with a standoff between Autobots and Decepticons on a planet now at the end of the line and The Fall of Cybertron begins just when the Decepticons, led by the indomitable Megatron, attack the Autobots of Optimus Prime as they are trying to leave their world aboard a huge spaceship. This first mission with Bumblebee as the protagonist turns out to be a prologue: the real story begins days before and tells the Autobots' tenacious defense of the Ark, the Decepticons' power games and the discovery of a space bridge that could lead the Cybertronians in an unknown solar system. Well, not so unknown, since it's ours. Almost each of the thirteen chapters into which the campaign is divided offers a different point of view and, inevitably, a different character to play: High Moon Studios has abandoned the solution of the trio of characters per mission, focusing on one at a time without sacrificing the idea of the supporting actors who follow us and interact in the adventure. Everything works much better: not only does the story develop in a more organic and compelling way, but also the level design itself is based on the protagonist of the moment. The developers have in fact forged the missions around the controlled robot and not vice versa: practically every Transformer is characterized by a special ability that drastically changes the gameplay. Cliffjumper, for example, can go into stealth mode and take out enemies with a lethal attack from behind, while Jazz and Swindle use a grappling hook that allows them to move quickly from platform to platform. The idol of the crowds Grimlock is the protagonist of almost two missions, in which firearms are completely abandoned in favor of sword, shield and temporary transformation into a T-Rex, and the immense gestalt Bruticus is controllable for an entire, exhilarating chapter . This new type of structure makes each mission quite different from the previous ones and also presents a certain level of micromanagement: in The Fall of Cybertron the equipment is much wider than before and for each light or heavy weapon there are various upgrades, which can be purchased at Teletraan I terminals scattered across the maps. The player must therefore understand which weapon is most suitable for the character on duty and upgrade it accordingly to unlock interesting secondary effects. Full of secret objects to find and particularly evocative settings, we liked the campaign precisely for the variety of situations and locations, but also for the disproportionate amount of quotes, references and winks to the franchise and its fans, including secondary characters that are used surprisingly for a few minutes and others that will make much more than a cameo, as is the case with the Dinobots. However, the ending opened by a television cliffhanger and the lack of real bosses to defeat, practically present only in the last, epic mission, leave a little unsatisfied.Curiosity Did you know that Hasbro has produced a toy line inspired by High Moon Studios games? Only five action-figures had been released for the release of War for Cybertron (Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Cliffjumper, Megatron and Soundwave) but this time the company decided to go big, launching a much larger line than offers the new model of Optimus, Jazz, Shockwave and other characters, including the five Combaticons to be merged to form the huge Bruticus. Unfortunately, the quality is not up to par with the previous models of War for Cybertron, but collectors are crossing their fingers for the Grimlock which will be released in a few months and which promises really well... Roll out! The control system has not changed one iota compared to The Battle for Cybertron: the controller buttons allow, among other things, to shoot, zoom in on the target, use a secondary object such as mines and bombs, change weapons and jump. A key is instead delegated to the transformation because if you couldn't transform what kind of video game about Transformers would it be? However, High Moon Studios should also be reminded, whose overzealousness in creating a splendid campaign overlooked this important feature of the franchise. In other words, there are no situations in which the player may deem it more appropriate to transform into vehicular form, except when the game itself clearly suggests it with timed escape sequences or long clear roads. The vehicular form is also a defensive asset due to its increased stamina and nearly unlimited ammo, however the campaign is littered with ammo and energy reserves to be gathered making transformation superfluous except as an evasive maneuver. It is perhaps one of the few features that The Battle for Cybertron managed better, the usefulness of which has however remained unchanged in multiplayer mode. On the other hand, the situation seems to have reversed: the prequel surprises for the solid competitive multiplayer mode, at times better than the campaign itself, but the opposite happens in The Fall of Cybertron. The proposed game modes are the same, including the inevitable ~conquer and defend~ and ~team deatmatch~, and there is also the Escalation mode in which players work together to defeat wave after wave of enemies, as in Gears Horde games of War, unlocking bonuses and alternative paths with the money you earn. The problem is that High Moon Studios seems to have decided not to work too hard on this side, simplifying most of the mechanics in favor of a faster and more incisive experience, almost hit and run, but significantly less deep. There are still the four ~classes~ - Destroyer, Titan, Infiltrator and Scientist - which represent the specialties of our robotic alter ego in the field: the Scientist can transform into an aircraft and heal other players, the Infiltrator can make himself temporarily invisible and so saying. We can create our character by choosing the various parts of the body from a limited number of variations and colors which, however, do not allow for a lot of creativity; moreover, we can choose the weapons to use in battle: most are unlocked by leveling up with the experience points earned during the games, as well as the multiple upgrades for each weapon. The main strategic element consists of this, in choosing the weapon and upgrades that best suit our style of play, but there are no longer Call of Duty-style ~perks~ and rewards for streaks of kills or particular maneuvers of guerrilla warfare. The balancing of the classes also seemed a bit superficial to us, with the Titans clearly more powerful than the others, but this is an easily fixed problem with a patch. In short, the multiplayer mode is no longer the best part of the package but an entertainment whose longevity will certainly depend on the player and the support of High Moon Studios, although we doubt that it will extend beyond a few paid DLC packages. Playstation 3 trophies There are 51 total of Fall of Cybertron Trophies: 42 Bronze, 6 Silver, 2 Gold and Platinum. Obviously they will be unlocked by completing the various chapters of the campaign, but also by reaching specific goals in multiplayer, for example by overcoming a certain number of waves in Escalation or personally conquering all nodes in a competitive game. Robots in disguise The Battle for Cybertron stood out above all for the exceptional artistic direction and the inspiration of the developers of High Moon Studios in the creation of characters and locations with an unmistakable and innovative style, modern and detailed but full of referencesto Generation 1 of the franchise. Impossible not to recognize the Transformers who accompanied us for most of our childhood and beyond: the massive and scarlet Ironhide, the doctor Ratchet, the extrovert Jazz, the coward Starscream and the collectors' nightmare Bumblebee, among others . And of course Optimus Prime, who together with Megatron has undergone a complete and inexplicable restyling: as far as Megatron is concerned, something happens in history that involves the change of his ~frame~, but the aesthetic modification of Optimus, both in robotic and vehicular form, does not is explained throughout the game. Nonetheless, the care taken by the graphics in the modeling of the various robots remains unchanged, not only in the character design but also in the meticulousness of the details, of the body parts in continuous movement, in the great variety of weapons that replace the right arm during the shootings. The animations are excellent, especially when we press the transformation button and see dozens of pieces and polygons disassemble and reassemble in an instant. Even the settings have fully satisfied us for variety and spectacularity, thanks to the search for detail and effective plays of light, from the ancient ruins in the Sea of Rust to the twisted remains of the Iacon destroyed in the previous episode, passing through the Insecticon area that surrounds Shockwave's tower and the initial/final battle in space between the spaceships hurtling towards the space bridge. The painstaking modeling of each element is unfortunately once again undermined by a mediocre texturing job: we underline that the PC version seems to load more defined textures at a greater speed than the console versions, but they still remain dirty and often in low resolution, as demonstrated chilling close-ups on robots. Among other things, the low quality of some cutscenes is inexplicable, clearly inferior to the non-interactive sequences in real time: a questionable choice which fortunately is limited to a few total minutes. Complementing the fluctuating graphic panorama is an excellent and decidedly epic soundtrack, perfectly punctual in increasing the tension during the firefights or underlining the spectacularity of some situations. The game is completely subtitled in Italian and dubbed in English by famous voices that fans of the series will not be slow to recognize, such as the historic one of Peter Cullen for Optimus Prime, even if there are other famous videogame professionals such as Nolan North, voice actor among the more by Nathan Drake, who lends his voice to Cliffjumper.", "date": "2012-08-27", "grade": "8.2"}
