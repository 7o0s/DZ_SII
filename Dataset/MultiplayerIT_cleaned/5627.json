{"name": "Un'eredit oscura", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/165799-obscuritas-uneredita-oscura.html", "text": "The horror adventure landscape is always very busy on Steam. In fact, many developers try their luck with this genre which, more than others, is capable of rewarding good game design ideas, even with a small budget. This was the case, for example, of Pineview Drive, the debut title by Vis Games which, despite the obvious limitations and exasperating backtracking, allowed the German team to bring a second game to Steam. Obscuritas thus takes up the mechanics and atmospheres of its predecessor but expands them over the course of twenty-nine levels, to the benefit of the variety of situations and the sense of tension in the player, grappling with dark and disturbing settings. But even this time, many aspects remain to be fixed. Here comes the new adventure from the creators of Pineview Drive: are you ready to explore another horror mansion? Sarah said no to estate agents We shouldn't expect any original cues from the plot of Obscuritas, which takes up one of the most inflated clichs of the genre: the inheritance of an old villa that belonged to an unknown uncle. A situation that under normal circumstances, between inheritance taxes and maintenance costs, would lead anyone in their right mind to entrust the property to the first available agency. But since in this way we would lose all the fun, the protagonist of the game, Sarah, rather decides to face a long train journey to discover the secret behind her uncle's estrangement from her parents. Obviously the house is in a state of semi-abandonment and is definitely too big to accommodate a single person. The fact is that the heroine arrives just at dusk and, instead of going to sleep, thinks well of starting to explore every room. Following standard horror logic, Uncle Arthur also decided to put his niece to the test, hiding keys and letters almost everywhere. However, the narrative component remains barely sketched, with the uncle's messages never longer than a few lines. However, it is a path capable of intriguing, at least just enough to proceed one door after another in what in the first few bars seems to be nothing more than a slavish reproduction of Pineview Drive. Hunting for keys If you have tried the first work of Vis Games then you have probably already got an idea of the mechanics that underlie Obscuritas. With a first-person view, the player moves around the villa complex in search of clues to solve the puzzles that are gradually proposed to him. Thus we find ourselves looking for one key after another, to access the different rooms and finally obtain the one necessary to reach the next wing of the house. The mechanism remains almost identical for the first third of the game, with puzzles ranging from reading combinations by candlelight to analyzing paintings and replacing pieces of furniture. But when you start to think that dear uncle has decided to exploit Sarah after firing the butler, the title opens up to new environments and situations. Areas such as the garden, the crypt and the laboratory are real labyrinths, where saving flashlight batteries as much as possible becomes essential. If in the house electricity and candles are a valid aid for finding one's way, outside and in the underground rooms it is practically impossible to orient oneself when the torch runs out. And in the dark it is easier to stumble upon deadly traps. Without going into too much detail, as soon as you set foot outside the villa, dangerous situations become more and more frequent, as do paranormal phenomena, disturbing apparitions and encounters with aggressive creatures. Solving the puzzles also becomes more complex and it is impossible to proceed without a notebook for notes. Unfortunately, however, guessing the solution is not always sufficient to proceed quickly. To artificially increase the longevity, which stands at around ten hours, the guys from Vis Games have seen fit to keep one of the most annoying aspects of Pineview Drive: backtracking. Sarah is thus forced to continually retrace her steps to view the clues and recover the objects, given that the inventory is incredibly limited: we have space for the flashlight, some batteries, a couple of matchboxes and one of the tools useful for solving the riddle of the moment. Only one, when maybe four or five are needed to move forward. The situation then becomes more frustrating given the absence of an on-screen cursor indicator, which would certainly have made it easier to open doors and interact with the environment. Instead we find ourselves spinning around for potTo highlight a handle or to manage to pick up a gear. Watch out for the edges! The technical sector of Obscuritas is scary, but not in a good way. While on the one hand the scenarios are quite neat, with a good variety of external vegetation and furniture, their practical realization rests on an engine that to define backward is an understatement. Even with all settings set to maximum quality, edges are everywhere. An example? The most striking are certainly the trees, which up close reveal a perfectly rectangular section of the trunk. Even the effects aren't particularly advanced, with overall sufficient lighting that gives rise to disturbing dynamic shadow plays on more than one occasion, which is difficult to consider premeditated. The realization of the local fauna is also nice: the stream that surrounds the villa is inhabited by insects, fish and completely lifeless mallards, which limit themselves to floating on the water and abruptly changing direction when they collide with an obstacle. Not to mention the movements of Sarah, a girl who always goes straight on her way. In the sense that even when he moves sideways, his legs and arms continue to move as if he were walking forward. However, these are problems that could be overlooked, given that the excellent atmosphere of the game is not affected that much. Instead, what is difficult to explain is how it is possible that, in the face of an all in all poor technical sector, the request in terms of hardware resources is anything but modest. Playing with reflections in real time is practically impossible even with a high-end PC, while our test configuration allowed us to run the title in medium-high quality, without however giving up frequent slowdowns and stutters. Indispensable to keep the atmosphere unsettling, the audio sector is rather good, even if a little too abrupt in the passage from one room to another: hearing the ticking of the clock disappear and appear suddenly with the door still open does not help keep the level of immersion in the game high.", "date": "2016-03-28", "grade": "6.6"}
