We're somewhere else than Threes! which is a pure puzzle game, one of those pertaining to the more classic tradition of puzzles based on mathematics, given that in this case we are dealing with a narrative adventure with RPG influences. What remains constant, from one title to another, is Sirvo's sure trait both in terms of the aesthetic cleanliness given by the particular graphic style of the game, and in the design of its structure, which offers rather original solutions. Guildlings is essentially a parody but also a tribute to the world of role-playing games, in particular to the more classic tradition of these in the institutional fantasy setting. The aim is to form a group of adventurers, the ~guildlings~ of the title, and guide them in a perilous mission to save the whole world, only that the epic tone of such a quest is drastically smoothed out by the disruptive personality of the protagonist and of the various characters, who seem much more interested in solving their small-big daily problems or triggering minor skirmishes rather than dedicating themselves body and soul to the collective good. The story begins with Coda, the protagonist, who obtains a ~second-hand smartphone~ from her sister, but this turns out to actually be a magical tome that allows the owner to become a Guildmaster and lead his own team of adventurers. So, when first turned on, Coda finds itself stuck in a kind of purple bubble, floating around in the form of a spirit guide intent on recruiting and guiding the heroes in the daring mission to save the world. The one released last week on Apple Arcade is only the first chapter of what should be a series of adventures for Guildlings, so it shouldn't be taken as a complete game, even if it already has all the characteristics of a standalone adventure. Its duration at the moment is therefore limited (it ends in about three hours) but the story is destined to continue in the next period, in any case it is already a substantial beginning with comparable contents and those of other complete narrative adventures. A strange world To understand the spirit with which Guildlings deals with the classic themes of fantasy RPG, one thinks of Adventure Time, which may have actually been an inspiration for Sirvo Studios, considering the proximity of the humorous vision of this setting with that of the animated series. But also to Earthbound, with which the title in question shares the parody intent and some more technical characteristics, such as the combat system. The protagonists live in a world that gives rise to the classic characteristics of fantasy with extremely current and decidedly prosaic elements, so for example the great mission of saving the world soon becomes saving the appointment of Syb, Coda's sister, who agrees to do part of the group only after bending the ~contract~ as an adventurer to her requests, with a quick change to the ~terms and conditions of use~. Likewise, Chazazz's daring enthusiasm to join the Guildlings group seems more related to the attempt to get out of his condition of neglected nerd who has an effective spirit of self-denial. In general, we constantly witness this bizarre combination of youth comedy elements immersed in a world that still has the typical characteristics of fantasy that makes everything particularly interesting, thanks also to the excellent writing that supports everything. The narration takes place mainly through dialogues, visualized as a constant chat between the characters, complete with emoticons, young neologisms, attached selfies and different styles to identify the different personalities of the protagonists. In this continuous exchange of jokes probably lies the greatest strength of Guildlings, which proposes a narrative that seems fresh and pressing, with non-trivial dialogues and the possibility of choosing the answers to be given in order to influence the development of the story and also to earn experience points to the group with statements aimed at creating a positive atmosphere. The texts are completely in Italian, losing something of the puns and the linguistic game often present in the original version, but still with an excellent translation job. The fights take place in turn and recall the rhythm and style of the classic pen and paper RPGs, but transfigured into rather absurd situations that lead us to fight against refrigerators, garbage crabs and other strange creatures, which is somewhat reminiscent ofor the spirit of Earthbound. However, the mechanics of the clashes are very classic, with the subjective view of the enemy and the possibility of selecting attacks and actions to be carried out with different consequences and influences on the emotional state of the fighters. Among the clashes and dialogues, the game also offers more classic adventure elements: by exploring the settings we discover various scenario elements or characters to interact with, but the puzzles and game situations are generally simple, which makes the fights and dialogues the two moments in which the story generally evolves.", "date": "2019-11-14", "grade": "7.8"}
