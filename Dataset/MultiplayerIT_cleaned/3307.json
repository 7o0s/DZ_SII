It is a silent and brooding puzzle game focused precisely on construction, as befits a Lego title: for once, we return to a videogame interpretation faithful to the classic spirit of Danish constructions, after having seen them applied to a flood of action adventures , often related to movie tie-ins. In this case, however, we go back to the actual construction, even if channeled within a particular puzzle game with somewhat abstract tones, which allows a certain degree of free creation but still within some pre-established rules, given that it is You need to achieve certain specific goals in order to access the next level. There is also a sort of story, which emerges from the succession of seemingly enigmatic fixed screens: it is deduced that the two simple stylized figures made up of a few building blocks represent a father and a son and that the first tries to teach the second the secrets of the construction and adaptation of the elements of the scenario to go from one point to another of the various areas. However, a deeper theme also emerges, which has to do precisely with the essence of Lego: the importance of playing and finding each other, father and son, together with discovering the wonders of creativity through the interlocking of pieces. This is quite evident in the contrast between the rigid and mechanical ~work~ to which the father is subjected in some sections and the tenderness that transpires instead from some moments in the company of his son, discovering the secrets of the construction. Obviously, it is the player who must learn with his son and try to solve the puzzles arranged along the scenarios in order to be able to reach his father each time or some specific objective required to access the next area. Everything remains just mentioned, as there is no type of textual or oral narration, but the expressiveness that is achieved by the two abstract stickers made up of a handful of simple pieces is incredible. The choice to stay on abstractionism and abandon all the more humanized elements of Lego such as the characters and objects more faithful to reality increases the charm of the beautiful metaphysical atmospheres. In many respects, the dreamy and meditative air is somewhat reminiscent of the tones of Monument Valley but the touch given by the use of the typical Lego pieces to build the fantastic dioramas give Lego Builder's Journey a truly unique style. A builder's journey Beyond a very brief introduction with some instructions clearly written on the screen to get us familiar with the control system, Lego Builder's Journey offers no indication of what we have to do to advance in the game. However, anyone who has had to deal with Lego in their life, the real one, will have no problem bringing out their constructive instinct: the pieces to be used are the original ones and their interlocking possibilities perfectly comply with the standard construction rules Lego, therefore it is enough to have a vague idea of what it is necessary to do to reach the conclusion of the level: the steps to be taken then emerge naturally, following the instinctive flow given by the previous experience with the bricks. There is not a great development in terms of puzzle design, given that the joints must follow a certain logic and the pieces are predetermined, therefore the solution arrives without excessive hitches, however there is a notable opening in the possibilities offered to the player of solve the levels in different ways, with a certain degree of choice of the best constructions to carry out in the different situations. Given the objective, in short (to go from one point to another of the scenario, usually) it is not a question of rigidly replicating an imposed constructive scheme but we can choose with a certain freedom the way to carry out the crossing, with the use of pieces different. There are also more rigid puzzles, but these in fact also represent the least interesting moments of the game also because they are less understandable, given the total absence of instructions. Another element that contributes to making the experience of Lego Builder's Journey pleasant is its control system, which manages to replicate the typical sensation of the joint between the lego pieces quite well, following a good physical simulation, albeit quite simple. It is not easy to provide direct control andcomplete the pieces through the touch screen but in this case the operation takes place with an impressive naturalness, making the construction very intuitive even if in some cases there are some problems in detecting the inputs which can be annoying when greater speed is required of execution.", "date": "2019-12-28", "grade": "8.0"}
