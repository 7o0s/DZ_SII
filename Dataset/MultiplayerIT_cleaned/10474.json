Over the years the various chapters released have been able to disappoint or exalt the fans: as in a sort of perennial ~beta~ moves, combat-system, roster of characters, playability have been modified from year to year, up to 2009 with the latest incarnation: King of Fighters XII. The developers have finally abandoned the good old Atomiswave arcade hardware to switch to the Taito TypeX2 card (the same used for Street Fighter 4, Senko no Ronde and the latest Samurai Showdow), more performing and faster even if still behind the consoles housewives on which the same game was then converted. On the official website, the writing ~Re-Birth~ stands out in large letters, rebirth: let's find out together if the modifications, changes and novelties of the XII edition will be able to satisfy the fans who have been waiting for the return of the series for too many years. There is no story One of the main characteristics that has always distinguished KOF is that of having a strong plot behind it and close relationships between all the characters. After the saga of Kyo Kusanagi, that of K, of Ash and the ties with Orochi (Japanese legend to which hundreds of manga, anime and videogames refer), in King of Fighters XII the story mode has been inexplicably abandoned and shelved, favor of a purely linear game system: ~choose your character and fight~. There are only 5 stages, and at the end of the fights the total time taken to complete the tournament is calculated, finally it is sent to the online rankings via Xbox Live (or PSN on Playstation 3). If we want we can repeat each fight once, trying to improve the time. At the beginning you choose three characters and before each fight the order of appearance of each of them. The second mode is online, with custom or ranked matches. Curiosity SNK artists, as we know, are considered among the best and most capable of the entire video game panorama. King of Fighters XII, more than a video game, is almost their bet, given that it is the only game of this generation entirely hand-drawn, frame by frame, character after character, background and related animations included. A work of years given that the last KOF dates back to 2006. Each character has about 400-600 frames, and perhaps for this reason we understand the reason for the lack of a greater number of stages and fighters. Barrel with lag! Unfortunately it should be noted that in the multiplayer game connected to the internet King of Fighters XII undergoes ~slow-downs~, heavy slowdowns, which undermine its genuine playability at the base. For a fighting match game, neutering multiplayer means making it mostly unusable. One of the novelties introduced by the programmer is the ~Guard Attack~, a sort of Street Fighter IV Focus System: in practice, all you need is the right timing with the block button and the opponent who is attacking automatically suffers a recoil. This system certainly disadvantages the most offensive players who, after having performed a particularly difficult move, see it canceled by simply pressing a button, also suffering a counterattack. Another novelty is the Critical Counter: a system that allows you to remove a large part of the opponent's energy with a personalized combo. Indeed, after a few attacks, the counter bar flashes and we can perform a devastating move. The opponent, to protect himself from those few seconds in which he is vulnerable, significantly slows down the pace of the game and becomes very divisive and shy. The frenetic and fast gameplay typical of each King of Fighters has therefore been (partially) affected, or if we want modified. Xbox 360 goals King of Fighters XII is giving away the canonical 1000 points to unlock, mostly related to multiplayer and obtaining a certain number of victories or particular performances (number of counterattacks, combos, score). Some points (few) are unlocked almost instantly, while for all the others there will be a lot of effort. The distortion of KOF Almost all the features that made King of Fighters unique and particular have been distorted, changed or cancelled. First of all, the roster of characters available, historically very large, has been reduced to only 22 fighters (with heavy shortcomings: Shiranui Mai among many). The various ties and relationships that distinguished them have been canceled sincethe lack of a storyline that cripples the single player and less charm and charm to the whole package. The quantity and quality of the stages has been sacrificed (perhaps in the name of the entire work done by hand) by only five backgrounds, even if well built and full of animations. Epic Final Boss Battles are no more. More than a rebirth or the innovations introduced, we therefore find ourselves talking about an involution and what has been eliminated from the saga. The sprites are huge (more than half the TV, in height) but the much vaunted high definition is a mirage: the pixels are nice and big, to the delight of 80-lovers. The pure gameplay is once again the same: fun, frenetic and technical, even if remixed in the moves and supers once again (but this is nothing new, in fact, we are used to the changes). King of Fighters XII is an atypical title among packaged games that can be bought on a store shelf: it is largely incomplete, short, with few options, limited characters and scenarios. King of Fighters XII is, or rather would be, a title suitable for digital delivery and a much lower price. More than a rebirth, we should talk about premature aging.", "date": "2009-10-12", "grade": "5.5"}
