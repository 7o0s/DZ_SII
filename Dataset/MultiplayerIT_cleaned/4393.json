Namco Bandai itself is probably aware of this, coming to totally change course both from a production point of view and from the saga on which to base it. In fact, Fatal Bullet takes its cue from the most mistreated of the Sword Art Online sagas, which abandons fantasy and white-weapon combat to move towards the shores of the third-person shooter. Let's get our hands on: we are not dealing with a beautiful shooter, not even a fantastic RPG, nor a technically excellent title, but after forty hours spent on the game, despite the difficulties in understanding the sensations that arose, we believe we can say that it is the best game based on the famous light novel series. The hard life of virtual reality Anyone who is accustomed to the series, whether it is for the novels or for the anime, knows well that Sword Art Online places its foundations in a very near future in which virtual reality has taken a clear step forward. No more viewers capable of replicating some simple 3D environment, but real cerebral immersions that allow you to project your mind inside a digital body that lives and thrives in a totally fictitious world. Leaving aside the dubious ethical values of this thing, which we are certainly not interested in taking into consideration, a large portion of the gamers of this hypothetical future now live a double life. They form friendships, romances, alliances and feuds within the games. Over the years, the various Sword Art Online sagas have covered different types of worlds, starting from fantasy and then moving towards fairytales, but inserting a purely Western derivation between one and the other and dedicated to earning real money , all based on a post-apocalyptic world where firearms are the masters. The plot, supervised by the same creator of the SAO universe, certainly does not make one cry for a miracle, inserting the classic Japanese anime stereotypes and limiting itself to teasing the player with the appearance of all the old glories of the series, integrating them however in a confused alternate reality in which some of the events we have already experienced seem to leave the various Kirito and company dumbfounded. Let's try to explain ourselves better, without ruining the little surprise that could arise. At the beginning of your adventure you will be asked to create a character from scratch, male or female (this choice will have implications in the advanced stages of the adventure) and launch yourself into Gun Gale Online (this is the name of the VRMMORPG in question). The game is about to receive a big update, with advanced content dedicated to the strongest players and the inclusion of a new type of highly advanced artificial intelligences, necessary to complete it. It goes without saying that, with the protagonist's classic luck, we will acquire one of these AIs on the very first mission that we will find ourselves experiencing, and from there the whole adventure, the discovery of the environments, the continuation of the narration and the relationship with the characters will they will develop precisely on the need to bring our AI back to full efficiency and complete the new content that has just been added. Everything is fine, at least until, just when you are convinced that everything is about to end, a subplot opens up which recalls the same saga seen on the small screen and which creeps between one event and another without a specific reason, as well as deleting some of the awareness that the Sword Art Online experts had already placed in the safe. We will not go further, and we realize that put in these terms it is extremely cryptic, but we are sure that you will realize it the moment it happens. In the abundant thirty hours needed to conclude the adventure you will experience too few moments worthy of being remembered, but we challenge anyone to believe that they are buying a title of this genre and discovering a plot that they will remember for the rest of their days. Playstation 4 trophies Reaching the coveted Fatal Bullet platinum will take you a substantial amount of hours. The 47 trophies, divided into 34 bronzes, 9 silvers and 3 golds, will focus on the completion of the campaign (with the two different endings) and without forgetting those relating to the growth of the character beyond a certain level, the accumulation of resources and the maximum upgrade of weapons and skills. The roundup ends with those relating to the inevitable (but thank God less prevalent than inpast) possibility of deepening relationships with the various characters of the game world, spending time with them, conversing and even getting to be quite intimate. I'll shoot you, you'll shoot As we have already mentioned before, Fatal Bullet is a substantial change for the series. The change of setting in the world of Gun Gale Online has required to turn the fulcrum of the gameplay, which for years has been based on white-weapon combat, towards that of the third-person shooter. Trying to summarize all of Fatal Bullet's myriad of content is basically impossible. It is even more difficult to make a system of this type appreciated by those who are not accustomed to extremely ~Japanese~ titles. Where one would normally expect to find classic third-person shooter mechanics, the DIMPS title relies on an automatic aiming system which is the cross and delight of the production. Although it is possible to aim manually by pressing the left trigger, even to the point of completely deactivating the auto-aim with the directional cross, our dispassionate advice is to keep it active and dose the two possibilities well according to the situation. The whole game is divided between long phases of dialogue, which closely resemble a classic graphic novel, and the overcoming of a myriad of dungeons dotted with hundreds of minor enemies, mini-bosses and final bosses, which inevitably lead to further subsequent dungeons. The combat zones are the ones that suffer the most from a very low level level design, with areas all equal to themselves and often difficult to decipher, to which a simple, clear but not very descriptive map comes to the aid as regards the objectives to be reach and areas yet to be explored. We admit that we have never really lost our way, also thanks to the impossibility of deviating from one's main road, but it is obvious that we are not dealing with a design masterpiece, far from it. Better, but always bare and totally devoid of interactions, are the macro areas that characterize the game world. Mostly desert-like and in line with the idea of a post-apocalyptic world, they are the only ones to leave some small reminder of their structure, thanks to a slightly less sketchy construction and the structure free from labyrinths made up of corridors, only useful for connecting a fight to the next. As for the equipment and customization of your arsenal, this is certainly where the heart of Fatal Bullet is played and it is also the element on which your choice regarding whether or not to buy the game should focus. The whole system is based on the accumulation of materials and projects to be deciphered, useful for obtaining ever better equipment. As you progress through the campaign, you will be provided with information to understand how to move within the various missions (main ones, but above all those relating to treasure hunts and unique monsters) which are nothing more than a sort of end game dedicated to extreme farming. When you are satisfied with the equipped weapons and you have the right materials, you can contact Lisbeth (historic sword art online blacksmith) to upgrade your weapons, which are divided according to a degree of rarity (color) and rank. Each weapon has its own base level, which can be increased twice by substantially and permanently enhancing your guns. If this weren't enough, in the advanced stages of the adventure you will also be given the opportunity to take up two weapons of the same category at the same time. This element, not to be underestimated, allows you to double your damage, without requiring two weapons of the same type or increasing the weight of your inventory, provided you have double the statistics required for the use of a single weapon. This helps us explain how character growth works. DIMPS has implemented in Fatal Bullet a system similar to the one already included in its previous Dragon Ball Xenoverse and which gives a nod to the various Dark Souls (could a reference to Souls be missing in 2018?). Once you have accumulated enough experience points to level up, you will be assigned a certain amount of PP, which you will be free to spend on one of six basic characteristics, ranging from strength to vitality, via intelligence and dexterity. With the newly released patch, the level that can be reached up to 150 has been raised, making the growth and longevity of the title even longer and more lasting than it already was previously. With the addition of a healthy dose of equipable skills and a myriad of gadgets purchasable at shops around town, it becomes clear thea large amount of customization possible, which is not lacking in individual weapons either. As mentioned before, each of them can be upgraded in its characteristics, but if this does not seem enough, you will also have the possibility to spend transformation chips to modify the individual perk of the weapons, ranging from resistance to a specific state alteration, up to to the highest accumulation of ammunition or experience points. Telling you everything that Fatal Bullet has to offer would require an extremely longer text than we can write, but the highlighted features already highlight how profound the experience can be, if you are willing to dissect it to the end. Kirito Mode and Multiplayer Kirito Mode is, as the name clearly states, a separate game mode that can only be unlocked in the very advanced stages of the game, which allows you to make sense of that plot insertion we were talking about at the beginning of the article. Also useful for reaching the true ending, it is nothing more than a revised and corrected reinterpretation (but with the use of some scenes taken directly from the anime) of the story experienced by Kirito in Gun Gale Online. With a narrative device capable of justifying the change of aesthetic appearance and the previous knowledge of some characters such as Sinon, the Kirito Mode will allow you to play the famous BoB (Bullet of Bullets), the tournament played by Kirito during the anime, with intended to track down and defeat the Death Gun menace. A nice extra, extremely simple and very short, but which will leave more than a smile on the mouth of fans. We conclude this box with a few words regarding the multi player, which finally enters the series. Unfortunately, it was impossible for us to try it, due to the almost total absence of users in the days before the release, but you will have the option to join a group of three other players and set off on a high-level treasure hunt, or challenge yourself with other teams to achieve the best online scores. An ugly and empty world From a technical point of view, Fatal Bullet is undoubtedly a great step forward for the series, thanks to the now abused cel shading engine that DIMPS uses for all its games and recently seen in the two Xenoverses. This does not mean that the title is still extremely bare and ugly to look at, with low definition textures and models that seem to be made up of 90% aliasing. The paucity of the settings and the aseptic dungeons only make the situation worse, highlighting an average technical level closer to the last generation than to the current one. It's a shame if we think how interesting it could be to be able to see a title in this series visually satisfying. The sound is sufficient, with some inspired pieces, which reach an average level that we can consider acceptable, without ever reaching peaks of remarkable quality. The Japanese-only dubbing (with Italian subtitles) will delight some enthusiasts and will turn into the nightmare of all those who hate the language of the Rising Sun, above all due to a quantity of dialogues that are always the same and phrases said and laughed at by the various protagonists during their outings into battle.", "date": "2018-02-23", "grade": "7.0"}
