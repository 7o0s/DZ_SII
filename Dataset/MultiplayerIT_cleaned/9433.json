Trapped with him are eight other prisoners, each with a sort of digital watch on their wrist, but useful only for marking their identification number; from one to nine. The mysterious Zero, tormentor and at the same time the only anchor to cling to to escape from that situation, introduces the group to the perverse rules of the game in which he has decided to let them take part, what he calls the Nonary Game: they will have to join forces to reach the door bearing the number 9, within 9 hours so as not to be torn apart by the explosive charge ingested between the moment of the kidnapping and the moment of awakening. The only 9 that will lose consistency, the contestants must soon realize, is the one that indicates all the people who took part in the test. The path to salvation is in fact interrupted by a series of numbered doors that will be opened by groups of three, four or five, adding up the values shown on their bracelets and then again, until you have a single digit - for example 4+7+ 8=19--> 1+9=10--> 1+0=[1]. An approach that will require sacrifices, leaving Junpei's fate hanging in the balance until the end. The ship of mysteries The plot in 9 Hours, 9 Persons, 9 Doors is the main attraction, to the point that its narration, rigorously via screen text, takes over the playful aspect of the experience, making it become if not a tinsel at least a diversion to reading. The good news is that Chunsoft, the Japanese developer, and Aksys Software, the publisher who oversaw the localization for the American market, have done an excellent job in this regard. As can be guessed from what is written in the introduction, the story bases much of its charm on the resolution of an increasingly dense series of mysteries: many and not only related to Zero's identity. What initially might seem like an oriental version of Saw, in fact proves to be a more complex design, dashed with science fiction shades but also a solid writing of the characters. Certainly the style is the Japanese one, it must be liked and certain choices in the characterization of the characters may appear excessive to our eyes, however it is reasonable to assume that anyone who comes to play 999 already has sufficient elements to understand if it is an approach to their liking. Progressing from dialogue to dialogue, from description to description, Junpei will begin to develop different relationships with his fellow sufferers, starting with Akane, a companion at the time of elementary school and for this reason of contrast for the player: apparently a figure of to trust among so many strangers but also a question mark on what kind of relationship really binds them. Of these question marks 9 Hours, 9 Persons, 9 Doors suggests several and this is functional both to the sporadic but interesting choices to which it is subjected - which door to cross? What reaction to the words of another ~competitor~? - and above all to the excellent replayability. There are six different endings which, thanks to the choices on the path to be taken from time to time, can be reached through a good amount of different paths. Which in turn add new details to a mystery that speaks of experiments, missing ships, ancient mythologies and other tasty finds that are the result of good research on sources and an exceptional imagination. The greatest satisfaction given by the game is obtained after the first completions, perhaps by taking advantage of one of the guides available on the Net so as not to risk arriving at the same conclusion twice, when one understands how the adventure itself is designed to be traveled by relying on the notions learned during the games already completed. to know more As mentioned in the body of the review, it might not be a bad idea to accompany the games after the first completion by a good guide among those available online. If after seeing the final six - or if you get tired sooner - you want to go deeper into the subject, the official site is a good source of information, with a very rich section of questions and answers. Just beware of spoilers. Among other things, the atypical structure of the game made it possible to create an ad hoc demo, to be tested via the browser. And the game? Of the eight or nine hours spent glued to the DS to complete 9 Hours, 9 Persons, 9 Doors the first time around, maybe a couple will be spent playing. Three at the most, everything else is taken up with reading. This is because the playful aspect of the experience is limited to a few rooms or small groups of rooms from which to get out by discovering clues, completing puzzles and, as a rulea, retrieving the key to open a door or activate a mechanism. These moments, played with a first-person camera forced to a handful of pre-calculated movements, bring to mind certain graphic adventures in which to collect and combine the objects scattered within the backdrops. There are some reasoning puzzles but they are divertissements that don't affect a rather simple challenge, however well done. In short, the title of Chunsoft does not stand up to the competition with the classic point and click for the simple reason that it does not even compete with it. And even the productions of the late Cing look like monsters of interactivity by comparison. However, the text is not everything and the visual component has received some attention: the drawings of the characters and the 2D backgrounds are accurate, perfectly in style, while the use of the third dimension for other environments leaves us rather perplexed from a point of view strictly technical, while proving functional. The game lacks voice acting but the choice is unavoidable given the amount of work and cartridge space it would have required. It goes without saying that the American version, the only one available in the West, is entirely in English.", "date": "2011-03-07", "grade": "9.0"}
