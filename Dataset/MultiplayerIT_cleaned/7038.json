The hero created by Rebellion is a bit the archetype of the perfect soldier: a sniper with a formidable aim, capable of remaining calm even when an entire squad of enemies is on his trail, placing shots to the head, heart and , the liver and even the testicles thanks to his trusty rifle. The visual results of his shots find ample prominence in one of the features that most characterize the Sniper Elite franchise, namely the X-ray kill cams: when the shot is successful, perhaps because we held our breath to execute it (a practice based on the breath available and which causes a red ~hot spot~ to appear in the reticle which guarantees the effectiveness of the shot), the view resumes the path of the bullet from departure to arrival, highlighting in great detail the consequences of its impact on the body of the victims. What follows is a feast of cracking skullcaps, disintegrating jaws, puncturing internal organs, and snapping bones like twigs, twisting limbs unnaturally. A show perhaps of dubious taste but of great impact, which gives exceptional value to our main weapon (the sniper rifle, to be precise), making it preferable in any situation. After all, the ~monothematic~ connotation of the Rebellion series does not lend itself well to alternative approaches. Sniper Elite III represents a small but interesting evolution for the Rebellion series Let's check in The eight missions that make up the single player campaign of Sniper Elite III refer to the traditional strategic approach of the franchise, which sees us observe enemy units with binoculars and ~tag~ them so as not to lose sight of them, then proceeding to eliminate them way we deem most appropriate. However, the action is less linear than what was seen in the previous episodes, allowing us to decide what to do and when to do it, as well as putting some secondary objectives on the plate capable of enriching the offer and improving its variety. To support this new vision we find broader scenarios, with alternative routes and devices that can be tampered with so that they start making noise and thus cover the sound of our shots. Unfortunately we often run into rather annoying level design ingenuity, such as the inevitable invisible walls, small rivers that you cannot enter or even low depressions that you cannot climb over, and which represent a quite sensational own goal where the intention of the developers was to communicate a certain freedom of movement and action. Let's say that there were certainly better ways to mask the dead ends in the locations. The gameplay prefers sniping, as it should be, but all the stealth mechanics work well and you can therefore penetrate the Nazi camps trying not to get noticed, remaining low and using walls and obstacles to hide from the sight of the guards, except then reach them from behind and eliminate them with the dagger or with the silenced pistol. Leaving corpses in plain sight isn't a good idea either in Sniper Elite III, so in addition to rummaging through the pockets of our victims we can also load their body onto our shoulders and throw it behind a bush to avoid problems. The multiplayer modes The offer of Sniper Elite III is not limited to single player, but also to various multiplayer modes. Firstly, it is possible to tackle the entire campaign in a two-player cooperative, which undoubtedly represents the most interesting feature with regard to online, especially by making an agreement with a friend and raising the difficulty level to the maximum. Other concessions to co-op can be found in the survival (which can also be tackled alone) and in the Observation mode, in which one player has the task of identifying targets with binoculars and the other to eliminate them. There are five competitive modes included in the game, for five maps and up to twelve participants: Team Deathmatch, Traditional Deathmatch, King of the Hill for Teams, King of Distance and Non-Contact. The latest push in particular on the distance approach, even preventing the teams from coming into contact and therefore encouraging them to take a strategic approach, hitting the opponents from hundreds of meters. The shadow of myself It's not always possible to mask your strikes or even body takedownsclose combat, but when we emit a noise and the same is perceived by the enemies, albeit with a view to sometimes controversial audio management, it is possible to recover by moving quickly from the shooting area and finding a safe place at least thirty meters away. This doesn't cancel the alert completely, but at least it prevents all the soldiers in the surrounding area from tracking us down; also because the ~old school~ vital energy management of Sniper Elite III, with the squares to be restored through the use of bandages and medical kits, appears particularly sensitive to enemy fire and therefore a couple of bursts are enough for you to come across the game over and you have to start over from the last checkpoint. Wanting to keep a stealth approach as clean as possible unfortunately leaves room for a ~trial & error~ interpretation of the experience, with quick saves allowing us to resume the action from a few moments before a gaffe: not exactly a desirable solution compared to the concept of challenge and the duration of the campaign, which is completed within six hours but which can be ~lengthened~ or ~shortened~ depending on the approach we choose to follow, as well as the attention we will pay to secondary objectives. It is possible to proceed with weapons drawn in the game, certainly, but in this juncture the Rebellion title shows all its limits, with an often problematic hitbox and certain aspects of artificial intelligence that prove to be fallacious and are revealed in the traditional situations in which an enemy he doesn't notice that we've gone around and arrived alongside or behind him, yet he continues to expose himself without feeling the need to find shelter. The management of special weapons also encounters the same obstacles, in the sense that one rarely feels the need to throw a grenade, create a diversion and even less place a contact mine or dynamite, because those situations from ~ siege~ that abound instead in the horror spin-off Nazi Zombie Army. Even the confrontation with armored vehicles must be carried out with the sniper rifle, however following somewhat too simplistic dynamics (~study~ of the target, two shots on the rear grill and good night). The lack of concrete interaction with the scenario also decreases the potential of bosses with tanks, since their cannon fire does cause a large amount of damage but does not destroy the walls behind which we take cover. Sin. Playstation 4 trophies Sniper Elite III includes 61 Trophies, most of which can be obtained simply by completing the single player campaign on various difficulty levels. There are clearly also more specific achievements, such as the one that asks us to hold our breath for a total of one hour, as well as to carry out certain kills in a certain way. The request in terms of multiplayer is very limited, with only a couple of Trophies to be obtained by playing a certain number of online games. Dreaming of Africa From a technical point of view, Sniper Elite III looks like the traditional ~mixed bag~, perhaps due to its cross-gen nature or perhaps simply because the development team does not yet have that maturity (and/or the economic resources) capable of marking the difference between a triple A production and one of lower carat weight. The debut on next gen was easy due to the great work done on PC, and it is probably also thanks to this experience that on PlayStation 4 the game runs at 1080p and 30 frames per second without particular problems or uncertainties. However, on the Sony console there is a lower definition of the image in general and of the textures, as well as a ~simplified~ rendering of the surfaces during the bullet times that act as a preamble to the kill cams. It must be said that on personal computers the Rebellion title can also count on supersampling, a feature that significantly increases the visual ~concreteness~, although it is only digestible on high-end configurations. In close-up shots, the quality of the materials appears basically the same, just as those elements that make one's nose turn up a bit are identical, such as the relative simplicity of certain polygonal models, mechanical animations such as those of going up and down the stairs and, in in general, the lack of effects capable of making the scenarios less flat. Compared to a location like Berlin in the 1940s, it is clear that the wastelands of North Africa are less fascinating and more complicated to exploit, but there is precisely a problem of ~flatness~ which is not resolved even in night missions, as well as a use of ~standard~ assets regarding the arrangement of rocks and vegetation. The sound can count on excellent interpretationne by Roberto Draghetti, who once again lends the voice to the protagonist, but the rest is a bit inconsistent, with some ~background~ dialogues translated and others not, while the effects are of good impact.", "date": "2014-06-27", "grade": "7.7"}
