In fact, the football simulation of EA Sports once again faces the top of its genre as it has been doing for some time now, successfully passing from the old role of hare chaser behind which the competition has been forced to trudge for a long time. In reality, as we have already seen this year with Pro Evolution Soccer 2017 Konami has continued to make great strides towards its former glory, but the guys based in Vancouver have not been idle this time either. In fact, FIFA 17 presents an inevitable series of novelties in the gameplay, which fortunately - we tell you right away - do not distort the excellent dynamics of FIFA 16: after the crash two years ago, the confirmation of continuing on a game of the highest level allows you to breathe a big sigh of relief. To support the new elements on the field, EA Sports has included changes of various entities in the various modes of its simulation, retouching it in every aspect with the hope of making the whole package even more attractive for players. Dulcis in fundo, the queen of all the novelties this year was the addition of the mode entitled The Journey: our journey within FIFA 17 is right on this side. FIFA 17 enters the top positions among the chapters of the EA Sports football series: that's why! The road to glory After being presented to us in June in the setting offered by Stamford Bridge in London, home to Chelsea's home matches, The Journey has been sipped in every aspect by the developers. The intention was clearly not to spoil the gaming experience for people, as the story of Alex Hunter has a real plot, complete with twists and other events to live up to the final epilogue. Obviously far from us the intention of revealing things that you are destined to discover by yourself, so we will limit ourselves only to remembering what is already known, in order to offer a complete picture of this brand new mode. The Journey sees us engaged in the role of Alex Hunter, son and grandson of art introduced to us during the early stages of a career that sees him as one of the rising stars of the English championship. The ups and downs that can characterize the lives of many footballers are told to us above all through Alex's performance on the pitch, but also through the interlude scenes for which the developers have fielded a truly impressive creation. The characters involved in the story were all played by real actors, called upon to make The Journey as if it were a real film. Like the latter, the story of FIFA 17 will undoubtedly be able to excite: certainly not for its ~drama~ (however dramatic a story about football can be), but for the way in which in some moments it manages to evoke the dream of many football lovers to play on the most important fields on the world stage. It doesn't take much for the player to end up feeling as if it were no longer Alex Hunter who took the field but himself in person, enthusiastically exulting at each of the boy's goals. In terms of gameplay, all this translates into the possibility of controlling only the protagonist during games, thus letting the CPU move the other team members, or take over the reins of everyone, keeping in mind that the goal final is to make Hunter look good. Between a cutscene and a game there are the weekly training sessions, and it is here that the guys from EA could definitely have done a little more: in fact, it is nothing more than the skill tests present every year in the game, re-proposed in various ways in the modes present in FIFA 17. A good expedient to teach newbies how to play, but at the same time a rather boring way to progress those who have been used to this kind of training for years. The result is that they soon have most of the tests simulated on the CPU, aiming only at the games. The second criticism that we feel we can move to the Journey mode concerns its duration: perhaps we were wrong to compare it with what is present in the NBA 2K series, the fact is that everything ends in a few hours of play, inevitably leaving a bad taste in the mouth. Those who expected freedom of choice thanks to Mass Effect-style dialogues will actually find a narrative underpinned by some predetermined key events, whichand therefore leaves very little room for maneuver to the player. Overall we feel we can judge Alex Hunter's adventure in a positive way, seeing it as a starting point for a necessary expansion in the next edition and a pleasant diversion from what is present in FIFA 17. Even if the arrival of Il Viaggio has inevitably monopolized much of this paragraph dedicated to the modalities of this new chapter, it must in fact be remembered that this year's game is full of novelties that embrace all of its contents. At the head of these we naturally find the eternal Ultimate Team, which after the FUT Draft arrived last year, is enriched with a series of challenges on the construction of the road, thanks to which you can obtain rewards by creating teams that meet certain geographical or other type. Daily events will now focus on FUT Champions, a series of challenges scheduled for the weekend to qualify for on weekdays for mouthwatering rewards. Minor changes also concern the Career mode, where the player can count on a new system of objectives to understand how to satisfy his club, now manageable more effectively from a financial point of view thanks to the new tools offered by EA Sports. In this mode, unfortunately, the management of transfers by the CPU still needs to be improved, a little too lively in the market sessions in which you see both prices that are in some cases absolutely out of the market, and investments made by teams in theory already well covered in a certain role. Xbox One goals FIFA 17 offers a total of 45 goals, for a total of 1,000 points. The largest amount comes by completing The Journey mode, for which the game rewards you with 90 points. This is followed by an 80-point reward for scoring a goal with a tight raise from the goalkeeper and another for getting 4 wins in the FUT Draft session. The rest of the objectives naturally embrace all the other modes present in the game, including the women's teams confirmed after FIFA 16. The physique first of all For years now, the team working on the FIFA series has been working on the game engine's management of contrasts, thus demonstrating its desire to take care of a fundamental aspect for what appears to be the simulation of a contact sport such as football. Despite the excellent steps taken in this sense since the advent of the current videogame generation, the so-called dirty work was still partly missing, made up of tight links and upper limbs that work as much as the lower ones. In FIFA 17 it finally becomes possible to use players of the most impressive size to take position on an aerial ball without necessarily heading off, while in the attack phase the player in possession of the ball can use his body to cover the ball, using the same tempo with your arms to keep your opponent at arm's length. Both things described above can be put into practice through the use of the left trigger, which can also be activated in the defensive phase to respond in kind to the attacker's attempt to escape us. During the first few games of FIFA 17 these dynamics hardly seem to make a difference, but just accumulate a little additional game time to realize the new possibilities that open up together with them. With the work done on the management of these contrasts, among other things, EA Sports also seems to have reduced the incidence of awkward clashes that were also seen last year. The list of new features on the field goes on with the new management of standing situations, practically revised in every aspect from the lineout to the penalties. These take some practice to master, but once you get the hang of it you end up appreciating the new level of control over eleven-metre football. For penalties, as well as for free-kicks, it is now possible to choose the type of run-up by whoever kicks the ball, thus influencing the trajectory of the latter. Corner kicks have also largely changed, which like penalties require some practice to be tamed: after a bit of acclimatization, also in this case the choices of EA Sports need to be promoted. The rundown on the novelties in the gameplay is completed with the possibility of crushing headers and making low shots with the double pressure on the appropriate button, together with a new through ball with a less decipherable trajectory to allow players to create new attack situations in an increasingly busy and attentive midfield. We always stay on the green rectangle but switch to the opposing team, to analyze the behavior of the CPU in camp. After years of suffocating tiki taka, implemented in a very unrealistic way even by the poorest teams, the developers have finally taken into consideration the complaints of those who love to play in offline mode, proposing more plausible styles of play. Thus, it still happens to see teams that make phrasing their strong point, but it must be said in the first place that they appear decidedly more ~human~, giving the player the possibility of waiting for the right moment to induce artificial intelligence in error. Then there are teams that use the counterattack and others that prefer to maneuver vertically, thus giving variety to the aforementioned styles and thus solving a problem that has plagued the FIFA series for years. The show of the Premier, but not only In the list of FIFA 17 innovations that have been covered up to this moment, the one concerning the introduction of the Frosbite engine has been missing, instead of the Ignite Engine which had made its debut in 2013. The immediate consequence, according to the developers , it was the possibility of creating Il Viaggio, a modality inseparably linked to the Premier League, a championship with currently unmatched media prominence. Indeed, the competition from across the Channel once again brings with it all its stadiums, updated and improved by EA Sports to really give the player the impression of being in front of a match on television instead of a video game. The glance offered by places like Old Trafford and Stamford Bridge is simply deadly, thanks to the attention to a series of details with which the Frostbite proves to get married. Among the exquisitely aesthetic elements we find the coaches on the sidelines, present with their features similar to the real ones: it is easy to identify Jos Mourinho, Pep Guardiola and Antonio Conte, even if we were a little disappointed to see that Walter Mazzarri's model at least for now it is absent. But it is of course the players who shine in such a situation, thanks to the facial scanning technique implemented for the most famous ones like Eden Hazard. The fact that the Premier League is the central pivot of FIFA 17 does not prevent this chapter from presenting the usual expanse of licenses, in which this year very little was left to the competition: even the Japanese J1 League, once the horse battlefield of the Pro Evolution Soccer series. Turning our gaze instead to our parts, we actually also find Juventus among the partner teams of EA Sports. The Old Lady is present in the game together with her Stadium, while the players' models were made with the same scanning technique mentioned earlier. Although the faces of the various Gianluigi Buffon, Paulo Dybala and Leonardo Bonucci (this year's testimonial in Italy) show a fully satisfactory result, the general comparison with Premier League players leans in favor of the latter, but it is clear that the appeal of this championship is too strong compared to the Italian one to be ignored. In any case, a little more resemblance is beginning to be noticed even for some less famous players in our Serie A, even if for example someone like Gonzalo Higuain continues to be in hiding. Beyond the aesthetic details, during the match there are some more animations between defense and attack, while the goalkeepers have not shown any particularly noteworthy flaws. Speaking of notes, the soundtrack is presented in an ever richer guise, counting within it old aficionados such as Kasabian and their Comeback Kid dedicated to Alex Hunter. We Italians will also be able to recognize the voice of Rocco Hunt, present with the song Sto Bene Cosi. As for the commentary, Pierluigi Pardo and Stefano Nava are back, a well-established formation of recent years: the final result is good with the addition of various phrases, even if not some errors of adaptation to the various situations that occur in the field are missing.", "date": "2016-09-22", "grade": "9.3"}
