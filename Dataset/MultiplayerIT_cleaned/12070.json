{"name": "Overspeed: High Performance Street Racing - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/overspeed-high-performance-street-racing-recensione.html", "text": "Guide model The paths are not totally bare given the presence of elements such as fire hydrants, cars and mailboxes, which will react differently to impacts. During the race it will be possible to opt for different views inside and outside the car, which will surely satisfy any virtual driver. Overspeed's problems are almost all related to the driving model, given that being able to keep the car straight or avoid crashing at every corner will not be a trivial matter. In fact, it is not clear whether the developers have opted for a too realistic driving model or if they have not been able to create an arcade one, much more suitable and fun for this genre of racing game. Unlike other titles based on clandestine races, cars are damaged following the most violent collisions, but by pressing a button it will be possible to repair the vehicle at the cost of a few precious seconds. In this way, winning the very first races will be quite difficult also because one or two accidents are enough to actually have to start over. However, the driving style during the races favors those who decide to play dirty, given that even a small push causes loss of control of the car. Music and atmosphere In addition to the main mode, it is possible to play timed races, challenge the champions in special head-to-head challenges, or launch into multiplayer through the appropriate servers or on the local network. The soundtrack is the classic one, made up of hip-hop songs, and is quite varied, although it is not up to millionaire productions. However, it will be possible to extend the list of pieces by inserting your own MP3s in the appropriate folder in the game directory. There are also some voiceovers, but nothing memorable, and there is a lack of viewers. Outline elements like these would certainly have benefited the atmosphere and pace, allowing the player to load up properly before each race. System requirements Minimum Requirements: Processor: Pentium IV 1 GHz or AMD equivalent RAM: 256 MB Video Card: GeForce 3 with 64 MB Ram Disk Space: 1 GB Test Configuration: Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo 1.66 GHz RAM: 2 GB DDR2 Video Card: Geforce 7300 with 256 MB of memory Comment Overspeed: High Performance Street Racing despite the decidedly inviting price and packaging, disappoints in some respects due to the lack of general charisma and the driving model that is unlikely to meet those looking for a fun and immediate driving title. Graphics and audio are of a good standard and even on PCs with a few years behind them, the game will run quite well thanks to the many parameters available. Pros Inexpensive Decent graphics Pleasant soundtrack Cons Poor charisma Inaccurate and at times frustrating driving model Non-existent sense of speed In recent years, driving games based on clandestine races based on souped-up cars and beautiful girls as choreography, have reached their maximum expression with the Need for Speed series. There was no shortage of excellent competitors such as Juiced and Midnight Club, but at the moment the EA series, also an Olympic discipline at the World Cyber Games, has proved to be unassailable in terms of charisma and gameplay. Overspeed: High Performance Street Racing is a low-budget product distributed in paperback, which in some way tries to get close to the games just mentioned, but as we will see, the distance is truly abysmal. At the beginning we will have to choose the name of our pilot and one of the two cars available, but continuing in the game we will be able to unlock another dozen. Each car has different parameters such as maximum speed, acceleration, power and trim, but in principle these are minimal dissonances that do not change the overall values of the vehicles. To improve the performance of our car, we will have to beat other drivers, betting from time to time on an upgrade from those available. Having won a race, we will be able to mount the upgrade and challenge increasingly powerful and faster opponents. There are four places where you can race, accessible only by increasing our prestige in the street racing arena. The models of the cars are acceptable as well as the theater environments that reproduce some areas of Los Angeles.", "date": "2007-08-08", "grade": null}
