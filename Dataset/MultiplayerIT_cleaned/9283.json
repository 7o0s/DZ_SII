Arriving at the climax of the party, the one in which you remove the dirt from your teeth with a three-meter long two-handed sword, our barbarian friend is attacked by a group of demons. After the first massacre, Garshasp has an intuition and decides to return to his village, which he finds under attack. Unfortunately, he doesn't have time to go down to the valley before an armored guy, armed with a long halberd, kills his brother, evidently drunk, he was so easily defeated, and steals the sacred mace of the people. Now, it is known that a barbarian is capable of enduring all the oppressions that the wickedness of creation can oppose to him, including the rape of wives and the killing of children, but do not touch his mace, because otherwise he becomes furious. And so it happens. Garshasp begins a desperate chase through valleys and swamps, mountains and ancient temples, in search of the thug who stole his mace. What will he do with it since his people have been exterminated? He'll probably make us pesto alla genovese or, on lonely nights... the plot ends here. Nothing great, right? Iranian intelligence Garshasp: The Monster Slayer is an Iranian title that appeared on Steam like a bolt from the blue (in the sense that it arrived by surprise, without anyone in the western world having talked about it). Many users have died trying to pronounce it, others have managed to buy it to understand what it is. The mystery is soon solved: it is a clone of Devil May Cry, or God of War, if you prefer, starring a barbarian. Did you already know? Who told you that? Ah, that's right, you've read the introduction (that's nice, there are also readers who read). The main problem with this genre is that the benchmarks are very expensive productions, which is not easy for an indie developer to contend with. How did the Dead Mage developer group fix it? In the meantime, he exploited the OGRE rendering engine very well, creating good three-dimensional models and designing beautiful textures, then he deliberately chose to widen the shot, creating a fixed direction for the action, which continues except for some films, which he maintains the camera always at the right distance so as not to point out any flaws, which are there. In short, Garshasp demonstrates that by making good use of the means available, albeit few, you can come up with something spectacular and pleasing to the eye. Season everything with some discreet metal music and the technical side is promoted with flying colors. Fight and fight Garshasp fights with a sword, a dagger and, later in the game, a mace made by destroying an ancient fossil (barbarians are known not to be very careful about the protection of the fine arts). He can carry weak or powerful attacks, he can jump, parry, somersault to dodge blows and, depending on the level of the weapon, he can perform lethal combos capable of wiping out enemies. Although it doesn't cause too many problems, we have found a certain ~stickiness~ of the controls in some situations, more so when it comes to performing very precise jumps or negotiating narrow passages. This problem is also felt in combat, especially with tougher enemies who don't go to the ground easily. Of course, we are not at the level of an X-Blades and there are no situations that cannot be solved with a couple of attempts, but a little more precision would not have hurt. The enemies are of different types and range from very weak demons, who die after a few hits, to gigantic behemoths that must be finished off with a sequence of scripted moves. In between are various creatures, more or less armored and all quite repulsive. Obviously there is no shortage of bosses, linked to particularly spectacular sequences, which are more demanding than the other opponents and which require different combat strategies. Each enemy killed grants some experience in using the weapon. Once the bar that collects it is filled, the weapon levels up and new combos are unlocked. Around the areas there are not many objects to interact with. In reality, it's easy to list them all because there are only spheres set on pedestals (red for experience, blue for health), free blue spheres (collecting four of them increases the health bar) and a few levers to press or winch to rotate to overcome very easy puzzles. In addition to fighting, our hero will have to overcome other types of difficulties, such as rather annoying pitfalls and walls to go down leaving slipperywith a knife, where it is very easy to lose grip and be smashed.", "date": "2011-05-12", "grade": "7.0"}
