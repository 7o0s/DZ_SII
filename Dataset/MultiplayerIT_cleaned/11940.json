{"name": "Conan - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/conan-recensione.html", "text": "When it arrived in the editorial office, the new Conan game immediately presented itself in the best possible way, and all thanks to the fact that it takes very closely, in terms of characterization and drawings of the main character, the novel written by Robert Howard, who with his a particular style imbued with violence and personality has attracted a large number of enthusiasts over the years. Having therefore banished the danger of seeing a new transposition of Schwarzenegger also on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, let's analyze this new adventure of Conan the Cimmerian in a little more detail, rigorously armed with axes, knives and a good dose of stress from download. Comment Conan is an ~ignorant~ title in the good sense of the term, a hard and raw hack and slash that fully captures the spirit of its creator, perfect for spending a few hours in the name of fun but also with an excellent variety derived from the system of combos and give incentives to use as many of them as possible. Too bad that it lacks original ideas or memorable moments, and that longevity, as well as extras, is reduced to a minimum. Recommended for lovers of Conan and the genre, also in light of the few alternatives available at the moment. Pros Great variety of combos Fun and rewarding Cons Technically average Low longevity and few extras The Black Death The episode that has just been released in stores can be considered a continuum of the novel, with which it shares the setting and characteristics of Conan, which we could encompass under two main aspects: sex and violence. In fact, starting from the early stages of the game there is no shortage of beheadings, amputations and brutal dynamics in general to get the better of the enemies, together with the rescue of beautiful damsels who have no qualms about showing their breasts and adequately thanking our barbarian (the latter part we infer, of course). However, everything is reproduced, at least according to the writer, in an absolutely non-disturbing or excessive way (but obviously not suitable for a teenage audience) and which fits perfectly with what a person expects when they choose to buy the game for the character it is based on. The story, as often happens in these cases, serves as a pretext for the actual action and for the various settings, but it is also hand-in-hand with Conan, who after a short initial game session finds himself having to recover all the magic pieces of your armor, each of which, almost obvious to say, allows you to acquire a new magic, which can then be selected with the digital cross and pressing the left trigger. The Black Death However, the cornerstone of the production developed by Nihilistic Software is represented by the combat system and the combos available. The brave Cimmerius in fact has three configurations of weapons, those with one hand, those with two hands and finally the double ones, which affect the speed, effectiveness and power of the clashes. The interesting thing is that, especially at the highest difficulty level (there are three available) their use must be alternated based on the type of enemies and bosses. To give some more specific examples, having a sword and shield allows you to deliver light but immediate blows, as well as to parry the vast majority of opponents' blows; the two-handed greatsword instead of shattering an enemy shield or ~breaking~ his block, but feels slow against opponents with fast counterattacks. The combo system fits very well into this context, with an exceptional number of moves that are both spectacular visually speaking (and here the degree of violence reaches its highest peak) and effective to continue without too many worries . The moves are acquired by spending some points, which can be increased by defeating enemies, opening some chests scattered around the scenario and saving the aforementioned damsels. No prisoners The variety of combos satisfies all tastes, with holds (the basic key is the circle), amputations, crushes and throws. As a further incentive there is the fact that every time one is used, the percentage of confidence with it increases and that once 100% is reached, the number of points acquired is doubled, also to replenish one's energy and the magic bar. It is a pity that they cannot be connected to each other and that the large number available makes several unused or little used. To close the picture of the control system we think the X key to jump, the right analog to avoid the blows and the R1 and R2 backbones for some actions based on the game context. No prisoners The course of the action is soon explainedor therefore: blows, blows and more blows, very useful for relieving stress and interspersed with sporadic platform sections and rather elementary puzzles. The fights with the bosses are particularly cared for, which last for several sections and are for the most part interesting, except for a couple that become tedious and the last one is particularly difficult. This is the substance of Conan, which, although simplistic, fulfills its purpose and perfectly embodies the character, giving a few hours of fun, excellent variety and an incentive to continue until the completion of the adventure. Just starting from the duration, however, we recognize the major defects of the title, which we completed after only six hours of play at the intermediate difficulty level, and due to the presence of very few extras, which are limited to some objectives to be achieved during the game, online ranking of scores and concept art viewable in the appropriate gallery. If we add the lack of any multiplayer mode, these absences are quite heavy and undermine the good substance of the title. We dedicate the last paragraph to the technical sector, which enjoys mixed fortunes. Appreciable are the light effects, the reproduction of Conan himself and the style of the settings, as well as the fluidity of the action and the reproduction of the final moves. On the other hand, the polygonal mass, the graphic cleanliness and above all the textures are less, which in various ways seem to have gone on vacation instead of doing their duty. The sound follows the same lines as the graphic part, with motifs that alternate the inspired and the anonymous and a completely Italian dubbing, well done but not too expressive.", "date": "2007-10-12", "grade": null}
