In fact, Hatoful Boyfriend was released in Japan by the author Moa Hato in 2011, never officially arrived in the West due to the lack of translation from the idiom of the rising sun. Thanks to the work of Mediatronic and Devolver Digital, however, the work has finally arrived also in Europe and North America, but available only in English and exclusively on PC. The publisher's means have also allowed it to land on the digital store of the two Sony consoles, with a little delay but some innovations that will make the happiness of those who have remained empty-handed until now. Despite the truly over the top premise, in fact, the title is very popular with fans of the genre who will finally have the opportunity to play it completely translated into Italian. Hatoful Boyfriend lands on PS4 and Vita in cross-buy, cross-save and fully translated into Italian Playstation 4 trophies The visual novel of PigeoNation Inc. offers 17 trophies, of which two are silver and the remaining are bronze. No Platinum given the digital nature of the title, but to get them all it will still be necessary to spend several hours attached to the pad, completing Hatoful Boyfriend over and over again, exploring the various choices granted to the player in such a way as to reach different endings each time. Two is better than one As logical for any visual novel, Hatoful Boyfriend also offers a large amount of on-screen text to read, as well as a good number of choices aimed at giving a specific direction to the unfolding of the narrated events. We will come back to this point later, but now let's focus on the text, the real protagonist of this conversion for Sony systems. As anticipated, Hatoful Boyfriend finally arrives completely translated into Italian, both in the menus and in the texts, unlike the PC version still available today on Steam only in English. In this sense, for all those who would have liked to give it a chance but gave up discouraged by thousands and thousands of lines never translated, it will be possible to enjoy the story at its best, in all its facets, thanks to carefully localized and correctly written texts. Furthermore, given the nature of the title, the arrival on both PlayStation consoles certainly represents the best way to enjoy the Japanese dating simulator in all circumstances. The cross-buy purchase on PSN entitles you to download both the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita versions, with the possibility of switching from one version to another at any time without losing anything in the game in progress given the implementation of the shared save in the cloud. In this way it is possible to play away from home by picking up directly from where we left off on PlayStation 4, enjoying all the features of the portable console in addition; among all the possibility of playing on the move a title mainly to be read. The story of Hatoful Boyfriend lends itself perfectly to a fragmented type of fruition as it is not too long and not too complex either: based on the choices made in the key passages, it can also considerably influence the time taken before arriving at the epilogue, but given the number of not very high characters, it is not difficult to easily pick up the thread of the conversation. In this sense, it is perhaps the presence of in-depth dating simulator mechanics that leaves the greatest doubts about the production, to be framed in a limbo halfway between classic visual novels and real dating simulators. As rambling as it may seem, we will play the role of a girl with the aim of courting birds, but the situations that will arise inside the San Columba will be anything but trivial. The greatest value of Hatoful Boyfriend remains in fact that of being able to excite for a deeper narrative than expected, with unexpected consequences that instill in the player the desire to revisit the story again to find different endings and reveal the true nature of all protagonists. Because even in the world of birds, nothing is as it seems.", "date": "2015-07-28", "grade": "8.5"}
