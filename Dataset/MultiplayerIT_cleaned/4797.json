You are in front of your PlayStation on a hot summer afternoon and you want to play a good game of Crash Bandicoot: therefore, first grab the Memory Card that you find at hand and insert it into the save slot, obviously giving it a good tip, insert the disc and turn on the console. Don't you feel a shiver down your spine when you think about it? Since the release of the first Crash Bandicoot, developed by a semi-unknown Naughty Dog, 21 years have passed and after an adventure full of ups and downs like a roller coaster, all Crash fans had slowly lost hope, convinced that the marsupial and his band of friends would never come back to keep them company. Unexpectedly, however, Activision fulfilled their dreams by entrusting the Vicarious Visions team with the task of bringing the first unforgettable chapters dedicated to the Sony mascot back to the PlayStation 4. It was quite logical that Activision had some faith in the development studio, after all Vicarious is particularly close to the American producer as he is responsible for the Skylanders franchise and over the years has had several times to deal with Crash, but the work done with the N. Sane Trilogy is something really admirable; we somewhat expected it after seeing it in action a few months ago in London but to be truly appreciated it must be played in its entirety, all in one breath. 1, 2, 3 Crashes! The trilogy contains the first three chapters of the orange marsupial saga: Crash Bandicoot, Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back and Crash Bandicoot: Warped. After a brief animated introduction, in pure Crash style (and a somewhat lengthy loading that really recalls the waiting times of the first PlayStation), you have access to the initial screen of the game where you can select the three titles, choosing whether to start a new game or possibly continue one that has already started without having any type of limitation and starting from our favorite. For some of you they will be obvious but since more than two decades have passed it is good to do a quick review. Crash is a 3D platform where the aim of the game is simply to get to the end of the various levels, collecting crates full of colored fruit along the way: by smashing all the crates you get collectible gems and inside the crates, in turn, they are enclosed Wumpa fruits. Every 100 fruits you get a 1-up and every time you die you lose one. This is how we proceed, overcoming levels, conquering collectibles, exploring bonus areas and defeating each end of the area bosses. Interface and commands have remained unchanged compared to the past: the lives are visible in the upper right corner while on the opposite side we have the Wumpa counter, in the center then the number of broken and total crates. With X you jump, with the square you perform the turn attack and to move Crash you can use both the left analog and the directional cross; between '96 and '98, with the sequels, many other abilities were added to the marsupial, such as area attack and double jump, all available in the relative adventures and illustrated by the tutorials. There are some small differences compared to the past but we are dealing with extensions rather than modifications: the three chapters in fact maintain their native structure with lots of bonus areas, secret paths and scattered collectibles, however presenting a certain uniformity in terms of content. So let's talk about the presence of time trials in all three episodes, to which is added the possibility of playing some levels with Crash's little sister, Coco, even outside of Warped. For less experienced (or just rusty!) players, hints have been introduced during the loading screen of each level. Playstation 4 trophies The PlayStation trophies of the N. Sane Trilogy are more than 70 and divided by episodes, so that each chapter has its own collection of achievements with relative platinum trophy. The average duration of the title adding up the three episodes is really very variable because it depends on how much confidence you will have and how many trophies you want to conquer. For us, the total duration of the three adventures was about 12 hours net of collectibles: if you want all the gems and relics, it will take much longer! Look how hairy I am Even the pause menu remains extremely dry by providing a summary panel on the percentage of the game completed. It will not be possible to act directly on the graphic setting: the title remains fixed at 30 frames per second both on PlayStation 4 and on Pro and the only options available for the screen are the inversion of the axes for vehicle control where foreseen by the game and nothing more;so if you expected to be able to play in the original graphics we have to disappoint you but the reason is soon explained. As we had already told you in our last test, the developers worked on these three games completely from scratch, using only the proportions of the character with respect to the game environment as a reference, thus reconstructing every single object and animation. From this point of view, the work carried out is really impressive because the attention to detail has not only been dedicated to the narrow corridor levels and the elements inside them but goes far beyond, it extends, eliminating that graphic separation between the game and landscape. The many graphic effects, in particular those of light and water, undoubtedly make the difference: the glare of the sun on the surfaces, the reflection of the ice sheets or the pouring rain are just some of the many details added for the occasion. The characters have also faced a major makeover while retaining their original look. The overall result is a real joy for the player but at the same time it turns out to be a bit alienating for those who know the old titles by heart, especially if you listen to the N. Sane Trilogy carefully: the main themes of the levels have all been recomposed in high definition but the sound effects, such as the noise of the speakers, the Wumpas or the Aku-Aku mask, are truly indistinguishable from the original ones. Old school difficulty To really understand the impact of the game you need to go into a little more detail and dissect the three chapters carefully. When we say that the three games are really those of twenty years ago we do not say it lightly: we bet that each of you retains the memory of a particularly hated level, an impossible time challenge or a cursed hidden chest that you only found after going up and down the bonus area at least a dozen times... If you experienced these difficulties twenty years ago, get ready because they are still there waiting for you, with the difference that in the meantime we have all played video games for twenty years who have deluded us that they are difficult. Unless you've practiced (or you're that kind of self-harm player... we meant hardcore), you'll notice picking up the pad again that the enamel of youth is a bit scratched and at least once you'll exclaim to yourselves ~but Was it really that hard?~ To be tackled seriously, the N. Sane Trilogy requires the same reflexes and concentration used to complete the original games, a particularly grueling performance for all modern gamers who are a little distracted. The difficulty offered by the trilogy extends over several levels as in the past because in addition to never letting our guard down, we will have to find the bonuses of the various games, redo a level several times to access its secret area, try our hand at difficult backtracking sessions and understand the right order in which to break a group of crates almost like a small puzzle. Made with love Wouldn't it have been better to simplify the game dynamics a bit, making the three chapters more friendly and perhaps opening up to a new audience? For us the answer is no, Vicarious Visions made the right decision, processing everything with a truly unexpected elegance. If we were faced with a real return of Crash Bandicoot and therefore we had a totally new game in our hands then yes, they would have absolutely had to review a good part of the game mechanics; the genre has experienced a sharp decline over the years and even if someone is timidly trying to get players used to 3D platformers again, it is difficult in the current market to conceptually separate the genre from that large group of children's games, where Skylanders is perhaps the greatest exponent. Let me be clear, The N. Sane Trilogy is within everyone's reach, it is simply a different type of game from contemporary tastes and the approach adopted by the developers is the right one because although the collection was created from scratch, Crash is and Crash remains: this trilogy could not be something different, it had to remain as it has always been even if, it must be said, in certain moments you can feel the musty smell. However, what the development team has achieved goes far beyond the wildest expectations because we are talking about a practically perfect remake but initially created by a different developer. Vicarious Visions not only found itself in its hands a bomb ready to explode at the slightest mistake in handling it but had to do so by taking on the legacy of a development studio which in the meantime has collected so many successes as to become practically untouchable... given that mowing a timid criticism of Naughty Dog today is automatically equivalent to a public hanging. Yet Vicarious proved to be largely equal to the situation, working so painstakingly as to emphasize the nuances of the three chapters; although the developer has slightly standardized the titles in some respects, playing the first chapter is not like playing the second or Warped. The first is noticeably more woody, the second ~lets you play~ with less resistance and the third acquires that fluidity that Naughty Dog has given it after having had a little experience. Not only can we see the growth that the saga has experienced sequel after sequel but, pad in hand, you can even perceive the experience and confidence that Naughty Dog itself has perfected in the first years of its debut. Obviously as nostalgic beasts which we are we would have been satisfied with much less, even a rougher job would still have suited us well because you know, when the withdrawal crisis calls and despair grows we adapt to anything, but faced with a such a meticulous work, one can only offer due compliments. It would be bold to say that Vicarious Visions with its N. Sane Trilogy has redefined the standards for remastered but undoubtedly demonstrated that the talent of a development studio is not only innate but also goes through hard work of analysis and research up to that the right balance between personal processing and past memory is not found. All this to say: now we want Crash Team Racing.", "date": "2017-06-29", "grade": "9.0"}
