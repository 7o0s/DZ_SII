If we then think of the time that has passed since the first chapter ~Tag~, of which this is the direct sequel, we are even talking about 12 years later. We must recognize Namco for a certain rigor in the management of its popular fighting game series: in an era in which the squeezing of successful brands is a standardized practice, with annual serializations to which publishers have become accustomed, it cannot be said that Namco Bandai has also reserved this treatment for Tekken, with the exception of the Tekken Hybrid operation. If then this derives from a desire to preserve the purity of the game or from an effective lack of ideas to apply to the series, it is a point on which we can discuss, given that compared to other competing products, there is no doubt that the Namco game has characteristics of evident irremovability, in structural and also technical terms. In any case, the long waits between one chapter and another only strengthen the faith of the most passionate users and transform each new chapter into an event of considerable importance, as demonstrated by the expectation that characterized the arrival of Tekken Tag Tournament 2. We are not dealing with a new chapter of the regular series but with a conversion, revised and corrected with various expansions, of the arcade of the same name released about a year ago in Japanese arcades and more precisely of its updated version ~ Unlimited~. And in fact it is really a pure arcade: there is little space for narrative moments and extra-clash trappings, and in Tekken Tag Tournament 2 what matters is what happens in the ring. Team play The tag battle is a well-known variation of the normal one-on-one fighting game, already introduced in the series by the first Tag Tournament for PlayStation 2 but also present in many other titles of the genre. In the ring two fighters no longer compete against each other, but teams made up of two fighters (with the possibility of variation between one or two fighters per team), who can take turns at any time. Beyond the simple variation given by the enrichment of the cast within a single fight, this mechanic introduces various additional strategic features capable of profoundly transforming the structure of the game. The most obvious is given by the possibility of creating a team with the most varied resources, able to exploit two fighters who can differ substantially in terms of attack and defense skills, speed or fighting style. As far as the rhythm of the fight is concerned, the tag system modifies the times by tending to lengthen the various rounds: when a fighter is close to KO, he can in fact take turns with his partner who enters the fight with maximum energy, while the character who remains waiting outside the ring slowly refills her. For this reason, by carefully dosing the interventions it is possible to reverse a desperate situation by recovering the lost energy. Note that the amount of health reloaded corresponds at most to that lost in the immediately preceding seconds, making it necessary to change character in the right amount of time. In case only one fighter is chosen, this feature is balanced by the automatic recharge of his energy, while he is in the ring. The third strategic element is also the most in-depth one compared to other similar titles, and is given by the couple attacks and the strategic insertions of the character change within the fight. The moment of change has become, in this chapter, a real element of attack available to the players, who can therefore exploit, with the right timing, an insertion capable of saving the fighter in difficulty and inflicting considerable damage on the opponent . The tag therefore takes on further strategic nuances, offering different solutions for responding to unstoppable holds, combos and attacks with the right countermoves, thus making it possible to choose between a more prudent change of character and a more aggressive one. Among the novelties of the tag system, it should also be noted the presence of the ~rage~ factor, which involves both fighters in the team. When the wrestler in the ring begins to lose large amounts of energy, his partner's bar starts flashing, and if the switch is made, the newcomer's strikes will have higher power than normal. It must be said that this is one of the few cases in which a certain problem emerges in the otherwise very accurate balancing of the whole game: the abssummers in this particular status can in fact be too powerful and have a decisive influence on the progress of the match. World Tekken Federation The World Tekken Federation is one of the major innovations introduced with Tekken Tag Tournament 2. It is an online platform capable of providing detailed and continuously updated information and statistics on the world of Tekken, which will probably also be supported by the next chapters of the series. A sort of response to similar services offered for games with a predominant online component such as Halo, Call of Duty or Battlefield, to underline Namco Bandai's desire to relaunch Tekken-based competition among players, but also to provide some ~social~ derivation and strengthen the community of fans by providing a new telematic meeting place. The service will be free when the game launches, but it's unclear if it's meant to stay that way forever. Back to the arcade At first we remain rather lost in front of Tekken Tag Tournament 2. The core of the experience is the arcade mode, but if we are looking for a more traditional approach to single player we can be disappointed by the complete absence of a narrative substratum . Truth be told, looking back on Tekken 6's questionable story mode, a complete removal of the narrative might not be a point against it, especially considering that this is a game derived directly from coin-ops and with different premises. There is no shortage of side elements, but they do not represent an offer capable of exponentially enriching the gaming experience, nor do they offer particular stimuli to break away from the normal arcade routine, both in single and in multiplayer. The Laboratory, presented as one of the major novelties of the game and already detailed in the preview, is a bizarre reinterpretation of the training mode, based on the story of a scientific laboratory engaged in the construction of a combat robot (Combot) capable of evolving and progressively acquire new skills. If the story mode of Tekken 6 was unknowingly comical in its naive being, the Laboratory clearly shows a humorous cut, with certain digressions into Japanese nonsense that can elicit a smile but which can hardly represent a completely valid mode; all told through cutscenes drawn in 2D and animated in a rather crude way. However, it is an excellent tutorial that starts from the basics of combat and gets to teach the most advanced techniques, ideal for beginners but with the additional possibility of customizing the Combot, making it acquire various special moves and use it in arcade mode (but for obvious balance issues not in online ranked matches). Likewise, the presence of a new ~Practice~ mode is appreciable which allows, in addition to freely trying the moves of any character against a sparring partner of your choice, also to see precisely the execution and effects of all the various attacks and combos. The presence of an extensive editor that allows you to change the appearance of all the fighters by applying costumes and accessories of your choice is appreciable, even if the not too refined design chosen for most of the variable elements often makes it preferable to leave the characters as they are. In addition to being an aesthetic addition, the application of objects is also linked to the particular ~Item Moves~, impractical in combat but certainly spectacular. To conclude the rundown on the game modes, we note the presence of the ~Ghost Battle~, of Versus against another player in split screen, of the ~Team Battle~, of the ~Time Trial~ and of ~Survival~, while in online mode the subdivision is the typical one in classified and free matches, with the possibility of viewing the rankings. Punches, kicks and what goes with it Since this is a more or less direct conversion from coin-op, it is therefore in the arcade clash and in the mechanics of the combat itself that we find the core of the playful offer of Tekken Tag Tournament 2, its true meaning. Without many compromises and digressions, the game simply represents a small evolutionary step in the process of perfecting the core gameplay characteristic of Tekken. For this reason, it is a product dedicated above all to those who already belong to the consolidated group of enthusiasts, who will be able to appreciate the technical innovations introduced in the game mechanics, the result of a work of filing and adjusting the code that is difficult to notice if you do not follow the series. Thanks also to a renewed graphics engine, the mechanics of the clash are migbetter than the one present in Tekken 6: it is a clear sensation, given in particular by a better link between the animations and in the action-reaction effects between moves and countermoves, thanks to a more solid modeling of the characters and a more precise calculation of the collisions . In short, there is no epochal change in the game structure and, also considering the presence of well-known historical figures, the substantial innovations must be sought in the adjustments made between the gameplay gears, as well as obviously the tag team structure itself. Also for this reason, Tekken Tag Tournament 2 is configured as a game for fans of the series. But beware, although the presence of a huge and almost dispersive roster suggests a simple fanservice operation, the more experienced player will certainly be able to notice and appreciate the improvements. Moreover, it is a chapter that seems to want to reinvigorate the spirit of Tekken, which has its roots deeply in the classic heritage of the series and which does little to attract new customers: in this perspective we can evaluate the presence of devastating combos, juggling extreme (the possibility of inflicting damage on a falling opponent) and fatal rebounds, characteristics that require a deep knowledge of the characters and their techniques in order to defend and fight back, but which tend to keep newbies away. In short, those who know the combos inside out and are able to predict the low/medium/high changes and the difference between the stances of the various characters will find themselves perfectly at ease in Tekken Tag Tournament 2, and will probably welcome the big relaunch very positively of online competition that accompanies it thanks to the introduction of the World Tekken Federation. Likewise, the ~pro~ user will probably be the one most able to assimilate the mechanics of the different types of character changes, and to appreciate how these fit perfectly into the flow of combat. It is equally clear, however, that the game reinforces the closed circuit of a series that has already been looking above all at the past for a long time, perhaps placing itself as a summation of what has been achieved so far while awaiting possible new arrivals in the actual next chapter, which this point could point directly to the next gen. Xbox 360 goals 50 goals for the classic 1000 points represent the hidden treasure within the game. Not containing a real story mode, the objectives are scattered throughout the various modes and are linked to the player's performance, in quantitative terms (number of victories, number of particular moves made) and qualitative (level reached with your character in the arcade or in the Laboratory ). It goes without saying that the complete collection of objectives requires particular application and a large number of active matches. Tekken party Tekken 6 had left us somewhat dumbfounded, with its engine still not fully run in and the presence of a somewhat annoying aliasing, as well as a modeling of the characters that showed ups and downs. From this point of view, Tekken Tag Tournament 2 fits much more appropriately into the standards of the current generation, with the objective advantage of 60 frames per second. The characters are solid and well animated, although the Tekken style imposes certain consequences on the level of characterization that may not be liked, such as certain somewhat tacky drifts of ~metaphysical~ fighters and the general thickness that makes the female characters rather robust. It is precisely the attention to the animations that is the most distinctive element of the entire graphic sector, both for the remarkable quality in the reproduction of the fighting styles of the fighters (in total, including the 4 downloadables, they should settle on 53 different characters, even if good part are obviously derivations or simple duplications, as per tradition) and for the way in which these are linked to each other, also thanks to an excellent management of collisions and the physics of the shots. The details of the characters generally stand at excellent levels, although there are some qualitative variations which, in the face of excellent results achieved on some fighters, show other decidedly simpler models. There are about twenty scenarios, derived from some typical panoramas of famous places (for Italy there is the Trevi Fountain) and they play their role without particularly standing out, adapting to the prevailing trends with the introduction of some interactable or the variable presence of barriers. There is also a gallery mode that allows you to review all the CG footage, not only of this but also of", "date": "2012-09-11", "grade": "8.6"}
