{"name": "Life is Strange 2: Episode 4 - Faith", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/life-is-strange-2-episode-4-faith-recensione.html", "text": "Needless to deny it, it is almost annoying with each new episode of Life is Strange 2 necessarily having to redo the point of the situation: the fault of the many months that pass between one episode and another of the Dontnod Entertainment work. In any case, nostalgia also complicates the situation this time: our story actually began almost a year ago, at the end of last September 2018. Life is Strange 2 is about to end, episode four is Faith, and you are preparing to read the review; episode five is scheduled for December 3, 2019 (more than three months away!). Meanwhile the narrative proceeds quickly, accelerates decisively towards the grand finale. Faith is undoubtedly the most successful episode of the four, excellent in terms of rhythm, variety of situations, partly also in the choices to be made... and above all in the evolution (and return) of some very important characters. Read this article only if you have played the previous episodes, even better if you have also already taken a look at episode four of Life is Strange 2, so if you want it will also be possible to discuss in the comments section. Plot: find Daniel Life is Strange 2: Episode 4 - Faith sees Sean looking for and finding Daniel, his younger brother. This is the narrative engine of the approximately three hours of gameplay needed to get back to the end credits. It is a physical and practical reunion, because the two brothers were separated following the plantation incident of Life is Strange 2: Episode 3 - Wastelands, which ended in tragedy; but it is also a metaphorical find, because when Sean finally finds Daniel, the latter is no longer the same as before, although only a few months have passed in a coma for his older brother. The variety of situations proposed by the developers of Dontnod Entertainment is excellent, as is the introduction (and recovery) of important characters, who peep into the plot through various narrative devices (from the letter to the real unexpected entrance into the scene). We will not clearly tell you who we are thinking specifically, but it is important to note that here the choices made in the previous episodes have their weight: just to give an example, based on how you concluded episode three and its possible survivors, you may find a dear friend of yours in the hospital... or not. Just from the hospital, Sean will have to escape the police once again, and go in search of his brother, who has been missing for a few months now. He will find it very far from California, in the Nevada desert: if you like the atmosphere masterfully represented by the novel Desperation by Stephen King (and a little less by the film of the same name) then you will be enchanted by the atmosphere of the new episode. It doesn't change, it can't change and it mustn't change what the player has to do instead: that is, to witness Sean's events, accompany him on his long and troubled journey, see him interact with the various characters present and make important choices, especially in the ending, where once again Life is Strange 2 enjoys playing with our feelings and our moral sense. Is there really a right choice to make? Where is the line between good and evil? The series, in its various iterations, has taught us that the answer is not always so obvious, obvious and simple... and that in case of mistakes, the protagonist and the people you love will suffer the consequences. With due guilt on the part of the player himself. We cannot go deeper into the story of the Faith chapter, at least not from the point of view of the characters present because we would run into a gigantic (albeit narratively predictable) spoiler and probably the players of the previous episodes have understood which person from the past we are alluding to. Playstation 4 trophies Life is Strange 2: Episode 4 - Faith, like all previous episodes, also has a certain number of trophies to unlock, related to collectibles and Sean's drawings. The Platinum Trophy of the season, however, can only be unlocked at the time of the publication of the fifth and final episode, scheduled for December 3, 2019. Themes: faith, loneliness, family Each episode of the second season of Life is Strange focused on very particular themes: homophobia, friendship, love, the sense of belonging to a given community, the problem of relations between civilians and the police, the legalization of drugs, and much more. Life is Strange 2 is a huge cauldron of burning and other pleasant themes, and it draws from time to time on the most interesting and captivating ones to make the whole work stimulating: the important thing is that this never happens done iin a sloppy way. Fortunately, the cases of trivialization in Life is Strange 2 can be counted on the fingertips, compared to four episodes published and hours and hours of gameplay. The fourth episode of Life is Strange 2, Faith, has a title that basically ~is all about it~, as they say: Faith. That is Faith. All right, metaphorically it's the faith that feeds Sean in finding his brother, it's the faith in trusting again a painful figure from his past, the faith in a better future... but it's also the real faith, the one par excellence in God. The fourth episode takes place in Nevada, and precisely in a small town that hosts a particularly intransigent Orthodox Christian sect (or cult), one of those that can only arise in the desert and in the presence of an already particularly strict and conservative. This time Dontnod Entertainment seems willing, among the other themes of the episode, to unmask the false attitudes of practicing Christians from small isolated communities, hypocritical and falsely benevolent towards others, only to then look after their own profit and justify the attitudes of all types, as long as the community name is preserved. However, the developers' judgments are never absolute, and therefore occasional secondary characters instead show true Christian behavior and unconditional (and above all disinterested) love towards others: like a truck driver who interrupts his journey to offer Sean a lift in the desert. The theme of solitude and the training journey emerges several times in the moments in which Sean finds himself alone on his journey, or is immersed in his own thoughts while convalescing in the hospital; however, once again the sense of family and affection dominates everything. The two wolf brothers have always remained together, and intend to do so until the end of their journey to a safe haven ... assuming they manage to reach it.", "date": "2019-08-24", "grade": "8.2"}
