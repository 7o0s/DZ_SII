{"name": "Skater XL", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/skater-xl-recensione.html", "text": "When it was announced, Skater XL was supposed to be on paper the game that would set the standard for skateboarding simulations, and the title that would have to take the throne by dodging his majesty Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and Skate. Yes, on paper. Stop. Really, the Skater XL review is about a game that is all the worst that could be done in this historical era and with these technologies. Already from the initial screen you can understand the scarcity of content. Total absence of any campaign or main story. You are catapulted directly into one of the only 5 original maps in the game and you are immediately destabilized by the type of commands. The desire of Easy Day Studios to revolutionize the commands with the independent foot control system was not a happy choice in the light of the facts. This complex system is based on assigning the two feet to the two analog sticks, accelerating with the X button, turning using the two low backbones, grabbing with the upper backbones and braking with a circle. With the triangle instead we can decide where on the map to teleport. In theory it could even be an interesting control system...if it works. During the games, more times the chosen skater jumps alone or performs completely busted tricks than those in which he performs what we would like him to do. Obviously the fact of having to turn with the backbones is a very uncomfortable setting and almost in all cases we found ourselves doing it with the analogs, thus preventing us from maintaining the speed and being able to make the desired evolutions. The models of the structures on which you can climb, then, have imperfections from the point of view of collisions, with parts on which it seems you can grind or jump when instead you find yourself falling disastrously to the ground. To make you understand the complexity of the mechanism, let's take a simple example: to perform a ~Three Flip~ you need to perform a simple Ollie (a jump) by holding down the analog sticks simultaneously and releasing them together, to then rotate the stick clockwise first right and then the left by a quarter turn, but we must constantly be careful not to turn them too little or too much and we can't even go wrong by a couple of frames by turning the right stick instead of the left, otherwise another trick will come out which will force us to repeat the whole thing. And trust me that after 20-30 times that bugs recur, small involuntary movements of the analog sticks and jumps out of nowhere, you get impatient. And that's not all, read on to discover the other wonders. A technical sector to scream, yes but horror We cannot understand how, on the threshold of the next gen, there is still the possibility of being faced with such a bad job from the point of view of cleaning up the animations, modeling and textures. Let's go in order. The main menu, in its simplicity, should also present us with a fantastic editor with which we can customize our own avatar, or at least that's what we're used to doing. Skater XL instead puts us in front of only two models, one male and one female, without offering the possibility of being able to change their features apart from the hairstyle and the color of the skin, and allows us to change clothing, from the hat to the shoes, as well as customizing the tables in all their parts but without allowing us to give our personal touch, since there is no color or texture selector. We don't know what will be the reason behind the impossibility of being able to change even just the color of our avatar's eyes. What we're sure of is that we haven't seen such a meager editor since the days of the first PlayStation. Skater models are something unwatchable. A job really done badly and apparently in a hurry, with unrealistic movements and faces bordering on decent. The thing that left us stunned, however, was one in particular: the developers were unable to even manage the ragdoll. That's right, even when you fall, the game fails to return a realistic feeling. Not to mention the times our character was left staring at a wall after running into it, instead of falling or activating a contextual animation. In fact, there would also be some famous skaters that you can choose and use to perform your tricks: we're talking about Tiago Lemos, Brandon Westgate, Evan Smith and Tom Asta, but they too are very little recognizable or customizable in terms of aesthetics. Playstation 4 trophies Skater XL brings a total of 22 trophies including the coveted platinum. They are all quite simple and requireparticular tricks or travel times in certain stances, or change clothing 20 times or simply save a replay The modalities As we said at the beginning of the review, there is no story or career mode with attached trophies or tables to unlock, characters gradually made available or aesthetic elements. Nothing. What you can do is free roaming within the 5 real licensed maps or on the community maps (only three were available at the time of writing) in which to have fun (??) performing as many complex tricks as possible or, as we did naively believing to unlock some trophy, complete the challenges dedicated to the various locations ranging from simple to more elaborate tricks, with grabs or manuals to combine with each other. As we said, the evolutions would also be interesting to carry out if they weren't affected by continuous bugs. There is also a tutorial mode that makes us understand more or less the command system, to be completed immediately on pain of not being able to play. Even the general settings are sparse, and you can't even see the music tracklist to understand which songs we have in the background of our stunts. In fact, the music is the only point in favor of the entire production, with themes that always keep up the desire to try to make this or that evolution better. The maps have a good variety even if, as mentioned, they are very few. We go from parking lots to skate parks to city settings. However, even these, in our opinion, could have been treated better, with significant differences in size between one and the other. We conclude the examination of this disaster by noting also drops to the framerate.", "date": "2020-08-11", "grade": "4.5"}
