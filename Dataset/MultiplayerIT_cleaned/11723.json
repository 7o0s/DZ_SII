{"name": "Ghost in the Sheet - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ghost-in-the-sheet-recensione.html", "text": "My underground love The adventure takes place entirely inside the factory. The locations to visit are few and the variety is lacking, even if, despite everything, it is undeniable that the construction of the puzzles and the story manages to keep the interest high throughout the game. The interface is atypical for the genre: no inventory and no multi-use cursor. That is, the cursor exists but by itself only allows you to examine objects, talk to characters and nothing else. To perform the various actions necessary to unravel the puzzles, you need to use one of the ghost's powers, lined up in the upper left corner of the screen. These are not all available right away, but must be acquired during the game. At first you will only have the power of telekinesis, but soon you will be able to push objects, throw electric shocks and gusts of wind, eavesdrop on the words of spirits, make sounds to communicate with monsters and so on up to a total of eight powers . The more powers are unlocked, the more, obviously, the situation becomes more complicated, above all because the game environment must be explored from top to bottom several times and one must constantly go back and forth between the main locations trying to figure out what to do. to recommend its purchase, the reader must be asked to overlook a whole series of obvious problems My underground love The puzzles are all quite classic: doors to open, buttons to press in sequence, objects to repair, and so on. Nothing revolutionary, even if the use of spectral powers at least makes what would otherwise be the usual soup more interesting. There are also a couple of sub-games of which the first, made badly, consists in squashing mice inside the factory warehouse; you have to grab a stone and, looking at the floor from above, synchronize to be able to catch the poor critters. The second is, on the other hand, better also because it is more integrated into the plot. Trying not to reveal anything to you, we tell you that it is a test of logic in which you must be able to make the protagonist escape from something that threatens him. All pursuit is displayed on a schematic map of the factory, on which the player and the ~threat~ take turns moving to one of the rooms adjacent to the one in which they are. The aim is to never let them find themselves in the same room at the same time, while managing to bring the protagonist ghost into the dungeon. Style Ghost in the Sheet has the tone of a black comedy permeated by a strong irony. Stylistically, a very specific choice was made, with the game locations represented in a realistic and cold way (after all, it is a ruined factory), while the narrative sequences are entrusted to comics with a questionable style; that is, they are immature both in the stroke and in the representation, despite some good intuition such as the choice to never exceed in the Baroque and to maintain a homogeneous style from the beginning to the end with strong contrasts and very clear lines. The same ambivalence can be found in the narration which at times is well conducted while in some cases it is ruined by bad choices, evidently the result of little experience. The story is still interesting, although some dialogues are rather childish and have excessive redundancies. The sound is composed of some well-made but rather anonymous sound effects (doors that open in the distance, strange cries of undefined creatures and so on) while the few music present is nothing exceptional. Considerations Playing Ghost in the Sheet you realize the effort made by the developers to make something good even with a very limited budget. The result is excellent, if one takes into account the level of production and the number of people who worked on it. Of course, if you start with the idea of wanting something technically revolutionary, forget it. Obviously the game is full of all those defects underlined in the article, to which must be added a not exactly exciting longevity which, as in all adventures, varies according to the speed it will take you to solve the different puzzles. For our part, we would like to recommend it if you are passionate about point and click graphic adventures and if you want to try something extremely relaxing, especially after the FPS binge we have had in recent months.

Keep it in mind if it meets your tastes and if you are passionate about graphic adventures. Even feeling sympathy for minor productions can help in accepting some of the inevitable limitations it carries with it. Others may as well look elsewhere. Pros Fascinating plot despite some ingenuity Well thought-out puzzles Low selling price Cons Technically limited Some ingenuity too many Not very long Ghost in the Sheet is available for PC. Ghost in the Sheet is the game you don't expect in a time like this. Surrounded by triple-A giants who show off ultra-pumped graphics engines, redone breasts and glittering platitudes, what does a tiny little graphic adventure created by two people and occupying only 300 MB of hard disk want to achieve? Come on, we're not kidding. It is difficult for such a production to be able to illuminate some of the light cast on the obese and bloated Christmas blockbusters. But fortune favors the bold, so why not give it a try? It is difficult to write this article. The premise has been written at least ten times. It is that on the one hand there is sympathy for a project that has the flavor of the early days of the videogame medium, when games were developed by a single person or by very small teams. Accustomed to previewing and reviewing products that boast teams of dozens (if not hundreds) of people, it makes you smile to think of the end credits of Ghost in the Sheet where only two names appear. On the other hand, however, it cannot be denied that, in order to recommend its purchase, the reader must be asked to overlook a whole series of obvious problems that we will underline in the article. But let's get to the game: a man dies in a car accident and becomes a ghost. He is recruited by an unidentified being to find out what happened inside a factory on earth, from which the souls of the deceased apparently pass. The ~boss~ places a sheet on the ghost (hence the title of the game) telling him not to remove it for any reason, under penalty of definitive death. Once the nameless neo-ghost arrives on site (he simply calls himself Ghost in the Sheet... which is also a rather vulgar pun, you just need to understand a little English to realize this) he will find it completely destroyed and turned off. The workers are all (or almost) dead and the walls are full of writings about ladybugs. Obviously it will be up to him (and us) to discover the mysteries behind this chaos.", "date": "2007-12-18", "grade": null}
