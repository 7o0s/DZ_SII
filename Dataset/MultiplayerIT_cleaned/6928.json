Hollywood has almost always used the city of Nevada as a crazy stage for improbable stories, from the nonsense of The Hangover to the unbridled luxury and underworld stories of the Casino, passing through the unscrupulous excesses of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Too bad, except for a few dismal slot machines and a couple of poker tables, you won't find any of that in Tiny Tower Vegas. The new NimbleBit game takes up the same and identical mechanics of the free-to-play released in 2011 and sets them in Las Vegas, but the feeling is that, after the original title and the Starwarsian parenthesis of Tiny Death Star, the formula recycled from Californian developer has definitely come to an end. The new Tiny Tower Vegas introduces small innovations to a formula that has already said it all One bet too many At first glance, Tiny Tower Vegas looks like a trivial makeover of the original game, and it's actually largely that way. Once again, a skyscraper is managed by gradually building new floors, each of which generates money by offering a series of services or by selling products; moreover, you have to hire staff and assign them to each floor, while helping visitors to use the elevator in exchange for small tips. Since everything is set in Vegas, the shops and offices of Tiny Tower give way to casinos, luxurious restaurants and nightclubs, but in reality the substance is the same. This means the player spends most of his time waiting (from a few minutes to a few hours) for a new floor to be built or finished products to be replenished. The refinement work done with the updates of the first Tiny Tower and with Tiny Death Star is carried forward with some ideas that, at least, allow the game economy to run more smoothly. In addition to the classic coins and the rarest bux, Vegas introduces a third currency: from time to time it is possible to obtain chips, tokens that can be used within the casinos. Once the respective floor has been built, chips can be bet in three mini-games: the slot machine, poker and blackjack. With a little luck it is possible to win a lot of bux, and thus speed up the construction of new floors or the customization of the structure. These mini-games don't require any skill and are played in seconds, but of course the more chips you bet, the bigger the payout. BitBook is also making a comeback, the fictitious social network where customers and employees of the facility leave funny (but almost always useless) comments about life inside the facility. Perhaps there is someone who is particularly disgruntled about working at the casino, and who might make more money on another floor. Or there are those who have spotted a VIP and managed to photograph him: among the cameos in the game we have seen the Dude and Walter from The Big Lebowski, for example. Unfortunately, as we were saying, these little innovations are not enough to make a formula attractive again in an almost identical way three times. Tiny Tower had the benefit of originality, it was fresh, polished and honest with the user in a time when the free to play market was poor quality. Tiny Death Star instead managed to attract the attention of Star Wars fans by mixing the humor of the NimbleBit games with the imagery of Star Wars. Vegas, on the other hand, returns to speak to the same audience as the first Tiny Tower, but without offering big reasons or news that justify more hours spent repeating the same actions over and over between the floors of your tower.", "date": "2014-09-06", "grade": "6.5"}
