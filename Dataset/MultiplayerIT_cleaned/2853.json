{"name": "Tsubasa+", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tsubasa-la-recensione.html", "text": "We continue the revival of Holly and Benji with the review of Tsubasa +, a new mobile game dedicated to the famous series that transports the football universe created by Yoichi Takahashi in a particular context that recalls the structure of Pokmon GO and derivatives. After Captain Tsubasa: Rise of new Champions we are faced with a particular reinterpretation of the manga / anime, with multiplayer and social grafts and the emphasis placed above all on collecting various characters and players. It's not such an absurd idea, if you think about it: the world of football has always lent itself to this now historic mechanism thanks to the old habit of stickers and in this sense we can see Tsubasa+ as a sort of video-game extension of this game. Obviously with associated expenses, considering the amount of micro-transactions that support the whole system. However, there is also a certain gameplay behind the spasmodic search for players to conquer, which goes from the matches themselves, a central element in the whole game, to the management and team organization, with a significant amount of layered activities. It should be noted that the game has the FIFPRO license, which determines a strange fusion of characters taken from the manga with real footballers who can be conquered gradually: in Tsubasa+ we don't find ourselves playing only against characters from the series, trying to complete the various historical teams of the anime, but also against a large number of real players belonging to international championships and leagues, reproduced in this case with a different but still caricatured graphic style. The general structure is typical of titles such as Pokmon GO or Minecraft Earth: the game relies on Google maps to recreate the area surrounding the player in a simplified map, where we can find stadiums created by other players or positioned near places of public interest. At first we have to create our character through an editor set according to the graphic style of the Captain Tsubasa anime and then build a stadium near your home, so you can easily access it every time you log in, but most of the gameplay lies in the exploration of the map and the search for other stadiums, the only way to access a greater quantity and variety of players to defeat and conquer. Here we encounter the first problem of Tsubasa+: beyond a response that is not really reactive to detection GPS of the user's movements, the coverage of the maps in Italy is still decidedly incomplete and in many areas it is impossible to find marked places of interest, so the areas are often deserted making it virtually impossible to play. We are still at the beginning of the service and it is a question of seeing if the Miraire team intends to evolve the support from this point of view, as well as waiting for the user to expand and build stadiums to interact with, therefore the judgment on this juncture is suspended, for the moment. On and off the field There's a good amount of different activities to engage in between head-to-head matches, training, team management and various upgrades, but it all comes through the consumable items that underpin any action. These are above all spheres of energy to be used to take part in matches, but also modifiers, bonuses and other objects that are necessary to take part in training or receive essential power-ups to face the most demanding matches and the structure weighs on this aspect of micro-transactions that supports the free-to-play of Tsubasa+: it is the same situation that we have seen with candies and Pokballs of Pokmon GO, but here it is further complicated by a greater amount of parameters to keep an eye on and by the huge consumption of objects determined by each single encounter. The result is that, in order to be competitive and play in longer sessions, in-app purchases become predominant. The mechanism is easily understandable by examining a simple one-on-one match, which is the basis of the gameplay as regards the conquest of new players and the evolution of one's character: Tsubasa+ does not stage real football matches but rather of the sorts of street football exhibitions where two players go head-to-head made up of tricks and spin shots. There is no direct control over the character because the action is limited to associating as many spheres of the same color as possible (up to a maximum of five) in the shortest possible time, and then holding them down with perfect timing in order to frame the target that appears on the screen and launch the shot with maximum power and precision before it doeschase the opponent. In fact, to play, it is therefore necessary to have a good amount of spheres available, considering the consumption that is made of them in each game and this is already a relevant aspect in the dynamics of collecting and managing resources. Furthermore, the outcome of the clash is not always understandable, given that this is often decided by fractions of a second and is only visible at the end, giving the impression that it is also strongly dominated by opaque parameters or directly by chance. The outcome of each match is only partially linked to the speed of the player, because there is also the level of power reached by the characters to consider, and it is often necessary to compensate for the enormous imbalances that can occur with the most important and coveted players with the application of bonuses and special abilities. This introduces the need to acquire additional objects, which from the simple regular distribution on a daily basis (at login, upon entering the various stages encountered on the map or by completing the objectives) are often not sufficient and therefore also focus on micro-transactions . There is a large amount of activities to take part in, but they all depend in some way on the presence of consumables, so this problem of supplying energy spheres is always present, even if you want to dedicate yourself to training, progression of their players or team management, which represent alternative game elements of a certain interest.", "date": "2020-10-13", "grade": "6.2"}
