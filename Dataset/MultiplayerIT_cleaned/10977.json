{"name": "Neverwinter Nights 2: Storm of Zehir - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/neverwinter-nights-2-storm-of-zehir-recensione.html", "text": "Second official expansion of Neverwinter Nights 2, Storm of Zehir continues the path of experimentation undertaken by Obsidian with Mask of the Betrayer (the first expansion), which demonstrates the willingness and intelligence to exploit the additional packs, usually purchased by the hard core of enthusiasts, to propose new and in a certain sense extreme gameplay solutions, rather than simply making cash. From this point of view Storm of Zehir goes far beyond what the series has offered so far and is proposed as a completely autonomous gaming experience containing such and many new features as to make it profoundly different from the basic title. obviously it will be possible to use pre-cooked characters, but in doing so you will lose much of the initial fun The adventure starts on a ship where you have to create a party initially formed by a maximum of four characters. The novelty is that all of them can be created from scratch, a form of customization that D&D fans have been clamoring for for years (at the time of 8 and 16-bit systems it was quite common). Obviously it will be possible to use pre-cooked characters, but in doing so you will lose much of the initial fun. Some may be wondering if it is possible to use a hero exported from previous adventures. The answer is yes, but doing so makes little sense: firstly, the plot does not follow the narrative line, although some plots are present, secondly, it is assumed that whoever finished Mask of the Betrayer managed to bring the protagonist beyond the twenty-fifth level, making it too powerful for Storm of Zehir, designed to take the characters from the third to the fifteenth level. We briefly tried to use the level 28 paladin with which we had concluded the previous expansion, but we immediately gave up due to the too much ease of the clashes. Skill is everything After the sequence of the ship, the plot continues with a shipwreck on a mysterious beach, with the clash with the destitute population, with the capture by a group of soldiers and with the arrival in a city where, freed, it will be possible to the first purchases and get the first missions. The initial interactions will make it clear right away how the expansion is aimed at party management in all its aspects. Let's take the dialogues for example. In Neverwinter Nights 2 it was only the main character who spoke, which made the companions' skills effectively useless; in short, having a character with Diplomacy at 20 was practically useless if he wasn't the protagonist. In Storm of Zehir the dialog allows you to choose the character who will give the answer, showing the different possibilities depending on the values in the respective skills. For example, now the brave warrior with the spotted armpit will be able to exploit the magical knowledge of his sorcerer colleague to intervene in the dialogues that deal with problems inherent in magic, while the puny taciturn petty thief, with the breath of rotten sardine thrown into a sewer , can leave the barbarian colleague the task of intimidating an interlocutor. The beauty of the system is that it allows you to rediscover the usefulness of some skills that were historically underexploited. Another novelty of absolute importance is the introduction of the dynamic map of the game world, used to add other features and to exploit skills that are always very underestimated by the players. In fact, the map is to be considered the fulcrum of Storm of Zehir: to move from one place to another it will be necessary to physically make the party travel the distance that divides them. Exploring it will be possible to collide with randomly generated groups of monsters, find points of interest to obtain hidden objects, participate in clashes in which other groups are engaged, reach commercial cities in which to sell the goods found in the various locations and so on. Go for a walk Managing movements on the map is more complex than it might seem at first glance, as there are some variables, related to skills, that will have to be considered throughout the game: finally a ranger (just to give an example) with high values in some of his typical specialties (for example Survival) he will be able to demonstrate his usefulness by allowing faster movements on inaccessible areas of the terrain, such as a forest, compared to a warrior who will be much slower. By growing other skills you may be more or less capable of discovering hidden treasures, going unnoticed in the vicinity of monsters, talking to animals and so on. Storm of Zehir is better than the base game, from which it inherits the interface but from which it differs profoundly in philosophy Go for a walk To pay a little price di all this customization is the narrative side, which is weak and uninteresting. Fortunately, little attention is paid to it, especially if you are a true fan of role-playing games. Storm of Zehir is better than the base game, from which it inherits the interface but from which it differs profoundly in philosophy, starting from the fact that here a character can die permanently if not cured in time and that it is not possible to sleep everywhere but do it outdoors (camping) or in an inn. In this way, the healing spells, practically useless in the previous episodes, regain their importance and we return to feel the sense of adventure, lost in modern video games, too piloted and trivialized in their structure, which leads them to give up gameplay elements often interesting and very deep. It is a pity that to remind us of how a good computer RPG should be made is an expansion, which will most likely go quietly and will not be considered in a period like Christmas, overflowing with releases. Comment Storm of Zehir amazes with its depth and richness. To best describe it would take much more space. Be content to know that for years there hasn't been seen, at a mainstream level, such a courageous product, capable of breaking with many of the patterns imposed by the market. Too bad it's only an expansion and that probably won't have much impact on the gaming scene. Connoisseurs should not miss it. Pros Hardcore in design Lots of new things compared to the base game Better than Neverwinter Nights 2 Cons Narratively weak There are still some bugs that plagued the base game Ends PC - System Requirements Minimum Requirements Processor: Intel Pentium 4 2.4 GHz or equivalent RAM: 1 GB Video Card: ATI Radeon X700 or NVIDIA GeForce 6800 Operating System: Windows XP SP2 / Vista DirectX: 9.0c Hard Disk: 8 GB 6x DVD-ROM Drive Recommended Requirements Processor: 2.6 GHz Intel Pentium D 805 or AMD X2 +3800 RAM: 2 GB Video Card: ATI Radeon X1950 with 512 MB or NVIDIA GeForce 8800 with 512 MB Test Configuration Processor: Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600 RAM: 3 GB Card video: GeForce 8800 GT Operating system: Windows Vista", "date": "2008-12-11", "grade": null}
