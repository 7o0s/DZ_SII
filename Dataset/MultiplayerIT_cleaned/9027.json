For this reason, in recent years the custom of recovering titles that have fallen into oblivion or unknown to the new generations has taken hold, and there are several remakes and reboots in development. In the list of the many cult games brought back to life, however, one of the most beloved strategy games ever, Dungeon Keeper, does not appear. Fans of the Bullfrog-branded masterpiece thought they were left dry-mouthed, but the lack of a worthy ~evil cavern management~ did not go unnoticed by the guys from Realmforge Studios, who released a curious game called Dungeons in early 2011. At the beginning, the work of Realmforge seemed very similar to the illustrious ancestor, a factor that brought it into the spotlight in a very short time. Once released, however, it turned out to be fundamentally different and not as brilliant. Not that the gameplay was to throw away, but many players did not like the fact that the main task of the evil lord protagonist was having to take care of the needs of the invading heroes, and not those of their dear little monsters. Despite the flaws, Dungeons was a moderate success, and Kalypso Media has seen fit to publish its official expansion, Dungeons: The Dark Lord. Will the developers have worked around the game system problems? And will the additional content be worth the ticket price? We see. Hell hath no fury like a scorned woman The story of Dungeons: The Dark Lord restarts from the conclusion of the predecessor. Calypso, the sour succubus ex-girlfriend of the dark lord protagonist of the first chapter, is rightfully rotting in prison after betraying her boyfriend and trying to steal the magical crystal throne from him. However, the demonic temptress easily manages to escape by exploiting the stupidity of a goblin who wandered around there, and begins to meditate revenge. For her plan to succeed, she decides to team up with two creatures as evil as she is, but more stupid and easier to control: the mighty minotaur Minos and the king of the zombies. What the demoness doesn't know is that the dark lord has fused her throne into a mighty ring of power and that it is impossible to eliminate it while the artifact is intact. Then starts a demented adventure copied from the plot of the Lord of the Rings, with a huge bull, a walking skeleton and a succubus in a bikini instead of the hobbits of Tolkenian memory. The main campaign lasts about eight hours, and features slightly more varied quests than those seen in the original Dungeons. The main novelty consists in being able to use three evil lords at the same time during some chapters, a gem that guarantees the gameplay a little extra fun and complexity but does not solve its defects. First of all the repetitiveness. Luckily The Dark Lord doesn't just add a few quests to the basic package: the expansion includes four brand new multiplayer modes for those who want to show off their ~dungeon design~ skills online. Team that draws... should be reworked As we said earlier, the Dungeons: The Dark Lord game system has a huge flaw, repetitiveness. The strange thing is that it manages to be boring despite its considerable complexity. The goal of your hero (or heroine in the case of Calypso) is to build a respectable dungeon, where stereotypical heroes will periodically enter in search of fame and wealth. Every champion of justice has specific needs, such as a strong need to disarm traps, or masochistic tendencies. To satisfy these needs you will have to dig rooms in the rock with the help of very fast and obedient summoned goblins, and furnish them in order to make them effective prisons, libraries, armories, hideouts for monsters and so on. Warriors and wizards will roam your labyrinthine haven, battling your summoned beasts, and stealing what you can steal. Once satisfied, they will be full of spiritual energy, one of the main ~currencies~ of the game, useful for enhancing one's alter egos, and improving the dungeon. It is certainly not difficult to make the enemies happy, what is challenging is to eliminate them once they have reached the maximum spiritual energy without having them killed first by the dungeon monsters or letting them escape. It's a series of interesting mechanics during the first few hours, but it doesn't take much to lose interest and at the hundredth hero slaughtered you start wanting something more. Occasional boss fights, the need to keep an eye on the ~heart of the dungeon~, the multiple usable resources (very important the ~prestige~ obtainable with someconstructions), and some peculiar objectives are not enough to resolve everything. A pity, also because the gameplay has some interesting role-playing elements, and many options for improving your cave. There is no in between with Dungeons: The Dark Lord, you either love it or hate it. You could waste hours building the ultimate lair, or get tired after 25 seconds flat. It just depends on your tastes, of course, but objectively it could have been better structured. In fact, among the problems there are also some inaccuracies in the commands, a poor sense of growth of the protagonists (with each mission their statistics are reset and you have to start over), a skill bar that does not change from character to character, and unclear tutorial. Nothing terrifying, but they are all chips that count in the final judgment, and prevent the title from positioning itself as an evolution of Dungeon Keeper. I bought an IKEA torture wheel Dungeons: The Dark Lord's multiplayer has potential. Challenging human players should raise the challenge level of Realmforge's work and guarantee hours of extra entertainment. Even the four proposed modes promise very well: with the classic Deathmatch, King of The Hill and Survival, and the curious Pinata (no prisons, and prestige gained with each hero kill). All of this however falls apart due to some serious shortcomings. First of all, rather unstable servers that have an unfortunate tendency to kick out of games, if one can find any. The menus are also bad, not very intuitive and unnecessarily complex. Overcome these adversities, and you will find that multiplayer is undoubtedly the best way to enjoy Dungeons: The Dark Lord. However, given its importance, a little extra care certainly wouldn't hurt. Technically the game has a certain style, which often pays homage to the work of Bullfrog which inspired it, but certainly not astonishing in terms of detail or beauty. The English dubbings are good and some dialogues are nice, even if the plot is as original as the tarot of a pumice stone.", "date": "2011-10-12", "grade": "7.5"}
