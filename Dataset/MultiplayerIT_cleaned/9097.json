The first episode of iBlast Moki had already positively surprised many fans of physics-based puzzle games, thanks to the ingenious idea of using the shock wave of the detonation of improbable bombs as a means of transport for the nice Mokis; its sequel, iBlast Moki 2 greatly amplifies the proven gameplay, introducing many new features and winking at the best seller Little Big Planet. Play, Create and Share: a slogan invented by the famous Sony exclusive but which is well suited, as we will see, also to the title of the lesser known boys of Godzilab. smart bombs Continuing the short tradition therefore, in iBlast Moki 2 the goal remains to teleport the funny little animals called Moki to safety, pushing them up to the portal present in each level. Unfortunately, the Mokis are not equipped with legs or other methods of walking: the direct consequence is that, to move, they can only rely on the players' skills as bomb squad. In fact, detonating a grenade continues to be the main means of locomotion: placing the explosive with your finger will indicate an estimated trajectory of the shock wave that the Moki will then follow; any slopes or ramps will finally help the nice creature (or more than one continuing in the levels) to reach the coveted exit. But as mentioned in the introduction, other types of devices and objects with more disparate effects have been introduced alongside the usual grenades, useful for overcoming particular terrain conformations: therefore, the sticky bomb can be used, which allows the Moki to remain attached to rolling surfaces (such as wheels or trolleys), or the rebounding one, useful for making them jump over obstacles and cliffs, and ending with the accelerating one, indispensable for providing an adequate run-up near a ramp. The objects available, with decidedly less traumatic effects, are balloons and rope; in particular, this last versatile tool allows both to tie the Mokis to the balloons and to join several pieces of rope together, thus creating customized solutions. The perfect combination of all the paraphernalia available, together with a good dose of intuition and reasoning, thus makes any type of difficulty surmountable but, if you are unable to get to the bottom of a particular level, it is always possible to view the best solutions proposed by other online users (a system of credits that can also be purchased ~in the app~ however prevents the abuse of this function). The complexity of the levels included in the game always manages to amaze, with the solutions often resulting from complicated combinations of various bombs and balloons; the detonation can also be postponed thanks to a convenient timer, adjustable by turning the virtual ring around the grenades with your finger. Finally, after the 90 levels, iBlast Moki 2 offers if possible the best part of itself: the powerful editor in fact allows you to create infinite additional levels, share them online and have them voted by the community of enthusiasts. Even if for obvious reasons we are not at the levels of Little Big Planet, the tools made available by the developers offer a huge range of customizations, the limit of which is given only by the player's imagination (and free time). Even on a technical level, the title offers joy for the eyes, thanks to the beautiful graphics full of colors and high definition; cheerfulness that also shines through from the nice background music, perfectly in theme. The game's features are completed by full support for the Open Feint and Game Center achievement system, yet another demonstration of its great social vocation.
