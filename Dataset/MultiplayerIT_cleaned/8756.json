Out on March 1, 2022 on PC, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S (on Game Pass from D1), PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, this new adventure leaves the arid lands of the first chapter and takes us to a world aquatic. To find out if the new features have hit the mark, continue reading our review of FAR: Changing Tides. Storytelling 2.0 The boat from FAR: Changing Tides FAR: Changing Tides is, to all intents and purposes, a 2.0 version of the first chapter of the saga. The underlying ideas are exactly the same, starting with the narrative. In the role of a minute nameless and completely silent character, we must venture into a desolate and submerged world, accompanied only by our boat. There is, basically, a story, that of the Ancients, humans who lived through the great catastrophe that flooded the world and destroyed cities. However, it is a sibylline and narrow narration, which works as a context but cannot (and does not want, in our opinion) to be central to the experience. The true meaning of the journey, among other things, is understood only in the final instant which gives a closure and a wider meaning to the entire first game of the series. Don't expect to experience a great narrative epic: FAR: Changing Tides is an adventure based on its own atmosphere and is built around solitude and silence, similar to works like LIMBO and Journey (just to name two classics). Unlike its sources of inspiration, however, FAR: Changing Tides always lacks that extra quid, that extra shot, that truly evocative scene that can remain impressed. Not that he doesn't try, on a couple of occasions, but he never succeeds. The end result therefore falls into the ~pleasant but not great~ category. Gameplay The boat in FAR: Changing Tides consists of various sections FAR: Changing Tides is based on the structure of the first chapter not only at the narrative level, but also at the gameplay level. The adventure begins with obtaining our boat, which obviously has a large sail that takes advantage of the force of the wind. From the first moment you notice the evolution of the game and the willingness of the developers to make the interaction with our vehicle a little more structured. If in Lone Sails the sails are simply raised or lowered, in Changing Tides we will have to hoist the mainmast, climb it, extend the sails with a rope and then control them with a rudder to move them and follow the direction of the wind, maximizing our speed. Nothing complex or demanding, but it is immediately a symptom of the expansion of the level of interaction. As the adventure progresses, we will activate the boat's combustion engine, which allows us to burn rubbish - to be recovered along our route, always conveniently within reach when we need it most - to move the oars. In a similar way to the first game, we'll have to give the boat speed, keep the engine temperature under control, organize the trash to send it to the burner when the previous supply is about to run out, and more. The boat from FAR: Changing Tides can become a submarine In Lone Sails, the boat expanded its structure with small additions along the way, which, however, did not change the focus of the gameplay in a massive way. In FAR: Changing Tides, on the other hand, we can even transform the boat into a submarine. In that moment, we will not only have to master the left-right movement, but also the up-down, pulling levers, pressing buttons and keeping our stocks in check. It never becomes complex, we repeat, but the management of the boat is less linear and repetitive than in the first chapter, for a more differentiated journey, even if not without criticism. In fact, the rhythm of the game is too often interrupted by sailing phases in the open sea where there is practically nothing to do except look at a generic horizon and listen to the (pleasant but repetitive) ambient music. Changing Tides takes about 4 and a half hours to complete, which is a little more than the first chapter, but would have benefited from some filings and a slightly lower hour count. There is no shortage of walking sections in FAR: Changing Tides However, the game is not solely based on boat management. FAR: Changing Tides also brings back the ~land~ sections (there's no land this time, but you get the idea) of Lone Sails. These are puzzle platform stages, simple, but once again more structured than those of the first game. In fact, we will often have to interact with the environment, activating machinery of various kinds, moving trains, winches and opening huge gatesand thus allow passage to the boat. These are pleasant sections that are able to change the rhythm of the game in the right way and take us far enough away from the boat, so as not to make the game too monotonous, but at the same time without taking away the centrality of the relationship with our boat.", "date": "2022-02-21", "grade": "7.8"}
