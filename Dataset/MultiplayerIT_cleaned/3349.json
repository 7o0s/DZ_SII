The game follows the events of the Bleach story, involving us in a sequence of chapters often punctuated by images taken from the anime itself (unfortunately in low definition), and obviously enriched by the presence of all the characters that fans of the series know well. Everything begins when the aforementioned Ichigo Kurosaki comes into possession of the powers of the Shinigami, receiving them from Rukia Kuchiki: the boy understands the weight of this responsibility and swears to defend people from the attack of evil spirits that move between this world and the beyond. Naturally, the plot is punctuated by an exorbitant number of fights with increasingly stronger opponents, which will push Ichigo to draw on all his resources to fulfill his mission. Gameplay and structure The interface of Bleach Mobile 3D is typical of MMORPGs for iOS and Android, clearly of oriental derivation: lots of icons on the screen, texts, names and notes which can be confusing at first and require a little practice to be assimilated. The same progression system is divided between various screens and items that can be spent for enhancing the characters and their equipment, an indispensable element in order to be able to proceed in the story from a certain point onwards. In fact, we are talking about a freemium title, which as such can be downloaded and used for free, but after the first few chapters it introduces a paywall which forces you to carry out a fair amount of grinding in order to grow and acquire the skills necessary to defeat new enemies. Unfortunately the narrative component is sacrificed on the altar of speed: the game lacks the right timing and a rigorous direction, which knows how to enhance the various sequences and dialogues; and so we find ourselves skipping the texts and rapidly projecting ourselves from one task to another, even resorting to the automatic movement, without paying too much attention to the details and throwing ourselves headlong into the fights. Also to blame for an urban hub that is not exactly splendid to look at, spoiled by big pop-up problems and cel-shaded graphics that unfortunately don't come close to the best that can be found in the mobile sector. It's a shame, because the Japanese dialogues give the game the right atmosphere, in concert with a decent soundtrack. Once on a mission, the touch control system allows you to act as in any action RPG, using a virtual analog stick on the left side of the screen and a series of buttons of different sizes on the right side: the largest activates the standard attack , the others allow you to make quick shots and special moves, some of which are quite spectacular. By unlocking some travel companions we will also be able to count on assist maneuvers that are also beautiful to look at and rather effective, however in the context of a very first phase of the campaign trivial on the challenge front, in which it is possible to beat anyone without suffering damage. The rendering of the impacts is good but not excellent, however the biggest problem lies in the repetitiveness of the situations, which is not even smoothed by the presence of some side modes, including a strategic-based multiplayer.", "date": "2019-11-28", "grade": "6.5"}
