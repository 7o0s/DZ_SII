{"name": "Frontline: Fields of Thunder - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/frontline-fields-of-thunder-recensione.html", "text": "Sturmtruppen ready for action! As we have already mentioned, Frontline offers the player the opportunity to tackle the multiplayer mode and the two single-player campaigns by entering the uniform of a German or Russian officer, for a total of 10 missions per campaign. Before taking part in the actual action it is possible, as well as highly recommended for novices of the genre (and of the Blitzkrieg series in particular), to take part in an exhaustive tutorial on the basic and advanced functions of your troops, arriving prepared for the clashes that the game offers and which, we assure you, will give even the most savvy players a hard time. In confirmation of what has just been said, whatever the deployment chosen for the campaign, Frontline immediately puts us in front of a difficult task: the first mission with the German troops in fact sets as its objective the conquest of a town to be used as an outpost to make way for the 'into a campaign filled with anti-tank mines, and then launch the actual attack on the city, the ultimate goal of the mission. At this point it becomes obligatory to dwell on the realism of the game, appreciable among other things through the Encyclopaedia, a complete and detailed list of all the means involved in the conflict that actually happened, complete with accompanying data and which can be consulted by the main menu. Efforts in terms of realism were also dedicated to the creation of the game's scenarios, referring to aerial photos of the time thanks to which the developers reproduced the battlefields in as detailed a way as possible, compatibly with the needs that a videogame and in detail a strategic may have. Frontline's fidelity to real events also translates into above-standard game difficulty, forcing the player to immediately understand what the wind is like and to adapt to this level, developing strategies worthy of the best general to be able to successfully complete the missions; the downside is the risk of trying several times with poor results to achieve the objectives of the game, inexorably ending up with discouragement, prematurely abandoning the battlefield. Make way for the Panzers In this new evolution of Blitzkrieg, the tanks are the masters, the real protagonists of the battle of Kursk. However, this does not mean that the infantry should be completely forgotten, given that its use can help and also the heavy vehicles a lot, thanks to the possibility of the captains to use the binoculars to increase the visual range, as usual prey to the so-called fog of war, the real plague for the strategy player, which to be honest in Frontline should have been implemented a little better, given that the defects found in the hands-on phase seem to have remained even in the final version of the game (very unrealistically , the view does not increase by climbing a plateau). The multiplayer, contrary to what might be expected these days, is not worthy of note, as it consists only of the capture the flag mode, already seen in Blitzkrieg 2: the goal is to conquer buildings and other key objects scattered on the map, to obtain points and reinforcements for your deployment, while preventing your opponent from acquiring the same things as above. In short, nothing that hasn't already been seen, and nothing worth spending sleepless nights in front of the PC for. Technically speaking Moving on to the purely technical side of Frontline, in particular to the graphics, we find a game engine suitable for the most agitated battle scenes, able to suffer from FPS losses very rarely even on less performing systems, to which we find the system requirements , quite affordable. The details of the units are taken care of, especially the armored vehicles, without however forgetting infantry and the like, while the passage of the tanks on the surrounding environment is very realistic, which changes with falling trees, destruction of fences and more. making the various war movements very beautiful and ~destructive~ to see. The only real flaw of the graphics sector is the low level of zoom: while not wanting to count the hair on the head of every single soldier, it would have been nice to be able to better appreciate what the game has to offer us, especially in consideration of those who are now the standard that the genre has more or less adopted internally. Moving on to the sound, we are met with a soundtrack that does its job by adapting to the various moments of the battle and a German / Russian dubbing of the units that does not giveI'm sorry, sometimes resulting even funny for us Italians.

Now however, the new effort of the Russian developers must necessarily deal with the recently released strategic ones, among all Company of Heroes and the result, unfortunately for Frontline, is not in its favor. A more refined multiplayer and the introduction of some innovation in the Blitzkrieg game system could have tipped the balance a little more towards Nival's work, which on balance is a lost opportunity for the consecration of the whole series. Be that as it may, the realism and the level of difficulty will put a strain on the warm minds of gamers from all over the world, obviously including the ardent fans of the Blitzkrieg series who will not be disappointed in any case, even if they want some innovation that maybe can come in the future with a 'expansion. Pros Very realistic If you love armored vehicles you will have bread for your teeth Cons High difficulty Nothing new under the sun Poor zoom level Blitzche? The number of strategic games set during the greatest war conflict in history is second only to the jokes that have been spent over the years highlighting the aforementioned phenomenon, which has spread like wildfire not only among this genre but a bit in all the others of the video game market, re-proposing clashes between the Allies and the Axis more or less in all sauces. However, Frontline: Fields of Thunder is not yet another experiment of a newborn development team, but the result of the experience gained by Nival Interactive over time through two chapters of Blitzkrieg and related expansions: the new name therefore does not draw you deceived. On the occasion of this new chapter in the Blitzkrieg series, in which we would like to include Frontline anyway (given its similarities with the past despite the new name), the focus is for once on the eastern front of the battle in Europe, thus leaving resting Anglo-American soldiers and placing the player in the shoes of a German or Russian general, depending on his preference. The scenario of the action is the battle of Kursk, in which the highest number of armored vehicles in history took part, a note from which we can deduce that the events of Frontline are more oriented towards combat between tanks, anti-tank guns and the singing company, placing the infantry in the background, orienting it more to support the metal beasts than to a front-line role, as we will see later.", "date": "2007-04-06", "grade": null}
