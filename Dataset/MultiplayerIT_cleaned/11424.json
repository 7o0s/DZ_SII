{"name": "Suicidal Squirrels", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/suicidal-squirrels.html", "text": "The diffusion of the internet has created a whole series of new possibilities for promotion. Just think of phenomena such as Alien Hominid, which from its application in Flash has met with enormous success and has become a video game ~properly speaking~ for all gaming systems. The case of Suicidal Squirrels is not very different: it consists of one hundred animated shorts full of black (but really black!) humor, which are currently broadcast in Germany on MTV but can also be seen via the official website of the series, so completely free. With the popularity of suicidal squirrels on the rise, it was only a short step to get these cute little animals on our phone screen. Not as cartoons, however, but in the form of a puzzle game heavily inspired by Lemmings... We know well that Lemmings, the game created for the Amiga by the DMA Design team in 1991, saw us controlling the path of a large number of small beings with suicidal aspirations. They started from the top of the screen, in a perpetual motion that could put them in dangerous situations, and we had to change their initial path using a whole series of actions. Exactly the same thing happens in the Suicidal Squirrels video game: our squirrels head towards a specific point in each stage, and we have to change their itinerary to get them to their destination. In this case, however, the final goal is not equivalent to salvation, but to a violent death: the squirrels end up disintegrated by a rotating shovel, dissolved in acid or in any case brutally eliminated. The similarities with Lemmings are not only found in the game structure, but also in the ways and situations that occur in each level. In fact, we will have a large number of powers available, to be assigned to each pet so that it can reach the stage we want. With the joystick we will be able to control a pointer on the screen, frame the squirrel we want to intervene on and press the 5 key to open a contextual menu, from which we can then select one of the powers. Everything must be done within a certain time limit, with the internships becoming more complex and multifaceted as you go along. The technical realization of the game is functional to the action, but nothing more. The squirrels are very small, identical to each other, with a poor animation that is saved only by the presence of numerous powers and abilities to be assigned. The stages boast a good use of colors, but an approximate and repetitive design: the various elements that compose them do not shine in quality, but above all they tend to repeat themselves and give the idea of an approximate work, in particular as regards the textures. The low speed adds a sense of uncertainty that is absolutely not good for the gameplay, already spoiled by the fact that we are dealing with a Lemmings clone which, however, does not equal the original in any respect, in particular it does not boast the same ~agility~ . The sound sector, as usual, is made up of a few pieces of music that do not make a difference, being largely deactivated. Finally, as regards the control system, there is little to say: controlling the pointer is simple, assigning powers too... from this point of view, the game performs well. PRO Nice graphics A good number of levels and powers Valid play structure... AGAINST ...but the comparison with Lemmings is merciless Technically far from exceptional Slow action", "date": "2008-05-13", "grade": "S.V."}
