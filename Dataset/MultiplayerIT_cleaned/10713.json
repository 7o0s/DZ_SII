A voi la scelta!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/eroe-o-infame-a-voi-la-scelta.html", "text": "Morality within video games has always been treated in the most disparate ways, where there have been titles that have made it a flag by proposing it in a subtle key, others that have exploded it or put it at the service of the actual gameplay. As in the case of Infamous, which arrives exclusively on PlayStation 3 in a rather ~quiet~ period and is ideal for showing off its undoubted qualities, while placing all the attention towards the single-player adventure without any multiplayer component. Behind the title are Sucker Punch, a relatively small team that made itself known on PlayStation 2 for the Sly Raccoon series, an action/stealth game with excellent ideas and good execution. Anyone who has played the three dedicated titles will certainly not struggle to find part of the mechanics and setting previously adopted by the developers in this game, obviously adapted to the type of game and the setting. From Sly Raccoon to Cole MacGrath The main protagonist is Cole MacGrath, a simple delivery boy on a bicycle who literally finds himself delivering a parcel bomb, containing within it the radius sphere, a particular device capable of releasing an absolutely uncontrollable power. Upon awakening everything has changed, Empire City, which is the backdrop to the events of the game, is completely torn apart, at the mercy of terrorists, assassins and stragglers, and quarantined by the federal government, for a picture that presents itself to Cole's eyes like a nightmare difficult to metabolize. In some way, however, Fortune has affected the fate of the main protagonist, now marked by a doubly bond with the electricity that flows powerfully in the fictitious metropolis created for the occasion, and which allows him to unleash some powers capable of making him very different from ordinary citizens. However, every honor has a burden, everything follows a logical thread that is revealed at the end of the adventure, and there are many characters that Cole will meet, including friends, enemies and double agents. The structure of Infamous takes up the canonical free roaming in the third person to Assassin's Creed rather than Grand Theft Auto IV. Cole uses the X key to jump and grab onto any ledge, wire, window; he can scale buildings and use all of his many powers, which we will come back to later. Reapers, Scavengers and Firstborns Empire City is divided into three large islands, each one that lives its own life with ruined buildings inside, more or less immense structures and citizens who live there with alternating feelings, between terror and courage. Dictating the law now are a sort of terrorists, who now feel strong against the authorities. In Neon, for example, there are the Reapers, equipped with a powerful arsenal of fire, including some turrets, and more advanced ~exemplars~, the Conduit, which can in turn release electrical discharges and move faster. Cole begins his story right in this neighborhood, where for large stretches the electricity has gone down the drain and must first be restored. Through the map, which can be called up using the select key, various types of missions are available, available progressively according to one's actions and divided into categories. First of all there are the main ones related to the story, which are often accompanied by animated interludes in American Comic style, with hand-drawn drawings of excellent artistic quality, while Cole's voice tells what is happening. The chosen style is well suited to the narrative, even if in some cases we would have preferred a more visually impactful representation, in light of how the story itself evolves. An ~open~ structure like that of Infamous lends itself well to proposing various secondary missions, obviously not necessary for completing the game but which bring various benefits as a gift. First of all, that of gradually making the city safer in the form of a system of conquest of the territory, which thus allows you to go around the streets a little more undisturbed without having to do your utmost in constant clashes or sudden escapes. Then obviously the possibility of acquiring more experience, which can be spent to obtain and enhance new powers, and which is linked to the development that the player wants to give to his character. At this point, in fact, the morality factor comes into play, which depends on a whole series of actions that it is possible to undertake within the game itself. The most interesting are those that must be done during the story, on how to deal with certain situations or not; in how you interact with the citizens of Empire City, since it is possible to cure those on the ground with an electric shockand trap enemies without finishing them off, or bio-drain them all without a shot being fired, or cause explosions involving even unfortunate innocents nearby. To support this structure there are 30 further missions, equally divided between good and bad, which exclude each other as one is completed and which, in addition to giving a decent amount of experience, affect the Karma of the main protagonist. At the top left there is in fact the indicator of Cole's inclination, with Karma divided into three positive blocks, which lead to the level of Hero, and three negative ones, which lead to that of Infamous. Obviously it is not possible to obtain both and the consequences are noticeable on how the citizens react to their passage (asking for help or throwing stones, fleeing or trying to lend a hand), rather than for Cole's physical appearance, clean, healthy and with a celestial aura in the case of good Karma, corrupted, dirty and with a red aura otherwise. Dulcis in fundo, experience points can be spent to enhance powers, some accessible only on the basis of one's Karma level and with slightly different functions. Each of these can be used in conjunction with the L1 key, which acts as a viewfinder, and if for example Cole the Hero uses a single bomb (with the square key) that attaches to people and explodes, the corresponding Infamous one focuses more on destructive power, dropping three. Or again with the triangle key a sort of electrically powered missiles are used, which in the first case are guided towards the heat source, while in the second there are still three without any control other than what comes from the aim. Frequently Asked Questions Where is Infamous set and what is the main protagonist's name? Empire City, you play as Cole MacGrath Who is the developer? Sucker Punch, the same as Sly Racoon on PlayStation 2 How long is the game? 15-20 hours, depending on the number of side quests completed What language is the dubbing in? Italian for audio, text and manual How many missions are there? 40 those of the main story, 30 related to Karma and another 30 secondary ones How many endings are there? Two, which come with different final narration and different graphic part after completing it Let's get electrified! Diversification therefore, both from a graphic and setting point of view, obviously without sensational differences, which mainly affect the enhancements. The main new powers, on the other hand, are learned by continuing progressively during the adventure. As mentioned, in fact, a large part of Empire City is without electricity, with areas within which the enemies are much more powerful. During the course of the adventure, Cole must therefore systematically go underground through some trapdoors. First of all, inside there are generators that act as a ~distributor~ for Cole's powers, each unlocking a new one, and the continuation of the mission really serves the player to experiment with the newly acquired ability, with equally challenging clashes that end with the arrival at the main generator that supplies the current to an area of the city. In short, the particular setting given by Sucker Punch allows you to have two rather different styles, and sometimes stop to decide which choice to take to see how the story develops, at least from a narrative point of view and for the types of missions linked to the two Karmas. From this point of view, we are not afraid to say it, the structure of the missions represents in our way of seeing what Assassin's Creed should have been, which lacked variety and repetitiveness. In Infamous this factor is largely reduced, either for a greater variety, or for the more instantaneous nature of the missions themselves and, except in some cases, this sense of frustration is never felt. We have some that ask you to clean up a certain area, escort some characters or buses, go on crazy runs around the roofs or even follow some informants. The main ones are obviously of a completely different kind and some are really well thought out, coming to offer enjoyable platform sections or to explore parts of the city with imposing structures such as that of the police station, which must be fully defended and climbed. This whole structure would not be valid if it were not supported by an adequate control system and with which one immediately becomes familiar; taking advantage of a characteristic also of its previous titles, Sucker Punch has implemented a collision ~correction~ system that allows the player to not be 100% accurate when jumping near ropes or ledges, effectively eliminating for a large partand time the possibility of making Pindaric flights on land. Added to this is the excellent management of the checkpoints, which allows you to always start over just before the last action you were doing and to concentrate on the real fun. However, this system has some sporadic problems when you need to be more precise in reaching some points where there are fragments of the explosion (the classic object to be collected in industrial quantities around the city), not to mention that sometimes we happened to witness some bugs, especially on the last island, where we were left hanging from invisible platforms or stopped by something that isn't there. Fortunately they are rather sporadic and do not undermine the playability, however they show a lack of optimization in some situations. For the rest Cole, as a good fan of electricity, has water as his weak point, which kills him almost instantly, while he recovers vitality after a certain amount of time without being hit, or by exploiting his ability to absorb energy from any element powered present around. In this sense, next to the Karmic bar, there is another indicator made up of some luminous points, these represent the electric charge in the possession of the main protagonist, which must be spent on all the main powers except the basic one. Therefore, after a series of shock waves or other, you have to ~recharge~ to be able to continue using the most powerful attacks. What is striking about Infamous is how the developer has managed to perfectly calibrate Cole's powers and how they are always unlocked at the right moment, with the main protagonist becoming more and more powerful until he becomes a fury, and in concert the difficulty of enemies and situations increases accordingly. Even the progress of the story undergoes a powerful surge starting from the second half, where the characters become more characterized, the missions interesting and engaging, to arrive at a final part with a conclusion that is far from obvious and which lays the foundations for a inevitable and welcome sequel. The gameplay also follows this line, Infamous is a title that can be played with pleasure, in its setting it leaves the side to less repetitions than one might expect, the platform and combat sections are equally interesting and one finds oneself leading to finish the game with satisfaction and in a rather long period of time, not to mention that it is possible to continue after the final boss to complete the side missions rather than unlock trophies, or even replay the title following a different Karmic inclination. Too bad that everything starts rather slowly, both from a narrative and game point of view, and therefore the impact is not among the most memorable. Some missions, fortunately a minority, are not in line with the rest, but once you enter the perspective, understand how to move faster (it is no coincidence that on every island there is also a beautiful rail that performs this purpose) you always enter more in line with the title. Playstation 3 trophies Infamous offers 50 trophies, of which 1 Gold and 11 Silver. By completing the game without banging too much you can get about 40% of the total loot. Trophies are linked, for example, to completing certain parts of the story, unlocking all powers, reaching the maximum positive or negative Karma, finding a percentage of fragments from the explosion. To receive the coveted Platinum you must complete the title at least twice, one of which on a Hard level and with Karma opposite to the previous one. Audio & Video Ups and downs, for Infamous, from a technological point of view. Empire City, in terms of extension and variety, defends itself quite well, as well as the amount of people, machines and details especially of the structures related to the main story. However, everything appears a bit static, starting from the sky or the environmental effects, present in small numbers. The explosions and all the plays of light are still absolutely positive things, above all when the period of the day is linked to sunset or sunrise (there is no natural passage of time, but one passes from one day to another after a certain number of missions), the glance is certainly pleasant, where the best situations are found in the most numerous clashes rather than in the fights with the bosses. On the other hand, again, the aliasing is quite marked, there is some drop in frame rate in the ~fullest~ situations and also in this case we noticed some scattered graphic ~glitches~. The dubbing is completely in Italian for both the dialogues and the texts, more than valid for the main protagonists. Note how much better than others", "date": "2009-05-26", "grade": "9.0"}
