Certainly interesting and inspired content that re-proposes one of the most popular backgrounds of recent times. Back to the classic myth We have therefore returned to immerse ourselves in an imaginary strongly inspired by the Greek myth that we can find not only in the presence of gods, demigods and creatures linked to the imaginary of ancient Greece, but also in the graphic style of the cards that wink to various elements of the epic poems and to others present in what is the most famous iconography concerning that period. Even the Sagas, a type of card that returns after a period of absence, are an element that takes up the theme of epic poems and hero myths, narrating deeds of incredible workmanship through several phases in the same card. Like any self-respecting expansion, Theros Beyond Death introduces a new set with new/old mechanics and keywords, so let's see which ones. First we will find the Escape mechanic: a mechanic linked to the concept of the ~second chance~ for the deceased, which will translate into the possibility in-game for the cards in the graveyard with this ability to be played again. However, like any action in Magic, to take advantage of such a power you will have to exile cards in your graveyard and the number of this exile will vary from card to card. Escape cards can obviously be countered with instants or sorceries, but the most important aspect is that there are some creatures that add bonuses to the Escape element, such as an increase in attack and defense once they return to play using Escape. This will therefore allow you to create a decidedly varied and layered set of combinations. A very important keyword in Theros Beyond Death will be Constellation. What in terms of narrative background is one of the elements most closely linked to the Greek myth, i.e. the search for the favor of the gods through their constellations (even the Mastery menu is linked to the concept of constellations), translates in-game with the keyword Constellation. The Constellation is a bonus guaranteed to cards that have it and that is activated, for example, every time you cast a spell. Each bonus that can be activated with Constellation is different from card to card and the best use is obviously through a chained use of different cards with Constellation in order to activate multiple bonuses with the least number of turns possible. Finally, Devotion, an important mechanic linked to the gods of the pantheon of Theros. As we also saw in our special on the plane of the gods, Devotion is a useful tool for the gods to bask in the pleasure of feeling feared and revered and despite being a concept very steeped in narrative, even in-game it is one of the most interesting mechanics so far , precisely for the different uses based on the type of god. Devotion to a color is calculated based on the number of mana of that particular color present on the battlefield and this allows you to activate different abilities of various cards. The most popular at the moment are those related to the gods, creatures capable of changing the tide of battle in a snap of the fingers thanks to Devotion. Beyond the key features of Theros Beyond Death, the expansion brings with it a new mastery tree and a new pass with several free and premium rewards, marked by the accumulation of exp by playing both standard and in sealed than with drafts. Nothing new therefore to report in terms of additions to the margins of the cards. Precisely on the latter we would like to focus both on a graphic level with the very suggestive full art and more generally a very inspired style of the whole expansion, and on a practical level because several new cards have turned out to be quite superlative. Let's talk about the Red-Blue deck ~Purforos Devotion~ which is currently able to shred any opponent thanks to a truly monstrous solidity in the early, mid and late game. Using Fires of Invention together with Prowess of the Ironpeak allows you to have a large amount of lands available to cast any 0-cost card in order to trigger Purforos with its ability to play Drakuseth, Terror of Mount Velus and Illharg in the most short time as possible in order to do a huge amount of damage even in double strike. Thanks to these combinations currently ~Purforos Devotion~ is able to win a game in a round by reversing a situation of prolonged dominance of the opponent. ~Nylea Devotion~ also seems to be a deck capable of making a difference, although not at the level of Purforos.", "date": "2020-01-25", "grade": "8.0"}
