{"name": "Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-recensione-per-nintendo-switch.html", "text": "Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice was released about a year and a half ago, more exactly in August 2017, on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC: the world and the critics were dumbfounded. Ninja Theory, the most recent of the Microsoft acquisitions, had hit the mark once again, telling a profound and fascinating story, tackling very intense and profound themes, accompanied by a truly remarkable technical sector and artistic direction. Many still carry Senua's story with them, others (hopefully there will be many) will be able to do so now that Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice arrives on Nintendo Switch, the hybrid console of the Kyoto House with apparently unstoppable success. Surprisingly announced during the last Nintendo Direct, the game has already been available for a few days on Nintendo Switch, only in the digital version, the result of a conversion that took a long time. The point of arrival is a complete, satisfactory product, probably the best that could be legitimately expected on the (also) portable console from Nintendo: the fact remains that the porting required numerous compromises. We tell you about them in our review of Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice. Plot: Celts, Norse, psychosis It seems that April 2019 should be remembered as the month of long-awaited portings on Nintendo Switch, even if they belong to very different genres: the other day we brought you the review of Cuphead on Nintendo Switch, now it's Hellblade's turn: Senua's Sacrifice. However, don't expect to find in the second of the two the same light-hearted themes as the first, and not even the same videogame genre: Senua's adventure is a tortuous path into the abyss of madness, into the neurosis that afflicts the mind and the person of the protagonist; it is played on two different levels of reality, the inner one of the tormented heroine, the outer one of the Celtic world recently conquered by the Norse invader. And the external and contextual world of Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice will definitely make the fans of Nordic and more specifically Norse mythology happy, the same as the most recent chapter of God of War. The plot is also apparently linear and simple: Senua is the warrior of a Pitta village (pre-Roman Scottish population). Her tribe is attacked and decimated by the Norse invaders, who in the brutal raid and conquest also kill Dillion, the man she is in love with: she then begins her journey to the realm of the dead, Hel, in an attempt to bring him back to life . A bit like the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, but on the contrary, and with Eurydice in a strong state of confusion: after all, Freudian psychoanalysis, of which the production of Ninja Theory is steeped, has taught us well how the functioning of the human mind can be easily compromised by traumatic experiences. An enemy invasion, the destruction of a village and the death of a loved one are definitely traumatic experiences. But these brief considerations are not sufficient to explain the psychological depth and scientific precision that accompany Senua's journey in Hel. From an early age, the girl manifested forms of neurosis, the same ones that for a long time the Western historical tradition (pre-Christian and then Christian) considered (almost always) mystical experiences, real encounters with the divinity. The madman has always been privileged, the one who was in contact with the divine world: he could have experiences closed to the rest of mortals. For Senua exactly this happens: the voices in her head, the Furies, lead her to the realm of the dead. Here he must face a series of lesser and greater gods, all dangerous, in a desperate race against time to save Dillion. We won't anticipate you further, nor would we ever dare to anticipate the conclusion of the journey, but never as in this case is the experience of the journey itself more important than its real goal and its end. Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice is a videogame experience that oscillates between the interactive adventure proper, the action, the exploratory title and the puzzle game. Most of the adventure is in dialogue, Senua constantly talks with the voices in her head that answer her, guide her, deceive her, press her, mock her. The player controls the protagonist in a third-person view, through Nordic and hellish environments of various types; solves rather elementary environmental puzzles and others a little more complex, but never really difficult (unfortunately, however, very repetitive); from time to time he fights enemies in white weapon duels, also in this case never really insurmountable and without a system of progression or enhancement of one's skills, which in the adventure in question is notit would have no reason to exist. The conversion to Nintendo Switch We come to the thorny crux of the matter, namely the conversion to Nintendo Switch from a technical, graphic and acoustic point of view. Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice arrives on the hybrid console of the Kyoto House with a more than decent port: it can be seen very well on the Full HD TV in the living room, a little less well (but still in a largely acceptable way) in portable mode, it is always listened to with attention and pleasure preferring a nice pair of headphones. From our point of view, playing Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice in portable mode instead paradoxically risks distorting the production itself, which always requires a lot of attention from the player: losing a detail, a word or thinking about a level affects the understanding of the whole story. If you really feel the need to play the title in this last configuration, it is probably better to do it in closed places and where you are sure of not being interrupted constantly or shortly thereafter, otherwise the narrative situations and the entire experience will be fragmented ; completing the game takes more or less nine hours, and it's not a bad idea to organize yourself into sessions of about two hours each, possibly close together. Even the aliasing and lower performance in portable mode, however, provide a decent incentive to enjoy Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice in TV (or docked) mode: the title runs at 30FPS (fixed) and 720p in fixed mode, while at parity of frames the overall graphic performance decreases a little more in the portable (or tabletop) version. To make a purely illustrative comparison, we recall that the game could be enjoyed on PlayStation 4 Pro with two different settings: 1440p and 30 FPS or 1080p and 60 FPS. Considering that Nintendo Switch still has hardware-related limitations, the conversion of Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice seemed like a happy medium: it's not excellent, but it still represents a good job, from any point of view you want to consider it . It is certainly pleasing, however, to see an enlarged catchment area and players who will be able to play Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice for the first time, enjoying a truly unique adventure of its kind. The Ninja Theory team has thoroughly studied the theme of neurosis and madness, thanks to the support of a team of scientists and specialists in the sector; to this are added the extraordinary acting skills, identification and expressiveness of Melina Juergens, face and body of Senua thanks to the most sophisticated motion capture systems. Among other things, the Nintendo Switch version also includes special content related to the making of the title, an additional value for all those who want to further investigate the development phase and the background of the game.", "date": "2019-04-21", "grade": "8.2"}
