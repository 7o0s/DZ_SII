But despite the similarities, first of all the setting, the New World Interactive title, a software house that includes some members of the Red Orchestra development team, stands out from the direct competition for the degree of realism and adding to the obvious objective-based multiplayer modes a substantial offer dedicated to cooperative play. For now, unfortunately, just two of the three promised cooperative modes are missing, but the present one is already sufficient to evaluate the artificial intelligence of the enemies who, although not particularly brilliant, are fast, equipped with good aim and rather ~human ~. In fact, these are not automatically aware of our position, contrary to what happens in other titles with similar modes, and can be circumvented or confused by smoke grenades, guaranteeing players the possibility of devising complex tactics that are absolutely necessary to face the bot on higher difficulties. In Insurgency, rioters and special forces face off in a deadly conflict Reasoned shooter Born from the idea of a former Canadian soldier, now community manager of New World Interactive, Insurgency entrusts its appeal to the rather high realism combined with teams structured according to predefined roles. By entering the chosen server, players can occupy specific positions, among those left free, and in some cases, such as the demolisher, these are essential to accomplish certain objectives. Each class allows you to draw from a specific selection of weapons and devices, but there is a limit to the equipment you can carry. Limit regulated by a points system which makes customization rather interesting by avoiding the implementation of a growth system which always risks disadvantaging newly arrived players. By spending all the points on the weapon it becomes difficult to get them for the armor while choosing heavy protection it is necessary to save on the offensive potential. But as much as resisting a blow can be decidedly relevant in a title characterized by extremely precise and lethal weapons, mortality is always high and the tactical approach is the only one recommended even if often leaning slowly from every corner is not enough to survive. In fact, the opponents can hit us from a great distance, the grenades have an extreme range of action, many surfaces are perforated by the shots and there is a further detail that makes the lurking enemies decidedly dangerous. In fact, the front of the soldier's body lifts slightly when entering aiming mode while prone. A decidedly simulative choice that further increases the need to pay close attention, especially when you are in the role of someone who has to attack a target. The maps are also designed to enhance realism with a Middle Eastern setting, which ranges from Iraq to Afghanistan, combined with alleys and multiple passages that always make it possible to circumvent, allow you to find protection and avoid the risk of shootings chaotic even where 32 players compete for a large but not huge battlefield. All this further increases the tactical tenor of the title by enhancing the usefulness of the microphone, which has integrated chat even when playing with complete strangers. Not that a prodigy of aiming can't make a difference, but running wild, in a title with virtually no visual cues, very often results in a quick and merciless death inflicted by a seemingly invisible enemy. And this is what makes Insurgency appreciable, beyond the defects or the not excellent graphics. Instead of following Call of Duty, the New World Interactive title chooses the path of reasoning and gives up convenient growth systems by aiming for a balancing-oriented customization system. The last mile Insurgency, in essence, does not miss several goodies that make it a decidedly interesting product in the eyes of those who appreciate tactics and reasoned movements. But, despite the title having come out of the Early Access phase, there are still several refinements missing which we hope will be implemented before the already announced DLCs. The interface is deliberately minimalist and sparse but it is clear that, especially where friendly fire is active, it would be better to make the indicators responsible for signaling who our companions are more visible. Furthermore, two of the three promised cooperative modes are still missing and the present one, which asks us to progressively conquer a series of checkpoints,still needs a lot of filings. Refinements that should include the ability to host co-op on the fly so you can quickly set up a game with friends. To this we must then add some glitches related to the spectator mode, some interpenetration too many, and various other ingenuities to fix. But the netcode is solid, the options related to the control system are many, the weapons are precise and well simulated, the modes are numerous and the co-op is interesting. An imperfect picture emerges, which does not miss even some inopportune crashes, but full of potential that we hope will emerge more clearly after a few full-bodied patches. In any case, the price is competitive and the balanced matches generate a palpable tension. With the introduction of the last two cooperative modes, the final picture will include nine game variants of which seven, already present, which include the skirmish, the classic shooting and different objective modes which are all well differentiated from each other. And the same can be said of the maps, currently seven, to which we must add about twenty weapons, some of which can be equipped by all classes, excellently simulated.", "date": "2014-02-11", "grade": "8.0"}
