Apart from the awareness of being born in a test tube from the hair (or worse) of who knows what generous donor, apart from calling you X2 while your brother is called X1 (who knows people's reaction when the two walk into a betting shop... ) and apart from militancy in an army that is sent without much hesitation to slaughter instead of ~normal people~, you also allow yourself the luxury of having a conscience. And so when Chancellor Palpatine issues the fateful ~order 66~ resulting in the extermination of all Jedi Knights, you don't feel like obeying the directives and run away from your companions and from your only relative, who apparently received in full the amount of wickedness meant for both of you when you were in the fetal state. Divided into a series of chapters that take place parallel to the events narrated in the six films directed by George Lucas, Star Wars Battlefront: The Special Squadron puts us in command of the twins X1 and X2 in an action game with a three-quarter view from above , whose stages are generally completed by eliminating all the enemies present, activating some switches and perhaps facing a boss. The standard game action is interspersed with shoot 'em up sequences in which we control a ship or an assault turret, or with short rides aboard the famous Speeders. Double action The control system adopted for the game is classic: the d-pad to move the character, the B button to shoot with the equipped weapon, the A button to switch weapons between the two available, the Y button to use the special weapon and the X button to interact with the scenery. The L and R back buttons are used respectively to lock-on enemies and to switch between the close-up and distance views. The touch functions remain practically unused, while a radar appears on the lower screen which indicates from time to time the position of enemies and key objects within the stage. During the shooting phases, the controls are very simplified: the d-pad to move the ship (but it is not possible to accelerate or brake: it is all automatic), the R backbone to perform an evasive maneuver capable of avoiding the missiles and the B buttons and Y to fire volleys or missiles at the tiny targets that we will see appearing in the distance. Let's say immediately that these alternative sections on the one hand have the merit of breaking the monotony of the standard game action, on the other hand they have a very limited and approximate gameplay, with a simplistic combat system capable of returning very little satisfaction. The lack of direct control of the acceleration of the spacecraft, together with the classic space background, makes everything very static. In the scenarios where we have to drive a Speeder, things change a lot in terms of speed, with the background flowing very quickly, but the aiming system in this context is even less accurate. There are therefore some big problems that concern the game design, which are not mitigated by the good plot or by the splendid illustrations that enrich the dialogues between one level and another. Class is not water The standard game phases, with a top-down view, are characterized by very short and simple stages, which can be completed in a few minutes. Things are enlivened only by the presence of four different classes that we can select for our character when we are near the appropriate device. The initial class is that of the assault rifleman: the basic weapon is a fast and fairly powerful beam cannon, which alternates with a sort of devastating shotgun from short ranges, while the special equipment consists of grenades from throwing. The second class that we can unlock is that of heavy armament, with a powerful machine gun as a basic weapon and a grenade launcher as a secondary, while the special weapon is a bomb that we can detonate on command. The third class is that of the engineer, obviously less effective in firefights but equipped with fundamental tools to repair certain switches: the basic weapon is an electric pulse cannon also capable of stunning enemies, the secondary one is a powerful grenade launcher, while the special equipment consists of up to three droids that once activated fight alongside us. The last class is that of the spy, also placed as a pass in certain phases of the game: the basic weapon is a very fast double laser cannon, the secondary one a sort of homing flamethrower, while the special weapon is a throwing grenade. Regardless of the type of equipment selectedionato, unfortunately the aiming system without lock-on is unusable and therefore the action is reduced to a series of movements aimed at avoiding enemy fire while we wait for our attacks to disintegrate even the last remaining drone. In this sense, the clashes with the bosses constitute a pleasant diversion, given the variety of situations and patterns to memorize; but once again they are not enough to remedy the general mediocrity of the title developed by N-Space, a mediocrity which also and above all afflicts the technical sector: beyond the aforementioned interlude illustrations, the polygonal models of the characters are very little detailed, while the scenarios are always small and full of invisible obstacles. The best thing is undoubtedly the sound sector, which relies on the usual music and effects of the film, however afflicted by a low sampling quality.", "date": "2010-01-06", "grade": "5.0"}
