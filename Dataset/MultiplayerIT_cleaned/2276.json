{"name": "New York Race: corse direttamente dal ~quinto elemento~", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/new-york-race-corse-direttamente-dal-quinto-elemento.html", "text": "Introduction However, if Besson's film is characterized by the photography (well-finished), by the scenography (admirable in the panoramas of the megalopolis), by the costumes and by the visual inventions: saturation and chromatic contrasts, almost obsessive insistence of orange and blue hues, a post- artfully smug baroque like not seen on the big screen since Flash Gordon, NYR doesn't settle on the same expressive levels, but merely copies the idea of flying cars around a futuristic city copied from that of the film. Is this enough to make a good game? If you answered NO, then you won an M.it puppet (have you not put them into Pucci production yet?). The review Let's go back to the real review talking about the graphics engine and audio effects. Nothing to complain about both aspects: the graphics engine is able to process very complex scenes and very rich in colors and light effects. A praise to the programmers who have been able to create a really nice graphics engine (perhaps too expensive at high resolutions, but perfectly usable at low resolutions with not too powerful computers). The review Don't trust too much the minimum requirements declared on the package: pentium 2 400. With such a computer you will struggle to play even at the lower resolution. As for the audio effects nothing to report. For lovers of the genre, I point out that the CD contains the WAV tracks that will be played while we make our forays into the various circuits. A completely personal judgment is that listening to this type of music makes me want to throw myself out the window (even if I'm on the ground floor) and in the second game I disabled the music inside the game. I don't exclude that (since tastes are tastes) someone might find these 12 tracks something enjoyable and usable. The game is structured in a very classic way: you will have the usual game modes present in all games of the genre. You can take on the championship mode (which is used to unlock the tracks), the single race (to practice in a certain circuit), the timed race (in practice you will ride on the tracks with the sole purpose of completing a fast lap) and the KEIRIN mode (at each ~checkpoint~ the competitor who is in the last position is eliminated and so on until only one player remains). After winning the various challenges proposed by the championship mode, new tracks and new vehicles will be blocked (I don't think it's new). Wrapping it up (and it's pains for NYR) Are you thinking that the game could be fun and are you about to go out and buy it? STOPIIIIIIIII! We come to the really painful part of the game: playability. We're in bad shape.. The game offers great freedom of movement of the vehicle (as well as being able to accelerate and brake, point the nose of the vehicle up and down, overdo it right, left and overdo it up and down ). This freedom, combined with the fact that the routes are very twisted, with the fact that you only need to hit a wall to lose almost all speed, with the fact that it is very difficult to stay in the lead, but very easy to make a mistake and find yourself in last position ( and catching up on opponents is really a difficult task) is a source of irritation for the player. I tried to play with the keyboard, with a joypad, with a joystick, but I never found myself comfortable with the controls, not being able to control the flying vehicle effectively enough. Wrapping it up (and it's pains for NYR) If we combine all this with the fact that the route intertwines with a sort of space railway crossed by nice shuttles sponsored by Orangina and that when you least expect it you will plant yourself against one of these vehicles that have come out of nowhere, the final result is that the game is extremely frustrating. After an initial momentum (which in my case didn't last long anyway) anger will take over and then boredom. The futuristic racing genre is very rich in titles that are worth playing. Before thinking that NYR is your game, I suggest you try at least one of these great masterpieces of the ~futuristic racing~ genre: POD, WIPEOUT, ROLLCAGE or DETHKARZ. One of the first sentences of the manual in Italian says: ~if your nerves are fragile, think carefully before starting!~ I didn't have enough nerve: GOODBYE NYR. Introduction The story related toNew York Racer is peculiar. I would have been ready to write a review at least a month ago, but due to problems related to the Christmas holidays and university exams I had to postpone writing it. Usually after receiving a video game, after having played it intensively for a rather short period and after having collected all its aspects, one throws oneself on the ARTICOLI engine to put one's impressions on paper. As far as New York Racer is concerned, however, I had the opportunity to replay it after a rather long period in order to be able to re-evaluate the impressions born from the first gaming experiences. And unfortunately the impressions have remained the same (and the fact that he didn't play it during the Christmas holidays is a bad sign). New York Racer is a driving simulation set in the future 2215 (guess where? Exactly NY CITY). From the first look at the game packaging, it is clear that one of the strong points of the game is the inspiration: NYR should in fact be taken from the film ~The Fifth Element~. I say that it should be drawn, not because it isn't, but because the game has drawn only a very small part of that film (and more precisely the chases with flying cars). Probably the producers, knowing that the quality of the game would not have been sufficient to convince a possible buyer, focused on associating ideas with Luc Besson's film.", "date": "2002-01-14", "grade": null}
