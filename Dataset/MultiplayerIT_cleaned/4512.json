It is a genre that goes very well with devices equipped with touch screens, although the risk of an experience that is too essential and inconsistent is always around the corner. With Sniper Strike: Special Ops, the guys from EightPixelsSquare have therefore tried to propose an evolution for the genre, starting naturally from the missions in which you need to carry out precision shots but accompanying them with many variations on the theme, such as the sections on tracks in which you have to shoot enemies using a shotgun, heavy machine gun or maybe a simple pistol. The result of these efforts composes a fairly rich single player campaign, set for the moment in two different scenarios, the North Sea and London (with the forthcoming addition of Baghdad), and characterized by an interesting progression system . In fact, to get to the boss fight, we will have to complete a certain number of missions belonging to four categories: carbine, shotgun, machine gun and pistol. Depending on the type of assignment, the challenge to face will change: we will be asked to eliminate targets from a distance, to shoot enemies that we find dynamically along the way, to carry out sorties and so on, while upgrading the weapons in our possession through the use of play money earned with each win. Precise fingers Belonging to the category of freemium titles, Sniper Strike: Special Ops obviously aims at monetization, and does so through two different mechanics: on the one hand, a valuable currency that allows access to more powerful weapons and immediate upgrades, on the other, a set of boxes rewards that contain personalization items or virtual currency. In reality, however, this aspect of the experience does not prove to be limiting, nor does the presence of an indicator of the energy of action force long waits between one game and another. Perhaps a more intensive use of the application would have put us in front of this evidence, but with sessions consisting of several missions, it seems you don't bump into any paywall and you are able to move forward without having to evaluate the use of real money. Closed this important parenthesis, it must be said that the game certainly suffers from an excessive speed of the missions, especially the introductory ones, which are completed literally within a few seconds and never present a challenge worthy of the name. Going forward, however, the situation improves, and in general the gameplay manages to maintain a certain variety, being able to count on very reactive and precise touch controls. The single player sector is accompanied by a very interesting competitive multiplayer, in which you have to identify your opponent from a distance and kill him in the best of three rounds, as well as an arena mode in which four users have to shoot enemies that arrive in waves, and whoever carries out wins multiple eliminations. In short, we are faced with a very solid and complete product, which also boasts an excellent technical realization: we really liked the polygonal models, while the scenarios inevitably appear a bit repetitive and generic but guarantee a certain level of detail.", "date": "2017-12-06", "grade": "7.8"}
