With an at least singular choice, the software house has decided to come out only on Wii (and Psp) with this F1 2009, entrusting the development to the Sumo Digital team. Paradoxically, right on the console theoretically least suitable for hosting a driving simulation, we thus find ourselves talking about a surprisingly enjoyable title. A game of KERS Let's start by immediately clearing the scenario of potential doubts regarding F1 2009: first of all, although it can count on licenses and official names, the Codemasters product is not a simulation properly speaking. You have the possibility to modify a large number of parameters concerning the driving model and the complexity of elements such as damage to the cars and penalties, but even with the most ~hardcore~ settings, the title sports an arcade soul that could wrinkle the nose at sport purists or simply at all those who mainly seek relevance to reality in a racing game. On the other hand, we are still on the Wii, and precisely in relation to the peculiar characteristics of the Nintendo hardware, let's immediately go to the control system: in F1 2009 the Remote can be used alone, keeping it in a horizontal position and rotating it as if it were a steering wheel, or in combination with the Nunchuck, using the latter's analog lever to manage the steering. As often happens, the first option is as picturesque as it is imprecise, and we immediately find ourselves preferring the more classic method, more suitable for attacking the curbs and tracing precise trajectories. And here we go back to the speech made at the beginning: although it is not a real simulation, F1 2009 is still a fairly challenging racing game, and reaching the top positions is not an easy task, especially at the highest levels of difficulty. Therefore, even if the physical routines and the representations of the damage are not the maximum of realism, it is easy to find satisfaction in the driving model offered by Sumo Digital, thanks above all to the excellent sensation of speed that the product is able to give. Precisely by virtue of the good qualities mentioned so far, it is sad to note that the developers have not taken care of the artificial intelligence of the opposing single-seaters properly, an aspect that ends up removing a good part of the bite from the races: the drivers do not show the slightest hint of personality , always driving on the same trajectory and practically never making mistakes. F1 2009 | Watch all videos | See all images Long live the FIA In terms of content, F1 2009 does its best to offer at the same time a welcome package for enthusiasts and non-enthusiasts alike, managing with some success to alternate phases inspired by the dynamics of the real world championship with other more exquisitely ~playful~ ones. The rigorous Career mode must be ascribed to the first group, which has all the credentials to not disappoint any new Schumacher. It is possible both to tinker with the set-up of the single-seater (although it is not allowed to go too deeply), and to face free practice and qualifications following the regulations currently in force: the less savvy can however skip all the more technicians and immediately jump into the fray of the race. And it is in fact the extensive customization of the matches that constitutes one of the major advantages of F1 2009: the modifiable parameters are different, all with effective feedback on the gaming experience, which can therefore simply be adapted to a vast range of needs. Continuing on the modality front, we find an interesting Challenges section, made up of over 70 scenarios that require the fulfillment of certain objectives (perform a certain amount of overtaking, place yourself on the podium starting from the last position and so on): nothing new under the sun, but certainly a good supply of fuel for the replay value. The same can be applied to the multiplayer mode via split screen: the company of a friend can be exploited not only in single races, but also in an entire Career that can be tackled in pairs. The sore points instead come - in full Wii tradition - when it comes to technical realization: F1 2009 offers a rather bland visual system, the result not only of the poor definition typical of the Nintendo console, but also of questionable chromatic choices and aalmost total absence of light effects, refraction or anything else. It doesn't go better on the sound front, with objectively scarce effects (primarily those relating to the single-seater engine) and an audio commentary that is limited to sparse radio communications from its pits.", "date": "2009-11-27", "grade": "7.2"}
