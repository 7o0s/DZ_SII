Digressions aside, some time ago Babylonian Twins made its appearance on the iPhone, a platformer with a strong puzzle component that goes well with the above concepts, and certainly represents one of the best representations on Apple's all-round mobile phone. not so generous with titles belonging to this genre where the two aforementioned components are so well balanced. The events behind the development of this title are quite fascinating: in fact, the project dates back to 1993, and Babylonian Twins was initially supposed to be released for the Amiga. However, the team that took care of it, a Cosmos Interactive based in Baghdad, had never been able to publish it due to economic difficulties, but after shelving it, it jealously kept everything already done while waiting for better times. Seventeen years later we find the title on the App Store, a platform that is decidedly a friend of low-budget productions, obviously updated in the graphics as well as expanded in the contents, to guarantee adequate longevity even if the purchase price is rather low as per tradition. My power for the kingdom The game is set in 576 before Christ in the city of Babylon, where a dark wizard has summoned a curse that has made the king a commander thirsty for blood and victories, who has therefore plunged his kingdom into militarization and absolute suffering. In this context Nasir and Blasir enter, the twin sons of the king who manage to find out how to stop and cancel the curse, thanks to an enchanted tree. Right at the climax, however, they are imprisoned by the sorcerer, but Blasir still manages to escape determined to free her brother as well. At this point Babylonian Twins begins; the aim, in the guise of the two principles mentioned above, is to cross five different locations (each consisting of three levels) to reach the garden that houses the magic tree. We have said that the title is a platformer with various puzzle elements, and in fact the two protagonists have different skills and characteristics, which must be used as appropriate. First of all, by touching the top left of the screen with your fingers, where there are also the number of lives and the energy bar, you can immediately switch to control one or the other character, while the previous one remains stationary in the form of stone. This first feature allows for example to position oneself in a fixed manner on some mechanisms to open doors, while the other protagonist can pass undisturbed, or use one's partner as a base to reach elevated positions. Furthermore, Nasir has the ability to jump higher, use his own sword to stun enemies, and has a sort of side shock wave attack, which can be used to open a side passage between more fragile wall sections. , represented by a different color than the rest. Blasir, on the other hand, has the possibility of using its hammer to open amphorae that may contain keys or other things and of performing a pirouette capable of unhinging the less reinforced floor in this case, in order to therefore open vertical passages. The two skills of the main protagonists must therefore be used as appropriate and often alternated to reach the end of the level; Babylonian Twins in fact also provides for a minimum use of ingenuity by the player to understand how and when to exploit Nasir rather than Blasir, perhaps by collecting the highest possible number of stars and secret objects scattered throughout the stages. The platforming part is equally important, because it's needed to avoid certain types of enemies, borderline jumping from platform to platform rather than falling into a few inviting lakes of fire. The control system in this case is the classic one seen in other titles of the genre, with the virtual stick on the left and two buttons for jumping and attacking on the right, which if pressed for a certain amount of time allows you to activate the special ability of the main protagonists. The graphic style adopted by the developers is functional to the setting, it's not exceptional but it does its duty, especially as the technical sector offers excellent animations and perfect fluidity, which make the title very clean thanks toalso to the use of the two dimensions. The sound is in line with the graphic aspect and obviously offers oriental music, while it is worth noting the support for Open Feint, a social network that offers gamertags with objectives and a friends list, and the presence of an HD version also for iPad, sold separately .
