{"name": "Bonk's Adventure - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/bonks-adventure-recensione.html", "text": "What was it yesterday On PC Engine, a console decidedly more oriented towards the shooter genre and equipped with a decidedly unusual soft library, Bonk had in a certain sense risen to the rank of mascot-character: a caveman equivalent, in practice, of stars with a much greater blazon such as Mario and Sonic. Bonk worked well as a videogame mascot because he embodies, as a character, sprites and vision of the video game, a solid and univocal conception on which to rotate everything else: the environments, the enemies, the entire platform playable world. Bonk's originality lay in the fact that the head, generally the vulnerable point of platform heroes (who usually jumped, in fact, on other people's heads), is here the center of gravity and offensive fulcrum of the experience. Bonk's rock-hard head is the primary means by which to take out enemies by jumping at them from low to high, hitting them while they are in front of them, performing head-first dives while flying, jumping or in water, or performing in rotating somersaults, during which the shiny bald becomes a real unconventional weapon. To complete the playful offer, Bonk can become temporarily invincible by gobbling up spicy legs that offer a berserk mode complete with a pulsating vein on his forehead and breath of fire. What is it today Such a shift of the offensive axis compared to the typical expectations of the average player, considered to take on the vulnerability in a platform game in a slightly different way, is what makes Bonk an original and slightly disorienting title at the beginning despite the relative, extreme simplicity of the overall game design. Bonk's settings are extremely minimal even compared to those of platformers such as Super Mario Bros 2 in terms of breadth and complexity of the environments, but they feature colorful and bulky characters and enemies, drawn with large color fields, and with final bosses. level that take up the whole screen. Chromatisms and cartoonish gimmicks of various types strongly characterize the levels and make the crossing of the game a relatively easy and practically contemplative experience. The gags are numerous: from dinosaurs identical to those of Cavemen Ninja to Bonk who climbs the vertical walls with his teeth; from enemies as pestilent as kawaii to Bonk who foams at the mouth and resurrects from the point where he had made it; from unconventional bosses to the exuberant, intoxicating chromatic harmony of the environments. At a cost of 800 Wii Points, Bonk is a game for younger players, not too demanding and with only five levels, however long. We are light years away from the peaks of contemporary games or games produced by Nintendo or other companies a very short time later. Yet, even when the game mechanics leave something to be desired in terms of freshness, level design or level of challenge, Bonk's humorous aesthetic and visual gags always manage to make even the most savvy player smile, convincing him to continue to the next level. Cartoonish, humorous, ~light~ and full of visual gimmicks, Bonk's Adventure is an ~atypical~ platform game recovered from a long-gone videogame era, originally published on PC Engine. With its minimal game mechanics and its naive and vaguely surreal settings, the mascot of the dear old NEC console may not reach the glories of the best two-dimensional Mario, but it remains an enjoyable pastime and an experience to be recovered by all the insatiable completionists of the genre.", "date": "2007-04-12", "grade": null}
