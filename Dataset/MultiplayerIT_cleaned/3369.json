The story that the game tells is that of Cal Kestis, a Padawan who escaped extermination by the Jedi after the events of Episode III. Taking refuge on Bracca, he hides from the Empire working with a team of space junk dealers, but one day some troops led by the ruthless Second Sister reach the planet and force him into a daring escape, which ends happily only thanks to the intervention of Cere and Greez, who rescue Cal by welcoming him aboard their ship, the Mantis. Moved by the desire to reconstitute the Jedi Order thanks to the maps kept by an old master who disappeared, the three set off for Bogano, where Cal makes the acquaintance of the small droid BD-1: a small robot with attitudes similar to those of a cat, with an irresistible mimicry, which will win you over right from the start. The newly formed couple will have to deal with a constant and very well-told growth path, which will progressively increase the skills of both characters, in a crescendo of exploration, solving environmental puzzles and spectacular lightsaber-based fights. Gameplay and structure The experience offered by Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is undoubtedly derivative: the game draws liberally from productions such as Tomb Raider, Uncharted and even Dark Souls to give us gameplay capable of mixing storytelling, exploration, puzzle solving and fights. Some sequences appear as obvious quotations: Cal crossing a narrow passage and then, having reappeared on the surface, he admires an enormous stone structure whose functioning he will have to understand. Or it is produced in interesting and multifaceted platforming sections, jumping from one handhold to another, using ropes and vines and perhaps swooping down on an imperial soldier from above for immediate execution. Or still find a place dedicated to meditation to rest, recharge your energy, possibly unlock new skills by spending the points earned up to that moment, save your position but at the same time accept the fact that all eliminated enemies will return to their place. the guys from Respawn Entertainment are not the latest arrivals, they boast an undoubted talent and have known how to make the most of these inspirations, crafting a title that does not miss anything, manages to recreate the atmospheres of Star Wars in an epic way (also thanks to the column sound and an excellent dubbing in Italian) and to keep the involvement high, managing the transition between cutscenes and in-game action as in the best Naughty Dog productions. The smudges are very few, identified mostly in the phases in which one launches into slides that can turn into frustrating traps when one falls for the umpteenth time, or in sequences in which the camera does not have time to follow our movement, leaving us without references for an instant. Fortunately, these uncertainties are compensated for by a series of ideas of considerable impact, which also here take advantage of the rich lore of the brand in an excellent way. The combat system deserves a separate discussion, because the references to Dark Souls are not limited to the points rescue / campfires, but extend to the mechanics that regulate the clashes. Cal takes on his foes wielding his standard-issue lightsaber, but must pay close attention to their ever-changing movement patterns. The creatures have quick shots, for example, although they cannot defend themselves clearly from our blows, while the soldiers have rifles, flamethrowers or electrified maces that allow them to parry blows and make them difficult opponents. It is possible to open their defenses by making a parry with perfect timing or by using the side slip to take them from the side, or still take advantage of some of the unlockable maneuvers to gain an advantage in the early stages of the duel. A real touch of class is the management of rebounds: parrying with the lightsaber it is possible to deflect the beams that are fired at us, and by carrying out this maneuver with the right timing, send the shot back to the sender. If at the normal difficulty level the challenge is more than fair, it becomes absolutely nottrivial where the grade is set to difficult or very difficult, recreating the typical soulslike tension and a justified fear of each group of Stormtroopers facing each other. Fortunately, it is also possible to resort to the Force, both in the context of exploration and puzzle solving as much as in fighting: the protagonist can block enemies for a few moments, so as to change position or hit them without them being able to react; push them away, perhaps at a precipice, so as to instantly resolve the clash. Or still attract them, causing them to end up in a pressure mechanism or canceling the advantage of distance where they are soldiers capable of shooting or flying. In combination with the BD-1's capabilities, which can also be upgraded progressively, the repertoire developed by the developers not only appears rich but also perfectly focused and functional to the gameplay, in a finely crafted interlocking game that is supported by the Metroidvania-style approach to the scenarios. In fact, it happens that in the first visit to a planet it is not possible to explore it 100% due to passages and doors that in that specific moment one is not yet able to overcome, returning thereafter once that particular skill has been acquired. Technical realization and PC version The first half hour of the Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order campaign stands as an extraordinary visiting card for the game, made up of highly spectacular sequences that are enhanced on the Windows platform thanks to Ultra HD resolution and improved effects compared to what seen on the console. Cal's escape on the moving train, the first duels with lightsabers and the last-minute rescue aboard the Mantis arrive at the end of a first, fascinating dream sequence in which the device of flashbacks is used to make causes the character to remember certain skills learned during Jedi training. The management of the lights and their refraction plays a fundamental role during these scenes, with the rain ~colored~ with the shades of the lightsabers, which also illuminate the scenery sending any Star Wars fan into raptures. Traveling aboard the Mantis is also It's a fascinating experience: you can roam freely in the vehicle and admire from the windows of the passenger compartment how the planets move away when we leave for a new destination, rapidly projecting ourselves among the stars and using the hyperspace jump to reduce waiting times as much as possible The settings are decidedly large, structured as mentioned in Metroidvania style, complete with a three-dimensional holographic map to possibly show us the way forward, understood as the areas that have become accessible or are still blocked waiting for a skill that allows us to pass. The animations are of excellent quality, as is the motion capture during the cutscenes, capable of giving great expressiveness even to the faces of improbable alien creatures. Of course, it happens that in some sequences the shaders give a flat appearance to the characters and some glitches make them suddenly appear in the frame, but in a Windows environment you do not experience the problems seen on PS4 and Xbox One with regard to loading assets. The graphic adjustments available for Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order on PC are numerous, although not as many level of Gears 5, to cite a recent example. The effects are present in a separate entry, where it is possible to activate or deactivate motion blur, film effect, chromatic aberration and vibration of the view: features that increase the involvement of certain scenes and perhaps are responsible for the conspicuous drops in frame rates that occur occur, for example, when you launch yourself down a ~slide~ for the first time. After that you move on to the more concrete options, ranging from resolution to vertical sync, passing through the intriguing couple formed by the maximum FPS value and the scaler dynamic. The latter basically takes care of instantly changing the resolution so that the performances correspond to the value of the maximum frames just mentioned, but in our case we encountered a curious bug. By inserting a lock at 60 fps and activating the automatic scaler, in fact, the game never remains anchored to that target and indeed runs as if there were no optimizations, keeping the 40-45 frames per second stably. To make everything work at a constant 60 frames, you need to raise the maximum value to 90: maybe the developers will release an update that will fix it. The other adjustments go into detail on the individual graphic elements, with different presets that go as far as setting ~epic~: graphic quality, disvisual stance, shadow quality, jaggies (antialiasing), texture quality, visual effects and post-processing. It is possible, depending on the configuration, to limit some of these aspects (for example by lowering the rendering of the shadows and antialiasing) to obtain a few more frames, but in fact it is better to fall back on the aforementioned scaler, which allows you to enjoy the maximum quality possible by automatically managing the resolution. With a GTX 1080 Ti the game runs at 2160p with all effects at maximum and generally keeping 40-45 fps, which rise to 60 and beyond if you opt for 1440p. By activating the dynamic system, it is therefore possible to enjoy excellent fluidity without getting too many problems with the actual most used resolution, which in our case is probably around 1800p.", "date": "2019-11-18", "grade": "8.8"}
