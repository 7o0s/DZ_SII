La recensione di un classico dei ~Tycoon~ in formato iOS", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sid-meiers-railroads-recensione-classico-tycoon-ios.html", "text": "Mobile platforms could count on an immense diamond mine hidden in the great tradition of strategy and management for PC, but strangely the gaming market on iOS and Android tends to underestimate this potential, with few and late ports of famous titles finally arriving on such platforms. Sid Meier's Railroads review! is emblematic of this situation: the game was originally released in 2006 on PC and arrives on iOS and Android only after 17 years, despite being considered a classic of the Tycoon genre, in the particular railway declination. In fact, these are complex and deep games, which could be badly associated with the characteristic type of use of smartphones and tablets, but which can well satisfy all those who would like real video games for these devices that are becoming more than capable of managing titles more substantial. Sid Meier's Railroads is particularly suitable for this type of conversion, given that among the management software of the author of Civilization it is perhaps among the most intuitive, with interface and menus that are complex but not exactly overwhelming. To better manage this aspect, the ability of Feral Interactive then takes over, which we have already appreciated for other ports of PC titles on mobile platforms and which does not betray even in this case, with a conversion that lives up to expectations. The game is a railway simulation that relies on the collecting spirit and the irresistible charm of the ~trains~ on the one hand, and on economic management and the direct challenge with opposing Tycoons on the other, seeking a balance between the two aspects but tending to long especially towards the financial aspects rather than the constructive ones. In short, despite a not exactly prohibitive learning curve, know that to get in tune with Railroads it is still necessary to devote oneself, in large part, to the economic management of the railway through the menus, rather than to the construction of railways and stations on the map. The conquest of the world on railways Sid Meier's Railroads! mobile Keeps all the features of the original on PC Exactly as we said in the ancient review of the original on PC, Sid Meier's Railroads confronts us with a series of ~scenarios~ to complete, choosing the Tycoon to play among a wide range of real historical characters and various settings that they range largely between North America and Europe, each with its own characteristics and elements of challenge given by the configuration of the terrain and the layout of structures and cities. Our aim is to build and manage functional railway lines capable of making us a lot of money, racing against other entrepreneurs who, at the same time, try to expand their influence within the same map. At the basis of everything is the economic management of the railway network, with the careful balancing of expenses and profit projections based on the lines of communication built. There is therefore the creative aspect constituted by designing the railway lines directly, trying not to collide too much with natural obstacles and to connect cities and structures that have a strategic weight in our network, but there is also a considerable study on which stages to connect in order to maximize profits. In Sid Meier's Railroads the contemplation of the ~trains~ is a fundamental aspect More than building railways and buying new locomotives and technologies, which are still important elements in the game and satisfy the ~train collector~ aspect, in short, above all it is necessary to make ends meet, and this may be the least stimulating aspect for many. although it is fundamental in the gameplay. To this are also added various boundary elements that enrich the simulation, such as the auctions to win technological patents capable of giving substantial advantages over the competition, if chosen wisely and at the right price. The portable version Sid Meier's Railroads has a more understandable interface on tablets The port to iOS and Android platforms keeps all the original contents intact, especially by acting on the interface and the control system to best adapt the game to use via touch screen. These are rather intuitive and natural solutions, as befits the transition from the mouse to the touch screen, even if the large amount of information and text contained in the interface remain complicated to read and manage on smaller screens. On iPad there are no major problems and readability is good, but on a smartphone screen this problem can be felt heavily. There is also another particular question: when thereis dragging a railroad with his finger to draw a new line, it can become complicated to scroll or rotate the camera to reach the pre-established objectives, if they do not fit into the single screen. Beyond these specific drawbacks, however, Sid Meier's Railroads! It's precisely the PC game transported into a portable context, with some graphical enhancements as well as resolution bumps to better support modern displays. The system is clearly dated, given that we are talking about a 2006 game, but perfectly functional to the type of game and the graphics appear decidedly in line with the spirit of ~contemplation of the model with the trains~ which always represents an important part of the charm of this game. Strangely, the multiplayer mode that is present on PC seems to have been removed entirely in the iOS and Android versions, leaving us to compete exclusively with opponents managed by artificial intelligence.", "date": "2023-04-10", "grade": "7.5"}
