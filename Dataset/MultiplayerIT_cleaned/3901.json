{"name": "Season: A Letter to the Future", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/season-a-letter-to-the-future-recensione.html", "text": "In the Tieng Valley, about to be flooded with the opening of a gigantic dam, it often happens to hear sounds that seem to come from a distant past, marked by a crackling that places them in a different time horizon from ours. Yet they are there, infesting the valley and its inhabitants with the cumbersome weight of memories now magnificent, now painful. Season: A Letter to the Future moves in a very intense present, suspended between past and future, in which an organization would like to erase that mass of ~already happened~ which, according to some, would block the healthy development of the future of human beings. Given the undoubted thematic proximity between Season: A Letter to the Future and Oxenfree, we refer you to our special on Oxenfree and the ghosts of the past, between radio waves and hauntology. Speaking of the past, we cannot forget the reports relating to the environment of work of Scavengers Studio, with heavy allegations of physical and verbal abuse and lack of inclusiveness by company employees who have decided to expose themselves anonymously. The history of the study, if confirmed, cannot be erased with a swipe of the sponge, but from the production process of the latest work by the Canadian developers a video game has come out that is almost miraculous in its ability to convey visions, words, sounds with a very powerful poetic charge , giving players an experience that sometimes becomes meditative, marked by the call of the beauty of the grass, the setting sun, the sparse architecture of the Tieng Valley, in which the few remaining human beings are at the center of the scene. We tell you about this unusual adventure in our review of Season: A Letter to the Future. A pendant to tame memories Estelle's adventure in the Tieng Valley thrives on intense colours, between the green of the grass and the blue of the sky A prophecy states that this season is about to end. The protagonist, Estelle, decides to embark on a journey into the outside world with the blessing of the village elder, in order to record the sounds of the season and photograph the places which, in her opinion, deserve to be remembered by posterity. It seems that a museum located at the end of the world cyclically manages to survive the changes of the seasons, events that irreparably mark Estelle's world and transport it to ever-changing futures. Memories, therefore, are the beating heart of Season: A Letter to the Future, as well as the raw material that will make up what Estelle will want to pass on to those who will come after her. And it is with a magical use of memories that the adventure begins: Estelle's mother, aware of an ancient ritual, uses her most precious memories - capable of touching the five senses: sight, touch, smell, hearing, taste - to create a pendant that will protect her daughter when the weight of memories becomes unbearable. As you explore the game world, you will discover that voices and events from the past tend to be channeled into specific objects, capable of distorting the very fabric of reality and posing a threat to the inhabitants of the world outside the safe perimeter of the village. Too bad this danger is never materialized in Season: A Letter to the Future, with Estelle totally safe thanks to that pendant, a symbol of her mother's affection, something that reminded us of the wonderful novel ~The Dress of Feathers by Japanese writer Banana Yoshimoto. Our affections manage to keep us safe, and it is no coincidence that Estelle's adventure will lead her to forge intense, albeit brief, ties with the inhabitants of the Tieng Valley, about to be flooded the following day. The old dam, in fact, is no longer able to maintain the amount of water that is hidden behind it; metaphorically, the measure of the past is full and a mysterious organization, called Gray Hand, has taken charge of the decision to free the dam of its weight and erase the Tieng Valley forever, opening a new season. We don't want to reveal anything else about the plot of Season: A Letter to the Future, narrated through objects, dialogues, often surprising discoveries, in the context of an exploration that takes place entirely on a bicycle. Riding a metal steed The bike is inseparable from Estelle and is her primary means of transport Looking at the medium's past, many identify with confidence the best videogame courser ever to appear on the screen: it is Agro, the horse ridden by Wander in Shadow of the Colossus. The reasons are not only of the plot - Agro is the protagonist of one of the most unforgettable moments of the entire narrative fabric created by Fumito Ueda and Team Ico - but also physical. Agro's movements come with weight, as if we were actually driving an animal, not a massor of pixels; it seems to perceive the resistance of his body, his autonomous will, the movement of his muscles thrown at a gallop in the immense and solitary expanses of the Forbidden Lands. In Season: A Letter to the Future, Estelle travels the Tieng Valley on a bicycle , whose control is masterfully managed by the PlayStation 5 DualSense. In the face of its sometimes lazy use by much more experienced teams in very high-budget productions, the Sony controller is used in the round by Scavengers Studio, building an experience sensory that prompts us to advise you without reservations to try this production on PlayStation 5 and not on PC, if you have the opportunity. With the dorsal triggers pedaling is managed, with greater resistance in the first ones, those of the restart, and when going uphill; a slight vibration signals the moments when we go off the beaten track. The muttering of the very special flowers of the Tieng Valley, guardians of sometimes bulky and revealing memories, comes directly from the DualSense, giving a particular effect to the most intense moments of exploration. In short, Season: A Letter to the Future is a journey not only for sight, but also for touch and hearing. Too bad only for some small technical stumbling block, such as the unfortunate management of the shadows during the interlude scenes and the cumbersomeness of having to press a button to be able to resume one's bike following the examination of the elements of the scenario, a very frequent eventuality : a simple automatism would have been decidedly more functional. Calm contemplation and management of memories Little Kuchi is one of the most unforgettable characters of Tieng Valley and Season: A Letter to the Future as a whole If long journeys by bicycle take the lion's share in the gameplay of Season: A Letter to the Future, the breaks between one journey and another are marked by the management of the Notebook called to contain the memories that Estelle (and the player) will deem worthy of reaching posterity. This diary can contain audio recordings, photographs, short sentences and stickers (the latter to be unlocked by adding enough memories to the Notebook for each location). No journey will be alike, just as no player is alike. Not only that: we are ready to bet that by resuming Season: A Letter to the Future in some time we will deem other elements, colors and sounds worthy of being handed down. In short, travel is always different, in the same way that human beings are constantly changing. The cinematic cut given to the screen and the wide, horizontal glance, with cel-shaded graphics that recalled some solutions adopted in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. The contemplation of a cemetery, seen as a space for memory; listening to a friend's dream, who invites us to close our eyes and live a profoundly Zen experience; a little monkey making funny noises from the top of a column. Estelle, the last tourist in the history of the Tieng Valley, is called to live the present moment with intensity, looking to the past and fearlessly projecting herself towards the future, in search of her loved ones - and in particular of her father, who disappeared in circumstances that will be clarified during the adventure - in the breaks between his heartbeats. And if in the valley there are those who pray not to be haunted by the past, Season: A Letter to the Future tries in every way to make us understand that a healthy present is also lived, and perhaps above all, thanks to a continuous and courageous confrontation with the our past. The human relationships forged by Estelle, the last tourist of the Tieng Valley, lead us towards an intense ending At the moment there is no Italian translation for Season: A Letter to the Future, which we have played entirely in English, for a total duration of about twelve hours. The interpretation of the voice actors is excellent, giving softness and nostalgic nuances to the voices of their characters. The soundtrack is excellent, equally delicate and dreamy, with its piano notes and the sounds of distant wooden wind chimes.", "date": "2023-01-27", "grade": "8.5"}
