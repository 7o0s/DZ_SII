It is a speech that we have already made, but which comes back to the present whenever we find ourselves reviewing an indie video game. Just like Ignite: it is a racer with a distinctly arcade character, which is clearly inspired by certain productions of the same genre (we could say Ridge Racer or Burnout, but on PC the mind runs fast to recall the times of Screamer) and offers us a good selection of circuits, modes and different cars. When you don't have many resources available, you have to propose a project with well-defined contours, which doesn't get lost in superfluous facets, and from this point of view we can say that a good, orderly and flawless job has been done. In fact, Ignite does not seek to revolutionize the genre of driving games on PC, nor to offer us technical solutions so advanced as to require a high-end computer to be able to run it with a decent frame rate. No, the game immediately reveals itself to be very classic in its setting, equipped with a simple structure and a well-optimized technical sector, with the graphics flowing smoothly even on configurations that are not exactly at the top: in our case, at the resolution of 1680 x 1050 pixels and with all the effects at their maximum, we traveled on 60 fps, going down to 45-50 in the presence of particularly populated scenarios. Modes and tracks From the start screen it is possible to participate in a single race, access the online multiplayer mode (for up to five players) or try your hand at the career mode, which clearly represents the fulcrum of this production. The single races depend directly on the elements unlocked in the career, in the sense that you can only race on the tracks that are already available and with the ~earned~ cars. The same goes for the multiplayer, which will therefore reveal all its facets only after we have spent a few hours dealing with opponents controlled by the AI. As already mentioned, matches can be organized for up to five players and any gaps can be filled using bots, while for the type of event you can choose between three alternatives: traditional race, knock-out or run-out. In the first case, the winner will simply be whoever crosses the finish line first, while in the second case we will be faced with an elimination race, therefore the car in last position will be discarded at each lap until only one remains on the track. The run-out mode, on the other hand, is a little more particular: it is also in this case an elimination race, however based on a score that gradually decreases over time. Our goal will be to keep the score high while our opponents reach zero and are discarded, performing spectacular drifts or impacting objects on the track. These three typologies also characterize the course of the career mode, set within five different scenarios from which various tracks are obtained: you can run in a fraction of the entire track, face it all or turn it upside down. The locations boast a fair variety, both in absolute terms and in terms of their ~portions~: Nitrous Wharf is practically a large seaport and will see us running even close to the moored ships; New Downtown looks like an urban cross-section with tall buildings in the background but also some construction sites along the way; Miner Heaven is a mountain scenery, with beautiful views and many pitfalls; High Rise Borough is a sort of massive freeway that passes through the middle of a city; Finally, Oxide Park is a traditional circuit surrounded by greenery. It takes beastly physics There is no common thread between the career mode races, which means that we can tackle them using the car we want, without limitations. Ignite offers us an unofficial car park, made up of three different types: street, muscle and race. Each category is made up of five models that must be unlocked by successfully completing races, and each model in turn boasts five configurations that imply particular passive bonuses: a nitro multiplier, one for the score obtained with drifts, one for collisions, and so on. After driving around for a few hours and unlocking almost all the cars, we can say that their ~personality~ undoubtedly represents the biggest limitation of the game. The arcade setting implies a marginal attention to physics, to the rendering of the weight and the forces in action during each manoeuvre, but this does not justify the lack of substantial differences between the behaviorment of a street car rather than a muscle car. Perhaps the latter tend more to drift while the former enjoy greater stability, but in the end these are details that do not make the experience really varied and which therefore severely limit the longevity of the Nemesys Games product. Product which, we reiterate, presents itself on the strength of a not astonishing but solid technical sector, driven by a light and powerful engine, which makes extensive use of light effects and motion blur and which is lost only in the quality of the polygonal models of the cars, for some verses a little too simple.", "date": "2011-11-16", "grade": "7.5"}
