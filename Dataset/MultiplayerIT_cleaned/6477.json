In this new version for smartphones and tablets, subtitled Wizard for Hire, the game maintains the same playful mechanics, however obviously relying on the touch control system and being able to count on a completely renewed technical implementation. Will it be enough to trigger the magic? Bearded wizard always liked As per Nitrome tradition, Magic Touch: Wizard for Hire can also boast such a level of immediacy that it does not need any tutorial screen: the user is therefore immediately in the middle of the action, in a scenario where the magician is the protagonist positioned at the bottom of the screen while robots are tied to balloons falling from the sky. The aim of the game is to prevent the enemies from touching the ground, and to do this it is necessary to burst the air chambers that support them and let them crash to the ground, obtaining points and coins for each elimination. All the balloons bear a symbol that must be reproduced with your finger on the touch screen to allow the magician to cast the right spell to make it disappear, with the level of challenge increasing as the drawings to be traced go from being simple lines to more complex and convoluted shapes. From these premises, it is easy to make a comparison with Darklings, a title that recently offered a very similar play structure, but in reality it was Magic Touch that arrived first: as we mentioned in the introduction, this mobile version is none other than the remake of a 2007 concept, and therefore Nitrome is safe from any accusation of plagiarism or lack of originality. In any case, the title lets itself be played which is a pleasure, with that speed and that freshness which are the best virtues that it is desirable to find in a mobile product: the symbol detection system is precise, the on-screen rhythm is frenetic and there is also that bit of depth necessary to keep the attention alive game after game. There are single-symbol-traced combos to eliminate multiple targets, enemies with multiple balloons, and more, all within a playstyle that gives the user seconds to decide what to do next. Immediate and fun, Magic Touch: Wizard for Hire is a mobile game that works perfectly Nitrome confirms its appreciable aptitude in free-to-play management also with Magic Touch: Wizard for Hire, which does not present intrusive in-app purchases nor penalizing barriers for players who do not use a credit card: the developer he preferred to insert advertisements that peep out from time to time, leaving the freedom to those who wanted to pay a small amount to remove them completely. There are also packets of coins that can be bought with real money, suitable for those who don't have the patience to collect the loot during the various games: this must be spent in the appropriate in-game shop to unlock special magic formulas (useful for example to slow down time or to instantly clear the screen of all enemies) to be traced with specific drawings on the touch screen. A feature that gives a pleasant thickness of strategy to the game, but which at the same time also constitutes the only real sore point of Magic Touch: Wizard for Hire, as only the symbols relating to these spells do not always seem to be interpreted correctly by the software: we therefore often find ourselves in the unpleasant condition of not exploiting these powers for fear of making a mistake and thus losing precious seconds which in a frenetic title like this can literally make the difference. Too bad for this little flaw, which in any case does not compromise the pleasure of an excellent product also from a technical point of view: Nitrome has wisely decided to put its hand to the graphic style of a 2007 game, basting a cosmetic system characterized by a pleasant and colorful pixel art and embellishing everything with a pressing sound accompaniment without being annoying.", "date": "2015-03-19", "grade": "8.5"}
