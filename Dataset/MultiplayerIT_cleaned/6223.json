{"name": "Ooblets", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ooblets-recensione.html", "text": "Exactly two summers ago we tried Ooblets for you, a very curious title and then available exclusively on PC, moreover in early access. Strengthened by an immediately recognizable (and in our opinion also particularly effective) artistic direction, the Glumberland production drew liberally from series such as Pokmon and Animal Crossing - later you will understand how, despite the apparent irreconcilable nature of the two - trying to find but its own way, as original as possible. Two years are a long time and, even if they don't guarantee a priori improvements or unpublished contents, they have made us feel taken in this case too: we have been able to spend many hours in the company of a product that is certainly more solid than in the past, even if some doubts remain even now that it is practically in the process of publication. The following Ooblets review will try to clear all your doubts. Plot: Island life Ooblets is first and foremost a very colorful life simulator The narrative premise of Ooblets is probably the most overused ever within the life simulator genre. Our alter ego (created from scratch using a small editor, but later customizable again at some specific structures) arrives on the island of Oob to start a new, more peaceful life. It goes without saying that all the inhabitants will look forward to inviting him into the small local community, even going so far as to give him a shack in which to settle. Where have we seen all this before? In addition to many more or less well-known indies, certainly in a title from which Ooblets has drawn heavily on several other mechanics: we obviously think of Animal Crossing: New Horizons. The narrative structure, compared to its counterparts, is however sufficiently solid, because the newcomer will have the opportunity to get acquainted with not only different characters, but also engaged in specific activities, who will need a series of favors through a tested system of assignments which, even if initially it is a bit dispersive, after a few hours will begin to kick in, marking the daily routine on the island. By advancing through these secondary missions and above all by completing the main ones assigned by the mayor, the player will thus unlock new areas of the island, new features, new commercial activities, in a constant virtuous circle. Even if about forty hours should be enough to allow anyone to fully understand what Ooblets has to offer in structural terms, it goes without saying that a title like this doesn't really have real end credits. A bit like in Stardew Valley and in the various Harvest Moons, you can simply continue playing forever, enriching your collection of little monsters more and more, transforming the cultivation behind the house into an industrial-level activity and much more. In short, the story represents only a small part of the offer. Gameplay: grow vegetables or raise little monsters? Farming will be your main activity in Ooblets The two souls of Ooblets consist of the verbs in the infinitive cultivate and raise, among other things also in interaction with each other. Undoubtedly you will spend most of your time creating new clods of soil suitable for your seeds, buying them from the city shop or obtaining them from secondary characters, planting them, watering them, caring for them lovingly for several days in a row. Maturation depends on the species; moreover, the playing time does not correspond 1:1 to the real one, but the 24 hours flow more or less quickly, depending on how quickly you consume your energy and decide to run to sleep in your room. The passage from one day to the next is marked by the attribution of experience points and objects of various types, depending on the activities completed up until the moment of rest. Obviously, farming means earning, because the products will end up directly on the local market. But that's not all, because even the iconic creatures of the production, the Ooblets, will be born from real seedlings: and it is here that the gameplay brings together all the aspects that individually seemed difficult to amalgamate. Ooblets live freely on the island, some in the company of humans, others in the wild (just like Pokmon). Again as in the Game Freak series, upon your arrival you can choose one in particular which will thus become your best friend, while the others will still be accessible at a later time. Now, the most original element of the whole experience consists in the ways of fighting between different Ooblets: embracing completelyUnder the philosophy of non-violence, the creatures challenge each other in a dance step. Some of the dancing little monsters from Ooblets Here the real adventure gives way to a mini-game based on cards and music. The Ooblets begin to dance in a colored arena, while it's up to us to choose, one turn after another, which cards to play. The latter allow you to increase the pace, attribute power-ups of various types, and above all ~score points~, which will be accurately counted in a bar on the sides of the screen. The first Obleet to max out this gauge will automatically win the game; the defeated creature will be set free, but will give the player a seed to plant in the field behind the house, from which an identical copy will be born. The idea is undoubtedly fascinating and even works quite well, but Ooblets are not that many and appear in different species every day. Also, in addition to the obvious collecting and customization factors, they just keep the player company, because they don't completely hold the entire gameplay on their shoulders like in the Pokmon series. new content as well as preparing console versions for Xbox One and Nintendo Switch. For the first aspect we have little to object to, because the title offers several activities; however, the Nintendo console version, in addition to sometimes quite evident slowdowns and various frame rate drops, also suffers from really excessive loading times, not only at startup but also between one area and another in the main city, for example in the passage from our house to the square.", "date": "2022-09-01", "grade": "7.5"}
