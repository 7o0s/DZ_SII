Did the Italian trio (supported by three other freelancers) manage to hit the mark? The answer is in our review of Eldest Souls. Of Gods and Men Eldest Souls: Gods, Men and Death In the beginning, there was only dust. After a long time the dust condensed and formed the Moon. This celestial body, however, broke apart and some fragments fell on the planet below: one of them created Men, the other the Gods. The two species lived in peace, coexisting, until an evil God corrupted the others and enslaved Men. After centuries of imprisonment, the humans rebelled and locked the Gods in a prison-city, the Citadel. However, the Corrupting God returned and, through a dark power, created demons who took control of the Citadel and brought pestilence to the world of Men. In a last-ditch effort to eliminate their enemies, the humans led a Crusade against the city, but failed in the attempt. The Moon then cried one last small fragment, from which our character created a blade capable of killing the Gods. Our task is to eliminate them all. This is the narrative incipit of Eldest Souls, a game that - despite its linearity and simplicity - does not disdain the creation of a small lore. In fact, during the adventure we will be able to find some documents scattered in the environment that tell us fragments of the failed Crusade against the Citadel and expand the background of the game world, making us imagine distant lands. The right word is just ~imagine~, because the lore of Eldest Souls is managed with a dropper, small hints here and there that do not particularly deepen the incipit and the identity of the protagonist. Let me be clear, we do not consider it a defect, quite the opposite: the work of Fallen Flag Studio is structurally simple and, while not lacking in NPCs with quests, it is based first of all on raw gameplay, or rather on combat. All that is needed is therefore just a little context, so as not to make us feel lost, while at the same time avoiding making us waste time in long-winded and useless dialogues or readings. However, there are several endings, linked to the completion of certain quests, which are actually very simple to complete. The characters in the game need objects that we can find in the environment. The various areas are small and with a minimum of attention it is possible to find all the objects and, even if you are not sure what to do, it will be enough to go around from one character to another to see if we have what he had need. Completing some quests is also useful for obtaining special upgrade items, which will help our advance. What matters most, though, is picking up the controller and fighting well; in other words: git gud. Kill first, ask questions later Eldest Souls also offers NPCs and quests, albeit very simple ones Eldest Souls, by direct admission of the developers, first of all wants to awaken that ~burning~ feeling you get when you are one step away from victory and you are defeated. Eldest Souls asks us for commitment and knows that the right audience will be able to derive great satisfaction from every success, obtained only after multiple attempts. In our opinion, the result has been achieved, even if the difficulty curve is not perfectly calibrated, as we will see later. During the adventure we will have to fight against ten bosses. Eldest Souls is quite linear and at most makes two bosses available at the same time: after defeating a group of enemies, you enter a new area, where other bosses, NPCs and quest items await us to collect. Unlike Titan Souls - the famous boss-rush game - the Fallen Flag Studio action-RPG offers a character upgrade system, as each boss gives us a skill point and a Fragment. The skill point must be spent in one of the three available skill trees. Choosing a skill tree blocks the others, but at any time it is possible to recover the points and reposition them (even in the other trees), so as to completely change the character. Specifically, we will have access to a tree based on movement speed bonuses, one based on damage enhancement and one based on defense and counterattacks (the latter has proved to be our favorite in the advanced stages). Each style of play is different and allows you to approach a fight in a different way. The Fragments, on the other hand, can be assigned to the various moves of the character (which we will see in detail shortly) pTo give them additional effects, different for each type of move. Eldest Souls does not skimp on customization, essentially allowing us to adapt the character to our preferences or, if necessary, to create a warrior more suited to the battle we have to face. Let's take an easy example: if you have to face a very mobile enemy, it makes little sense to use skills that create areas of damage around the character, as we will often be far from the enemy; better to focus on direct damage. Eldest Souls offers both English and Italian lyrics How exactly do you fight in Eldest Souls? The combat system is based on a series of very interesting pillars. First of all, we have the classic basic attack, neither too slow nor too powerful. The fulcrum of the clashes, however, is the charged attack: in addition to inflicting more damage and performing a dash in the selected direction, this move fills (proportionally to the charge time) a bar; when the latter is in the second half, we will be in Bloodlust status which makes us more powerful, faster and allows us to recover life by inflicting damage on the enemy. Eldest Souls in fact renounces the classic Estus-style cures and asks us to manage attack and defense in a shrewd way. Attacking during Bloodlust means recovering life, but also exposing yourself to counterattacks. It is therefore essential to know exactly when to attack and when to think only of avoiding blows, paying maximum attention to Stamina. Eldest Souls provides only three bars of Stamina which recharge slowly and which are equivalent to three dodges (attacks do not consume Stamina). This is a deliberately limited amount, designed to ~punish~ those who play carelessly and try to dodge wildly when they are in the middle of an enemy combo. Each boss must be carefully studied, you must learn to recognize attacks in advance and know when to act: if you succeed, you will be rewarded, as a perfect dodge speeds up the recharge of Stamina and, with some skills, allows you to activate an attack special. Eldest Souls, one of the bosses Added to this is a powerful but slow attack that can only be activated in Bloodlust status and which consumes the relative bar. This move allows you to perform a large single damage, for those clashes during which there is no room for many weak shots, and - again thanks to certain skills - it activates very useful bonuses. Finally, we have two different active skills: one linked to the skill tree we have chosen and one associated with an equipped Fragment, both of which can be used after recharging. The strength of Eldest Souls lies above all in the fact that each move serves to enhance others: you must not only attack and run away, but you must carefully exploit each character's ability, to maximize damage and chances of survival, because Eldest Souls will go out of its way to challenge us, especially in the beginning. One more try Talking about difficulties is always complex, as manual skills, attention span, glance and, often, pure and simple patience are involved. Eldest Souls is not an easy game, that's for sure, but in our opinion the real ~problem~ is getting into the right state of mind, i.e. understanding that we are weak and that a few blows from the enemy can tear us apart, while we have to strike again and again and again before achieving victory. The first two bosses are basically a tutorial, but the next two could be a big stumbling block for many. The entire adventure (10 bosses + exploration of the small game world) took us a total of 7 and a half hours: more than half of these were needed to defeat the third and fourth bosses. At this stage the player only has a couple of skill points and a single shard, so heavy reliance on powerful moves is not possible. The only way to get beyond that and into the real Eldest Souls is to understand that you have to play well. Point. Git Gud. We're dwelling on the concept to make sure the reader gets the gist of the matter: Eldest Souls isn't unfair, it isn't punishing (by dying you lose nothing and you can instantly respawn in the arena), but it's undeniably difficult, especially in the beginning. . Eldest Souls first boss is just a tutorial Once the initial obstacle has been overcome, the game opens up more quests, gives a couple of useful rewards, allows us to unlock more skills that make us more powerful and simplify subsequent battles (maximum ten attempts per boss, compared to over 100 attempts for the third /fourth boss). You always have to work hard, but at that point we will really feel that we can do it with a little extra effort. At the beginning, however, we will have to sweat seven hundred shirts. It is funny? It is satisfying?In our opinion yes, but we are convinced that for some players it will not be like this: we have warned you... The clashes, beyond the difficulty, are all very interesting. Each boss is unique, has its own moves, transformations, at least two phases and often - when we are about to win - there is a surprise that will make us say ~oh no, it's not over?~ (no spoilers, we won't say more). The arenas themselves are different in shape/size and become as much a part of the battle as the boss. Each battle is also a major step forward thanks to the skill point and Shard obtained, which makes victory even more satisfying. Extra The game world is visually pleasing Finishing the game is also not the end of the journey. Eldest Souls compensates for the limited longevity with an interesting New Game + (which is activated automatically by defeating the final boss, so be careful not to leave the quests behind). In addition to making enemy attacks slightly stronger and our ability to heal ourselves lower, bosses gain more than double the health (a bit too much, in our opinion) and, most interestingly, gain new attacks that make fights more difficult . We only got to see the first two NG+ bosses (they're much, much stronger), but we can confirm that the encounters feel really new and different. Furthermore, it is possible to continue to upgrade the character, even if the skills cost much more. Finally, the Arena mode is unlocked which allows you to fight freely with the ten bosses and, with each victory, unlock an additional difficulty level for the relative boss. In this mode, however, the character does not power up. The message is therefore clear: Eldest Souls is designed for those who want to work hard, for those who are not satisfied with the victory and want to throw themselves back into the fray. It is credible that those who like this type of challenge spend up to 20 hours on the game. Finally, as you can see from the images and trailers, Eldest Souls defends itself well on a visual level. The character is generic, but the bosses have a unique style and the environments, while classic, make us breathe the feeling of desolation of the Citadel. Even the soundtrack accompanies the clashes adequately: there are no specific traces that have remained with us, but they all perform their duty. Final note, we point out that the game is (obviously) also translated into Italian.", "date": "2021-07-29", "grade": "7.8"}
