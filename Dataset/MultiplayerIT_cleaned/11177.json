{"name": "Encased", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/encased-recensione.html", "text": "If the gaming world has taught us anything, it's that old genres die hard. Turn-based isometric RPGs are certainly not the beating heart of the industry today (to the chagrin of some), but there are many developers who still have the desire to have their say. The same goes for Dark Crystal Games, which has brought its reinterpretation of this genre to PC. In the review of Encased we tell you about this Fallout emulator. Under the dome Encased is a sci-fi and apocalyptic world The world of Encased is deeply sci-fi, with a touch of apocalyptic that never hurts. However, we are not in the future, but in an alternative version of the 70s during which the Cold War ended peacefully, thanks to a sensational discovery: a Dome of unknown origin, in which is hidden an extremely advanced technology that allowed the humanity to take a technological step forward, while maintaining the style of those years. The Dome is a mysterious and dangerous place due to unexplained anomalies and radiation, but it is also the destination of many people, explorers, scholars or soldiers. Everything is controlled by CRONUS, a multinational of which we are also part. Our character - which we can create from a series of pre-sets or completely free - is characterized by multiple elements, but one of the most important is the faction, defined by color. CRONUS has divided the internal society into castes, with the Blacks who work as soldiers and guards, the Blues who perform the task of technicians, the Silvers who act as administrators, the Whites as scientists and researchers and finally the Oranges who are practically slaves , convicts of the outside world forced to become laborers for the Dome. All castes, for the most disparate reasons when it comes to the single person, work with one goal: to find relics, objects of unknown origin that have various effects on people, objects and reality itself. Our work begins with a ~field trip~ to a CRONUS headquarters, which has gone under radar for far too long. When we get there, of course, we understand that something has gone wrong. From here starts our adventure that will guide us in a wide world. The power of Encased lies precisely in the cure for the Dome and everything below it and outside it. The narrative universe is interesting (even if the game starts slowly and it takes a few hours before you get to the heart of the story) and throughout the story there will be a lot to discover, between main and side missions. Discovering obviously means reading and precisely reading in English, with even some occasional translation problems: the language of the authors is Russian. Character and fights Encased features turn-based battles However, the story of Encased is also our story and, while it is true that many events are fixed, our choices will have an impact and will lead us to one of 14 possible endings. Even in the microscopic, however, our character has its own weight. First of all, being of a certain faction instead of another will unlock certain dialogue options, allowing us to obtain various advantages or access certain areas in a unique way. Statistics are also important, as they will give access to certain contextual actions. The character evolves on a regular basis, defining three categories of ~stats~. There are the fundamental ones, attributes such as physical strength, intellect, luck, charisma, willpower ... which also affect combat and skills, or our level of mastery with various weapon classes , with psychic powers, with technology, with medicines and so on. These skills, if enhanced, unlock the real actions that we can use in combat. Finally, there are perks, unique features that apply bonuses and penalties. There is also a reputation system, similar to what we saw in Fallout New Vegas. All of this obviously also determines our effectiveness in fights which, we specify immediately, are not mandatory. In fact, technically it is possible to avoid clashes with stealth or through alternative passages that allow you to overcome entire sections, even if sooner or later you will have to face some battles and it is advisable to be ready. Encased offers stylistically pleasant environments The structure is very classic. Each turn we have a series of action points and each move and each character's attack/upgrade skill has its own cost. The objects in the environment can cover the line of fire and we can use the advanced points to increase our defense, if we know that we are going tor be hit hard and we don't want to save those APs for the next turn. Yes, there are many types of weapons, including psychic powers for those who prefer to save bullets or even unconventional weapons that stun enemies for those who want to aim for a pacifist run, but the structure of the fights tends to be not very tactical and mostly based on raw statistics: you win if you are stronger, in essence. You can shoot barrels that deal elemental damage and enemies can step over traps, but there isn't that layered structure of more 'modern' games like Divinity Original Sin. When you have access to new characters the situation improves, but the fights are never deeply satisfying. More interesting instead the exploration of the game world. Not only are the individual areas (not too large, actually) full of elements with which to interact, looking for useful objects and notes to read, but it is possible to explore the world in search of new areas, finding them even before they are reported from NPCs during a mission. While traveling we will have to take into account some survival elements, such as hunger, thirst and tiredness: it is a not very intriguing system that does not add much to the game except the need to consume objects (such as food and drink). Graphics Encased is a mix of past and future technology Encased, from a technical point of view, is certainly not a game of great impact. After all, we are talking about an indie game, which has aimed to offer a large number of environments, objects, 2D graphics (some dialogues are supported by artwork illustrating events and characters). The consequence is that the level of detail is not comparable with works that have been able to count on a higher budget. From a stylistic point of view, while not reaching peaks of uniqueness like those of Disco Elysium, Encased is good. This sci-fi, apocalyptic, alternative 70s world aesthetic is thoroughly enjoyable. Luckily there are no glitches, bugs or performance limitations. We close by pointing out the longevity: a first run will ask you about twenty hours, which could increase by several hours depending on the level of completionism.", "date": "2021-09-13", "grade": "7.4"}
