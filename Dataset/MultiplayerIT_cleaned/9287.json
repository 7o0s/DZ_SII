{"name": "Carnival In azione!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/87907-carnival-in-azione-carnival-in-azione.html", "text": "Cat Daddy Games, through the casual label 2K Play, offers us a new chapter in the popular Carnival video game series, this time on Xbox 360 and with full support for the Microsoft Kinect peripheral. We now have several products specifically designed for this special controller, but few manage to combine perfectly or almost a good level of aesthetic and technical detail with the playability and variety that one would always expect from a certain type of family video game. The two ~escorts~ of the Luna Park Carnival: In Action! (Carnival Games: Monkey See, Monkey Do in the United States) is the classic party game, a type of game that is to be enjoyed in the company of friends and relatives perhaps during a party or in any case in moments of aggregation. As tradition dictates for the genre, it is therefore a collection of mini events related to each other by a common element, specifically a plot or a setting or a general theme. In our case this unitary element is the Luna Park with all its attractions. We are in a typical American amusement park divided into five zones, each of which contains four activities with variations, to which you are introduced by a friendly presenter. Those who have played other titles in the series will already know the mustachioed character, available here together with his faithful monkey, Monkey Barker, who makes his debut in this franchise with his dancing skills and his innate sympathy. From dancing to pig racing, passing through the classic Luna Park games such as the one in which you have to hit piles of cans with a ball, or a guy sitting on top of a tub into which you then have to drop it, to throwing darts, but also basketball or baseball-based challenges, our avatar, who represents us, can participate in each event alone or in the company of a friend (but only one at a time: two cannot play at the same time except in a couple of evidence). Hit go go Among our favorite events, however, the roller coaster stands out, where you can move between one lap and another by collecting stars or coins, or the one in which you have to catch cakes on the fly by stacking them without dropping them. And again: one where within a few seconds it is necessary to assume a pose, often funny, to match it with the on-screen one that one's avatar has ideally ~drawn~ crashing like a cartoon against a brick wall (its shape must be matched) , or the other where to send a fake rocket to Mars, which is none other than the classic game of the hammer that hits the bell that activates the appropriate mobile indicator to test the strength of the customer. The playability in these cases is quite good, thanks also to the variety of situations available for each event. Riding a piglet is one of the best mini games in the collection And to the Kinect, which performs quite well in terms of responsiveness to our bodily movements. Only in a couple of games, especially those in which the use of a viewfinder and the throwing of an object is required, have we recorded a slight delay between the gestures made by us and the material execution then replicated on the screen by the avatars. As well as a little 'inaccuracy. But nothing exaggerated or that could affect the enjoyment or usability of the product. Menu navigation is also quite responsive and easy to use. Just move your hands following the directions on the screen and everything works like a charm. Returning to the mini-games we were talking about earlier, at the end of each race the player is rewarded with tickets which in turn lead to a series of rewards: this ranges from items of clothing useful for dressing our virtual alter ego to accessories for embellish its look or that of some areas. Everyone at the Luna Park It is also possible to spend the tickets to play the wheel of fortune or with the mechanical seer Wodin. With the latter you can interact by answering questions that the magician will ask the patrons or by participating in games. Unfortunately, not all that glitters is gold. Avatars are waiting for a race to start We have already described above how in certain mini-games in which a certain precision is required in throwing an object against a target, a slight inaccuracy is recorded, as if an accurate peripheral and game calibration were missing. But Carnival: In Action! it still has a few other flaws that partially affect an otherwise very positive evaluation. First of all, the general level of difficulty: in fact, there is only one for each activity to be carried out. This means that after passing a test and perhaps reaching first place in one of the challenge rankings for that eventto, you will hardly want to play it again. Maybe there was the possibility to set the difficulty to a higher level, then maybe that would have been a good incentive to continue that session. Another negative note concerns the brevity of some games. They resolve too quickly and, even in this case, if not to challenge a friend to their first experience with the world of the 2K Play series, they will rarely recover. Luckily the developer has also promised to support the product in the future with new add-ons to download via the Xbox Live Marketplace. There are rumors of new games, avatar accessories, etc. From a visual point of view it must be said that contrary to many other games of the genre, this Carnival: In Action! It defends itself quite well by presenting very colorful graphics, beautiful to look at and fully integrated with the context in which the mini-games are set. The Luna Park is well done as well as the areas where the challenges take place, as mentioned, appear beautiful. Overall this is certainly a nice collection of games that are suitable for everyone. Not a masterpiece, but certainly a nice party game for Kinect that is a valid alternative to Kinect Adventures.", "date": "2011-05-11", "grade": null}
