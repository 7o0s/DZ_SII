The only warning we can give is that, in this case, the controller is actually a smartphone, so it would be better not to indulge excessively in destructive impulses, but it won't be simple. In case you don't know what we're talking about, it's a sort of rhythmic platformer with endless runner-style elements, in which we essentially have to try to get a picture to the end of intricate levels through a single input that can find different applications. Everything is complicated by the presence of obstacles of various types and rather complex platform structures, which make trial and error practically the norm, in a continuous retry also highlighted by a ruthless counter placed in the center of the screen, which shows the number of attempts made to complete levels (and which regularly reaches insane numbers). The Impossible Game 2 is fiercely difficult, but has that particular design that keeps you trying while fighting the impending frustration: the structure of the levels is complicated but not overly unfair and with each ~death~ we realize how we could have improved performance by moving the last jump by a millimeter, or by acting a fraction of a second earlier. The immediate restart from the last checkpoint then triggers the classic ~last attempt and that's it~ automatism, which eventually leads us to crush hours in front of this implacable destroyer of the nervous system. The game even more impossible The Impossible Game 2, a screenshot of the game The extreme minimalism that characterizes the aesthetics of The Impossible Game 2 is found in every aspect of the game, starting with the protagonist, who is effectively a square. The geometric figure in question is limited to scrolling on the platforms, but it's up to us to touch the screen to make it jump, hold down to jump in succession or act in different ways depending on the power-ups found in the levels. Beyond the basic jump, as the game progresses, additional variables are continually encountered that modify the standard gameplay: ~guns~ that allow you to destroy pieces of the scenery (but with a single shot available, therefore to be carefully evaluated), double jumps , switches that open or close the passages, reversers that reverse the movement and other elements that modify the structure of the platforms, are all features that enrich the game and always keep the attention perfectly focused on the instantaneous action. To help pass particularly challenging points, it is possible to activate some consumable boosters such as autopilot or slow-mo, but they are available in very limited quantities, unless you want to resort to the appropriate in-app purchases. A fundamental addition inserted in this second chapter is the possibility of playing in multiplayer: in addition to local matches, organized ad hoc, the most interesting mode is probably the ~battle royale~, in which up to 60 players participate. This is structured as a checkpoint race, with the need to reach various progressive milestones within certain time limits, on pain of elimination. The Impossible Game 2, a scene from the multiplayer The last one who remains active has won the game and it is a truly high-level challenge: it is an addition capable of providing a considerable stimulus for the most experienced and talented players, who can thus devote themselves to direct competition. To further enrich the package there is also an interesting level editor, which can potentially infinitely expand the game contents. The minimalist look fits perfectly with the game action and also emerges with an attractive style: obviously the graphics it's not exactly a preponderant element, but it manages to create a remarkable cohesion between gameplay and aesthetics thanks also to a rhythmic soundtrack that underlines and presses the timed action. The Impossible Game 2 is distributed as free-to-play with microtransactions. The Impossible Game 2, a screenshot from the level editor Although these are optional and not forced (some concern the aesthetic customization of the square, while others allow you to purchase some additional boosters) there are some more significant ones that concern the purchase of the Achievement Pass, which has a certain importance as it allows to unlock some bonus levels.", "date": "2022-03-19", "grade": "7.8"}
