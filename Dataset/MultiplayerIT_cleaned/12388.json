Of course, those in real time have gone down in history thanks above all to the contribution of Relic, but there is also room for smaller productions that rely on the indestructible turn-based structure. This is the case of Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector, whose review you are reading, published by Slitherine and developed by Black Lab Games, the same software house as Battlestar Galactica: Deadlock. Unlike Gladius: Relic Of War, published under the same banner a few years ago (and reviewed by Simone Taglifarri), Battlesector almost completely renounces the management part which, as we will see, is limited to simple upgrades, to concentrate exclusively on the tactics that develops in rather small arenas so as to be able to be defined, as the title itself suggests, real sectors. Much closer to its strings is Warhammer 40K: Sanctus Reach by Straylight Entertainment, with which, as we will see, it shares more than one aspect. A story to be written If you are not a fan of the Warhammer saga, you will hardly be able to get captured by a story told through dialogues and cartoons: the absence of expensive cut-scenes and the very few exchanges between the characters during the game sessions certainly don't help to contextualize the plot that follows the exploits of Sergeant Carleon at the head of the Blood Angels, overwhelmed by the invasion that the Tyranids have brought on their home planet Baal the Second. Hurry up the pleasantries and immediately move on to action: the battlefield is divided into a square grid, on which the various units move, each characterized by a quantity of action points that make it more or less mobile. There are covers that can modify the outcome of an attack or defense, making them more or less effective, even though the maps develop only on the horizontal plane and the terrain cannot be modified by attacks. Units are made up of one or more elements, depending on firepower, and each element has its own health bar. In addition to the standard ones, whose ranks can be replenished at no cost between one mission and another, there are heroes, including the aforementioned Sergeant Carleon, who have specific skills and whose premature demise will coincide with game over . From what has been written up to now it should be clear that Battlesector neither adds nor takes anything away from the typical structure of turn-based strategy; however, the developers have decided to spice things up with the introduction of the momentum, i.e. a bar that fills up as you kill tyranids and unlocks a special attack. The intriguing aspect is that points are lost by leaving troops in a defensive position; this mechanism adds a welcome tactical variable because sometimes it is worth risking moves that can prove to be both triumphant and catastrophic. Tactics Typical fight on a military platform As initially written, the maps are small, however they can take a long time to free up. This happens due to the continuous enemy regeneration which stops only when the primary objective (escort the blood priest up to the certain point, disable the defensive towers, resist an alien invasion for a certain number of turns) is reached. At this point, regardless of the efforts made previously, it is still necessary to get rid of all the tyranids left standing: this is the most critical moment ever because it is precisely in correspondence with the final rounds that the invasion produces its maximum efforts. The first maps seem to be accessible at the level suggested by the game, but soon the difficulty rises exponentially and already in the fifth mission it will be necessary to resort to the loading function. The challenge is not given so much by artificial intelligence, but by the overwhelming number of units controlled by the CPU, on average more than double those available to the player. With these premises, the conditions for failure are clear right from the deployment of the units, because neither the positioning of the opponents nor the composition of their army is known. This ~trial and error~ mechanic is not new to this genre of games, but it is often a source of frustration, and Battlesector is no exception. Furthermore, the fact that all the units are revealed before the middle of the game and the absence of secondary objectives during the missions are elements that risk making the action repetitive. Management Blood Angels attacking the ruins The management part is reduced to the bone: by completing the missionsi you get experience points that can be spent in the generals' skill tree, unlike troops which always remain at the same level regardless of the number of kills. In addition to the classic distinction between active and passive, some concern the single hero, others concern the standard units. Of these, in particular, we find ten types for each of the two factions represented, while the Tyranids, unlike the Space Marines which number five, have only three samples. There are only two game modes: the core of the offer is the Blood Angels campaign, divided into about twenty missions. Then there is the classic skirmish where finally the invaders can also be selected, and where it is also possible to set some parameters including the automatic regeneration of enemies. However, there are only eight maps and there is only one mode, that is, whoever gets the most points within a set limit of rounds wins. The multiplayer could not be missing, in which we find ~live~ matches, i.e. the traditional ones in which the two players compete in real time; the asynchronous ones, in which the turn is completed only when the player decides to get in front of the keyboard; the anachronistic hotseat where challengers use the same computer. Unfortunately, as often happens before the launch, it was not possible to try the multiplayer due to the absence of a lobby: however, we believe that this should not be the main reason for buying Battlesector.", "date": "2021-07-19", "grade": "6.8"}
