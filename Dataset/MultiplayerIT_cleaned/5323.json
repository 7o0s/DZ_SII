Made by Ben Brode, certainly not the latest arrival and indeed already game director as well as the public face of Hearthstone, the debut project of Second Dinner Studios made its debut these days on PC (still in early access), iOS and Android in the traditional free-to-play format. Adhering to the classic motto ~easy to learn, difficult to master~, the title of Brode involves us in one-on-one online matches characterized by simple and effective management of the deck, which we will be able to enrich and enhance in various ways thanks to a roster of over one hundred and fifty characters. Does the idea work? We tell you about it in the Marvel Snap review. Gameplay: immediate but with depth Marvel Snap, look at the deck The idea behind Marvel Snap is actually immediate: within matches lasting just three minutes, our goal will be to get a higher score than the opponent on duty in two out of three scenarios. The interface shows three different locations, each with four slots and peculiarities that influence the functioning of the cards, marking the strategic difference between victory and defeat. The deck, made up of only twelve cards, is almost completely gutted in the ambit of a match, which takes place over six rounds. The action energy determines whether or not a card can be used and increases by one unit at a time, which means that in the early stages of the game we will only be able to play cards with low requirements, but which nevertheless may possess special powers . It is precisely the mix between the abilities of the characters and the bonus / malus of the scenarios that gives an unsuspected depth to the experience, which is actually easy to learn, but difficult to master. The tactical nuances of these plots can only be learned with experience and by facing increasingly stronger opponents, all while following a progression path that will lead us to gradually unlock new cards and enhance those in our possession. The upgrade procedure uses the resources earned up to that moment and visually translates into a notable enhancement of the images that characterize each card: at first the portrayed character comes out of the frame, in a second moment it gains a three-dimensional effect, then small animations, a brilliant logo and border effects: a great way to emphasize the collectible aspect of the game. Marvel Snap, the game interface The free-to-play setting turns out to be rather permissive right from the start, which means that it is possible to play for free without problems and in any case unlock a large number of cards, but it is obvious that putting your wallet in hand (or buying the inevitable Battle Pass) we will be able to speed up the growth of our deck or create different variations to which to resort when necessary. Matchmaking, obviously fundamental in the context of a formula such as that of Marvel Snap, is very fast and produces stable and well-balanced clashes, also thanks to their brevity. Perhaps the lack of options is felt, but we are still at the beginning of a journey that we imagine will last a long time and will see the package gradually enriched with new content. After all, the players do not seem to be missing. Technical realization: focus on cards Marvel Snap, The Punisher's card In terms of technical implementation, Marvel Snap appears solid and well packaged. Net of a sound sector that is limited to being functional, the interface is confirmed to be very clear and legible, the board and the scenarios have synthetic descriptions that help to deal with the relative peculiarities, and some nice effects accompany the positioning of the cards. The latter are clearly the great protagonists of the experience and can count on excellent quality artwork, divided by styles and variants that wink at the Marvel collector in us, so much so that it is pleasant even just to stand there and admire them, perhaps after have strengthened them.", "date": "2022-10-24", "grade": "8.0"}
