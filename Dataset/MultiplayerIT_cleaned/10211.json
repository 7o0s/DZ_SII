In reality, the title present here, of the famous brand, gives all the impression of having appropriated it when the project had already assumed its very precise physiognomy, when perhaps the upper echelons of Ubisoft, impressed by the quality of the work proposed to them by Capy, decided to support you with an important name to avoid that so much good things go to waste in the chaos of poorly recognizable DS productions. If that's true, then hats off to the upper echelons of Ubi, who managed to recognize a truly extraordinary game. Once Upon a Time... Let's go in order: the narrative premises do not present themselves as the most original of this planet, and draw heavily from the narrative topos of the fantasy universe. In a medieval-fairy-tale land, where Men and Elves have been living together for some time now in harmony and prosperity, the Demons, relegated centuries earlier in darkness by the aforementioned races after a classic, epic war, return one fine day to plan to conquer the world and do their usual filthy and wicked things. The races ~of light~, thus, find themselves having to face the danger that seemed forgotten again, renewing their ancient alliance and mobilizing armies and heroes to restore peace and justice. Said this way, the thing seems, and is, quite trivial, but from these premises starts a story which, although it continues throughout the course of the game never stands out for who knows what gimmick or coup particularly ingenious and innovative scene, it is nevertheless of an excellent level by virtue above all of the wealth of details, the love for particular, the stereotyped but remarkable characters, and the lack of that fear of daring (expect quite hard and painful moments) that it could have hit a production that is still aimed at the widest possible audience. Even the dialogues and the quality of the writing in general are of excellent quality, although, also in this case, we are not dealing with first-prize literary material: in general we can say that the story, characters and dialogues are the indicator of attention and passion that the development team has dedicated to this product, and they are among the (many) factors that keep the attention alive during the long and numerous hours of play. The nice thing is that you will soon realize that, among these many factors, the one analyzed here, although valuable, is only the last! A Hero, his Army The game system developed by Capy, a real source of pride for the young development team, is so complex, structured and profound that describing it, for the poor reviewer, risks becoming a more difficult task than it was to learn it, since to do this, the exhaustive tutorial that accompanies the player in the first fights was very useful, which can also be tackled separately from the main Campaign. Let's start by saying that you find yourself impersonating the Hero on duty, who is none other than the leader of your army: the Hero moves on a world map structured in waypoints (the classic world map of Super Mario Bros. 3 as the most immediate comparison), where in these waypoints events such as dialogues, trades and, of course, battles in the first place may or may not occur. As the big guns of the strategic RPG genre teach, there are battles that are an integral part of the story and therefore cannot be avoided, and in addition a whole series of optional battles, sub-missions and beautiful company, which you might even prefer to not to face but which often turn out to be the most demanding (and therefore fun) and profitable. The Hero is endowed with experience points and relative levels, which mainly affect his life points, once these are exhausted the battle is lost. The army he heads is instead a much more complex system: first of all there are three different types of standard units, which differ in characteristics (one type can attack faster but weaker than another, for example), which are available in unlimited quantities during a battle, and which can be deployed together; in addition there are two types of Elite units and two of Champion units, equipped with extremely useful special characteristics for battle purposes, but which must be purchased with money and resources found by playing and can be deployed up to a maximum of two types per battle. Each of these units then has its own particular experience points and characteristics, the values of which increase as you pu can wait, with every win. War to the last color Therefore, if the strategic part appears sufficiently complex and deep, know that it is the ~tactical~ part, that is the actual battle, which is the real surprise. Your units in the field are three different colors, you decide the unit-color association on the world map but it is irrelevant for the purposes of the game (on the other hand the decision of which types of units to deploy is not irrelevant, given that each enemy army is structured in a different way), and they are arranged on a certain number of rows and columns on the lower screen, while the upper one shows the opposing units. The battle takes place in rounds, in each of which you have a certain number of moves available (usually three), and the fundamental mechanic is to create combinations of three units of the same type: three units of the same type arranged vertically begin to charge an attack, while if arranged horizontally they create a wall that will limit enemy attacks. Combinations can be created either by moving the last unit of a column, or by eliminating a unit that is in the middle of a row or column: in this case the units that were below will advance by how many positions the eliminated unit occupied, i.e. one in the case of a standard unit, more for Elite and Champion units. The contenders lose life points when an attack reaches the opposing Hero, who is behind the ranks of their own army: the opposing units that are in the trajectory of the attack are hit by it, often losing their life points until eliminated total, but in this way making the blow weaker and therefore protecting one's commander. Obviously these are only the basic mechanics, to which many other rules must be added, such as the chains of attacks by units of the same color and/or type that reinforce each other, the possibility of creating walls one behind the other, the ~chains~, i.e. those more or less long combinations that arise from a single, perfectly fitting move and which give the player the possibility of making a large number of extra moves in the course of a single turn, or again the ~chain special~ that becomes available by filling a bar. The Neverending Story However, there is plenty of time to master even the most subtle of tactics: in fact, the game will put you in the shoes of five Heroes before reaching the coveted final, one for each alignment present, in fact you will also play the role of the villains . Estimating, it takes about thirty hours to finish everything by paying attention only to the main story, which will also be very difficult given that to overcome some battles the experience given by the sidequests proves to be fundamental; if you want to see everything there is to see get ready to double, or almost, the count of hours. And after all, how would it be possible to resist Puzzle Battles, in which you have to defeat the enemy in just one turn? Here the real puzzle soul of the game comes out, and the puzzles reach the levels of the best exponents of the genre. Once the Campaign is over, then, you can still have fun thanks to the wireless multiplayer; unfortunately there is no online mode. The graphics of the title are delightful, a 2D that doesn't make our eyes accustomed to the flashiness of 3D cry out wonders, but delights them with tons of on-screen sprites all detailed and expertly animated, with excellently drawn backdrops and quite a few of nice effects to create the right atmosphere. Rather the graphic style chosen, which winks quite a bit at manga and anime, could make Might and Magic lovers perplexed, but even here we are faced with a beautiful work, which stands out particularly in the character design, not memorable but definitely tasteful. And in the midst of all this attention to detail, he certainly could not disfigure the sound department, with beautiful musical compositions that fully fall within the canons of the fantasy video game, but which can be appreciated and which remain, in some passages, even memorable.", "date": "2010-02-05", "grade": "9.0"}
