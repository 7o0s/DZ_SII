{"name": "Mare mostro", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/151239-monstrum-mare-mostro.html", "text": "Monstrum is the zero degree of horror. The developers have taken the basic concept of the genre and purified it of all distractions, purifying it to the extreme. The goal not to tell but to bring the horror to life is clear from the plot, which almost doesn't exist. We find ourselves on a ship adrift in the ocean, with the rest of the crew mysteriously missing. Our goal is simply to find a way to escape. The notes scattered here and there throughout the rooms provide a few more details on what happened, but nothing that can captivate you for more than the time spent reading. The rest is hide and seek, with the whole game system designed to fill the player with the fear of indeterminacy. Monstrum has two peculiar characteristics, around which the whole experience revolves: the adventure map is procedurally generated and in each game you have to avoid a different monster, chosen from a shortlist of three, whose identity is initially unknown. Each monster changes in appearance and attack patterns: the Brute is the classic noisy and violent beast, the Hunter is its exact opposite, while the Fiend is a creepy and deadly creature that disturbs the electricity grid when it is nearby . Although they are different, they have one trait in common: ruthlessness. Once identified, it is really difficult to survive, with the Brute giving a few more chances due to the size and less foresight in looking for us, but in general with the only possibility of running away in search of a hiding place. Classic tactics like locking yourself in rooms waiting for the monster to leave don't work much, since the funny guys can literally break down doors. Better to slip into some locker or under some cabinet, obviously avoiding doing it when we are still in sight of the monster. Your cases So far we have only mentioned the most relevant feature of the Team Junkfish title, namely the procedural generation of maps. As already mentioned, every time you start a new game the ship changes shape. There is no save option and when you are killed you cannot reuse the same map, so each escape attempt is unique. This injects a determining factor into the gameplay that ends up annihilating all others: chance. Monstrum takes twenty to fifty minutes to complete, depending on your luck in the distribution of rooms and items. Basically you have to explore every nook and cranny of the ship in search of something useful, both to leave and to distract the monsters and have a better chance of surviving. Initially we don't know exactly what, but with practice and reading the various notes, the only ones not to be lost after each death, we get a more precise picture. Traps are also randomly distributed. For example, there are cameras that can call monsters by activating an alarm, or pipes that emit lethal steam. Nothing is predetermined, apart from the starting room. The same encounters with the creatures can take place after a few moments of play, or after a few minutes. This overall vagueness gives Monstrum strong moments of tension and makes it replayable several times, even after finishing it, conceptually bringing it closer to the roguelike genre, from which it takes elements with both hands. Unfortunately, the randomness is not painless and brings various imbalances that partly ruin the experience as a whole. Dead ends Imagine the scene: you are walking down a long corridor with few doors when a monster appears in front of you. You turn and run away. The creature is behind you. He's stalking you. Turn and you are in a closed corridor. Get to the bottom and open the only door present by entering the room. Unfortunately it is a dead end and there are no hiding places. The inevitable conclusion is that the monster reaches you and mercilessly takes your life. On the one hand it is a particular situation, which creates a very strong tension in the player, but on the other hand it is also perceived as a profound injustice. Not only did we not know that that corridor led to certain death, but at the same time we didn't do anything with the information we acquired because restarting the game the ship will be different. Not bad, except that sometimes it's enough to explore a handful of rooms to find everything you need and escape. Well, Monstrum's biggest problem is its strength. Once you become familiar with the game system, you realize that randomness is decisive beyond the lawful. It creates variety, but also puts the player in the mood to hope for luck rather than his own abilities. In practice it boils down toraid room after room hoping to meet the creature on duty as late as possible, in order to be equipped to distract it and escape it. By fleeing, one counts, more than on oneself, on not finding oneself in one of the many dead ends with which the maps are full. Initially you don't mind too much, but after several deaths you understand that it's not exactly exciting to find yourself killed for faults not your own. Will Monstrum's randomly generated maps scare us enough? This ship is not an umbrella Stylistically, the procedurally generated levels also create some idiosyncrasies. The individual parts that compose them are not particularly showy. Essentially they are thought of as LEGO pieces that must be able to intersect each other in infinite combinations. It is natural that this is the case, but for a realistic setting like that of Monstrum the final effect is quite alienating. It is often difficult to identify the shape of a ship in the maze of corridors and rooms generated by the system. In this case architectural realism is not fundamental, but finding yourself walking through very long corridors with perhaps only one small room, and other very short ones with countless rooms, can annoy you and make the immersion more complicated. However, the technical quality of Monstrum is overall superior to that of the average independent title, although it does not shine for creativity. The basic elements are crafted with great skill and, above all, the interior impresses with its wealth of details. Even the monsters have their reason and they are definitely successful. Moreover, everyone has their own style and animations, a commendable detail for such a production level.", "date": "2015-06-11", "grade": "7.5"}
