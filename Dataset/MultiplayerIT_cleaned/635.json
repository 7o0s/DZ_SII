Viewtiful Joe: Double Trouble is a direct sequel to the home episodes and therefore also inherits the same mechanics. Moving through two-dimensional levels, you'll have to make your way past puzzles and enemies, constantly helping you with the powers given to you by your watch. Of the powers already seen in the previous episodes, only the ~Slow~ returns, which allows you to slow down the scene and dodge shots and bullets just like Neo in ~The Matrix~. Completely new are the powers ~Scratch~, ~Split~ and ~Slide~. The scratch power allows you to drop objects on enemies' heads by rubbing the stylus (or finger) over their silhouette. Among the new powers this is decidedly the least brilliant and precise, in fact trying to rub the enemy with his finger if he risks leaving the target area and canceling the power and its effects. Sometimes the Scratch power will help you solve some puzzles and overcome certain obstacles, and combined with the ~Slow~ power it will increase its effectiveness. The ~Slide~ power allows you to reverse the shots of the two screens to get some advantages. In VJ:DT both screens show the game environment. The lower screen is where we will play the whole game, while the upper one shows a zoom around the character: by giving the touch screen a vertical movement we will reverse the two scenes. Bringing the zoom to the lower screen, we will have the possibility to interact via touch screen on elements that were only previously on the upper screen, and which must be activated by pressing. Playing on the zoomed area, Joe's moves also undergo some changes, as happened on the home episodes by activating the appropriate ~Zoom In~ power. Often we will have to switch from one mode to another both to solve puzzles and to more easily defeat some enemies. But of Joe's new powers, the one that comes close to genius is the ~Split~, which allows, through a horizontal movement on the touch screen, to divide the (lower) screen into two lines and move the elements located in the upper half. In the first levels it will mainly serve to move some objects that block the way, or to superimpose some elements, but the further you go, the more you realize what they have achieved at Capcom. In fact, the split has the power to modify the structure of the level, allowing you to create passages where some walls blocked the way, or to shorten or lengthen the distances between the platforms. The idea really surprised us both for the absolutely original concept and for the realization and integration with the level design. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] Limits and possibilities VJ's cel-shaded graphics engine is certainly first-rate, and immediately surprises with the amount of detail shown on the two screens, which for the first time feature 3D graphics on both screens. A general ~spixellation~ of the environment penalizes what could have appeared even more precise and orderly, but it is clear that at least currently, Capcom has pulled the DS by the neck, trying to get as much out of it as possible. The framerate settles on 30fps with very slight drops from time to time, as opposed to the 60 of the home releases. Due to this limitation, much of that ~looseness~ effect that you had during the animations and special powers in the versions for the fixed consoles is lost. Obviously all the amazing effects on the GameCube have been lost, as well as the ~Mac Speed~ power, which speeded up Joe's movements, which are generally slow by default. This drop in pace, combined with the presence of only two (in number) enemies on screen for the entire duration of the game, means that VJ: DT focuses more on the puzzle component, losing almost all of the action part by the wayside. Joe's attacks are mostly all there, but the fact that you can't crumple enemies on top of each other and knock them down like skittles or dominoes, makes the fights, however challenging, much less fun, adrenaline-pumping and amazing. On the other hand, the puzzle phase has improved markedly, and we will find ourselves faced with pleasant and challenging puzzles, thanks also to their solution which must be sought in the powers we have described above. The soundtrack aligns with those already heard and which have become a hallmark of the series. The jingles and classic interludes at the beginning and end of the level are also reproduced in this version. Enjoy Joe's phrases that occasionally accompany particular moments of the game, such as famigrated Henshin a gogo baby. The story, on the other hand, is totally described through text and with the help of some animations or static artwork, with the characteristic style and cut of VJ, so much so that fans of the series will have no difficulty imagining the narrator who tells the story when in caption the narrator's line appears. Obviously, this adventure of Joe also follows the ironic / caricatural nature by setting up absolutely meaningless scenes and twists. There are obviously no shortage of cinematic quotations, but this time some self-quotations also peep out. The longevity aligns with the two episodes already seen, and also the structure of the game is the same, despite the absence of the six-machine level. A structure that is actually starting to tire both because it is no longer surprising, and because we are definitely tired of redoing all four spun bosses once again. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] Comment VJDT loses part of its action nature in favor of a structure interspersed with continuous and pleasant puzzles. Joe's new powers were designed on top of the DS and aren't replicable anywhere else, except perhaps on Revolution. The ~Split~ power then, must be seen in action to realize what it is really capable of doing, and VJ:DT, perhaps, will be the only possibility to do it. But these new additions don't just bring benefits: Touch screen controls aren't as precise as they should be. The Scratch power works much better with a stylus, and given the frenzy with which you sometimes have to act on the mechanisms, you find yourself a bit awkward in switching from one setting to another. With a little practice, you can proceed just fine by messing with your fingers directly, but sometimes the nib makes the difference between success and failure. Furthermore, although VJ:DT is totally new as regards the new powers, it suffers a bit from the usual game structure that reappears the same for the third time in the eyes of the player, who may find the game repetitive. Pros Excellent technical achievement The Touch Screen is integrated into the game mechanics Nice powers, excellent ~Split~ Cons Some sacrifices in immediacy and precision Game structure unchanged No stimulus for a new game Capcom with Viewtiful Joe has succeeded in creating an adrenaline-pumping, fast and above all fresh game. Although the market has not welcomed him as he deserved, the house of Street Figher, fortunately, seems to want to keep the character in vogue, and has created a whole series of games dedicated to Joe and his bizarre family in just a few years. On closer inspection, the games that followed the debut on the GameCube weren't quite as successful, but at least there is the hope that with the new generation a new dazzling episode of Viewtiful Joe will hotel in our homes. For now we can kill time with this controversial DS episode.", "date": "2006-01-30", "grade": null}
