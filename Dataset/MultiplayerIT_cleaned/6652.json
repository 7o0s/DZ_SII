This means a large amount of content, capable of entertaining for weeks, if not months. But what is Terraria? Basically everyone agrees in defining it as the two-dimensional version of Minecraft, basically it is always a sandbox where the user's creativity is put in the foreground. The purpose is apparently very similar: abandoned in a world whose dimensions can be established, we find ourselves in command of a fully customizable character, capable of digging the ground and manipulating it to find precious materials. Instead of the ~LEGO style~ three-dimensional block graphics of Notch's masterpiece, Terraria presents a typical aesthetic of the 16-bit era, with strictly 2D bitmap scenarios and characters and capable of recalling numerous classics. We could even go back further by bringing up Pitfall, but we would have only scratched the iceberg. Re-Logic also looks a lot at Commodore Amiga and Japanese role-playing games of the Super Nintendo era, evidently, given that its characters could have come out of a Final Fantasy or a Square production from the years of the glorious Nintendo console. Terraria keeps its charm intact also in the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions De profundis Once we have established that we are not really talking about a monster of originality, we must give credit to the developers for having managed to create a Minecraft clone that is able to take its own direction. Like the title, Mojang is able to involve the player for hours and days, allowing him to create the worlds of his dreams, providing him with all the means to transform the environment at will. On the other hand, however, it is a title that points in significantly different directions in terms of combat and weapons. If the initial ones are limited to the typical tools of the trade to procure vital resources, such as pickaxes or axes, later it is possible to build various weapons, including magical ones, useful for facing increasingly dangerous enemies. In Minecraft the enemy presence is an optional element and only partially linked to the game economy, in Terraria it is not possible to eliminate it and this leads the player to take immediate action to counter the threat, especially at night, where the enemy presence it intensifies. Even the damage system and the way to deal with enemies distance Terraria from the title of Notch, bringing it closer to platformers and role-playing games, an element also facilitated by the type of view used. Like Minecraft, however, it is possible to build a house and a bed, which is also functional as a rebirth point. This will soon become the primary purpose of the adventure, since exploring the scenario in a ruthless way leads to an early and almost always very cruel death. However, the materials must be procured and sooner or later this leads to experimenting with the insidious underground part of the Re-Logic work, practically inaccessible without the aid of torches and essentially deadly if approached without due caution and circumspection. It is also very easy to die after a disastrous fall, due to the rather realistic force of gravity, a simple factor to assimilate in a three-dimensional environment, much less, however, in a 2D context. Xbox One goals Common since the advent of Xbox One, despite the budget nature of Terraria, we find the usual 1000 player points, divided along 30 objectives. The first 10 points are obviously obtained easily by simply completing the Tutorial, for the others there will be sweat, but do you want to put the satisfaction of conquering 50 after having convinced your guide to enter the newly built mansion? All for One The Xbox One version of Terraria takes advantage of the Microsoft console to bring some aesthetic advantage to the title, at least compared to the old-gen, it being understood that we are not dealing with something that could worry the hardware. The graphic aspect still manages to conquer thanks to the numerous layers of parallax of the external environment and a functional but certainly pleasant graphic characterization. The same cannot be said for the repetitive accompaniment and light years away from the beauty of C418's compositions, a factor that quickly led us to exclude it from the options. The console port also has several critical issues on the control system, clearly designed for the mouse. Terraria is in fact a hybrid between a platform title and a point and click, with the player being able to choose precisely where to dig along a limited surrounding area. The mapping on the controller forces the usedirection cursor with the right analog stick, while the left controls the character. As a solution it does not prove to be as effective as the PC one, also suffering from the comparison with the masterful conversion work carried out by 4J Studio with the console editions of Minecraft. Finally, the presence of multiplayer in co-op for up to four players is appreciable, an element capable of offering new possibilities to an already very rich sector in itself.", "date": "2014-12-29", "grade": "8.0"}
