{"name": "Conflict Zone", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/conflict-zone-4.html", "text": "War on TV In a Real Time Strategy game the average user is required to use men, means and resources to their own advantage in order to complete the most diversified missions; masterpieces such as Red Alert and Front Mission (just to name a couple of examples) have taught us that in RTS fighting against enemies is extremely important, as much as the perfect management of one's resources in the phases preceding the scuffles. Conflict Zone has its own, that is, it introduces a new factor to be highly taken into consideration: public opinion. Any of your acts (killing, sabotage, rescue operations, etc) will appear on television, guaranteeing a positive or negative effect on whoever is watching your deeds, depending on what your role is, what you were ordered to do and what you have actually accomplished (those who kill civilians as if they were flies are warned, so to speak). The background is 2010, two powers hold the reins of the world in their hands: ICP, International Peace Corps and GHOST. The ICP is on the front line in moments of international crisis, trying to save as many innocent people as possible and, above all, preserve the peace while the second is made up of large multinational corporations and independent states, ready to do anything to hinder the noble intentions of the ICP. After starting the game, the player has the choice of carrying out a detailed and useful tutorial (especially for those who are not familiar with strategy) or to take the side of the ICP or the GHOST, successfully carrying out all the missions that you will gradually have to bring to fruition, always bearing in mind that the world is watching you. As per the script, it is vital to build bases, train personnel, know how to carefully manage jeeps, planes, tanks, as well as the weapons at your disposal (such as the very useful bazookas), as well as (and here comes the aforementioned novelty) act taking into account that you are live and that your actions will determine a whole series of chain reactions: if it is important for the ICP to be able to defeat the GHOST, trying not to kill defenseless people (who must be taken to the rescue camps) or avoiding gratuitous massacres (obtaining, therefore, the support of other nations), for the sworn enemy of humanity it is instead important to guarantee the full support of military states and arms manufacturers with massacres, genocides, perhaps in the most spectacular and sadistic way possible. They don't make it.. The game, which on paper seems to be a potential masterpiece, unfortunately disappoints the expectations that are created for the reasons that we will soon illustrate: first of all, last summer Conflict Zone was already barely passable in terms of graphics, let alone how deleterious it could be if not adapt the cosmetics of the game to the potentialities of the Playstation 2 which has shown real joys for the eyes with Gran Turismo 3, Jak And Dexter, Tekken 4, Devil May Cry and many other masterpieces. The polygons are present in at least a small number, the textures are not very varied and of decidedly unconvincing quality, the fluidity of 50 frames per second is occasionally undermined by some uncertainty (in addition to loading data from the DVD), although even a Dreamcast would have kept the frame rate constant and with a much higher level of detail. The sound remains average, with anonymous music, standard sound effects and the presence of well-made speech (absent the software localization of the product in Italian, favored by English, French and Spanish). Even if the game is not overly rigid like other similar products (certainly not to frighten the average console user), it is not clear why the artificial intelligence of its armed forces can also be defined as an ~artificial deficiency~, recalling the good old days of Secret Of Mana for Snes when the party got stranded somewhere or didn't execute our commands to the letter but what in our opinion is the worst aspect of the game is anything but: the scandalous control via joypad, which will put a severe test of your nerves and, especially at the beginning, your memory between various combinations of keys, directions of the digital pad and the 2 analog sticks. Bitter conclusions Conflict Zone is a missed opportunity to make the genre of real-time strategic video games more attractive: graphically bland, acoustically forgettable, characterized by a decidedly agnostic interface and an at least latent desirability, the video game programmed by MASA should only be bought if you love the genre crazy and you don't have the possibility to buy a PCor to upgrade it enough to take advantage of the previous release. Too bad for this botched conversion. Pros: Interesting idea of mass media 2 different factions to lead to victory Cons: Very below average graphics and sound Controls via joypad too messy Intrusive strategy and mass media on Ps2 Conflict Zone is a direct conversion of an RTS for some innovative aspects that last summer enthralled several PC users aficionados of strategy games, despite the game programmed by MASA still lacking an official distributor and therefore subject to limited diffusion on a national scale . After almost a year, Conflict Zone also arrives on Playstation 2 thanks to MASA (and the distributor Ubisoft), confirming how the black Sony console is the most heterogeneous from the point of view of videogame genres; someone could also argue that certain types of videogames such as first person shooters and rts are extremely unprofitable on consoles for the most diverse reasons (lack of mouse and keyboard, lack of online play, etc) but Age Of Empires 2 and Quake 3 Revolution, although inferior to their respective computer counterparts (primarily due to the obvious absence of all the freeware extras that abound on the Internet) testify that it is not necessary to buy a PC if you want to play (above all) with a multitude of shootem'up and rts. Will Conflict Zone do the same? Let's find out together.....", "date": "2002-04-11", "grade": null}
