Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. Although these are products designed for use with mouse and keyboard, therefore on PC, multiplayer online battle arena, MOBA for friends, have already successfully landed on smartphones and tablets, see the excellent Heroes of Order & Chaos . The Gameloft title offers the same mechanics that fans of classics like Dota know well: online multiplayer battles on large maps and a strategic approach, given that each hero must be developed during the game thanks to the gain of experience and coins made by first eliminating simple minions and then real opponents. Well, the Zynga developers thought that perhaps some elements of this type of structure should be eliminated in favor of a faster experience, with ten-minute matches, a scenario characterized by smaller dimensions and the total absence of minions on one side and on the other. In short, a MOBA that immediately puts the two teams face to face, without waiting, without ~construction~ phases: just pure action. And so here is the release of Solstice Arena, a game belonging to the well-known freemium category, that is downloadable for free but with the possibility of making in-game purchases, in this specific case to quickly unlock new characters. The roster is in fact made up of a total of thirteen heroes, but only five of them are available immediately: the others must be bought by spending the virtual currency accumulated with each victory, but it is good to clarify immediately that victories will take quite a few to raise the required amount. Solstice Arena tries the MOBA way by focusing on immediacy and immediately hits the target The good, the bad and the ugly The cast of Solstice Arena is divided into five categories: ~casters~, or characters with ranged attacks, such as wizards or archers, quite vulnerable in close combat; ~support~, support units for the team, capable of slowing down enemies or healing allies; ~fighter~, warriors well balanced in terms of strength, agility and endurance; ~tank~, the biggest and baddest guys there is, very resistant and powerful but very slow; ~assassin~, i.e. very fast and cunning demons or ninjas, but lack consistent brute strength. As MOBA enthusiasts know well, it is very important to identify a category that well represents our style of play and focus on that to understand its secrets, rather than changing characters in each game forever, risking not completing much. This element is particularly true for Solstice Arena, given that we will be able to enhance individual heroes based on experience points and make their three special powers more effective, which often and willingly represent the key to surviving in combat. One of the strengths of the Zynga product is the possibility to practice playing alone against the bots or in cooperative, always against the bots, and only later to face the multiplayer battles for six players, which require a certain familiarity with the mechanics and the strategy behind the gameplay. The only arena present has two respawn zones which also act as units for the recovery of vital energy, therefore a main tower and three ~secondary~ ones for each team. The goal is to destroy the enemy's main tower, but to do so we will first have to deal with the secondary defenses and, above all, knock out the three elements that make up the opposing team. During the game we will be able to access a virtual shop where we can buy objects capable of significantly improving our character's abilities, therefore it is not really true that the ~strategic~ phase has been completely curtailed, on the contrary. In short, there is depth and substance behind the action setting of Solstice Arena, which can also count on a quality technical sector, with excellent polygonal models and an enveloping sound, really well done.", "date": "2013-07-06", "grade": "8.0"}
