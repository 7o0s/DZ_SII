The largest part is occupied by the strategic map, divided into regions, where the troops are located and where it is possible to observe the general situation of the territory. At the bottom left is a minimap with which you can quickly navigate through the area represented so as not to waste too much time scrolling the screen. Also in the same area there are some handy summary tools that allow you to explore the particular situations of the different regions, showing various graphic information directly on the map. By clicking on a territory, a horizontal bar placed at the top of the screen will illustrate the conformation of the terrain, useful for understanding the level of defendability and the possibility of making or being ambushed. The same bar also shows the current and average weather conditions. the philosophy that governs Birth of America is to present itself with a few clear rules without accepting compromises in terms of depth The orgy of power A small box at the top right shows the date of the current shift and allows you to move on to the next shift in order to implement the decisions made on the field. At the bottom is the event bar, where the events of the shift that has just ended are illustrated. By clicking on any unit on the map, this bar transforms giving detailed information on the groupings and on the general status of each selection. In short, from here it will be possible to manage the troops and decide their behavior on the battlefield depending on the situation, all in a decidedly intuitive way. For example, besieging a fort and staying on the defensive can mean months of siege without tangible results other than reducing the enemy to its limits due to lack of supplies, but choosing a frontal assault can prove destructive even in the event of a large numerical superiority on our part. In short, every choice must be taken in a weighted way trying to take into consideration the different possible results and also evaluating how much the losses could affect the progress of the war: sacrificing men to take control of a strategic region can produce very different results depending on the overall campaign performance. The siege The main objectives usually involve the capture of one or more key cities. To do this, it is necessary to drag troops into the region of the city to take it by force, taking care not to leave uncovered any territory necessary for the enemy to win. Moving troops is an extremely simple operation: just select them and move them to the destination as if they were a Windows icon. The CPU will then process the route highlighting the time needed to reach the goal, taking into account all possible variables (weather conditions, terrain roughness, supply difficulty, troop morale and more). When the troops are near the city, the real siege begins, which is managed automatically following the general indications given by the player. By ending a turn, your choices will produce effects that, in the next turn, will require adjustments in your strategies. For example, if our men have managed to create a breach in the opposing defenses, we will be able to select a higher level of aggression in order to take advantage of the favorable situation. The artificial intelligence implemented by the developers is of the highest level. It can be seen that passionate strategists got their hands on it because the computer was repeatedly able to surprise us with thoughtful decisions that put us in great difficulty, significantly increasing the level of the challenge. Not bad for a product that has certainly not been able to enjoy a multi-billion dollar super production. High fedelity The biggest flaw of Birth of America is perhaps the excessive essentiality. As already mentioned, everything is perfectly functional, but sometimes you have the feeling of being faced with something sketchy. Some screens are difficult to read due to the amount of data they manage to compress in very little space, while other times you go in search of some more detailed information not tied to slow-reading numbers. Even the visual information is lacking in the game with the most important events underlined. Maybe some extra animations would have been welcome to show what happens in a battle or some quality static screens would have been enough to give the player some of that ~aesthetic~ satisfactiona~ that should not be missing even in the most serious of games. In reality it is not so much the latter that we lack as the possibility of understanding what happened in the opponents' turn without having to go and sift through dozens of messages at the beginning of the turn. In the early stages of the campaigns or of some scenarios, not very many things happen and the operation is decidedly fast, but in the advanced stages or even at the beginning of very complex scenarios, you can get dozens of different messages that require a lot of time to be disposed of, when it would have been enough to show a small representation of the event on the screen to make it known to the player. All this slows down the game rounds a lot, making some phases long, which greatly limits the possibility, for example, of playing online if you don't have several hours available. Fortunately, there is the possibility of playing via email, a very practical option in this case that allows you to postpone a game over a longer period. Another flaw is the irritating soundtrack. Between very low-level effects and a piece of music that would be able to make even a Buddhist monk impatient, it doesn't take long to eliminate the sound by opting for silence or for a personalized soundtrack of any other nature. System requirements The minimum hardware requests are not at all expensive, even if the best performing systems will notice a greater speed in processing the moves of the CPU which, on older systems, can prove to be a long and rather tiring operation, especially in the advanced stages. For the rest, the game was very stable and never crashed, even after very long sessions. Minimum Requirements: Processor: Pentium 3 1.2 GHz or AMD equivalent RAM: 512 MB Video Card: Any DirectX 8.1 compatible 64 MB RAM DirectX 8.1 Disk Space: 1.0 GB Recommended Requirements: Processor: Pentium 4 1, 8 GHz or AMD equivalent RAM: 1 GB Video Card: Any DirectX 8.1 compatible 128 MB RAM Disk Space: 2.0 GB Test Configuration Processor: Intel Pentium 4 3.4 GHz RAM: 2 GB Video Card : NVIDIA 7800GT Comment A well-designed and functional interface, an excellent level of artificial intelligence, hours and hours of gameplay to complete all the campaigns and all the scenarios, the possibility of playing online even via email in short, everything would be perfect if paid more attention to the visual part of the game and the speed of some operations. We are not talking about the graphic beauty itself, but about the lack of information that could help to dispose of some delays and could also attract newbies more. Birth of America is still a game that we would like to recommend and that earns some points also by virtue of its extremely competitive price. Pros Simple even for beginners Excellent game interface Long-lived and deep Cons Technically poor The soundtrack should be trashed in its entirety Some delays could have been avoided The birth of a nation Birth of America is an old-fashioned turn-based strategy in which substance prevails over all other aspects. The interface, a schematic map and some icons designed in a functional way is all that the graphics sector has to offer, but don't be fooled: you understand the few rules of the game, what you see fades into the background and you are dragged into an excellent play mechanism, perhaps not very suitable for the mass market, but endowed with great class. The scenario is one of the classic ones: the great wars of the end of the 18th century in North America where the well-known War of Independence which began in 1775 and ended in 1783 was accompanied by lesser-known conflicts such as those of the French-Indian War of 1755. The start is without frills, with some options to set, especially as regards the gameplay, and with the possibility of choosing whether to face the useful and slender tutorial, whether to try one of the 4 campaigns or one of the 12 scenarios available. The tutorial turns out to be a godsend given the lack of a paper manual inside the very poor packaging, where only the game CD and a black and white sheet with the serial number have found space. However, there is a PDF version of the manual on the CD. The tutorial explains the interface and the movements of the troops, making clear the excellent work done by the developers in terms of simplicity: you will hardly find such a specialized strategy in which the interaction system has been refined to such an extent as to allow even newbies to ~enter  into the game without a steep and slippery learning curve like Pierpaolo's head (our caporedactor, editor's note). The philosophy that governs Birth of America is to present itself with a few clear rules without accepting compromises in terms of depth. The result is a product that can be used immediately but which, as the hours pass in front of the screen, proves to be increasingly intriguing and never banal.", "date": "2007-05-15", "grade": null}
