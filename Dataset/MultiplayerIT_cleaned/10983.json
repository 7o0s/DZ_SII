{"name": "Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 FES - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/shin-megami-tensei-persona-3-fes-recensione.html", "text": "The Journey and the Answer The narrative basis of Persona 3 is very particular: the protagonist is in fact a Japanese student who has just moved to a new school. Your alter-ego will be embroiled in an epic battle between the demonic Shadows that appear at night, in a phantom hour called Dark Hour, and a handful of young heroes who contrast them with the powers of Personas, psychic entities that can be summoned to fight (moreover via a disturbing simulated suicide). The fact that our hero is able to evoke more Persona already lets us guess its importance in a story that offers numerous twists and characters that are always excellently characterized. This story, in Persona 3 FES, can be played by selecting the appropriate ~The Journey~ mode and is none other than Persona 3, revised and corrected: it is in fact possible to import data from the Memory Card, for example, to resume the game where it had left itself in its previous incarnation, perhaps enjoying the various features added for the occasion. ~The Answer~ instead is a second mode that is proposed as a sequel to all intents and purposes: over an additional thirty hours of gameplay we will see the protagonists who survived ~The Journey~ trapped in a bizarre paranormal phenomenon that forces them to relive the same day, whose origin seems to be hidden in the depths of the Abyss of Time, a space-time distortion generated under the dormitory of the members of the S.E.E.S which will then have to be explored, together with new adventure companions, up to the amazing epilogue of the story that has begun in The Journey. Of shadows, schools, tarot cards and other amenities We have already talked about the mechanics of Persona 3 in the previous review, to which we therefore refer you for further details: here we will limit ourselves to saying that Persona 3 is a JRPG with a rather classic setting but full of so many original features that it is always compelling, fresh and original. The main feature is certainly the structure of the story: the player lives an entire school year in the role of the protagonist, day after day, attending Gekkoukan High School in a particularly realistic way. Between questions, sporting activities and recreation there is also time to hang out with one's school mates and build relationships with them, called Social Links, which will influence the potential of the Personas. The player is therefore required to consider how to spend the day, who to hang out with, what activities to do: each choice inevitably affects the Social Links and our abilities, for a truly excellent level of customization. All this in the FES edition has been further improved with the addition of about thirty new Personas and various Social Links, furthermore those who have already played the original version will notice how many of these elements have undergone slight variations, as in the case of the position of some characters in the school complex and the quizzes proposed by the teachers. Persona 3 is a rather classic JRPG but full of so many original features that it is compelling, fresh and original Of shadows, schools, tarot cards and other amenities Of course, the improvements to the FES version don't end there: a whole new set of features awaits the player who has already faced the adventure. The expansion of the Persona Compendium with ever more bizarre entities offers further variety and combat possibilities, also considering the possibility of generating new weapons by fusing them with the Personas. New enemies and bosses are hidden in the meanders of Tartarus, the huge structure to explore in the Dark Hours, and for the more experienced players it is even possible to select a really difficult bonus difficulty level: in fact, the excellent combat-system is back practically unchanged, with the same general orders to be given to the party while having full control only of the protagonist. Between summoned Personas and increasingly bizarre ~spells~, devastating combined attacks and ~One more!~ (exploiting the weak point of the enemies you get a bonus round but, be careful, the same goes for the opponents!) A new, welcome gem of Persona 3 FES also stands out: the possibility of changing the protagonists' clothes. Confronting a possessed doll by shooting a revolver in the head while wearing a bikini? Well now you can. Of shadows, schools, tarot cards and other amenities Things change a bit in The Answer, where the adventure calendar structure leaves more room for exploration of the Abyss of Time and combat. It's a somewhat unsettling change of pace, given that the emphasis placed on level-up is much greater, but it's certainly a choice that makes The Answer something more than a simple ~more of the same~. The difficulty of the ~sequel~ is truly remarkable and players will have to use all their strategic skills to come to terms with the power of the enemies and the low possibility of healing: although it is possible to start the game directly from The Answer, we naturally recommend that you tackle the main adventure first.It must be said that however Persona 3 FES was originally released in Japan as an ~append-disk~, a sort of expansion, that is, which included only the sequel on the optical medium: the splendid package reworked for the American and European version therefore does not hide the limitations of The Answer, which for example does not allow access to the Persona Compendium on which we worked so hard during The Journey.Even with these restrictions, The Answer is a satisfactory epilogue, both from a narrative point of view that I play, and at the end of the whole story Persona 3 can be defined, as a whole, a truly complete game. Style matters Certainly Persona 3 does not compete from a technical point of view with other products available for PlayStation 2 such as Final Fantasy XII or Dragon Quest: while remaining graphically inferior, however, the Atlus title makes its peculiar style a workhorse, remaining unquestionably very pleasant. The character design, for example, so typically Japanese, is refined and clean, both in the case of the various characters and of the Personas, increasingly disturbing and bizarre. The polygonal transposition of the artwork is good, especially in the very fluid animations, and the fights are small fireworks displays of light effects and artwork that invade the screen. The various locations, especially in the real world, are very detailed and peculiar, remaining faithful to the Japanese setting. The animated sequences are numerous and splendid, both in terms of design and in terms of animations. The musical accompaniment has remained original and atypical: the often sung jazz and hip-hop songs return to act as a background to the events, even if there is a smaller variety of songs in The Answer, certainly due to the more tragic and oppressive atmosphere . The excellent dubbing in English - unfortunately Persona 3 has not been translated into Italian even in the texts - closes the circle. Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 FES is available for PlayStation 2. Comment Persona 3 FES already distinguishes itself from the splendid cover: it is not the typical swashbuckling JRPG with an intricate love-story and a megalomaniac who wants to conquer the world. The story is much more complex than it appears, the tone is decidedly darker and the themes mature and bizarre. If one can really move a flaw, it is the lack of dungeons to explore as in the canonical RPGs, but there is so much to do between one raid and another that it fades into the background. You are truly captivated by the splendid characters and a brilliant and profound combat system, by the variety and customization possibilities thanks to the over 150 Personas available and the Social Link mechanics. A budget price for a splendid RPG, its sequel and guaranteed longevity? There was talk of the best JRPG of the last generation: in all likelihood, it is Persona 3 FES. Pros Amazing plot in both modes Deep, complex and truly long-lived Original both in style and mechanics Cons At times very difficult The Answer mode is a bit limited Completely in English There has been a lot of debate lately about which JRPG to incense as the best exponent of the genre in the last videogame generation. Everyone agrees that the reference platform for Japanese Role Playing Games has been PlayStation 2, but it's more difficult to assign the golden palm to a particular title. Final Fantasy XIII? Dragon Quest VIII? Xenosaga? A title that may have gone a little quiet, but which has received enormous acclaim from critics and audiences all over the world, was Persona 3 by Atlus. Following a bilogy initially released on PSOne, Persona 3 belongs to the fluctuating Shin Megami Tensei series, which in the past has given us excellent titles (this is the case of Digital Devil Saga) and truly mediocre products (Devil Summoner) and which has always been characterized by a decidedly dark, disturbing and mature visual and narrative style. Of Persona 3 we have already exhaustively discussed a few months ago, but Persona 3 FES is not a simple sequel ...", "date": "2008-12-10", "grade": null}
