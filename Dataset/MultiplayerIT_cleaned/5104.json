One night the girl is awakened by a noise and she follows its origin, finding herself speaking to a light that transmits a message from the world of magic and warns her of an imminent threat. The initial scenario acts as a hub for the various missions, which Shantae can access by visiting her friend Sky and being carried in the air by her enormous bird, Wrench, to reach new destinations that are unlocked as the story progresses. Once in place, the action takes on the characteristics of a traditional horizontal scrolling platformer, with hordes of enemies to be fought using the classic ~hair blow~ of the heroine or some magic learned along the way, objects to find and huge bosses to defeat. The latter undoubtedly represent one of the strengths of the game: in all cases they boast disproportionate dimensions, a particularly successful design and well-differentiated attack patterns, which must be learned from time to time to avoid taking damage and understand when and how to retaliate . Shantae: Half-Genie Hero is a title capable of thrilling fans of the WayForward series Music and colors The initial stages of Shantae: Half-Genie Hero are exciting: the colorful graphics, the excellent use of cel shading, the particularly fluid animations of the characters and the extraordinary soundtrack, also enriched by a sung song, draw an exceptional picture, which involves and turns a blind eye to the implications of some concessions that the developers wanted to make to the ~old school~. We are talking about elements such as the lack of a map and clear indications, which inevitably create dead moments in which one does not know exactly what to do and where to go, while the indications of a character who is in Scuttle Town can be so helpful like not suggesting anything useful. This must be viewed within the broader framework of a structure that makes massive use of backtracking: new scenarios have to be conquered with difficulty, but more often than not one has to go back to already well-trodden paths (however, encountering the same identical enemies inside them) to interact with certain NPCs or to find hidden objects, the identification of which is closely linked to the transformations in our possession. One of the key factors of the gameplay of Shantae: Half-Genie Hero is in fact the dance that the girl-genie can perform and which allows her to take on various forms, all of course to be unlocked during the adventure: a little monkey capable of climbing walls, an elephant who is not afraid of gusts of wind and can destroy certain barriers, a little mouse who can sneak inside tiny ducts, a mermaid who can swim freely in the water, a spider who can adhere to ceilings and even a 'harpy who flies by flapping her wings, whose abilities will come in handy especially in the final stages of the campaign. Level design lesson The system developed by WayForward is solid and coherent, interfacing powers and level design to give us those situations in which we are faced with a narrow passage, a wall or a stream in a scenario, but only after having acquired a certain skill, one understands how it is possible to overcome them. Also in terms of quotations there is something to get excited about: the little monkey who does the wall kick to move from one wall to another in the absence of platforms is reminiscent of the protagonist of Guacamelee!, a couple of bosses clearly refer to the rotating tower of the classic Castle of Illusion and the harpy's inertial flight mechanism, as well as the stage where this ability is put to full use, reference the ruthless mobile game Flappy Bird. Of course, at first it is not very easy to deal with the structure of some locations, in particular those with vertical development, which appear quite bizarre and which must be explored several times in order to make a mental map of them. In general, however, the internships are a bit few (six, in addition to the main hub) and the forced backtracking gives the idea of a gimmick designed solely to lengthen the duration of a campaign that ends within five hours or even less, where you decide to use a special power that allows you to skip entire portions of the scenario at the same time. Completed the game(which offers at least two different endings) it will be possible to relive the adventure with Hero Mode or, with an update coming soon, play as Risky Boots and therefore use his skills instead of those of Shantae. The hard life of a half-genius The concessions to the ~old school~ we mentioned above extend to the general degree of difficulty of the game, which in its platform mechanics can be truly ruthless, often generating episodes of burning frustration. However, the same does not happen for the fights, which turn out to be mostly trivial: eliminating standard enemies requires a single ~hair~ shot, but the possibility of enhancing Shantae's attacks and resistance by purchasing certain items in the Scuttle Town shop makes even the confrontation with the toughest opponents quite simple. The progression in this sense does not go hand in hand with the degree of challenge: although it is a bit difficult at the beginning, once you have collected all the additional hearts for the energy bar and with the inventory full of potions it will be possible face even the toughest bosses without fearing their attacks too much. Together with the heavy backtracking, these are aspects that inevitably limit the enjoyment of Shantae: Half-Genie Hero, but which are compensated by the undoubted strengths of the WayForward production: the excellent graphics in cel shading (which runs at true 4K on PC maintaining the 60 frames per second without problems, as it was legitimate to expect), the extraordinary soundtrack (although subject to becoming repetitive) and the solid and competent gameplay, which intertwines with the level design to deliver us a platform experience maybe not perfect but certainly worthy of great consideration if you appreciate the genre and this franchise in particular.", "date": "2017-01-03", "grade": "8.0"}
