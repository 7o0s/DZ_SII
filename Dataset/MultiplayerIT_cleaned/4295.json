The title without numbering could be misleading, but we are not dealing with a synthesis of the trilogy created by the German team Fishlabs, but with a simple conversion of the third episode, released on iOS and Android between the end of 2016 and the beginning of 2017. On the occasion of the landing on the console, some important changes were naturally made, above all the original free-to-play system, with its systematic limitations, was replaced by a normal premium model for 19.99 euros. At the same time, however, the mechanics and the game structure felt the blow, leaving those who had had the opportunity to try the excellent experience on mobile a little disoriented. The matter is complex and disregards the production value, because when a certain title is designed for use on the go, often impromptu, piloted by touch controls, many things are consequently adapted to the context and it is not easy, not to say that it is impossible, to reformulate these aspects when dealing with a different platform, mostly home. The challenge faced by Manticore on Switch was therefore not trivial, and the final result clearly testifies to it. Molasses galaxy The protagonist of Manticore - Galaxy on Fire is a cunning space pilot who suddenly finds himself adrift, attacked by a team of pirates. Rescued in extremis by two mercenaries in the pay of the Manticore, a huge merchant ship, he is introduced to the head of the shack and joins the team, immediately setting to work with an escort mission. Unfortunately in the middle of the journey there is an unprecedented attack by unknown forces, with a weapon of mass destruction that wipes out most of our colleagues and tears an entire planet to pieces. The scenario therefore changes drastically, and our goal during the long campaign becomes that of identifying those responsible for the operation, eliminating fearsome mercenaries one by one until we reach their mandates. The structure is quite simple and linear, with escort or exploration missions culminating in a series of dogfights until the final confrontation with a boss. Once the most powerful enemy has been defeated, we will be able to stay within the area in search of collectibles useful for speeding up the crafting of upgrades, return to the base to spend the experience points earned with upgrades or quickly launch towards the next objective. The formula also works well on Nintendo Switch, but there is no doubt that in the original vision, also thanks to the ~slowdowns~ due to the freemium model and a shorter and more fragmented setting, the atmospheres and general experience of Manticore - Galaxy on Fire were more engaging and interesting. In fact, the absence of constraints allows you to ring mission after mission, revealing the banality of a challenge that with the physical controls is all too accessible, but also and above all a rather repetitive gameplay. However, the latter does not find comfort in the effective yield of the battles, which communicate the impacts in an inconsistent way and therefore return little satisfaction when we manage to score the shots necessary to take out the opponent on duty. The stars scream Designed to last, as is often the case with freemium productions, the Manticore - Galaxy on Fire campaign includes over thirty missions within three different space sectors, and even taking into account the brevity of each stage, it will take a few hours to complete the game . If the narrative component is interesting but not irresistible and the action is spoiled by the basic repetitiveness we mentioned earlier, there is no doubt that the progression in terms of upgrades, weapons and ships has its reason, allowing us to radically change approach depending on the equipment and vehicle selected. The default ship represents the traditional balanced choice, but in the course of history we will be able to unlock faster and more agile solutions or slow but devastating ones, ideal for dealing with different situations. The banality of space combat can be mitigated by initially raising the level of difficulty, and in this way the experience of the Fishlabs title actually takes on slightly more lively outlines, but as already mentioned, the original sin of this production lies in its having been designed for a very different type of use. From a technical point of view, the sixty frames per second are certainly appreciated both in docked and portable mode, withthe resolution that passes respectively from 1080p to 720p, but in the first case there are quite evident drops in the frame rate when abruptly changing direction or during the most messed up fights. Projected onto a 4K screen, the polygonal modeling turns out to be generic, with mediocre effects and scenarios that unfortunately lack variety, limiting themselves to proposing spatial panoramas that are always very similar to each other. The music is excellent, ~epic~ enough, while the English dubbing seemed to us without infamy or praise.", "date": "2018-04-23", "grade": "6.5"}
