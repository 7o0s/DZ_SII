Making Virginia was a strange and surprising experience. We hope that the result is an equally strange and surprising game~: in these few lines, the London studio Variable State has summarized the almost two and a half years it took to complete Virginia, a surreal thriller adventure with a first-person view. The main touchstones, in terms of content, are Twin Peaks and the X-Files series. In the recent past we have already seen other titles try to reduce the playful component to a minimum in order to pursue purely narrative objectives, think for example of Gone Home, Everybody's Gone to the Rapture or Firewatch. However, Virginia prefers a unique approach of its kind: to tell an interactive story with a cinematic cut without resorting to any dialogue. In this way a purely visual representation is enhanced, where the editing and modulation of the soundtrack play a crucial role. Virginia is a one-of-a-kind adventure and is open to multiple interpretations The Torments of Anne Tarver We are in the summer of 1992 and the disappearance of a boy in a small Virginia community prompts the FBI to take up the case. Anne Tarver is instructed to go to the town of Kingdom to carry out the first investigations in the company of agent Maria Halperin. The external investigation is only one side of the coin, because in the meantime Anne is assigned to monitor the movements of her colleague, who apparently has something to hide. We first meet the protagonist as she observes herself in the mirror of a toilet, betraying a worried look. A tip of lipstick on the lips, one last look to check that everything is in order and off we go. After crossing the threshold, a long corridor with bright red walls leads Anne towards a small queue of people, just as the background music conveys a growing sense of looming. We soon find her on a stage crowded with boisterous journalists. Not even the time to contextualize the scene and you are already taken elsewhere, along a corridor and a new door to cross. A few moments later Anne sees herself lifeless on the bed, while another door appears behind her dominated by a penetrating red light. The alarm rings and we understand that it was a dream, the first of a long series. The creator and screenwriter Jonathan Burroughs has tried to tell Anne's story by basing the entire narrative system on the deduction and interpretation of gestures, images and signals from the surrounding environment. In doing so, the plot soon takes on a very particular consistency, ranging between abstract references, purely psychological projections of the protagonist and sudden changes of plan that end up generating uncertainty and a growing form of unease in the observer. Playstation 4 trophies Virginia's eighteen Trophies are among the most cryptic we've ever seen in a video game. To unlock them you need to interpret their meaning. Interactive editing The events of Virginia take place over a single week, although the story does not follow a linear path. What is most striking is the way in which the editing of the scenes has been organized, in many ways unexpected if you think of a video game. The frequent changes of context and the use of the camera make it particularly similar to cinematographic representations, also by virtue of a truly bare-bones interactive component. In Virginia it never happens to cross a scenario in its entirety, one is transported without stopping from one portion of the story to another, with rapid passages that fragment the actions performed by the user. The result is an alienating effect, focused on cuts and abbreviations of the scenes that favor exclusively the narration. In this way, many more places are crossed and many different contexts are experienced in rapid succession, following a rhythm that is almost never set by the player. The effectiveness of the representation is supported by a soundtrack capable of effectively supporting the communicative dynamism of the work. The continuous changes of rhythm and tone allow you to frame with greater lucidity what is happening on the screen, becoming aware of the state of mind that crosses the psyche of the protagonist and of the other characters who revolve around her. The musical part, created by the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra and recorded at the Smecky Music Studios, is thereforei of fundamental importance in guiding the observation and interpretation of what happens on the screen. As we have said, the interaction has been deliberately reduced to a minimum, all you have to do is activate a trigger sequence by taking objects, opening doors or addressing other individuals. While inspired by graphic adventures, space for space exploration is almost completely absent. In fact, the player is led by the hand from start to finish, with the sole objective of understanding and reconstructing all the narrative pieces. Contrary to what happens elsewhere - let's think for example of the works of Telltale - in Virginia there are not even moral choices useful for directing events in one way rather than another: everything has already been predetermined by the script and the user assumes an almost analogous to the movie spectator. At the same time the subjective view allows to increase the involvement and one's degree of participation in the events described and in the main themes of the work, developed around concepts such as friendship and loyalty. The disappearance of the boy and the rural context where he is projected soon fade into the background, since the real relationship that wants to be investigated is the one that binds Anne to her colleague Maria Halperin. The result is precisely a journey with very marked psychological connotations and with evident authorial ambitions. Unfortunately, the graphic quality has proved to be fluctuating, betraying frequent drops in fluidity, motion sickness phenomena and insufficient expressiveness of the characters.", "date": "2016-09-26", "grade": "8.0"}
