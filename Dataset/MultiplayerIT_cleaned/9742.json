NBA 2K11, which counts on the presence of the greatest basketball player of all time, His Majesty Michael Jordan, in fact seems to have smoothed out the defects of the past 2010 edition and is therefore able to make users relive the beauty of this sport in its entirety . But let's proceed in order. Also this year the product offers a great variety of game modes. It is difficult to list them all without going too far into the article, so in this review we will focus on those that in our view are the most interesting. We therefore have those called Season, Association, My Player and Michael Jordan to which we will dedicate a separate chapter later. The first, as the word itself says, is the canonical one that allows you to play the entire NBA championship until you win the title. The second, which then represents the highlight of the production of the US software house given that it is the most complete, instead consists in interpreting the role of General Manager in a team chosen from among those available in the large roster of the product, managing it both from administrative and technical point of view. The big basketball In the role of this manager, the user can then organize his own technical staff by choosing the coach, athletes and talent scouts to unleash around the USA in search of young budding champions, or even establish the team's weekly rhythm by planning day after day the training or rest phases. It can also deal with the negotiation of contracts, renewals and transfers taking into account the real rules of the federation, such as the salary cap imposed on the various teams on the signing of players, and the improved ability of the opposing managers managed by the artificial intelligence of the video game. The transfer window also features an up-to-date NBA draft, with instant sales, dynamic participation, and an easy-to-use trade finder. In addition to the normal role of supervisor of marketing, sales and operational activities, the gamer can also devise schemes, strategies and then physically guide the team on the pitch by playing normally. Otherwise he can easily simulate and go directly to the final result of the various races. In these phases, the updated NBA Today 2.0 function should be highlighted, which thanks to the internet connection that the game makes extensive use of in all its aspects, allows you to always have news and statistics from the real world and the season at your fingertips NBA news, as well as those relating to the virtual championship played by the player, with references to previous games, ad hoc discussions at halftime and mid-game footage that summarize the best actions of your team. Speaking of online, a brief parenthesis: we've had the opportunity to play a few games on the servers dedicated to the game, and we can say that they are more numerous and better performing than in the past year. Although when we tested the version of the game in our possession the servers were obviously not clogged as they could be these days after the launch of the product in Europe. Returning to the analysis of the game, it is once you take the field that NBA 2K11 shows the best of itself and all the splendid work done by the developers to smooth out the defects of the past edition, starting with a greater usability of the many options thanks to the introduction comfortable and easy to manage menus. Fiction or reality? Like those that allow you to choose your preferred level of difficulty without wasting time with sliders and various settings (however present and usable separately if you want). Several refinements and improvements made here and there even during the races, sometimes imperceptible immediately, which made the action and playability much more fluid than the 2010 version. Starting from the numerous new movements practicable by virtual athletes on the field, to the dozens of parameters that characterize them and the new artificial intelligence that manages them and allows them to perform logical actions, practically equal to those that their respective real counterparts would do. It is now difficult to see a player who in the last seconds of a game waste time, for example dribbling or passing the ball to his teammates rather than attempting a desperate shot for the basket, or who, unbalanced by a defender, remains more or less immobile without trying to manta raysbalance and try another play. The search for physical contact, the propensity for possession of the ball, the commitment made until the end are just some of the key elements characterizing the work of the various teams. Each match consequently has a story of its own not only because, as in reality, there are several factors that will influence the course of events (quality and physical form of the players in the squad, absences, luck, user skill, etc.) but also for the ability of the AI of the coaches managed by the CPU to be able to ~read~ the matches in turn and to change strategies and schemes accordingly at the moment. To be clear, playing against the Los Angeles Lakers is decidedly different from challenging the San Antonio Spurs but also playing several times against the same opponents is never the same. In short, the times in which having learned an effective scheme it could be applied successfully in every match seem to be over. There are also many improvements in the control system starting with the passages that can be directed as desired using the right analog stick. Alternatively you can use the normal method of passing with X or that of the icons that indicate the various companions. Also using the levers you can perform a myriad of actions from shots from below to those in suspension, to dunks, to supports as well as some special shooting feints to be used via a modifier. Xbox 360 goals There are fifty goals available in NBA 2K11, distributed in both single player and multiplayer modes. Most are obtained with progression in Career mode, others are certainly more interesting and particular, such as the one that requires us to be chosen in the 1st round of the NBA draft in My player or create your own custom Air Jordan shoes or win 20 ranked matches. Continuous action Speaking of feints, the pass that can also be implemented from a standstill returns, the first touches and the movement of the athletes with their backs to the basket have been further improved. Although the dribbling system is more realistic and reactive than ever thanks also to the IsoMotion, unbalancing the opponent or overcoming the defenses with sudden shots, throws and counter-attacks is very difficult given the recalibration of the collision management which tends to enhance more than the recent past the physical game. The athletes appear more solid than those of NBA 2K10, and therefore to overcome them you need good timing and a careful evaluation of the action in progress, without too much improvisation. But when in the end after a lot of training you manage to perform a splendid alley-oop with your partner who jumps, catches the ball passed on the fly and dunks it or places it on the basket, it is an incredible satisfaction. Furthermore, the directional cross is no longer used to recall the schemes, but the upper back keys of the pad are used respectively on the right to highlight the icons of the teammates to whom to pass the ball and on the left to quickly select the play to be performed (cuts in the center , doublings, crossings, etc). On the defensive front, however, the abandonment of the block button on the ball carrier stands out in favor of a more natural defender posture on the man and which therefore allows the gamer to have greater control and dynamism in the lateral movement of the controlled athlete. In this way you have more freedom of action but the risk of letting your opponent escape increases. You always have to be reactive, attentive. The artificial intelligence takes into account the player's defensive errors and often exploits them properly to go to the basket. All it takes is a moment of distraction, losing the man you are marking or giving an incorrect marking command to the team and the omelette is done. Doublings are also much more effective, with the selection of the player to call in for more functional and efficient help. Known for the PlayStation 3 version, the game offers full support for PlayStation Move, both in the dunk competition and in regular matches: through rotational gestures and key combinations of the aforementioned controller, it is possible to perform shots, supports, feints, blocks and much more . Jordan craze One of the most interesting and certainly appreciated novelties by basketball fans in this year's edition of the Visual Concepts game is the brand new mode called Michael Jordan. In reality, NBA 2K11 starts with a huge tribute to one of the greatest basketball players ever, with a creepy introduction that ends directly with a game in which it is possible to impersonate him against Magic Johnson's Los Angeles Lakers in a truly great for basketball fanatics. Anyway in this modalty the gamer can take part in a whole series of situations related to the entire Jordan career. The session is divided into four parts: the first is called The Jordan Challenge and consists of a series of challenges to overcome that concern the ten most important moments of Michael Jordan's career from his debut among the professionals to the end, in game six of the NBA Finals against the 1998 Jazz. Each mini-game is therefore a sort of dimensional glimpse into a particular historical moment of the NBA and has the aim of recreating and making the player relive the games in which Air Jordan was decisive as a protagonist. A far from easy undertaking given that certain requests must be met to pass the various tests. For example, in the event called Arrival, the user is called to participate in the debut of the six-time MVP winner (Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award, the award given by the National Basketball Association to the best player in the finals) in the NBA dated April 20, 1986, during the playoffs, game 2, in the first round of the Eastern Conference against the highly favored Celtic, repeating more or less exactly on the virtual field what was done in reality by the champion Chicago Bulls: 63 points, at least six assists and a 50% field goal shooting. Ditto in the other challenges. Particularly interesting is also in this case the faithful reconstruction of the facts in every detail, from the commentary to the teams where the legendary figures of champions such as Magic Johnson, Ewing, Dominque, Larry Bird, Scottie Pippen, Robert Parish and Dennis Rodman stand out. Completing all ten challenges, perhaps the most interesting of the four modes related to the six-time NBA champion with Chicago is unlocked: MJ: the creation of a legend. It is a sort of special version of the career mode where the gamer plays the role of a young, talented Jordan to wean and grow in the NBA today. It will therefore be up to the user to shape the athlete's qualities, his shooting ability or his aptitude for dragging his teammates along with decisive plays, using a system for assigning skill points that can be accumulated during the game. Finally, the other two options are Classic Bulls teams where it is possible to lead the various historical formations of the Bulls and My Jordans, a feature focused on the virtual collection of the famous shoes signed by the American champion and which can be unlocked by playing. The funny thing is that these shoes don't only have a purely display function, but they can be equipped to players who, thanks to these shoes, will acquire new skills or improve their own. My player One of the strengths of last year's 2K Sports production was the My Player mode. It allowed anyone to create their own basketball alter-ego from scratch and then guide it along its climb to the top of the NBA championship. Well, this option is also present in this 2011 edition, but in an enhanced version that revolves around a new basic concept: every action, every gesture on and off the pitch made by a player generates consequences that positively or negatively affect his career. For this reason, a sort of GDR-style system has been implemented within the session which takes into account a series of statistics related to relationships with the team's management, with teammates, with the public, with the press and even with the sponsors for the individual growth of the player. Consequently, the gamer must pay attention to every single detail by behaving appropriately on the parquet and in the press room if he wants to appear on the covers of magazines or on billboards and become more and more famous. As far as the real sporting part is concerned, the competitive activity as a rookie this year starts from the Attack Athletics arena in Chicago, entirely reproduced thanks to the official license and only after having played three matches useful for impressing the scouts and therefore being chosen for the draft will be able to go to the Summer Camp, which as in last year's game can lead up to the NBA or to a career start in the NBA D-League. As if to further underline the realism of the production, Visual Concepts has also worked hard on the technical sector, improving here too a product that is already almost perfect in this sense. The visual impact with NBA 2K11 is something impressive: the players don't look real, they are, apart from some problems with the proportions of the polygonal models of some. The attention to detail borders on the obsessive: many of the athletes, as mentioned before, have custom animations, unique strokes and movements. To give greater strength to the visual impact of the game there are then the fields of", "date": "2010-10-11", "grade": "9.4"}
