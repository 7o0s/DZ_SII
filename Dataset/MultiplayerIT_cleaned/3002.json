{"name": "Namco Museum Archives Vol 1 e Vol 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/namco-museum-archives-vol-1-vol-2.html", "text": "Trying to frame a product like that of the Namco Museum Archives is somewhat complicated. Either for the fluctuating quality of the offer, or for the excessive price of the two packages: the overall experience, net of the natural emotions given by being able to play some timeless classics, is decidedly lower than expected. The amount of games contained, taking both volumes into consideration, is 22 titles, which in any case is a respectable number, even if perhaps the most logical thing to do at the end of this generation of consoles could have been to combine all the ~Museum~ titles released from the now distant 1995 to today. But so be it. The fact is that, apart from a few old blockbusters from the 8-bit era such as Galaga, Mappyland, the timeless Pac-Man and a few others, the rest of the games don't shine in quality and don't even light up the light bulbs of the memories that fans they can expect. However, from their point of view these two collections, in the hands of enthusiasts, will offer several hours of play with titles that most of them will surely remember with more than a smile. We try to sum up in the review of Namco Museum Archives Vol 1 and Vol 2. Games and content The offer of both collections therefore consists of 22 titles. Let's see it in detail: Namco Museum archives volume 1: Galaxian, Pac-Man, Xevious, Mappy, Dig Dug, The Tower of Druaga, Sky Kid, Dragon Buster, Dragon Spirit: The New Legend, Splatterhouse: Wanpaku Graffiti, and Pac-Man Championship Edition; Namco Museum archives volume 2: Galaga, Battle City, Pac-Land, Dig Dug II, Super Xevious, Mappy-Land, Legacy of the Wizard, Rolling Thunder, Dragon Buster II, Mendel Palace, and Gaplus. Games those mentioned above that for the older ones of us have a particular value. They range from RPG to platformer to shooter. There really is something for all tastes. The game selection interface is also immediate and simple, having to choose between titles by simply scrolling to the right or left. The original resampled audio always has its charm and each OST will accompany you exactly as it did in the 8-bit era. All games then have the rewind function, a feature that allows, in the event of death, to start over from a few seconds before the defeat in order to be able to try again without necessarily having to lose the elusive ~life~. In addition to this, another pleasant addition is certainly that of being able to use a filter that recalls the cathode ray tube typical of those times and the possibility of being able to save one's progress at any time. In short, there are contents to make the package pleasant, but the need for Namco (apart from the purely economic one) to divide the collections into 2 titles sold separately for about twenty euros each is not very well explained. On the other hand, each game takes up a handful of bytes which would have made it possible to insert more than 22 titles all on one disc, perhaps selling it at half the price and also including many other titles to really have a complete anthological collection. At that point yes, it would have been an attractive collection.", "date": "2020-07-16", "grade": "6.5"}
