The Infinite Dreams game is proposed as a sort of fishing adventure around different seas, in search of ever larger and rarer creatures but without disdaining even the hunt for more classic fish that can help the protagonist progress and become the most strongest in the world. Disturbing reports have come from various parts of the world: it seems that unknown creatures are emerging from the depths of the sea, spreading panic in coastal towns. These monsters of the abyss represent threats, but also great opportunities for all fishermen worthy of the name, therefore the protagonist also decides to take his boat and sail towards the places where the mysterious creatures have been sighted, but the road to go to reach the big game is decidedly long. And it really is, considering that the progression in Creatures of the Deep is not exactly expeditious, as we will see, but this is the classic case in which the experience is mainly given by the journey, and by the water to pass under the hull of our there is really a lot of nutshell, maybe too much. Beyond the narrative premises, which are somewhat concise but to tell the truth also rather useless at this juncture, the game immediately puts us on a small boat grappling with fish and mysterious wrecks to catch with a fishing line. A life for fishing Creatures of the Deep, a stage shift on the boat With a wide view from above, in Creatures of the Deep we move exclusively through a small boat (even by helicopter if necessary) looking for the ideal places to throw the line and try to catch something interesting. The basic mechanism of the gameplay is precisely that of the Animal Crossing fishing mini-game: it is a question of casting near the shadows that transpire on the surface, or the ripples of this that signal movement underwater, and position the bait to make it visible to the fish. Then we have to observe the float, and choose the right moment to start pulling with a single touch, but making sure that the hook is well planted, otherwise the fish will escape. So the gameplay is essentially focused on choosing the best places, on the sighting of creatures and the correct timing in the launch and above all in the recovery, with a few other additional elements to build a certain progression. In principle it is a mini-game extended to become a game in its own right, but there are still some characteristic elements that make up the experience. The protagonist has a progressive level that increases by carrying out specific quests, which are entrusted to us by various expert fishermen and take us around the maps in search of particular fish. These can be delivered to NPCs to advance the ~story~, but also resold in the market to obtain money useful for reaching new fishing areas and expanding the marina from which you start with other structures. Beyond the online rankings, progression is therefore mainly made up of the new possibilities that open up once you have accumulated enough money: different maps that lead to new species of fish and encounters with the largest creatures, as well as the possibility of obtaining more advanced and larger boats that allow you to expand your fishing space. Creatures of the Deep, the islet base to expand and build This last aspect is particularly annoying: the only 5 slots available to transport fish and objects are always too few and the fact that moving to the base for the sale of the fish is paid makes everything very cumbersome. Microtransactions also come into play here: Creatures of the Deep is a free-to-play game that offers the possibility of expanding various aspects of ~QoL~, such as the spaces available for fish and objects, through payment with gems, which they are rarely found in-game and can be purchased for real money. Creatures of the Deep is a very small production and this is also reflected from a technical point of view, but the choice of adopting a low poly stylization works very well to create the right atmosphere. There is great care in the creation of the sea and the transparency effects that allow the seabed to be seen, the ripples on the surface and the movement of the fish manage to convey the idea of a particularly lively world. Obviously the detailsgraphics are scarce and the great distance from which the scene is framed makes everything much simpler and sketchier, but the graphics are perfectly functional in order to stage a peaceful seafaring adventure. Also interesting is the fact of being able to see various other online players directly active on the map, even if it is not clear whether it is an actual online simultaneity or not.", "date": "2022-11-11", "grade": "6.4"}
