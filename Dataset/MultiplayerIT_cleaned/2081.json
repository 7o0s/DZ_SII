Virtua Striker 3 ver. 2002 is yes a football game, but also arcade to the bone! Those who have tried it in the arcade know very well what they are getting into. Leave Konami-style simulation aspects at home and start thinking like casual, not too busy players who play around with those strange virtual games that don't require too much gray matter but only a minimum of attention. Game strategies? Field tactics? Man markings? These unknowns In VS3 none of that exists. All you need are the three keys of the Lilliputian and very comfortable Nintendo joypad dedicated to the short pass, the long pass and the shot. In defense the only performable action is the slide. Unfortunately, if on the one hand this favors that immediacy typical of coin-ups, on the other it discourages those gamers who demand greater depth. Let's be clear, there is a lack of game elements such as running, a through ball, some ~sborone~ feints, etc. As long as it is a cabinet product, it is fine, but a home version should conform to the expectations of current gamers, perhaps with the addition of small precautions such as those mentioned above which, for sure, would have benefited the enjoyment and general depth of the title. The actions that take place in the field, then, are not the best in terms of variety and originality. In fact, most of the time we proceed along vertical paths of the field hoping for some defensive blunder by the opponent or in some favorable rebound for our attackers. The absence of beautiful football and well-set actions at Winning Eleven is felt. Here I am! Perhaps during the first few games this element remains dormant, perhaps due to the aesthetic spectacularity offered by the Amusement Vision product but then, already after a few half hours of play, the true essence of VS3 comes out into the open, i.e. a very well-finished and well-designed title accomplished but suffering from an overly arcadey and simplistic setting. Those who love these last peculiarities will find new ludic life in the game distributed by Infogrames, while the others will put away the small mini-DVD that contains it all too soon. It is also true that compared to the last episode this one enjoys a much more immediate response to the commands, but too many times it happens to see the players of your team wandering around the field without a precise destination and even out of control. The absence of a multiplayer option is also felt, especially if we take into account that in games of this kind the ~mass~ challenges are the most fun. Here it is important to remember that the only multiplayer mode present in VS3 is the 1VS1 one (i.e. player 1 against player 2). A shame The most beautiful there is! If in terms of playability VS3 ver.2002 is not free from defects, the same cannot be said at all about its cosmetics. Seeing a game is spectacular: muscular players, full of polygons, rich in detail and well defined, run far and wide on the fantastic turf that to define as almost real seems more than legitimate to me. If we then add the beauty and care placed in the construction of the stadiums (imitations of the real ones) and the public (now left to chance by too many softco ...) you get an idea of the graphic orgy that the title in question offers. But it's not over! In fact, it is important to underline the extreme fluidity with which the cubic hardware manages to manage that enormous polygonal mass, with graphic effects of all kinds. Suffice it to note the perfection of the shadows that are reflected on the ground, the fantastic light effects accompanying the polygonal surfaces and so on (note the realistic movements of the hair of some players). The only small negative notes of the technical sector are spent on the animations of the characters (not for their fluidity, always fixed on 60 fps) which seem to be too unnatural and cumbersome. In short, professional players don't have those moves! At most my neighbor, the one in his forties... But this is a small thing that only minimally affects the aesthetic quality of VS3. The rest rocks the competition! Guaranteed. Is football an endless game? Usually that of sports games (and especially football) is a genre that does not need to possess great playful skills to be enjoyable over time. In fact, it is enough to meet up with another friend or more than immediately the desire to challenge each other goes crazy until it becomes an illness. In this case, unfortunately, it is painful to notehow such a thing is not possible due to multiplayer holiday. Sacrilege! What does a football game know about in which you can challenge a friend at most? The reality is this, don't complain to me. However, the entertainment offered by VS3 stands at just sufficient levels that go into free fall after a little experience in the field. This is due to the structural limitations that require you to always maintain the same style of play to move forward in the various possible competitions. In addition to the classic modes, we find an interesting addition (only on Gamecube) that allows you to make a career as a coach of your favorite national team. This is where the rosters are formed, pre-season friendlies are faced, etc. until you get to the most decisive clashes. All this enriches the longevity of the product and certainly meets the tastes of those inclined towards the more managerial aspects of football. Also note all the subtitles in Italian in the local version which help to extricate oneself from the numerous menus that arise in the eyes of the player. Also nice is the edit mode that allows you to create small champions from scratch and make them grow in the world of international football. As for the sound aspect, VS3 doesn't convince that much. Unfortunately some choirs are too confusing, while the sound effects (apart from those of the sphere) are all taken from the old chapter. This, however, is a factor that does not weigh that much. The new VS3 ver.2002 is a title that fans of the series absolutely cannot miss. Unfortunately, being equipped with a purely ARCADE setting, it leaves anyone who wants a more simulative approach to the game of football with a bad taste in the mouth. And in any case, those who play the SEGA title know very well what they are getting into. Anyone wanting a more complex game should turn to Winning Eleven's younger brother who turns out to be the only football-loving alternative (apart from one Fifa too many...). Is football an endless game? Pros: Spectacular technically. It's a soccer game! A must for fans of the saga. Cons: Much and too much arcade.. Few possibilities of original actions. Limited time fun. Real football! Since its first incarnation in bar rooms, the Virtua Striker series has always tried to amaze the user for its resemblance (technical limitations aside) and correspondence to a real football match (at least on an aesthetic level). Obviously, if we go back in time, the aforementioned cabinet appears almost prehistoric to us, taking into account the current quality standards achieved. The fact is that in the world there are countless fans of the by now legendary most realistic and arcade football series ever. First in the arcade and now on the cube (the Nintendo one) you will finally be able to satisfy your appetite for that game that you love so much, perhaps to take the reins of the Azzurri and guide them towards victory against South Korea first and the coveted Cup of the world then (sigh never mind).", "date": "2002-06-21", "grade": null}
