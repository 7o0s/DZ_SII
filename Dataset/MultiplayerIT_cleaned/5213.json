It is certainly not the first software house to attempt a maneuver which, for better or worse, always succeeds, even without affecting the market and the collective imagination as Pikachu and the other GameFreak little monsters did. Considering that Final Fantasy is about to turn thirty, it is normal that the Japanese software house wants to celebrate the event by focusing on the universe of the franchise and not only on the highly anticipated Final Fantasy XV which will see the light - finally! - in a few weeks. In this sense, World of Final Fantasy represents the perfect spin-off: it does not aim to replace the mother series and focuses everything both on the nostalgia factor and on the tested mechanics that have made titles such as Pokmon, Digimon or Yo-kai Watch famous. Add lots of colour, a pinch of absurdity, a funny mascot, a super cute design... and voil, here is the ideal recipe for an RPG capable of captivating young and old. World of Final Fantasy is a fun and colorful spin-off that could have a great future Let's print them all! Anyone who has played the World of Final Fantasy demo released a few days ago will have gotten a decidedly wrong impression of the actual gameplay, much more sophisticated and complex than it initially appears. Mind you, World of Final Fantasy is a fairly easy title that rarely keeps the player on their toes; however, it offers a variety and dynamics that few RPGs even touch. That the Square Enix title mimics Pokmon is clear and we have already said it, but it is the game itself that ironically reminds us of it when it allows us to choose whether to fight Ifrit, Shiva or Ramuh and, therefore, to capture their ~lilichina~ version ...replicating the very popular choice of starter pokmon in various Nintendo RPGs. It almost seems like a joke, but World of Final Fantasy is everything like this: it doesn't take itself seriously and, on the contrary, plays with stereotypes without getting too paranoid. In this colorful universe almost everyone is ~lilichini~, that is small, stocky and disproportionate: in Japanese we would call them chibi. Very few are ~jiganti~ like our protagonists who, among other things, can change shape at will. The difference between jiganti and lilichini is absolutely crucial in terms of gameplay and has a profound effect on the fights and on the choice of monsters we want to take with us after having captured them... indeed, imprinted them. Individually, the various monsters and our heroes are not very powerful, so the player can organize ~stacks~ in which Lann and Reyn are based, in the form of jiganti, or as simple passengers, when they take on the liliquin form. In fact, monsters come in different sizes: there are small ones like the Mandragoras that can ride medium-sized monsters which, in turn, ride on top of the large ones; in the piles, which the player can assemble and disassemble through a simple menu, the statistics and elemental resistances of the individual units are added, therefore at a certain point it becomes important to structure the piles in the most appropriate way or even disassemble them in case of emergency to avoid that the enemy throws us off balance, making us lose precious shifts. The combat system draws on Final Fantasy's canonical Active Time Battle system but can be set so that the actions follow one another or that time stops when it's our turn to attack: at that point, we can select one of the skills belonging to the members of the our stack, consuming the Action Points that are recharged each turn. The interface is quite simple and can be customized by assigning actions to various shortcuts, but veterans will perhaps prefer to press the appropriate backbone to open a more classic and detailed menu. In any case, it is through fighting that new monsters are obtained, although perhaps we should call them by their names: mirages. Lann and Reyn can ~imprint~ them, locking them up in special magical cages, but to do so they must first meet requirements that become more and more complex as the timer hours go by. Initially it will be enough to weaken a mirage, then we will begin to have to heal them with Potions, perhaps we will first have to exploit their elemental weaknesses or make them the last targets on the field. Imprinting a mirage is a bit like throwing a PokBall: sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't, you have to try and try again, maybe one random fight after another. The simplicity of the clashes, combined with the possibility of speeding them up further by holding down a backbone, leverages the collecting spirit of the players who will find themselves scouring the areas and dungeons in search of the most iconic monsters of the saga, fromthe Tonberry to the Moogers passing through the Chocobo and the Malboro. Furthermore, each mirage can be further developed through the mirage, a menu in which to spend the points earned by fighting to unlock new skills that can be useful in battle or on the field. The dungeons, in fact, are full of small environmental or logical puzzles that guarantee a certain variety and break the rhythm of the random encounters, asking the player for a minimum of attention in choosing the mirages he intends to bring with him during exploration. Fortunately, a convenient system of portals and teleporters allows you to return to the city of Reyn and Lann to shop and change mirages, guaranteeing a certain freedom and a good immediacy whether you want to continue in the story or complete 100% % the monster collection. Playstation 4 trophies You will have to unlock 34 bronze, 12 silver and 2 gold trophies to earn the platinum one, but the undertaking will be more difficult than it seems: you will have to complete every mini-adventure, find every chest, imprint every mirage and, in general, thoroughly eviscerate World of Final Fantasy. It almost feels like Kingdom Hearts But what brings our twins to visit Grymoire, the world of lilichinos? Reyn and Lann were blissfully sitting in their town making coffee and pastries in their caf, when one fine day every other inhabitant disappears, leaving them alone with a funny little creature named Tama and a mysterious woman named Enna Kros. It turns out that Reyn and Lann have lost their memories, as the most overused of clichs have it, and that they live in a kind of limbo after losing their mirages. The only way to remember their old lives is to explore Grymoire and imprint the lost mirages, helping along the way all those who need them ... which, incidentally, some of the most famous heroes of Final Fantasy. From Princess Sarah of the first Final Fantasy to Yuna of Final Fantasy X, passing through many other more or less well-known characters, our journey into the world of Grymoire wants to be both a brand new adventure and a dive into the past of the saga. Unlike the multiverse of Kingdom Hearts, made up of separate worlds, the world of Grymoire is a single agglomeration of kingdoms and cities in which the characters we have come to love in these thirty live, outside the time and restrictions of their stories. years. Bahamut's federation casts a dark shadow over them, an army capable of using mirages in battle and aiming to conquer the world; at its top, shady figures sibylline discuss their diabolical plans by prattling about prophecies and, in general, doing their best to appear threatening without really succeeding. The storyline of World of Final Fantasy, in reality, is a bizarre mixture of stereotypes and absurdities: we have amnesias, prophecies, masked individuals and incredible twists that make your eyes roll several times, but in general we had the clear impression that the writers had a blast weaving almost any narrative device into the plot without worrying too much about logic. To be honest, the comic interludes between Tama, Reyn and Lann seem much more refined than the revealing dialogues, and the Italian translation does its best to render in our language some puns that are already complicated in English, let alone in the Japanese language. The result is an enjoyable but unpretentious story that focuses more on sketches and comic effect, without however disdaining a more serious tone when necessary that borders on the epic in the crucial moments ... however, snatching quite a few smiles every time they enter on stage curmudgeons like Cloud or Squall who try at all costs to remain very serious even in lilichina form. Fans of the series will just have to turn off their brains and enjoy this roller coaster, trying to catch all the references and quotes, both visual and musical. In this sense, the character design of Yasuhisa Izumisawa manages to find the perfect compromise between the original and irresistible style of the lilichini and the slightly more banal one of the jiganti, clearly inspired by that of Tetsuya Nomura. The carefree and colorful look of the world of Grymoire takes care of the rest, a triumph of touches of class that doesn't care about the brute power to restore the feeling of the old school JRPGs between fixed shots and isometric dungeons. World of Final Fantasy is certainly not Final Fantasy XV, but neither is it the ~low budget~ production that many expected: on the contrary, it is an extremely well-finished title both from a graphic and sound point of view. For example, the soundtrack by Masashi Hamauzu, former composer of various Final Fantasy, notis perhaps the most memorable ever, but it does its duty, even if at times it seemed a bit repetitive: in any case, a cut above other recent productions which, instead of showing us oceans of stars, left us simply indifferent.", "date": "2016-10-25", "grade": "8.5"}
