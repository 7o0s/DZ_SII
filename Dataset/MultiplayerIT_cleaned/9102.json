{"name": "Xenoblade Chronicles", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/92875-xenoblade-chronicles-cambiamo-il-futuro.html", "text": "A few weeks ago we offered you an examination of the current situation of one of the most popular genres in the videogame scene. Some software houses have tried to take advantage of the new consoles to offer something new, straying excessively from the path traced for over twenty years to the point of distorting it; others have taken a more traditional approach, crystallizing the genre to the point where they no longer arouse genuine feelings of surprise or interest in players. The common denominator of these approaches has always been a particular attention to the technical aspect, to the point of forgetting or underestimating the narrative or, even worse, the gameplay. The Monado sword Tetsuya Takahashi has chosen something in between. His name is famous for having signed some titles, such as Xenogears or the XenoSaga trilogy, which have brought decisive innovations to the genre without, however, ever being able to fully reflect the author's vision. This time, however, the talented director found himself working with a console objectively unable to compete on the technical side with more powerful machines and this limitation is probably what, ironically, made Xenoblade Chronicles the most complete and satisfying RPG of the last few years. Destiny is not written For the avoidance of doubt, Xenoblade Chronicles has nothing to do with the previous franchises developed by Monolith Soft: the original title is in fact Monado, which is the name of a sword around which the whole story revolves. The incipit is truly unprecedented: two deities battled for eons until they killed each other, becoming immense statues in the ocean. Millennia later, a different civilization has developed on each of these enormous creatures: one biological and the other technological. Items change the graphics of the characters The war between the two races seems to reach a fixed point thanks to the Monado sword, an artifact capable of injuring the otherwise invulnerable Mechon but also of progressively weakening the one who wields it. The protagonist of the story is Shulk, a young engineer from Colony 9 whose main interest is studying the Monado and understanding how it works: a sudden and unexpected siege of the Mechon forces the boy to take up the sword, acquiring its ambiguous power of foresight. Shulk will discover in spite of himself that knowing the future is not enough to change it: in search of revenge, Shulk and his friend Reyn will begin a journey which, as expected, will soon become something much more epic and important. As in the case of Takahashi's previous screenplays, Xenoblade Chronicles also offers an extremely mature and complex story, full of innuendos and meanings, in which fantasy, science fiction and spirituality are expertly mixed. The characters often interact and communicate with each other From a narrative point of view, Monolith Soft's new work is undoubtedly also the most complete: in over fifty hours of narration, incompleteness or inconsistencies are never felt and the pace of the story, told mainly through dialogue cutscenes, is homogeneous and increasingly pressing. The characters that will accompany Shulk on his journey are beautifully drawn and interact with each other in a timely and convincing way, making for a cohesive and diverse cast. A somewhat atypical, blatantly Anglo-Saxon dubbing contributes to personalizing the protagonists and enemies, probably due to the completely European localization (the game, remember, was not released in America). While it is true that some voices can appear a little understated, purists can easily solve the problem by activating the original Japanese voice acting from the options menu - the first in a long series of touches of class that characterize the experience. For those who know less English, Xenoblade Chronicles offers a well-kept Italian adaptation in the written texts. Shulk and Reyn arrive on the Plains of Gaur, the ~knee~ of the Bionis Shulk's Travels The care taken by Takahashi's team in the creation of the Xenoblade Chronicles universe is literally felt at every step, since it is on foot that we will have to travel the vast regions that make up the bodies of the sleeping deities. It is a feeling of majestic freedom: each area is truly immense and geographically rich and complex, dotted with streams, lakes, waterfalls, mountains, caves and colonies. The variety and vastness leave you breathless but it is not something that players less accustomed to exploration can worry about, since getting lost in Xenoblade Chronicles is practically impossible: an indicator always shows the direction to take to progress in the story and you can take advantage of some special points of interestto ~teleport~ instantly from one place to another, minimizing the distances to travel. Adventurers, on the other hand, will have bread for their teeth because each area offers nooks and crannies to discover and there is always a reward, a new enemy to face, a quest to complete, an object to collect. Nothing is left to chance. Many of the views are truly breathtaking The small luminescent objects scattered around the map can be archived in an encyclopedia in exchange for items or sold or given to your companions to increase the affinity of the group and the quantity and variety of creatures scattered around the map, easily avoidable if you don't want to fight, helps to increase the sensation of being in a living and complex world, thanks also to the random atmospheric variations and to a detailed day/afternoon/evening/night cycle which modifies the lighting around us but also the fauna and the presence of NPCs. Even the music is situational and the soundtrack composed by the collaboration of Yasunori Mitsuda, Yoko Shimomura and Manami Kiyota is one of the best we've heard in recent years: epic, majestic, emotional and always spot on, from the evocative music track of the menu to the wonderful song that accompanies the end credits. Xenoblade Chronicles is a living and ever-changing universe and the Monolith Soft team has squeezed the technical capabilities of Nintendo Wii to a level never seen before: the settings are very rich in details and particulars, with a boundless visual horizon that further expands the vastness of the environment and a play of colors and lighting that compensates for the fluctuating quality of the textures and the discreet polygon count of monsters and characters. The artistic direction is valuable, just think that even the equipment changes the appearance of the characters and the same object takes on a different shape depending on the character who wears it. Realistically, the overall magnificence achieved by Xenoblade Chronicles makes the technical limits of the Nintendo Wii irrelevant, especially when you get involved in the complex game mechanics. Power to variety It goes without saying that during the adventure we will have to face tons of enemies, not only the Mechons that threaten the people of Bionis but also monsters and animals of all kinds. Many of them will simply graze without caring about us, while others could attack us: whether it is you or the enemy who engage in battle, no loading or transition awaits you. The clash takes place in real time and involves up to three party members, but the player will be able to directly control only one. During battle, each character will repeatedly use a basic automatic attack and will have a series of skills, called Artes, with both offensive and defensive effects. The clashes are dynamic and many Artes require a specific positioning to have maximum effectiveness, therefore a certain planning is necessary which involves some parameters borrowed from other videogame genres, such as the aggro which determines the character towards which the enemy will be directed . Each character has three ~specializations~ which essentially distinguish his role in battle based on the passive skills acquired: these specializations can be changed at will, the same character can therefore concentrate on healing his companions or on the damage inflicted on the enemy if necessary. The dynamic combat system requires planning and timing Combining the specializations of the characters, which moreover can be mixed based on their mutual affinity, and the enhancement of the Artes available, it is clear that Xenoblade Chronicles presents a very high level of customization, further deepened by the possibility of creating or finding gems to set in the equipment, granting additional bonuses. During the fights the affinity between the characters plays a not indifferent role since our heroes will exhort each other, strengthening and helping each other when necessary: the fights therefore become a pyrotenic exhibition of strategy and special attacks that takes a few hours to be completely assimilated , to then give enormous satisfaction. In all this ambaradan, the role of the Monado is also actively inserted, whose prophetic visions are translated into gameplay through a very original feature that suddenly shows us the ~future~ and an attack with which the enemy is about to hit the players. Within a matter of seconds the player can use the skills related to the Monado to counter the attack, for example by producing a mystical protection that renders it ineffective, effectively changing thefuture shown by the weapon. A touch of class that makes the boss fights even more exciting. A reason to fight Xenoblade Chronicles has an enormous advantage, in general, and that is to be a jRPG that winks even at those who don't particularly like the genre, offering a mix of innovations and improvements that make it, above all, fun and suitable for all types of user. Those who want to find out immediately how the story will evolve will be able to follow the clear indications on the map to unlock a new area or a new event, those who prefer to hesitate or upgrade the characters will be able to enjoy solving the dozens of quests proposed in each area by NPCs that appear at different times of the day. The ominous Metal Face will be the reason that will push Shulk to leave Colony 9 Sidequests are completely optional and are not entirely dissimilar to the typical MMORPG fetch quests: kill these enemies, collect those items, find this material and so on. They are simple and quick side missions, perhaps not explained in a particularly detailed way in the special menu, but which can be solved at any time to earn money, items and experience points. By solving the quests we will also increase our affinity with the inhabitants of the various agglomerations, earning further bonuses. Between rebuilding the colonies, finding rare and unique monsters, completing the encyclopedia, unlocking the various Achievements designed specifically for the game and improving the characters and their affinity, there is really a lot to do and there is certainly no lack of variety. Xenoblade Chronicles isn't even a difficult game, or rather, it's not a game that punishes the player for his mistakes: the battles can become quite complex, yet you don't risk unpleasant Game Overs and loss of progress, because after a defeat you he will find himself comfortably at the beginning of the area or at the closest landmark. And in case you have a mishap in the middle of a dungeon? No problem, you can save whenever you want and at any time. Takahashi and his team have been very attentive to what is now considered obsolete in the structure of the genre, improving it without distorting it, making a real evolution without setting aside the usual care for storytelling that has always distinguished them.", "date": "2011-09-09", "grade": "9.6"}
