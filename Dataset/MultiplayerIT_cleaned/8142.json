However, the holy patience of the faithful was rewarded by the rich launch offer of the newborn Wii U, including some top-of-the-range products that have inflamed the hearts of gamers from all over the world in recent months. And among the various Batman: Arkham City, Assassin's Creed III and Call of Duty: Black Ops II obviously Mass Effect 3 could not be missing, one of the strongest candidates to win the crown of best game of the year. So let's see how you live the epic of Commander Shepard on the new Nintendo console. Gamepad or datapad? As etiquette dictates for articles concerning Wii U conversions, we refer you to the review, video review and superdirect of the original incarnations of Mass Effect 3 to find out everything there is to know about the final chapter of the trilogy. To those who fall within the profile outlined at the beginning, and who therefore have not had the opportunity to play the two previous chapters, BioWare has dedicated two sops, attaching the DLC From Ashes and the Extended Cut with the expanded ending as well as an interactive comic to the package selectable following the creation of the character, which performs two important tasks: first of all, it provides a sufficiently exhaustive background on the events of the first and second episode, and also allows the user to make some decisions that will change more or less markedly the premises of the adventure that will be faced. A solution that certainly cannot put Wii U users on the same level as all those who have been able to follow Shepard's path firsthand, but which with its approximately twenty minutes of duration allows at least to recover lost ground without fear of miss the central nodes of the plot. From a technical point of view, however, the differences with the Xbox 360 and PS3 counterparts are absolutely negligible and in no way affect the enjoyment of the experience. On the sound front, the same excellent qualities can be appreciated in terms of musical accompaniment and dubbing; as far as the graphics are concerned, no particular points of detachment are noticed, and fortunately the product does not suffer from the frame rate drops highlighted by other conversions of third-party titles, placing itself in terms of performance halfway between the excellent 360 version and the mediocre PS3. In what is one of the most fascinating features of these first steps of Wii U, Mass Effect 3 can also be played by displaying it on the GamePad screen in case you are forced to use the TV for other purposes: the effect is remarkable, but obviously the advice is to take advantage of the conventional setup in order to be able to enjoy the advantages of the integrated touchscreen. In fact, during the action, the controller screen hosts a comfortable map of the scenario, complete with the position of the enemies and also icons relating to the skills of the allies, with the latter who can be moved to certain points through simple touches: all features which certainly do not revolutionize the gameplay of the product, but which still represent a pleasant added value that can help make the game smoother. Still in terms of controller, its good performance in the field of pure and simple ergonomics should be noted, especially as regards the use of the back buttons, while the somewhat distant position of the two analog sticks could require a few minutes of adaptation in plus: nothing that makes you want to use a Pro Controller, however supported by the title. Mass Effect 3 on Wii U also easily passes the online test, showing off agile multiplayer management without particular problems as regards connectivity and matchmaking. In short, it would be an exaggeration to define this version as the absolute best of all those available, but certainly the work done by Straight Right was serious and better than other esteemed colleagues: the interesting but not excessively deep exploitation of the touchscreen therefore constitutes the only true hallmark of the title on the new Nintendo console, sufficient to please users who have never met Shepard and his companions but which in no way justifies the purchase for anyone who has already played this third chapter elsewhere. The only big problem, in hindsight therefore, is linked to that certain ~Mass Effect Trilogy~ practically released in contemporanea on Pc, Xbox 360 and PS3, which offers all three games in the series for around the same price, with all due respect to Wii U users.", "date": "2012-12-04", "grade": "8.4"}
