After a three-year break, the guys from Qubic Games are back to work, moreover on a system, Nintendo 3DS, which should lend itself much better to the proposed game formula; this objective advantage and the experience gained so far effectively make AiRace Speed a product that should not be underestimated at all in the wide and varied eShop panorama. So let's go into the claustrophobic tunnels of the title and see why it could be for you. The Need for F-Zero The first title of the series saw us in the cockpit of futuristic flying cars grappling with other competitors to be defeated with blows and various weapons in open arenas, while with the shortly following Tunnel the emphasis shifted to the Time Trial, with complicated and fraught with obstacles to be tackled at high speeds in the shortest time possible. AiRace Speed confirms the formula of the second chapter, however, making it more varied: a large part of the game still takes place in narrow and science-fiction tunnels, but these alternate with large open spaces and assorted bifurcations; moreover, this time we are faced with real circuits, to be covered for several laps. The levels add up to a total of 18, of which 3 have a different goal, which is to cover as much distance as possible without exploding, instead of beating the fastest time. Explode, of course, because each aircraft (five in all with different characteristics, but there is no choice, the game forces you to use a precise one in a given circuit) is equipped with an energy bar which is consumed at each contact with seabed elements; a front instead means immediate explosion, and the restart from the last checkpoint. Lacking any competitor driven by the CPU (and for that matter also by a human being, multiplayer is completely absent), it is clear that we are not dealing with a driving game in the strict sense, and more than on driving skills - that even at first they are important, since the approach with the spacecraft, each equipped with its own ~physics~, is not exactly very immediate - you have to count on lightning-fast reflexes and the ability to memorize the sequences of curves, obstacles and bifurcations well. The fact that AiRace Speed is not a real driving game is confirmed to us by the controls, which provide for automatic acceleration: the ship takes off by itself as soon as the countdown ends, and always by itself it keeps itself on a comfortable cruising speed which is around 300 km/h on average. The player is given the possibility, in addition to directing it (three options in this sense: two with the stick, normal and inverted, and one even via the touch screen, which is not recommended because it is much less comfortable and immediate) and to perform a semi-roll left and right to avoid certain obstacles, manage the brakes and the all-important nitro. With the simple standard speed, in truth, you could easily complete everything without too many worries; despite being nominally high, the sensation that derives from it is not that adrenaline-pumping and you have plenty of time to calmly navigate the various tracks, perhaps just applying the brakes here and there. However, it would be like denying the beauty of AiRace Speed, that is to say conquering the silver and gold stars corresponding to the fast times proposed by the programmers, and perhaps bragging about one's deeds on the online leaderboards. AiRace Speed is a fast, frantic and adrenaline-pumping ~trial and error~. The 3D effect Quite controversial to judge. In fact, the stereoscopic effect adds depth and spectacularity to an action that already makes a great show of it, directly and positively influencing the feeling between game and player. However, it seems to us that the fallout on fluidity is quite heavy: it does not affect playability in any way, but it is noticeable enough. Obviously it is a question of carrying out a couple of tests to verify which side of the trade-off is more acceptable; nothing dramatic, but we have seen titles no less demanding on the machine that performed better in this area. Explosions of joy By activating the nitro, which has no limitations on use or duration, the music changes: the sensation of speed increases exponentially and managing the nervous shuttle in increasingly convoluted tunnels full of obstacles becomes much more complicated. It is here that the true heart of AiRace Speed comes out, i.e. a sort of frenetic cross between racing and ~trial and error~, in search, as per the best eShop tradition, of the highest score, which inthis case becomes the lowest tempo. And obviously, the greater the difficulty, the greater the satisfaction and exaltation for a series of perfect evolutions carried out at great speed. Difficult, of course, but fortunately never frustrating: explosions will not fail, especially during the first approaches to a certain circuit, but as the checkpoints are positioned generously enough along the way (except for the 3 ~special~ tracks mentioned above) it will rarely happen having to redo very long stretches. However, the explosion carries a time penalty, and therefore remains an eventuality to be avoided at all costs. In short, we are facing the classic title for digital delivery which compensates with the difficulty and the spasmodic search for perfection to the inevitable limitations dictated by dimensions and costs that must remain contained, and consequently the more enjoyment you will derive from AiRace Speed the more willing you are. to enter his spirit; in reality the contents are not even scarce, as we said there are 18 circuits that become longer and more complicated, but the fairly continuous repetition of different typical situations and the lack of any competition other than the stopwatch could leave the door open to boredom and loss of initial enthusiasm for all those who do not like to repeat a given challenge to exhaustion in order to be able to complete it without any flaws at the end. A few words to finish on the technical component: the graphics are decent, well done but which suffer from a certain monotony as regards textures and elements of the backdrop. Its main advantage is certainly the great speed it manages to show off when, with the nitro activated, you travel through the narrow tunnels and skillfully juggle a series of obstacles and bifurcations; forgettable, though certainly not bad, the sound part, with very classic music and effects for the course-futuristic setting.", "date": "2013-10-03", "grade": "7.4"}
