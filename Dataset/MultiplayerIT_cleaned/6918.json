Especially since the manga created by Masashi Kishimoto is still far from finished, which means always new material for tie-ins. That said, Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution stands as a ~waiting~ episode, a filler that preludes the series' debut on next-gen platforms and which therefore finds itself in the unfortunate situation of not being able to dare too much, but at the same time of having to distinguish itself from Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 and its ~extended~ version, Full Burst. To achieve this goal, the developers have decided to include in the package a completely new single player mode, the World Ninja Tournament, and to add a story mode based on the events of the anime, the Ninja Adventures, in addition to the traditional free modes and the online clashes which, for obvious reasons (the game will be released in stores only in a week) we have not had the opportunity to try. However, the demo released a few weeks ago should have given you an idea of what you can expect at this juncture. The Mysterious Island The idea of introducing exploratory phases to Ultimate Ninja is not new, but historically it has had little success. The reason is obvious: we are faced with an encounter fighting game, although characterized by three-dimensional dynamics, and any other situation in which the characters find themselves, in particular the variations on the platform theme, is unsuccessful. The World Ninja Tournament, which takes place on an island where warriors belonging to the present or past of the series, alive or resurrected for the occasion, go, is a bit like the traditional Dragon Ball Tenkaichi Tournament and is was organized in order to find the strongest ninja in the world. The competition takes place through a series of rounds and categories (from D, C, B, A and S), therefore the character that we will have selected (from a rather large list, with many unlockable warriors and alternative versions of the same, for a total of about one hundred ninja) will have to grapple with a sequence of encounters and impose themselves on their opponents from level to level, until they reach the final stage. Simultaneously with the development of the tournament, the island that hosts the event ~opens~ and reveals new sections, also explorable and full of potential interactions: colleagues who could pair up with us, but also multiple-choice quizzes that will verify our degree of knowledge of the cartoon. These are extras that can arouse some interest in the eyes of Naruto fans, but which in reality leave the time they find, given that it is possible to proceed in the race even without paying them the slightest attention. Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution disappoints for some controversial structural choices And then there's Mecha-Naruto In view of the World Ninja Tournament, CyberConnect2 has inserted an alternative storyline, created specifically for the game by Masashi Kishimoto. In this case, the protagonist is Mecha-Naruto, a robot built in the image and likeness of the ninja of the Leaf, who finds himself in the difficult situation of having to be accepted by others despite his appearance and a terrible secret. It's a nice side story, dotted with fights and short exploratory missions, which adds a couple of extra hours to the experience, which never hurts. We were four ninjas at the bar The problem with the main mode of Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution does not lie in the possible interactions on the island or even in an ugly and uninteresting exploratory phase, but in the core of its gameplay. The meetings of the World Ninja Tournament, in fact, do not take place in the traditional one-on-one, but are very messy all-against-all with four participants, characterized by a not exactly precise lock-on system, by an artificial improvable and from a great chaos. You will happen to concentrate on a single opponent to perform a combo or a special move, but you will be interrupted by the shurikens thrown by another ninja and you will feel the need to carve out some vital space to be able to act undisturbed. If we consider the peculiar mechanics that regulate the gameplay of the game, it is clear how this thing of the four-player encounters is little guessed, approximate in the implementation and often frustrating. If we then add that the matches are won by collecting spheres and not simply by KOing the other competitors, the picture that is givenelinea is not the best. The feeling is that the CyberConnect2 guys have tried to shuffle the cards on the table to add a little variety to the usual action (see also the scenario ramps that allow you to attack from afar or pounce on enemies from above) , but the final result, while potentially lasting (about ten hours), leaves something to be desired and we sincerely would have preferred a classic setting for the tournament. Setting that we find in the secondary single player mode, Ninja Adventures, but not in the doses we would have expected. Playstation 3 trophies Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution Trophies are basically obtained by proceeding in the various modes available, or by completing the Tournament rounds and the missions of the Ninja Adventures. However, there is no shortage of specific achievements for the execution of certain particularly devastating maneuvers and combos. Adventurous adventures The Ninja Adventures are structurally presented as the most classic of story modes and are based on some elements of the plot of the cartoon, full of animated sequences of excellent workmanship, created by the famous Studio Pierrot. The first and most substantial mission illustrates the birth of the Alba organization, and it must be said that some moments manage to be truly exciting, even more so if you are a fan of Masashi Kishimoto's work. In the one-on-one matches, the innovations introduced by CyberConnect2 stand out in terms of gameplay, such as for example the new management of awakenings (available immediately), the addition of devastating chained moves (also based on the type of team, the which adds a pinch of strategy also from a multiplayer point of view), the simplification of certain maneuvers (see the counterattack) and a general balancing of the characters, some of whom are really hateful to face as they are quite elusive (see the puppeteers and Deidara). The feeling is the same as always, we are certainly not facing a revolution, however those who enjoyed the previous episodes will immediately feel at ease with Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution. Unfortunately, the second half of the Ninja Adventures disappoints due to the short duration and the prevalence of the animated sequences compared to the phases played, which translates into the completion of this mode in a very short time. It is a pity that this story mode has not been focused more decisively instead of looking for the variation on the theme of the tournament, at the risk of repeating itself. Also because on the front of the technical realization the work done remains excellent, especially in the standard shots (in the close-ups there is a bit of aliasing), and offers a qualitative level far higher than that seen in the animated series.", "date": "2014-09-12", "grade": "7.0"}
