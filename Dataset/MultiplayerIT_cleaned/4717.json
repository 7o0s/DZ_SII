A classic that has been appreciated and imitated for two decades, a phenomenon that has gone beyond the confines of videogames to become something special and perhaps unrepeatable. Everyone should play StarCraft at least once and for this reason the second trilogy was created, to modernize, expand and refine the original. Wings of Liberty, Hearth of the Swarm and Legacy of the Void are three excellent games that may not have had the competitive fortune of the original (and above all of Brood War) but for the common player they remain essential points of reference. Considering the nature between sequel and remake of the second trilogy, it is legitimate to ask what is not so much the value of StarCraft Remastered in itself , but the audience to which it really makes sense to recommend it. The complete package Installed StarCraft Remastered we are faced with a menu divided between single and multiplayer, with each of the two choices in turn asking us if we want to access the original or Brood War. If you only have fifteen euros in your pocket this summer, you have never touched the series and you want a mountain of hours of gameplay, you can play it safe: the two campaigns show the weight of the years a bit but are still fun and full of memorable characters , while the multiplayer, especially that of Brood War, will ask you for a huge commitment for months if not years before being mastered to the fullest. The challenge rate based on the type of experience you are looking for varies from ~walking with friends~ to ~climbing Everest in shorts~, especially if you venture between the multiplayer servers on the Asian shores. Even Fish has been maintained, the historic third-party server that hosted some of the strongest players in the world for years and where people like Bisu, Free and ZerO still enjoy streaming games on Twitch or Afreeca TV. In strictly content terms, the only real novelty is represented by the ladder and matchmaking system, initially announced also for the StarCraft Anthology, then becoming exclusive for this Remastered during the development. An interesting novelty for sure, which still seems to have some problems but which is still aimed at those who already have experience with the product or at those very few who won't buy it just to get through a few hot summer days but will make it a hobby to cultivate in time. All the others are likely to limit themselves to the many missions of the single player campaigns and some online skirmishes with friends. Change of clothes The flagship of this remastered edition lies in the important work of modernization of the visual component, done however keeping faith with the not only technical but also playful values of the original. In practice, the units, maps and effects have been redesigned to support resolutions and aspect ratios of modern screens, while maintaining the exact same dimensions, the same orientation and every feature of the counterparts of the time. This not so much to allow us to switch from one visual to another on the fly (which is also quite fun, just press F5) but to not alter a gameplay and a sports scene that has lived and in part still lives on very delicate balances. By the same token the imperfect pathfinding of units hasn't been touched upon, for example, and the little bugs or glitches that millions of users have grown accustomed to living with occupy the same place they did even then. A dive into the past that will please the nostalgic but that after a few hours risks becoming indigestible. Being able to select a maximum of twelve units at a time, having to direct the collection ones towards the deposits manually and having big limits in the creation of control groups is not easy if you have never done it and it is perhaps no longer as fun as it used to be if back then you were already committed to skyrocketing your shares per minute. There is a solution to all these difficulties and it's called StarCraft II, which basically has changed with a view to making the experience easier and more fun for everyone. The result is that to decide whether to recommend StarCraft Remastered or not, you need to properly profile the user to whom you are addressing: anyone who has always wanted to get their hands on the series, loves real-time strategy games and wants to have fun with a title in step with times, it's better to jump into the StarCraft II trilogy which also enjoys better structured and more entertaining campaigns; on the contrary who wants provary the thrill of something ancient made shiny again or see what happens to challenge the very strong Korean community, you can buy this slightly revised and (deliberately) incorrect version. A last note regarding the Koreans: at the time of writing the two servers / region of the country of the ~morning calm~, Korea and Fish, count about fifteen times the number of users of the second most active, the European one, a sign that the operation was born from a specific need. In a few months, we wouldn't be surprised if the gap becomes even more marked.", "date": "2017-08-18", "grade": "8.0"}
