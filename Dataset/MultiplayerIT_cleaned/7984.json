Among these, we would like to put Finding Teddy, a small adventure developed by LookAtMyGame and arrived on Apple digital delivery absolutely on the sly, however hidden behind a title that seems to refer to a very young audience and wink at light and perhaps negligible puzzle games . Nothing could be more wrong: the game is a graphic adventure with a rather classic structure, which hides a real challenge under the apparently childish characterization and a short but intense educational journey into the dream world of a little girl in search of a lost friend. There is within the grace and the disturbing cruelty of childhood dreams and nightmares and an underlying message that is discovered only by exploring, facing fears and solving puzzles, an experience that unfolds entirely without saying a single word but relying only on basic interactions with the bizarre characters and scenarios and a strange, magical music that permeates all the fantasy world in which the nameless child finds herself acting. As in a children's story, the premise is simple and the adventure doesn't need many words to start: a terrible arachnoid creature appears one night from the protagonist's closet and kidnaps her Teddy bear. The girl, with the courage that comes from the love for her favorite toy, immediately decides to follow the creature into the closet and finds herself in a strange world populated by friendly or menacing beings, fears to face and trials to overcome to finally find Teddy, with the help of top hat flies and wary cats. A musical journey The dream world of Finding Teddy is made up of pixels and bright colors, stylized shapes that bizarrely mix cute elements and terrible threats, all divided into fixed screens to be discovered progressively with interaction limited to a few sensitive elements. The puzzles arranged along the way, usually related to opening doors, passing through obstacles or rendering harmless to various otherwise lethal creatures, are essentially based on two different types of interaction: the use of objects in the inventory, in the more classic style of point and click adventures, and the composition of various music starting from particular notes, based on what the protagonist learns from the creatures scattered in the game world. When the right application is found for a particular piece of music, the new notes are stored in the ~stave~ which can be recalled at the top of the screen, in order to increase the number of recognizable notes and making the indications scattered throughout the settings, often composed from musical sequences. The complete absence of text and dialogue makes the interaction basic and often cryptic, with a hermetic language that finds its perfect expression in the vibrant and bizarre music. The problem is that this enigmatic, albeit fascinating, silence makes the puzzles particularly abstruse and very little intuitive, which can be frustrating on several occasions, prompting you to solve the puzzles by going at random. It is probably this, combined with a rather pronounced brevity (it is possible to complete the game in just over two hours) that somewhat blocks the quality level of the game, which nevertheless manages to stand out from the crowd as a singular experience, at a low price.", "date": "2013-02-28", "grade": "8.5"}
