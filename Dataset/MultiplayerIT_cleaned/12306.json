{"name": "Punch Out! - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/punch-out-recensione.html", "text": "What was it yesterday You're not wrong: Punch-Out is actually just that Mike Tyson's Punch-Out which, converted from the arcades (where it presented itself with a far more attractive graphic aspect), Nintendo had successfully implanted on the NES. But the unorthodox direction taken by Tyson's career, which would prove to be studded with scandals of various kinds and violent conduct culminating in recent years in acts that have remained in history (whoever has ears to hear, listen...), has no longer convinced Nintendo. Thus, a phantom and less politically incorrect Mr. Dream has replaced the boxing giant as the final challenge of the player's alter-ego: little Mac. But for the rest, Punch-Out (here in the 1990 reissue) is identical to the game with the original title. With big, cartoonish and well-animated characters, the game is, for the time, decidedly attractive from an aesthetic point of view (complete with a cameo from Mario, here in the role of tri referee). Not to mention those archaic, scratchy digitized phrases... but Punch-Out had really established itself in the NES soft library as a great little game, devoid of simulation attempts. Not too ambitious in terms of complexity, it was equipped with a game mechanism that lent itself well to exercise: dodge, get to know your opponent, discover their weak points, hit. What is it today After a successful and even more insane sequel to the SuperNES and with the various sports genre games becoming a display of official licenses and physical verisimilitude and extreme photorealism, Punch-Out appears to be a very distant game from us. Still, its formula isn't overused, and it's original just enough to make it a still palatable game. And, even before being a boxing simulation or a sports game, Punch-Out is an action in which reflexes are everything and observation of the enemy is essential. From the first opponent to the most lethal Mr. Dream, our aim will not only be to respond by opposing defense and dodging with increasing effectiveness and reflexes ready for the blows of the opponents: Punch-Out is above all a game for observers, in which the few available moves (dodging blows to the abdomen and face, with the character pinned to the center of the screen and unable to walk) are applied with timing, combinations and formulas that change from opponent to opponent. It is not given to advance at a good pace, therefore, unless after a good dose of trial-and-repeat necessary to discover the enemy's attack patterns and relative weaknesses. The playful presentation, the speed of response in the commands and the non-obvious level commitment required to face the game therefore distance its interest as regards those who are looking for something that resembles the contemporary concept of sports game. But all those who are looking for a small, large device on which to calibrate their reflexes to perfection and engage in a few pleasant and not without challenges evenings will have nothing to complain about. The approaches to the fighting game are practically endless but, compared to the most popular ones in various periods of gaming history, Punch-Out remains today - along with its more advanced SuperNES sequel - relatively original. With a view from the boxer's shoulders and a style of play based entirely on the discernment of the technique of the opponents, this game of yesteryear could intrigue and excite quite a few players, enticed by its low-end price on the Wii Virtual Console: 500 Points.", "date": "2007-05-07", "grade": null}
