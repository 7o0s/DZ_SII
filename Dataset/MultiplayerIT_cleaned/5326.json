Woe to the unfortunate people who receive their attention, because it is not easy to stop a crowd before they have made a havoc of the corpses (even on the internet, as recent cases have shown). Coffee Powered Machine's Okhlos places the player at the head of an angry mob made up of ordinary citizens, slaves, soldiers, philosophers and heroes, who must destroy the Greek gods because they are too oppressive. To do this you have to reach the cities where they live and literally raze them to the ground. The game system, which recalls that of Pikmin, but without being able to reach perfection, puts the player at the helm of a philosopher, the only figure capable of directing the crowd, over which, however, one does not have direct control, but only general indications are given. Let's try to explain ourselves better: with the keyboard we control the wise man who, in case he dies, is replaced by another philosopher taken from the crowd (if there are any, otherwise game over), while with the mouse we indicate to our improvised army where to go and whether to attack or defend. However, crowd movements are not completely predictable and controllable; on the contrary, they are downright chaotic to the point that, as we will see, they can cause various problems, which we will discuss later. Each city, while having its own theme, is divided into procedurally generated areas, to be overcome in order to reach the deity who governs it. The fixed goal of each area is to eliminate all enemies, indicated as skulls on the minimap. Only after doing so do the doors to the next area open. The enemies vary according to the city: there are simple soldiers with limited resistance, but also sorcerers who shoot fireballs, warriors who swell when hit, nymphs who charm the people, gorgons who petrify our men with their gaze, big soldiers tanks that explode when defeated, and so on. There is no shortage of traps of all sorts (spikes, reels, spiked steel balls and so on), which have the noble objective of weakening and killing our men. We have reviewed Okhlos, an independent title in which you lead a crowd in search of gods. Let's find out How a crowd is born Cities are not only full of dangers, but also cannon fodder for our improvised army. The areas we fight in are teeming with people eager to be drafted to fight against the gods. On average, an army consists of thirty units, plus heroes and animals, with the latter not counting in the overall count. Each unit has its own characteristics, theoretically favoring a certain type of approach to action. For example, offensive units speed up killings, defensive ones allow you to better deal with enemies that cause big damage, slaves allow you to collect more objects, whether healing or offensive, and so on. The heroes deserve a separate discussion: they are special units with powers that influence the entire army. For example there are some that increase the number of units in the army, others improve the attack and defense of all, others protect against damage from traps, still others speed up the accumulation of fury of the mob, which we will talk about shortly , and so on. These are precious units, very important for the final victory. Unfortunately they are not found around like the others, apart from in some rare cases, but you have to hire them in the shops located in the corridors between the areas, paying them with the sacrifice of other units. As we said, the crowd has different levels of anger, which determine its strength. A quiet mob will only attack enemies, dealing the standard damage, but if you piss them off at the expense of it, so will the buildings and the damage caused will increase. It seems bad to say, but being able to raze the maps is the funniest feature of Okhlos, the one that keeps it interesting for a few hours, preventing the repetitiveness of the action from sinking it immediately. The howling horde Okhlos is the classic title that exalts you in the first minutes thanks to its anarchic and caciarona formula, combined with a captivating visual style based on excellent pixel art, but which runs out just as quickly, due to a series of problems that arise too soon. As we have already told you, crowds tend to behave chaotically. We direct it, sure, we tell it to attack or defend, but in general we never fully control it. Not bad when fighting in unobstructed maps and against weak enemiesi, but when the situation becomes more complex, the system begins to show unsustainable limits. For example, in an area full of traps with very narrow passages, we could not find a way to move the crowd without taking damage, while in another case the presence of many enemies on the screen at the same time created such chaos that we understood what was happening only after losing half an army. Despite this, Okhlos is not a difficult title. In fact, it's quite simple to finish. The reason is that such a game system has imposed very large margins of error, so as not to frustrate the player. The result is that all the various features described are diluted and largely lost in a gameplay that quickly becomes repetitive. For example, what is the use of having different units if it is not possible to evaluate their specific weight in the game? Of course, it is clear that having defensive units you resist more, while having more offensive units you cause more damage, but in the final stages the crowd is decimated quickly and the situation requires you to bring in whoever happens. In short, the army is determined more by chance than by our choices. Starting to develop strategies therefore becomes superfluous, if not counterproductive. In what sense? Well, on screen the situation often evolves so quickly that thinking about some refined action is just a way to expose yourself to the carnage. Better to target the enemy and hit him as hard as possible, defending himself when he counterattacks. Even the bosses, who also have different and more varied attack patterns, don't allow you to work too hard. Only the latter require a minimum of planning of the moves, while in some cases, for example against Neptune, it is also necessary to evaluate the scenario. For the rest it's all a monotonous keep doing the same actions over and over.", "date": "2016-08-30", "grade": "6.0"}
