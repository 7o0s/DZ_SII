Civilization: Revolution perfectly manages to gradually bring the inexperienced gamer into the dynamics of the game. The PC series, which has been going on for more than ten years now with 4 official chapters and numerous expansions (of which the latest, Civilization IV: Colonization, has come to reassure those who feared the game's definitive ~pop~ twist), each chapter is based on what has been achieved in the previous episodes, taking for granted previous and settled knowledge of the game structure. Addressing a completely new audience, a new beginning was needed, and in this Civilization: Revolution finds perhaps the greatest justification of its suffix. The revolution is not so much to be sought in a change in structure, as in the ability to present it in a decidedly new and captivating form even for those who in the past had little to do with urban settlements to build, scientific discoveries to carry forward and civilizations to develop. But be careful, the adaptation must not be considered a simplification, or an excessive pruning of the game options: the nice aspect, the presence of the tutors and the cartoonish appearance in general only serve to captivate the public more, but they hide the same depth in the action, only aimed at a different type of fruition. The watchword, it is clear right from the start of the game, is the general speeding up of the rhythms: to make the game more enjoyable and to better adapt it to online multiplayer, some more specialized options have been eliminated and merged, such as those concerning specialists in the various jobs within the city, synthesizing the management of the urban agglomerations for general objectives, and therefore relegating the direct control of the units to the exclusively exploratory-military sphere. Relationships of forces At the beginning of the game you can choose a civilization to manage, assuming the appearance of a great leader borrowed from history, with the aim of making it progress up to the year 2100, which in any case marks the end of the adventure. In this millennial period of time, our goal is to build a society capable of maintaining itself and evolving, until it reaches supremacy over the other peoples present on the game map. Victory can be achieved through military supremacy (~domination~), achieving the highest degree of scientific evolution (~technological supremacy~), allowing the construction of a certain number of great wonders and welcoming a certain amount of important characters (~supremacy culture) or accumulating 20,000 gold (economic supremacy). The game map immediately appears rather crowded, with rather narrow spaces that force us to immediately have to deal with neighboring peoples. Starting from the capital, we will have to explore the surrounding areas, gradually discovering new portions of the world, which will become visible with the progression of the explorers. The directly controllable units are above all the military ones, which allow the defense and attack against other civilizations, and those for exploration and conquest, with which it is possible to discover new lands and found new urban settlements. The city management system has been simplified here, cutting the options linked to the use of the various work activities and condensing everything in the choice of the general direction for the settlement to take, which can be based on food (crops and livestock, to make to grow the population demographically), production (extraction and processing of raw materials), science (inventions) or the accumulation of gold. In a similar way, but at a higher level, it is possible to decide the political system to adopt (depending on the address and the degree of knowledge achieved) for the management of the civilization, on which its general behavior and the quality of the buildable wonders will also depend . Warmongering Civilization: Revolution places the emphasis, in a much more marked way than its predecessors, on competitiveness. One can try to concentrate on other aspects of civilization, and maintain peaceful diplomatic relations, but the closeness of other peoples and their aggressive behavior soon lead to armed confrontation. On the other hand, this too seems to be part of the acceleration of the rhythms that characterizes Revolution compared to the other chapters, and which finds its most complete realization in multiplayer matches. On the other hand, the direct control of the units comes into play here only with regard to the militias - with the exception of settlers and raiders - dividing the game into two main sectors: the management of the cicity and general politics (diplomacy, form of government, scientific investments) which takes place through various menus and submenus, and strategic-military management, through the usual movement on the map of troops, organized in shifts and in moments of attack and defense. The fights are frequent and well done with convincing animations, and their outcome is decided, as tradition teaches, by the parameters and the different skills that characterize each single unit. These are obviously of various types, and the passage of time allows us to always create new ones, in accordance with technological and scientific progress. A further tactical stratification is given by the fact that each troop is able to increase its own statistics by reaching certain results (quantity of battles won, level of defeated enemies), by the exploitation of the morphology of the terrain (advantage for attacks from the mountains, or from fortified areas) and the (unprecedented) possibility of bringing together three groups of the same type, creating a more powerful army. Revolution One of the main innovative features of this chapter is the interface, which here is not borrowed directly from that typical of the PC versions, but has been reworked to best fit the console controller: each key has its own function and allows you to access the various control menus, in a way that can be easily acquired with practice, although it is still clear that the mouse is always the best tool for this genre. It is not always easy and immediate to select the desired unit by repeatedly pressing on the directional cross, but all in all the fact of not wanting to forcefully simulate the use of the mouse through a pointer to be moved with the stick is appreciable. At any time it is possible to access the management menus, regulating the economic and social trend of the cities and controlling scientific progress and investments in infrastructure, while with the push of a button we find ourselves once again controlling the troops. The other distinctive element of Revolution is obviously its appearance: the general seriousness has given way to an absolutely caricatured interpretation of the world of Civilization, and although the graphics don't really make you cry for a miracle, it has a clean and tidy look, ideal for a strategic, and quite captivating, although there is no freedom to fully adjust the camera and the zoom level, while the audio sector underlines the topical moments without being too invasive. The third feature that helps to distinguish this version of Civilization is, as already mentioned, the faster pace of the game compared to tradition. This, if on the one hand makes the product more usable, with short and concise games, on the other it makes it overall shorter, and tends to flatten the original experience a bit by cutting off some possibilities for further study that could have varied more the approach from one game to another. However, the drawback is partially remedied by the amount of civilizations and leaders that can be selected at the start. Comment Vote Although it is difficult, and also not very correct, to compare it to a complex and structured title like Civilization IV, this Revolution undoubtedly represents a successful experiment. At first glance it may seem like a distorting simplification of Sid Meier's classic, but just take a few minutes to understand how the soul of the series is inside this product, hidden under more jovial and apparently childish guises. Accessibility is the watchword of the project, which however in fact only goes up to a certain point: it is still a challenging game, for those who are not passionate about the genre. Indeed, it represents a title that can be fully appreciated by console owners who are passionate about strategy, or at least interested in them, but can be difficult for those who are not used to it. A sort of half-measure that, perhaps fortunately, failed to become a real hybrid. The presence of a good online multiplayer and an original interface complete the picture of a game that can make console users finally say that they have a high-profile strategy game created especially for them.Pro Deep and well calibrated Good online multiplayer One of the few pure strategy games for consoles Well designed interface Cons but the mouse remains the best solution A bit forced towards military confrontation It tends to be too short Xbox 360 - Goals Civilization Revolution contains 50 unlockable achievements for the classic total of 1000 points to add to gamerscore. These are obtained above all by finishing the game several times, with each different civilization and at the various difficulty levels proposed. Others, of value to mebut distributed in large quantities at the beginning of the game, they are obtained simply by meeting certain requirements for the first time (constructing special buildings, attacking for the first time, etc.). In general, it's not too difficult to collect a large amount of the points provided by the developers. Multiplayer Civilization Revolution's online multiplayer mode is solid and well done. The rounds must take place within time limits, so as not to excessively lengthen the opponent's waiting times, and the accelerated pace of the game is well suited to the competitive dimension. The strong point of this mode, of course, is the possibility of improvisation and surprise given by confronting a human opponent, almost always more stimulating than artificial intelligence, and in this sense the possibility of multiplayer comes as a boon, for those who they wiped out the singles game. Furthermore, since it is a game that takes place in turns, the risk of lag or latency problems that could affect the experience is avoided. Also interesting is the possibility of withdrawing from the game, leaving control to the artificial intelligence, so as not to force the opponent to conclude as well.", "date": "2008-06-25", "grade": null}
