An important company like Chillingo certainly could not stay out of this segment, and decided to entrust the Russian developers of Yagoda Productions with the task of making him look good... Transformayas Looking immediately at the visual profile, Totem Runner definitely starts off on the right foot, showcasing cosmetics characterized by an original and highly effective style. The title is broadly inspired by Mayan mythology as regards the look of the protagonist, a sort of shaman committed to restoring balance and harmony in the game world: the latter is represented entirely through fascinating black silhouettes that stand out in the foreground two-dimensional, while well-designed, evocative and often animated backdrops flow in the background which contribute to giving a touch of vitality to the whole. From a playful point of view, however, the Chillingo product approaches the genre of endless runners from a different perspective than many other colleagues, first of all because it offers a canonical level structure rather than a single, infinite scenario to go through as long as possible. The goal of each stage is to get to the end of it in a short time, limiting the number of deaths and accumulating points using the simple but intriguing rules of the play structure. While the protagonist runs, it is therefore necessary to hold down the virtual button at the bottom left of the screen to allow him to leave a trail of flowers on his passage, an action that progressively increases the user's score. However, in the presence of certain obstacles, it is necessary to interrupt this procedure and use the other buttons on the right of the touchscreen to transform into two distinct creatures endowed with peculiar abilities: the eagle shape therefore allows you to fly over the ravines which often and willingly interrupt the journey, while taking the form of a large boar allows you to get rid of enemies and to break through branches, lianas and other destructible structures. The quid of Totem Runner's play experience can therefore be summed up in the need to change shape with the right timing, taking advantage of every second of relative tranquility to continue to reinvigorate nature and accumulate points. A system that works decidedly well, and which allows the Chillingo product to benefit from the immediacy and fun factor typical of endless runners, adding that pinch of strategy that makes everything more interesting and provides some extra stimulus to users eager to repeat the internships to improve your performance. There is also yet another fundamental element that enhances an already successful gameplay: by collecting the purple gems scattered along the way, an indicator is filled which, once full, allows with a simple horizontal swipe to transform for a few seconds into an invincible winged creature capable to complete long stretches without worrying about anything, at the cost, however, of not being able to increase the score for its entire duration. Totem Runner therefore does not struggle to excite, thanks also to a level design that keeps interest alive by using small but important points of diversity between one stage and another: if anything, a certain ease of the adventure can be found, with a basic package of only 18 schemes that ends quickly and without major hitches. We therefore feel the lack of some extra mode that can increase the life of the title (the achievements are there but they can contribute very little), perhaps just a section more closely linked to the canons of endless runners that allows you to go on until you makes a mistake. A gap that Yagoda Productions hopefully intends to fill with future updates of the application.", "date": "2012-11-13", "grade": "8.0"}
