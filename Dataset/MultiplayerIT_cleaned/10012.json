On the other hand, playing a title means receiving something in return, fun and more or less strong emotions that enrich one's experience, and also the waiting part, the revelation of new information and continuous released videos help to create that hype which in right measure is always good and also generates several interesting chats. The atmosphere and the setting are two of the equally decisive aspects, and they affect differently depending on the genre. Tired of participating in the Second World War for the umpteenth time - so much so that you know more about it almost from those who actually lived it - or of moving among the usual imitations of famous American cities between drug dealers, pimps and mafia bosses? Here is the review of Red Dead Redemption, a game ready to flesh out a Western setting (with some, unfortunately small, references to the Italian one) decidedly less inflated than those mentioned above and which has undoubted charm, it is no coincidence that the title has conquered over the last few months the expectation of a vast array of gamers. Branded by someone quite quickly as ~Grand Theft Auto with horses~ - a statement that among other things in theory would also be very positive - the title developed by Rockstar San Diego offers a structure that obviously shares much of the one created by the big brothers by Rockstar North, but also has several peculiar characteristics that outline its identity and a multiplayer that in some ways represents a new evolutionary step for the genre. Has the student surpassed the master? Let's see if there are all the elements to endorse this supposition. Minigames: there is no West without gambling Like any self-respecting free roaming game, Red Dead Redemption offers several mini-games for all tastes, ready to distract the player from the main story, increase the hours of play but also useful for replenishing your wallet in order to buy weapons and objects. Leading the lot we have poker in its Texas Hold'em version, with which it takes just a moment to spend several hours in company, followed by Blackjack, the Lying Dice where you have to declare the number of dice with the same face among all the contenders - complete with bluff and precise declaration - the five-finger game where you have to perfectly repeat the keys displayed so as not to cut your fingers, the horseshoe toss and arm wrestling, for a variety and quantity able to satisfy all tastes. Better to die free than live as a slave First of all, it is good to frame the historical period linked to Red Dead Redemption, which as expected is set in the early 1900s on the border between New Austin and Mexico, ideal and uncontaminated places to set a proper Western. You are/will be John Marston, a skilled gunslinger with the usual past of bank robberies, but also with the noble aim of hitting the richest and perhaps distributing part of the ~proceeds~ to those most in need. A Robin Hood of the West then, but who suddenly saw his gang disintegrate under the fumes of power and wrong choices, which led him after a series of vicissitudes to have to work on behalf of the government in order to track down his ex companions and embrace his family from which he was estranged. We leave the rest to the player to discover, but it is good to say that the plot of Red Dead Redemption is one of the strengths of the Rockstar San Diego production, as in its narration it can boast of absolutely interesting dialogues to read, always well interpreted, seasoned with the right humor and which make the narrative thread between the various missions always clear, to conclude with an ending that is anything but obvious and which certainly rewards the players who complete the title. The dubbing of Red Dead Redemption is in English with Italian subtitles and is of absolute value in terms of interpretation and number of people hired to give voices to all the characters. Obviously the ideal would have been to have it completely in Italian but at the same time it should have been of a very high profile, which unfortunately happens only rarely in the videogame field. The subtitles still allow you to perfectly understand every dialogue and aspect of the story and even if still too muchsmall, suffer much less from the legibility problem when you are on a horse or in a carriage, because crossings or detours do not happen as often as in any GTA city, and furthermore Rockstar San Diego has implemented a system that automatically ~adjusts~ the speed of the horse to that of your partner on duty by pressing the X key, and therefore you can concentrate on reading, paying attention to the deviations that occasionally occur. Game progression is the thing that most closely resembles Grand Theft Auto, in fact we have the territory divided into three parts and which is unlocked by continuing in the main story, whose protagonists are represented by letters scattered around the map, but it is also possible to freely roam the cities in search of disparate and various missions, which involve taming horses rather than night patrols, or other random events such as challenges to a duel by more or less sober people rather than horse and cattle thieves to be identified, bounties to be collected or kidnapped women to be saved. In the middle there are more articulated missions similar to those related to the story, given by the ~strangers~ and which are often like dialogues and in complexity very similar to the main ones. Where the game stands out the most is in the integration and in the structure altogether, in fact, it is noted how Rockstar San Diego has managed to increase the variety, reduce downtime and give the game an atmosphere and unpredictability without equal, avoiding lengthening the duration of the game beyond a certain limit which would have made less interesting. All this works thanks to the passage between the settings, three different and peculiar ones that manage to give an excellent sense of progression to the story, moreover the variety and types of missions that are proposed, offer new weapons, gadgets and types of objectives in an extremely well-balanced way, considering that even the longest ones are equipped with several checkpoints that never make the sections that have to be replayed in case of premature death frustrating. Between assaults on trains and enemy hideouts, horse racing and the collecting objects, escaping from prison or just chatting in pure western style there is so much to do, and even riding through the huge prairies, canyons and forests of the game it is possible to meet characters of all kinds, and feel part of the large game world The horse is obviously the predominant means of transport within the game economy and is also one of the most successful elements, starting from its animations to get to the control - present in two types, relating to the horse itself or to the view - and the perfect symbiosis with the main protagonist. It can be called up at any time with a whistle (using the digital cross upwards) and it is obviously possible to use any weapon while riding in a very simple and immediate way, making bucking always a pleasure even after several hours of use. The cities of Red Dead Redemption are characterized by various shops useful for buying medicines, maps, weapons and clothes, they have a purchasable property in which it is possible, by sleeping, to advance the game time by six hours, change clothes and to save. However, there is also an autosave function that activates after important events or unlocked features. But John Marston is also a gunslinger without rules and oriented towards freedom, and therefore riding around the game map he has the possibility of encountering different types of local fauna that varies from location to location, and in this case he can hunt different types of animals more or less dangerous and then skin them to get the skins useful for some quests or to be sold. Always being careful not to receive the same treatment though, because maybe at night a good pack of wolves could leave their signature on the back of the unfortunate main protagonist. In the same way it is possible to devote yourself to the collection of different types of herbs, where Rockstar San Diego has also thought of supporting this part of the game, which in addition to the very complete menu of statistics and completed missions, which can be replayed at any time to improve the score and obtain a more prestigious medal, has set up a system of challenges for each type that allows, on the one hand, to unlock new special clothes (the elegant one allows, for example, to cheat at poker and goals), on the other, to participate in those proposed by the Social Club, which among other things give prizes linked to PlayStation Home on PlayStation 3 and to Avatars in the case of Xbox 360. Finally, there are also the classic mini-games, to which we have reserved a dedicated box. To indicate the reputation of the protagonistfame and honor take care of it, with the first being increased by completing the main and secondary missions and allowing access to different titles and discounts in shops, and the second linked to how the same missions are completed and the behavior during the moments ~free~. In the event of irreproachable conduct, honor will reach its highest degree and will also allow for discounts in shops and less attention from law enforcement officers. When, on the other hand, to earn more money, one attacks stagecoaches, break into safes, rob rather than kill civilians, then your honor will decrease, the bounty on your head will increase more quickly and in general there will be several firefights for the game map when you pass near sheriffs or squads sent to find you.Red Dead Redemption therefore delivers as always an infinite series of things that are impossible to list in full, but which, as mentioned, make the game world alive and always able to offer something, according to a truly rare balance in this genre of games. It is therefore difficult to find real defects in the structure of Red Dead Redemption: it is a fun game, however vast and which gives the impression of giving a lot of unpredictability, while reducing some of the critical points encountered in Grand Theft Auto and above all the dead times, so much so that between stagecoaches and camps it is almost always It is possible to move instantly from one part of the map to another without firing a shot. Perhaps the part dedicated to Fame and Honor could have been more developed, because as it stands it is always preferable to remain ~clean~ and dedicate oneself to earning money with many alternative methods compared to dirtying one's honor. The control system takes up the same of GTA slightly refining some aspects, with the triggers dedicated to aiming and shooting, the square to jump and roll and the L1 key to access a radial menu for choosing the weapon, which ranges between sawed-off shotguns and repeating, guns, knives, Molotov cocktails, lassos and so on, very faithful to the historical context in which they are grafted. Do not miss the cover system, which can be activated with the R1 key, and the classic gunslinger slow motion of the west, here called Dead Eye, linked to a red bar at the bottom left of the screen and which recharges over time and with killed enemies. It is activated by pressing the R3 key while aiming, and with the R1 key you can mark a pre-set number of points on enemies, and then hit them almost instantly. There is no difficulty level in the game, but three different aiming methods that I also determine how hostile enemies are towards us. The basic one provides for the always and in any case automatic coupling of enemies when the L2 key is pressed, the intermediate one instead the initial coupling with the classic ~tap~ of the left trigger, and the expert one which offers completely manual control of the aim, which in truth it becomes rather difficult when you are on a horse to face enemies who are also in constant movement. We close this paragraph with a few numbers that are always pleasing, in our specific test we completed Red Dead Redemption in exactly 30 hours of play, completing it all '86%. Presumably going faster it is possible to complete it in 20-25 hours, while to complete all the clothes, the challenges, the hideouts and so on, you can easily reach 40 hours. To be even more precise we faced 57 main story missions, 17 dates from strangers and 183 random events of which 30 are unique, quite a lot. Love of Canyons and wildlife But if it is true that a game must above all be fun and well balanced, in a title like Red Dead Redemption it is also the atmosphere that plays a fundamental role, so as not to affect everything else. Well, the title developed by Rockstar San Diego has plenty to sell and the graphics engine is a worthy foundation. It will seem silly, but the first thing that catches the eye is the conformation of the territory and the sky game world, factors that give an absolutely pleasant impact. We have noticed at least a dozen variations of the latter, including cloudy or crystalline versions, for a dark or starry night, between incessant thunderstorms and light rain, with the puddles reflecting the surrounding environment, the strong wind that moves signs and flags in a more violent way, or with the rising sun filtering light through plants and buildings, with excellent use of light sources. A pleasure for the eyes therefore, which already deserves a ride in itself, perhaps while a train crosses the rails and proceeds at a walking pace at about", "date": "2010-05-17", "grade": "9.6"}
