It really seems that the Japanese developer is unable to get out of the warm and safe nest that he has built with the Atelier and Ar tonelico series, now also fairly well known in our parts: they are JRPGs that have never sold so much as to become as famous as Final Fantasy , Dragon Quest or Tales, but which over the years have managed to captivate a hard core of fans thanks to their artistic direction, beautiful soundtracks and some decidedly original gimmicks. They are three pillars on which Gust builds each of his new productions and which are not lacking even in this Nights of Azure, released in Japan with the title Yoru no Nai Kuni only a few months ago. We are not entirely sure that the western title does justice to the original meaning ~the land without night~, but for the avoidance of doubt it is worth immediately pointing out that the texts of the game are completely in English, while the soundtrack remained the Japanese one, to the delight of purists of the genre who, rightly so, would like the so-called dual audio at each output. It was a very good choice, however, both in terms of costs and results... Nights of Azure is a bold experiment that, sadly, hasn't turned out as Gust had hoped Love in the time of the apocalypse In case you were wondering yes, Nights of Azure is the famous JRPG that revolves around the love story between the two protagonists. Yes, you read correctly, and no, it's not a personal interpretation, it's not the usual script that says and doesn't say, you can't read between the lines and it's not ambiguous: perhaps at the beginning it appears as a deep bond of friendship and of respect, but some dialogue explicitly refers to their relationship, and the final lines cement their relationship. Some would call it a ~yuri~ game, a Japanese term for a same-sex relationship between women and girls... but why should we label it? Indeed, why should we label the two protagonists Arnice and Lilysse, since neither their friends do? The most important thing you need to know about this story is that Arnice would be willing to give her life to save Lilysse's: Arnice is her blue princess, the knight in shining armor that every girl dreams of. You see, Nights of Azure takes place in a parallel version of our nineteenth century, in an imaginary realm brought to its knees by the legacy of the Lord of the Night, a demon killed eight hundred years earlier who has stained the world with blue blood, mutating into an abomination almost every human being contaminated. Arnice is a rare half-blood: she has been stained but has not turned into a monster, and for this reason she has become one of the best knights of the Curia, the body that purifies the demons that appear during the night. At the beginning of the game, Arnice is assigned to protect Lilysse, a former companion of hers who acts on behalf of the Curia and who, unfortunately, is destined to immolate herself to prevent the Lord of the Night from awakening, in a ritual sacrifice that the Curia turns every ten years. We, in the role of Arnice, will have to protect the kingdom and, at the same time, find out how to save Lilysse without condemning the whole world to death in a story that unfolds along seven chapters and hundreds of side missions that deepen the narrative, reveal new details on the two protagonists and their supporting characters and fill us with objects and experience points. We can't help but promote the plot: it has rarely happened to us to play a Japanese RPG in which we immediately became so attached to the characters, but the merit is also and above all of the delicacy with which Gust has outlined the relationship between Arnice and Lilysse, also thanks to a truly superlative and always spot on soundtrack. It's just a pity that the pace of the script isn't always up to par and that the various endings all leave a bitter taste in the mouth, including the ~real~ one which seemed a bit hasty in execution. Playstation 4 trophies There are 38 bronze, 8 silver and 2 gold trophies to conquer before unlocking the legendary platinum trophy, but doing so will not exactly be a walk in the park: most of them will almost unlock by themselves, but some will require some effort in overcoming various challenges and accumulating collectibles. The Servant Lady As we said, Nights of Azure was a real experiment for Gust, both in the themes covered through the story and in the design of the gameplay. If in the first case we can say that the Japanese developer has successfully passed the test, in the second we are forced to be a little more severe. AbandonmentHaving at least temporarily taken the field of turn-based combat, Gust has preferred to choose real-time action and so the player can control Arnice and fight enemies using her supernatural powers: initially we will only wield a huge sword, but from chapter to chapter we will learn to use new weapons, including a mighty war hammer. It is possible to perform three different types of attacks and chain them into simple combinations of blows, but the combat system is infinitely simpler than any God of War or Castlevania: Lords of Shadow and in the end switching weapons becomes more of a preference factor . The same can be said for the Servans, the familiars that Arnice can deploy up to four at once and summon by consuming the blue blood collected in battle. Although it is possible to give the various Servans some behavioral orders, the mystical creatures play predefined roles and it is up to the player to establish the most effective loadout, perhaps choosing the Servans who heal him and those who attract the attention of enemies in his place. The Servans, moreover, level up just like Arnice and learn new skills: there are dozens and dozens of them and they guarantee the gameplay a certain level of depth. The problem, if anything, is that one doesn't really feel the need to think about the best strategies. In general, the difficulty level is very low in almost all the main missions of the story and in most of the secondary ones, and you can safely ignore the more elaborate dynamics in favor of a boorish button mashing ... at least until you come across in rare and frustrating fights, especially in the case of some bosses and in arenas, which force an unbridled grind and a much more tactical choice of equipment and Servans. The same goes for the demonic forms that Arnice can assume by meeting certain requirements and which give her different situational powers: there is one that makes her much more effective in melee, for example, and another that allows her to enhance her familiars, acting more as a support member than actively involved in the battle. Some transformations are designed to be more or less effective against certain enemies, but in reality, you almost never feel the need to play by the rules. From this point of view, perhaps it would have been better to implement an option to change the difficulty level at will, rather than resorting to slightly too convoluted systems to increase the challenge rate. Death makes you beautiful Unfortunately, a few hours are enough to realize that Nights of Azure, in addition to the beautiful protagonists, the fascinating music and the decidedly original assumptions, does not offer much in terms of gameplay. Most of the game revolves around a central hub, the Hotel Ende, from which it is possible to accept the assignments of the Curia and embark on the various main and secondary missions, set in delimited areas in which enemies appear to be defeated. The objectives are always quite simple and the game imposes a time limit within which you have to complete the mission on duty: if you fail to respect it, the mission fails but there are no particular penalties since you keep all the objects and points accumulated during the excursion. In short, it is not even remotely a game over and this superfluous mechanic exacerbates the problem of difficulty also because, frankly, it is almost impossible to exceed the countdown in normal missions. Unsatisfactory from this point of view, at least Nights of Azure pleases the eye thanks to an over the top artistic direction and a sufficiently accurate polygonal modeling, even if unfortunately it is enough to look around better to notice repetitive scenarios, subdued textures and angularity that betray nature cross-gen of the Gust title. Furthermore, the tested PlayStation 4 version shows its side in the most chaotic battles, when the amount of enemies, Servans and explosions on the screen exceeds the guard threshold, causing occasional drops in frame rate. While they're not that annoying, they're still inexcusable when you consider the nature of the code and the hardware involved.", "date": "2016-04-08", "grade": "7.0"}
