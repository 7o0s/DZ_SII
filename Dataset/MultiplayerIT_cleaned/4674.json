Escaping from prisons is a real passion cultivated by many, also satisfied in the videogame field thanks to The Escapists, a title that achieved some success in 2015 which also led him to give life to a spin-off dedicated to The Walking Dead. Zombies aside, the first The Escapists was appreciated above all for the freedom granted to the player in architecting his own escape, even if it was a bit difficult in some mechanics that after three years Mouldy Toof Studios and Team 17 have decided to try to correct with The Escapists 2. Already available for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, the new chapter will soon also arrive on Nintendo Switch: we played it on the Sony console, and here is our verdict. As before, more than before Those who have had the opportunity to play the first chapter will have no difficulty in approaching The Escapists 2, built on the same foundations as its predecessor. The ultimate goal is always to escape from one of the ten prisons proposed by the game, using any means available to succeed in the enterprise. As in the first The Escapists, therefore, we return to dealing with a precise routine, punctuated by the calls of the guards who will be inflexible in punishing every slightest mistake. Between breakfast, lunch, dinner and work, you have to work hard to develop your escape plan, dedicating part of your free time to the ~quests~ entrusted to us by our fellow prisoners. As in the past, they don't shine for variety, but they are one of the ways to get the contraband items we need to achieve what we have in mind. A very good part of the weapons and tools that can be used in an escape can always be built thanks to the crafting system of The Escapists 2, undoubtedly improved compared to 2015. While appreciating its power, in the old The Escapists you had to improvise some MacGyver to guess how to build objects, which the game now offers to those who have the pad in hand through the appropriate menu. Scrolling through the list we are now shown the basic elements to have available, in addition to the level of intelligence required for our character to be able to assemble. As in the first The Escapists, the mind can be trained in the appropriate areas of the prison, while if you prefer the use of brute force it is still possible to build up your muscles in the gym: it is better to keep this in mind, to avoid ending up in the infirmary during fights. On the other hand, little changes from the point of view of difficulty, still quite high even in the initial stages: the breath of the guards is constantly on our necks, and even a small inattention is enough to screw up a plan that has been concocted for hours of play. Once caught, everything we find on us disappears, and we have to start almost from scratch to make a new attempt. The save system remains linked to the online rankings and therefore not very malleable, so it is not possible to count on it to fix your mistakes. When frustration reaches its peak all this can inevitably seem like a flaw, but on balance this is the nature of The Escapists and it would not have made much sense to change it, even if perhaps a curve could have been implemented a little sweeter learning. Playstation 4 trophies The humor behind The Escapists 2 influences the list of Trophies in the game: in addition to the usual Platinum there are forty others, of which three Gold, twelve Silver and twenty-five Bronze. To get them all you need to succeed in escaping from the prisons in the game, but as we said it's just the beginning. In fact, the developers ask us to accompany the success in the escape with other noteworthy feats, such as knocking out fifty guards or going to eat like mom made us, plus other deeds to be discovered. Disreputable people If the game dynamics of The Escapists 2 have remained more or less unchanged compared to its predecessor, the multiplayer modes introduced by the developers take care of adding a little spice to the overall experience. At least on paper, because in a sandbox environment like the one we find ourselves in, the human component risks ruining everything. The first multiplayer mode is cooperative, and allows you to bring together up to a maximum of four people within the same game with drop-in drop-out dynamics. From a theoretical point of view such a thing is to be seen as a godsend, to allowto the player to try to succeed together with others where alone he struggles to escape. Unfortunately, practice tells us that online matches too often end up turning into a series of fistfights without rhyme or reason, thus ruining the cooperative purpose. In one case we even happened to start the game directly from the infirmary, let's imagine because they were beaten by another player even while our entry into the game was completed. If the game servers are populated by people not accustomed to collaboration, fortunately The Escapists 2 allows us to play with our friends both locally and via the Internet: facing it together with people who know each other allows the fun to reach rather high peaks, preserving at the same time the cooperative nature of the mode. A more or less similar discourse concerns the VS mode, in which the four prisoners participate in a race against time in which the game lasts only one day: whoever escapes first wins, with some facilitations that allow the execution of the escape plan in a short time. A sort of arcade mode, if we can call it that, useful to digress a bit from the concentration necessary to overcome the prisons with all their defenses. Following the other areas, the graphic aspect of The Escapists 2 also presents itself as an evolution of the first chapter, starting from the 16-bit style that replaces the old 8-bit ones. The additional attention to detail by Moldy Toof Studios is also reflected in the ability to customize the look of your virtual alter-ego, as well as the introduction of new animations that make the prisoner's life more beautiful to look at. The very unserious style continues to be present, and is also appreciable thanks to the translation of the texts into Italian (be careful because this is not reported on Steam!).", "date": "2017-09-18", "grade": "7.8"}
