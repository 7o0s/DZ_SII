Memory sometimes plays tricks, adding non-existent details or nuances. In the world of video games, especially in retro gaming, this compensation is essential, but there are series that would be better rest in peace. The guys from Firefly Studios bring us back to the heart of the battle: this time the Westerners will inevitably have to deal with the terrible warriors of Saladin and his armed troops. Once you meet you will immediately understand that the fearsome warriors on horseback will be really tough and that to face a big enemy... you need a big castle! Also in this chapter, the moment in which you raise the boundary walls to protect your possessions is always functional and captivating. Whether you surround a natural barrier such as the mountains or the sea, or you choose to protect natural areas such as oases, you will have to procure quite a few goods, given the high costs. And this is where the game begins. To go into more detail you will therefore have: a rich tutorial in which to know the basics, which concerns the positioning of the first warehouse up to the resistance from enemy attacks, the campaign in which you will represent the Christian army, with all the aesthetic and managerial references of the classics western castles and the moment when you will have to fight shoulder to shoulder with Saladin. Except for the tutorials, the difficulty is never at the highest level. The repetition of the same few actions to quickly have the resources available to create an army is an element that plays in favor of the immediacy of the action of the battle, which will almost always see two sides colliding head-on (until the final attack to the castle), for this reason the strategies to be learned are almost always quite basic. Nevertheless, some time will pass before the outcome of even small skirmishes can turn in your favor and that this is as natural and simple to administer as it really is. Stronghold Crusader II is a return that will primarily appeal to its old fans Take us by the... hand Although you may be unaccustomed to tutorials, in strategic titles it is essential to familiarize yourself with all those elements, indispensable to the game economy, which allow you to take control of the primary sources of livelihood, deposits and natural elements to be exploited, and then make the best use of it during the game. In the specific case of Stronghold Crusader 2 this is one of the parts that still works wonders today, as in the past. The simple and essential objectives will try to tease in you the optimal choice in the use of the adequate number of craftsmen or soldiers, exploiting the resources available. In these first actual missions it is essential to try to go beyond what is imposed on you in the missions, also to better understand how to move around the area. The fact that you have to build a castle on sandy ground requires that you necessarily have to disperse your men over a very large area and for this they could be attacked by both enemies and wild beasts ready to tear the poor unfortunates to pieces. The pace of the game is always very tight and there won't be many boring moments, so it's best to quickly prepare your craftsmen and troops to defend the area right away. Once you have managed to forfeit enough funds, it will be time to erect your coveted walls. Once the typology has been selected, all you need to do is place them in the designated area, provided that there are no natural ~barriers~ such as trees or small clearings on the imaginary trajectory that prevent their construction. If you do not want to create perfect squares, you will be given the opportunity to join the lines of the perimeter, with a magnetic coupling, which forms diagonals in the various conjunctions, so that even aesthetically, as well as technically, you can indulge yourself in engineering works. However, the most important aspect is being able to ~furnish~ your structures with a verticalised and very versatile system. In fact, if you are rich enough, you can for example create a first circle of walls, then enrich it with walkways and connect the various structures together, perhaps using the useful towers. The latter are essential as archers are decidedly lethal, being able to offer them a practical and comfortable shooting area will prevent you from preventing the opponent from getting too close to your fortification and starting to ~gnaw~ at your wall defenses. When there is no intelligence Artificial intelligenceicial is often the least logical and fun there is, and for this reason it is often also the most difficult part to program. All fighters in Stronghold Crusader 2 will welcome the barrage of arrows that will land on their heads, not even batting an eye when their first hapless comrades in arms fall within meters of them. With a catapult you can gut the mighty stone walls of castles (or suffer the same sort), observing with pleasure the effects of the Havok engine that animates the falling stones. In the latter case, the imperturbability of the ~perfect fighters~ will ensure that nothing changes in their disposition, until the coup de grace and the visit of the ~grim reaper~ will ferry them to the other world. When you don't act directly on the troops with specific tasks, in the hope that they do what you want and don't decide to ignore your orders, they will choose to roam the enemy area as if they were in Disney World. In fact, they will suffer damage from everywhere and without trying to gather around a single enemy at a time to bring it down but, on the exact opposite, it could happen that only one of them can decimate a handful of your men. Let's not forget the multiplayer part, the real gem that has always fascinated many players: the possibility of demonstrating to human opponents that our war skills are better than theirs still exists and works well. Alone or in the company of someone, better if a friend with whom we have studied every move at the table, could be the push that will guide you to the purchase, it being understood that the technical defects found just above remain, considering that in some cases you will have artificial intelligence is also in the game to enrich, so to speak, the dish.", "date": "2014-10-06", "grade": "7.0"}
