When a few weeks ago Bayonetta was announced - and promptly released - on Steam, many wondered what kind of port we would have in our hands. Platinum Games, like the most beautiful of the Cinderellas, amazed us and cheered us up, finally proving that even a studio deeply linked to the console world, if it relies on the right ones, can put a great conversion on the plate. Vanquish, just weeks away, follows exactly that same line. Released way back in 2010 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, Shinji Mikami's third-person shooter is now able to make even your flaming personal computers boil! Yet another world on the brink of collapse Just like seven years ago, not even this time Vanquish will be remembered in the annals of the videogame medium for an amazing and original narrative component. But does all of this really matter? The answer is no~! Platinum Games' third-person shooter, which took up (and in a certain sense improved) Gears of War, lays its foundations on the now highly inflated futuristic world, managed by government leaders who have abused it until it is reduced to a heap few energy resources. In the face of this crisis situation, the construction of an orbiting station capable of accumulating solar energy becomes the center of a clash between factions that sees us in the role of a DARPA agent, a certain Sam Gideon. When a coup in Russia puts the despot Zaitsev, head of the Order of the Red Star, in power, the attack on the station becomes inevitable. On these premises is based a narrative arc that includes all the contradictions and problems of the modern world, forgetting the originality but keeping in mind an epic and explosive staging, in every sense. The protagonist is called upon to avert an attack from within on the city of New York and, led by Colonel Burns, will have the fate of what remains of our world on his shoulders. If that sounds stereotypical to you, know that it is. This does not mean that the six to eight hours necessary to complete the adventure are able to give more than a moment of tension and exaltation. Odds Vanquish is back with its mix of frenzy and style: Platinumg Games now at the top even on PC! Space suits and colorful weapons Often Platinum Games games are able to base all their gameplay on a single, great gimmick. Just as Bayonetta himself lives on his ~Witch Time~ or the recent NieR: Automata amuses himself in the airiness of the long and harmonious strafe of his androids, Vanquish puts on the plate a progression system in the game environment that made it the fortune and has raised its praises to fit into the Olympus of the genre to which it belongs. Much of the charm of the game is in fact based on the mobility guaranteed by the suit worn by Sam. Called ARS, this near-future technological gem is capable, among other things, of scanning and reproducing in a fraction of a second all the weapons it knows and has already analyzed. However, what makes it irreplaceable is a system of engines that allow our alter ego to slide for tens and tens of meters, also counting on steering management. Everything clearly has a price and, in the case of ARS, this is paid for in overheating. If used too long or hit too hard, the suit takes a period of time to return to its optimal shape, leaving Sam exposed and vulnerable. The gameplay of a game is based on this single premise, which varies from situations of total frenzy (complete with a bullet time that can be activated during the slide) to moments of more strategic management. In this sense, even after many years, the decision to make the protagonist's movements quite slow when he is not using his thrusters is extremely apt, as is the forced slow-motion effect and consequent cooling period of the suit when in conditions criticism following a series of hits. Following this simple and precise scheme, we continue for the entire duration of the adventure, along the lines of the stereotypes of the genre and dividing the various areas with the classic scores so dear to Platinum Games. The arsenal with which it is possible to equip oneself does not depart from the stylistic features of the genre, showcasing the classic assault rifles, carbines, sniper rifles and rocket launchers; but also taking some poetic license, inserting strange technologies such as a gunola capable of launching a real force field and a laser cannon, the latter extremely powerful but risky, not using simple ammunition but the energy of the suit itself. The bosses certainly could not be missing in a proper action production, and here those of Vanquish turn out to be fun and in some cases even challenging, albeit always balanced in the right way. Also seasoned with some unique mechanics and map management, the end-of-section clashes can be played with extreme gusto, despite some uncertainty in the hitboxes of the weak points, which do not always respond in the right way. When technique is an added value Vanquish has always been a gem. Released on the sly and driven solely by the high-sounding name of its director, it did not enjoy the immediate success it deserved. Over time, however, it has become a real cult, earning a place among the greats of its kind. This reissue brings with it a general cleanliness that certainly doesn't bring it closer to the technological peaks we are now used to, but which confirms it as a jewel also in terms of its visual and performance aspects. What is most striking is an impressive frame rate, able to maintain sixty frames per second in any situation and without the slightest hesitation. Where PC conversions are usually botched and pulled by the hair, as well as difficult to thoroughly test and consequently optimize, Vanquish - as well as Bayonetta a month ago - will make you cry tears of joy, showing all its potential and a graphic sector which, net of the seven years that have passed since the release, still knows how to defend itself in a more than honorable way. Unfortunately, the same problems already present in the original persist and can be found in a not exactly exciting duration of the campaign and a small amount of extra content, which is limited to a few minor challenges. On the other hand, the management divided into acts and missions, and the possibility of replaying each of them at the difficulty you prefer, allows for a good degree of replay value. If we consider that all this good things can be found for about twenty euros, we can be more than satisfied.", "date": "2017-05-29", "grade": "8.5"}
