{"name": "Guilty Gear: Dust Strikers - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/guilty-gear-dust-strikers-recensione.html", "text": "The scenario of two-dimensional fighting games certainly cannot be considered among the most flourishing and growing. With Capcom having now turned its back on the world that brought it so much luck, and SNK now present only under the front cover called Playmore, the market has been able to offer very little regarding the legendary 'cartoon roller' video games. And it is in this market without competitors that ARC system Works has been able to slip, a small development house that emerged from nowhere with a game called Guilty Gears, ready to revive the golden years of the now forgotten genre. The years since the first appearance of the series have passed, but the developers do not seem to want to let go of what is now considered a genre almost exclusive to them, and after so many successful experiments on home consoles, the time has come to explore new portable terrains. Is 4 better than 2? Guilty Gears Dust Strikers, this is the full name of the game for Nintendo Ds, is to be considered in all respects an experiment. First of all it is an experiment because it wants to repeat the success of the saga also on a laptop, and secondly because it overturns what have been the basis of the game in all these years, in favor of something that on paper should be more 'catchy' , more captivating and immediate, through the use of the stylus and a couple of tricks in terms of combat structure specifically designed for the gaming platform. The first mode with which it is possible to test oneself is by far the most classic for fighting games: the arcade, a challenge in which the player finds himself fighting against a series of opponents in 1vs1 fights, without any particular pretext, but only to the taste for battle. However, the main mode remains the one dedicated to the real story mode, in which the major innovations of this Dust Strikers are concentrated. The 1vs1 fights give way to a sort of royal rumble between 4 characters, in fights with a strong connotation in the style of Smash Bros, Jump Superstar or Powerstone. The player continues his journey fighting against 3 opponents in multi-level stages (divided between the lower and upper screens of the DS), interspersing the fights with excerpts of dialogues useful for understanding the background of the character you are using. The upheaval of the stages, combined with the substantial change in the game structure (with 4 players on the field), has meant that ARC System Works also put a hand to the combat system, smoothing it to meet the needs of the Nintendo Ds. The resulting control is in fact an incomplete and imprecise version of what has always been the fighting-style of the various Guilty Gears, with only two buttons relegated to light and heavy attack, a useful key to use one's special power and a whole series of combos drastically shortened to fit the new 'hit and run' fighting style. As for the raising of the game settings, which go from the classic single-storey architectures that closely resemble the splendid Jump Superstar, one of the major problems that can be encountered during the fights is due to a poorly cared study of those which are the animations of the characters and their behavior within stages with a strong vertical connotation. In short and simple, although it is immediate to pass from one level to another (moving upwards and downwards with the directional arrow) the forced movement that the player finds himself making if moving to turn your back on the enemy. Decapitated sprites To want to close a decidedly not auspicious circle, one of the most important elements ever linked to the Guilty Gears saga also takes place: the sprites of the characters. In this chapter for Ds, whether due to an effective reduced screen capacity or due to the new game mechanics that require much more space to move around, the developers unfortunately found themselves 'cutting' those who have always been one of the prides of the game, the animations, making the characters almost tiny and practically expressionless. On the multiplayer front, Guilty Gears Dust Strikers offers the possibility for 4 players to compete in a multi-cartridge wireless mode in all respects similar to the story mode, and another mode designed along the lines of the arcade for 1vs1 battles , again for two players equipped with a cartridge. The list of possibilities offered by the game is completed by two real innovations specifically designed for the DS, which have the precise intention of increasing the longevity of the game and - as far as possible - differentiating it. Lhe first of the two is the one dedicated to the 'construction' of Robo Ky, a robotic character whose moveset can be fully customized, in order to adapt it perfectly to the player's fighting style and preferences. However, the Robo Ky factory is not a stand-alone modality, since it interfaces directly with what is the second novelty designed for the DS: the minigames. In fact, this mode allows the player to test himself with a series of decidedly basic mini-games (from acrobatics to billiards), useful - if passed by beating the maximum score - to unlock a series of special moves to equip Robo Ky. This collection of minigames, while not qualitatively representing anything in particular (especially looking at the other DS games based on this structure) is the effective proof of the good will expressed by the developers in creating a product that would adapt to what is the DS user. One of the most positive notes of the game comes from the soundtrack, once again heavy-rock / metal, which is the perfect background to what are the actions on the screen. Comment Guilty Gears Dust Strikers doesn't disappoint, but despite all the efforts of the developers it fails to excel and establish itself as one of the best fighting games on DS. The obvious shortcomings in the combat structure, level design and graphics phase make this game a half-successful experiment, from which very little can be saved. The path taken could be the right one, with the necessary corrections and perhaps a step back towards the basics of the home versions, one could come to have something really important in one's hands. Until then, just wait and hope. Pros: Many new gameplay ideas Character creation mode Cons: New control system not suitable for Guilty Gears Some problems in the game structure 4-player fights are too often too chaotic", "date": "2007-09-19", "grade": null}
