This is why we re-propose the same review by adding a paragraph dedicated to the technical aspects, controls and protection system at the end. Whoever wrote this review is one of those who, two years ago now, perceived really mixed feelings in front of the first Assassin's Creed. Enchanted by the setting, by the historical period and by a very dynamic pure gameplay, suffocated by a repetitive game progression, by non-functional horseback riding and by continuous threats that still reverberate in the mind today, such as the famous ~Thief! I'll cut off my hands!~ The underlying theme of Assassin's Creed II always remains the same, that is the age-old struggle between Templars and Assassins in search of artifacts capable of changing the balance of power, however the historical period changes. This time, in fact, Desmond Miles visits the current hideout of the Assassins and manages to escape from that of the Templars, getting to know the Animus 2.0 and the story of Ezio Auditore, a nobleman in Renaissance Italy at the end of the 1400s who discovers he has murderous lineages and he finds himself involved in retracing their deeds. In this second chapter, Desmond's role also begins to be more delineated, given that among other things we talk about his ability to acquire the skills of his ancestors by osmosis, with all the consequences of the case. You are an Auditor! The game structure is basically the same as the first chapter, Assassin's Creed II is a third-person adventure that provides a large game map that can be explored immediately for the most part, a main story to follow and many different types of secondary and optional missions. Once again through Desmond's memories it is possible to relive time sequences involving Ezio Auditore, a ~strategy~ that is used to pass from one period to another or to skip useless dead times, so much so that the aim is to synchronize (read complete the appropriate sequence) with everything that happened at the end of the 1400s, and find out what can be useful today. The setting changes, the actors change, but above all the way in which the game progression is proposed to the player changes, where Ubisoft has largely managed to smooth out those defects, repetitiveness and schematic, which represented the major criticalities of the first Assassin's Creed. We will no longer be forced to find the first observation point, do three predefined missions and then finally unlock the continuation of the adventure, or to face missions that are always the same and repetitive even in the dialogues. Those dark times are over, Italy is much more flexible and this is reflected in the main story, which is finally always available, and in the secondary missions, which, although sometimes suffering from situations already seen and reviewed, are reduced in number by type and make better use of the possibilities offered by the setting and by such a vast game map. Particular mention should be made for those called ~Tomb of the Assassin~, which allow you to explore some of the most beautiful and famous buildings of the cities in the game from the inside, offering long, complex and interesting platform sections. The others alternate in classic races against time, beating and delivery of some letters, but their balance is also perfect and, it will seem silly, having reduced them in number has greatly improved their usability. Beyond the fact that Ubisoft has chosen our country as the background for this second chapter, it is undeniable that the narrative has undergone a step forward in terms of twists and depth, as well as the variety of situations proposed. The vicissitudes of the Medici, the Barbarigo, the Borgias and the Auditores themselves are extremely interesting for the Italian public but we also believe in general, and are supported by a technical achievement of the highest order. Ezio is a rampant young man, snappy like Altair and a lover of women, he is moved by feelings of revenge and gradually he will be able to understand, at least in part, what is happening around him. In the narrow streets of Florence, in the canals of Venice, in front of the mammoth monuments of some of the most extraordinary Italian cities, one breathes a creation overflowing with detail, with excellent visual depth, convincing textures, lighting that makes everything more alive and gives an impact at times exceptional. Seeing Piazza San Marco or Santa Maria del Fiore or even one of the canals in the Venice districts at noon, where all the buildings and the sun reflecting on the water, is trulytruly a feast for the eyes, so much so that Jerusalem and Acres of Altair seem like merely ordinary cities. There has been talk of visually strong scenes within the game, but in reality they are well disguised and nothing scandalous, including the dubbing which in the Italian version has softened the tones (especially in the now famous sex scene present after a few minutes of play ) and which generally does its duty well without dialectical inflections, except for repetitions for the characters of the second (third?) level. The new phrases to memorize in the collective imagination are ~But what does hemorrhoids have to move like this?~ or ~At least he must have drunk some good wine~ on the occasion of Ezio's bucking on the roofs, while the soundtrack is instead of good workmanship and goes perfectly with what is proposed on the screen, it is invasive at the right point and boasts some really great moments for accomplishment. He must have had some good wine However, such a structure needs everything possible to be captivating, and therefore Ezio Auditore has a whole series of advantages compared to his illustrious ancestor, represented above all by a beautiful and comfortable villa in Monteriggioni, which also serves as a center for all the collectible objects (and there are many) present within the maps, each of which allows you to unlock new memories, resources and so on. It is possible to restore and embellish it, and therefore receive a constant income which is vital to always have the money necessary for purchases within the game. Its introduction therefore undoubtedly leads to a greater desire to devote oneself to everything that goes beyond the main story, and to delve into the events of the Auditores and everything around them. And again, an absolute novelty are the various shops scattered throughout the game cities, ranging from art dealers where you can buy paintings and treasure maps up to tailors for Ezio's clothing, doctors and finally blacksmiths, those most useful to because they sell weapons and gadgets of various kinds. Then there is a notorious level for the main protagonist, which determines how the guards realize the presence of the assassin, who on the other hand has the possibility of hiring thieves, mercenaries or courtesans to divert their attention and therefore pass undisturbed. The possibility of drawing swords, scimitars, hammers but also blades up to the spectacular double daggers allows you to add a lot of dynamism to the fights, another major criticality of the previous chapter. Bearing in mind that each weapon differs in power, speed and ability to deflect blows, it is strongly recommended to use different ones based on the type of enemy and its endowment in terms of equipment. We also have improved dodging and the ability to steal the opponent's weapon and then finish him off. The merits, however, end here, because unfortunately so much dynamism is not supported by a high level of challenge, and indeed it is quite easy to get the better of the clashes, even against multiple enemies. In this sense, the situation has slightly improved, but at most you are attacked by another enemy when you are engaged with the previous one, and you just need to press the keys quickly to almost always avoid being hit, while the others are watching diligently and wait your turn. Although completely manageable using the right analog or the mouse, the camera sometimes throws some tantrums, especially in the most agitated situations such as escapes, chases and large platform sections, where Ezio's movement is contextual to the camera itself, and therefore sometimes fails in that sense. Another criticism that we feel we can make of the Ubisoft production and which in part is linked to the behavior of the enemies during the fights, is aimed at the artificial intelligence that also characterizes them in the other phases of the game. Although improved and not so decisive for the type of title, it is sometimes badly calibrated and it is possible to ~cheat~ it without any problem, perhaps by activating the next sequence or talking to someone. Or again, in places that are clearly inaccessible for citizens, the guards behave in the same way, i.e. according to Ezio's infamous level, although, clearly, in that place a stranger is not allowed: they will approach, try to understand who we are, to then give the alarm, something very far from credible. Having archived the criticisms, we would like to underline how as a whole Assassin's Creed II represents for large stretches what the first chapter should have been. A varied, captivating adventure, with a fascinating story and settings, with lots to do and with a gamdynamic eplay albeit with the inevitable repetitions. In our test we concluded the events of the Auditores in about 22 hours, tackling practically all the side missions and collectible items. Realistically, at least 16-18 are needed to complete the game following only the main story and a few extras, with higher peaks as in our case. The final part is then a mixture of blasphemous and surreal, very interesting and well thought out, except for a couple of changes made clearly in the running to avoid the usual mass hysteria that could have resulted from the subject matter. It sets the stage for the third chapter and we are sure that there will be many discussions about the period in which it will be set. On PC There have been many controversies due to Ubisoft's decision to postpone the release of Assassin's Creed II for PC by four months compared to the PS3 and XboX 360 versions, but now Ezio is also arriving on our monitors. Leaving aside the reasons given by Ubisoft for this delay, now useless with the game already on the shelves, let's analyze something certainly more interesting. All parameters maxed out All parameters at minimum Let's start by talking about the offer, certainly more advantageous than the console one: in fact, the PC version already includes the additional missions ~The battle of Forl'~ and ~The bonfire of the vanities~, DLCs available on consoles only for a fee. All parameters maxed out All parameters at minimum Significantly improved graphics for the PC version thanks to the high definition textures. Excellent work done with regard to sharpness, detail and reflections. The differences compared to the console versions are also very noticeable in the details of the costumes and the faces of the characters. Everything is brighter, even the depth of field is much less prone to blurring. In essence, all the small defects of the console versions have been largely fixed thanks to the greater computing power that is available on a medium-high-end PC, above all the annoying pop-up disappears. Some ~hesitation~ and frame-rate dips only occur in the busiest parts of the game. Nothing alarming though: never below 30 fps demonstrating a more than good optimization. So let's move on to the controls of the game. We can choose to play either with the pad or with the mouse and keyboard. Clearly the pad is more suitable for this kind of game, however in the test we also took into consideration the keyboard/mouse combination with many difficulties given the total difference in the control system. Most of the action commands in the pad are on the right side. What happens if the connection drops? With the mouse instead, the right hand is engaged in the directional movements of the character and therefore totally upsets the playability. Juice of the speech ... to fully enjoy Assassin's Creed II equip yourself with a pad. An Xbox 360 controller for Windows was used in the test. The discussed - and questionable - protection system adopted requires you to be constantly connected to the Internet in order to progress in the adventure, with your saves constantly synchronizing online. If you skip the line, however, there are no problems, because it is possible to save the position locally and resume the game the moment you go back online.", "date": "2010-03-04", "grade": "9.2"}
