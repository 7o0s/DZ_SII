{"name": "Harry Potter e la pietra filosofale", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/harry-potter-e-la-pietra-filosofale.html", "text": "The Magic of Bits The introduction is something truly horrible: still images with, in the background, a voice that narrates a summary of the episodes that preceded Harry Potter's arrival at Hogwarts. The problem, in addition to the lack of animations, is that it is assumed that whoever plays HP has seen the film: therefore, the introduction, in addition to being poor in quality, has incomplete contents and, summing up, could easily have been avoided. After this incipit (which among other things you can't avoid following completely, since all the keys are disabled), the game begins showing all its 3D splendor: the castle, as well as the exteriors, are done really well , reproduced with care and skill. The graphics of the characters, on the other hand, make it clear why this game also runs on processors from a few ~generations~ ago: the human bodies, even with quality textures, are rather coarse and do not change their expression or move their mouths. While on the one hand a certain ~clumsiness~ is certainly passable, so as to run this game even on Pentium II 266s with 4 megabyte video cards, on the other it makes it quite ridiculous to hear them talking with their mouths completely closed. Every now and then I think: they don't need to move their mouths, they are magicians! But a little shake of the head brings me back to those ridiculous closed mouths. A game for many Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is, as previously mentioned, a cauldron of different genres. We can identify mainly four: 1) Research: it is the least attractive phase in terms of action but perhaps the most attractive one in terms of ~artistic~: during this phase, in which usually it will be necessary to either follow someone or go to precise rooms, one can stop to admire the faithfully reproduced setting. This is the ~adventurous~ side of the game: sometimes you will have to give jellies to the Weasley brothers (the All Flavors+1 jellies or the chocolate frogs, which restore Harry's energy, are usually found inside trunks or vases) making it necessary to search for as many jellies as possible; it will also happen to challenge Malfoy, or to find some secret room to collect and collect figurines of famous wizards (which can be viewed at any time of the game, by going to a specific menu item). 2) Spell exercises: who has a trackball can safely throw this game in the bin: using the pointer, in fact, it is necessary to repeat four times a long and narrow trace that appears on the screen and which identifies a spell: not only precision is required, but also a remarkable speed . It's the ~puzzle~ side of the game, albeit rather repetitive. It is always followed by a practical demonstration of how and against whom/what to subsequently use the spell: from that point on, to cast it, just press the left mouse button on the target. A game for many 3) Collection of stars/jellies/figurines/various & possible: it is the cornerstone of the whole game. In fact, between one search and another it will always happen to collect something, overcoming impervious obstacles and using a little ingenuity to continue the action. Sometimes it will happen to be faced with gnomes, fairies, snails or similar ~enemies~, who, in an attempt to bring the energy bar to zero, will move the action a bit. However, all the paths are well-assorted with ~game save books~, which will allow, in the event of death, end of energy or exit from the game, to resume from the last ~activated~ save. 4) Quidditch: from platform to pure action. Unfortunately, a nice graphics and all in all a not bad game system, there are some defects and shortcomings. Let's try to understand the reasons. As the seeker, the aim is to be able to grab the snitch trying to avoid contact with the bludgers or other players. The ride on the broomstick is fluid and intuitive (there is also the possibility of inverting the direction keys, so as to drive the broom like an airplane), the graphics are as always well done, but I dare to make a note on the game system. To catch the snitch it is necessary to pass through the rings it leaves in its golden trail: the reason for all this is not very clear. Perhaps it would have been better to leave more freedom to the seekers to pursue him as they saw fit. Another flaw is that all the other roles are completely left behind, which is a real shame. I personally believe that implementing the possibility of playing other roles, such as goalkeeper, would have given the game more longevity. Lee Jordan's comment isn't bad: compelling, witty, punctual. In the long run the comments become repetitive, but the overall result is definitely better than the Bulgarelli-Caputi couple... To recap Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is all in all a game with a longevity, difficulty, plot and graphics ideal for children who love the most famous little wizard of the moment: it is long-lived enough for a child who changes his mind continuously; it's hard enough to not make him throw the keyboard at the dog's head; it has a light plot and enthralling enough to entertain him without making him lose his sense of reality too much (and to avoid nightmares); Finally, it has graphics that strike an excellent balance between quality and performance. It can also prove to be a decidedly light pastime for those of more advanced age, but it risks getting boring after a few minutes due to the extreme ease and low adrenaline triggering. It is also an excellent ~gym~ to learn how to handle the mouse and have some familiarity with the direction keys on the keyboard: little concentration in the use of these peripherals would compromise the outcome of some searches or make Quidditch matches frustrating. Being children again... Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is not a game for everyone. By this I don't mean that only lovers of a certain genre will be attracted to this game, but that the reference target is well defined: children from 5 to 10 years old. What perhaps leaves the most perplexing is that this target is not mentioned in the DVD-style box set of the game, risking leaving all those who, aged 10/15 and up, with a bad taste in the mouth, bought a game they believed more complex. In fact, ease is what distinguishes this game, whose curious genre definitely pays homage to the concoctions that are used to create the most varied magic potions: a mix of adventure, slices of platforming and a few pinches of action, in a world in three dimensions that perfectly reproduces the school of Hogwarts (and surroundings), where the adventures of Harry Potter take place. So trying to identify myself with a computer maniac from elementary school (in theory I should go back twenty years, in practice one or two), I started playing Harry Potter with curiosity about the work done by EA.", "date": "2002-04-17", "grade": null}
