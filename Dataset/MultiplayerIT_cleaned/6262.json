The title by Moldy Toof Studios has in fact also landed on PlayStation 4 for a few days, after arriving on Steam and Xbox Live at the beginning of the year. For the benefit of those who don't know what we're talking about, as well as referring to the PC review, we briefly recall that it is a game in which we are called to escape from prison, inventing the necessary steps for the operation to be successful. We must therefore prepare a real escape plan down to the smallest detail, improvising ourselves as new Michael Scofields. Taking advantage of this second release of The Escapists, we have launched ourselves again into some escapism also on the Sony console, to understand if and what differences there are with the version we appreciated previously. The Escapists comes to PlayStation 4 in all its pixel art glory! Freedom between bars The PlayStation 4 version of The Escapists offers us the game as we remembered it, with some very slight differences. We can therefore start from the tutorial, already introduced in the previous edition: an almost obligatory step to learn the foundations of the controls and mechanics, but it is a pity that even in this case it is really limited to the basics, without exploring other aspects that would have could help leave the player less displaced after abandoning him to his fate in prison. The objective of each level is, as we said, to escape from the walls in which we are locked up, taking advantage of any weaknesses in the structure: needless to say, this will be guarded by a group of guards that we shouldn't make suspicious, for example avoiding missing roll calls or other occasions when the warders expect to find the prisoners all together. From mouse and keyboard we pass to the obligation to use the controller, a peripheral that behaves quite well thanks to a fairly convincing key mapping. The only flaw from this point of view continues to be the one linked to the training phases, which just can't get down to it: if previously the need to press the Q and E keys alternately to perform the exercises during gym time, now doing the same thing with the R1 and R2 buttons on the pad makes things even worse, making this aspect even more annoying on PlayStation 4. Something you can live with, mind you, but that favors the controls of The Escapists experienced on PC. A file for a friend Compared to the version tested months ago, the level of freedom we have to plan our escape remains unchanged on PlayStation 4, the real strength of The Escapists. Digging a hole somewhere, taking advantage of the darkness to sneak out, or taking one of the jobs offered by the prison to gain access to a particular area are just some of the ways in which it is possible to escape, leaving the player to choose among a truly endless range of options. If at the beginning things may seem relatively simple, as the levels and prisons progress, everything changes, making a plan that leaves nothing to chance and takes proper care of every single element increasingly necessary. The downside is the risk of being stuck in the monotony of prison, frustrated at not being able to find a way to escape. Among the means at our disposal, we also find the crafting system, with which to combine even harmless elements if taken individually, to make them a useful tool for escaping or a weapon to be used on other prisoners: a little joy and a bit of a pain, because it is undoubtedly a powerful component, but which ends up being underestimated due to the lack of information about it within the game. It is then inevitable to interact with our fellow prisoners, who also offer us some small quests during their stay in prison: nothing striking, given that they limit themselves to recovering an object stolen from someone, or to participating in a settling of accounts. As usual, we conclude with the technical sector: also in this case The Escapists on PlayStation 4 takes up what we had seen on PC, making us remember how pleasant its 8-bit pixel art was combined with a well-chosen style halfway between serious and the joker. The written texts seemed a bit more awkward to read from a distance greater than that of the computer monitor, even if on a larger screen, but after a while you still get used to it. The audio offers us the same soundtrack, using the speaker included in the DualShock 4 controller to play some effects.", "date": "2015-06-12", "grade": "7.4"}
