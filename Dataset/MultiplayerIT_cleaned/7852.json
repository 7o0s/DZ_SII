Juxtaposition is a key ingredient in Soul Sacrifice, the product of a collaboration between Comcept, SCE Japan Studio and Marvelous AQL; and it is both in narrative and purely playful terms. While on the one hand the game structure is enriched over the hours with new facets, touching and engaging stories, extraordinarily powerful spells and new allies, quietly pushing towards the threshold of thirty hours of duration, on the other hand they are not rare situations of deep frustration, in which the Monster Hunter-style combat system shows all its limits due to the long animations, which we cannot interrupt for a quick evasive maneuver and which therefore make us particularly vulnerable both to the attack of monsters and our own comrades, moved by an artificial intelligence that on more than one occasion proves to be basic and deficient. Perhaps we have just equipped a large stone mallet and are about to deal a blow of unprecedented violence to the boss when we are knocked to the ground by fire projectiles launched by an ally, frustrating the attempt and still finding ourselves with the ~consumed~ resource , as if the move had been successful. Or we have been taken by surprise by a demon, who has mysteriously taken away all our vital energy with a single blow and in fact prevents our friends, even if called, from helping us, inevitably determining the game over. And again: there are missions in which you have to face flying enemies without the fact being reported in any way, with the concrete risk of finding yourself without suitable maneuvers to be able to hit them and, therefore, of being forced to wait for the opponents to deign to land to reach out and attack them. Added to this is a management of spells (called ~offers~ due to their ~sacrificial~ nature) that is at least questionable, in the sense that any upgrades and transformations are too slow, not very significant and do not produce substantial changes in our approach to battle, with the setup screen before a mission literally full of largely useless ~ingredients~, which we cannot sell or combine and which remain confusedly taking up space. Things would have been different with a more immediate and simple crafting, which gave some importance to the search for objects within the scenarios, a practice that in the current state of things is limited to being purely ancillary. And now the merits The review just made of the defects of Soul Sacrifice clearly indicates that the action survival signed by Keiji Inafune does not aim for perfection nor does it stand as a timeless classic, however it is endowed with undeniable merits and strengths that make it a excellent title, among the best currently available for PlayStation Vita. In fact, various elements are convincing, starting with the original and effective choices made regarding the narrative, with a cursed book that acts as a link between our character and a sorcerer from the past, allowing us to relive his adventures and dramas in order to acquire progressively the memories and powers. The ultimate goal is to become strong enough to confront the powerful Magusar, our jailer and the architect of the end of the world as we knew it, but to succeed in the enterprise we will have to dedicate ourselves to a large number of ~ghost missions~ and defeat the most evil and terrible demons ever seen, in a dark fantasy setting in which an order of guardians aims to eliminate evil wherever it hides. The Soul Sacrifice single player campaign is therefore very particular, certainly different from the usual and far from linear, given that some memories of the sorcerer become accessible only from a certain point onwards and it is therefore possible to return to the chapters of the book with which we have already tried to complete them. Each level can also be tackled in cooperative multiplayer mode, locally or online, but this aspect of the experience seemed less strong and significant than the premises and what was shown to us during the last Tokyo Game Show. The lack of integrated voice chat in the software can be compensated for through the use of the Party application, but clearly only when organizing with friends; otherwise you have to resort to a simple list of ~clichs~ that can be recalled on the screen during the action, a solution which however cancels the strategic element of a team that is formed by paying attention to the characteristics of each component, for example with characters equipped with powerful attacks and others equipped with shields and healing magicto provide the necessary support against the strongest bosses. Demon Hunter We have mentioned several times, even in the recently tested one, how Soul Sacrifice's combat system is clearly inspired by that of Monster Hunter. The reasons behind this choice are more than understandable, with a view to making the product as close as possible to the tastes of Japanese users and to retrace the path traced by an undoubtedly reference franchise for the popularity it has been able to conquer over the years. Unfortunately, the shortcomings illustrated at the beginning are also daughters of this approach, those that often and willingly make the experience frustrating, i.e. the averagely long times for the completion of the attack animations and the impossibility of carrying out evasive maneuvers in the meantime, which makes it is mandatory to memorize the attack and movement patterns of our opponents to understand when it is time to perform a certain maneuver and when it is better to limit yourself to throwing a few blows with less conviction. Added to these mechanics is the concept of ~ingredients~, i.e. objects that sorcerers ~offer~ to be able to cast their spells and which, in the case of special moves, involve the sacrifice of body parts such as skin, arms, eyes or even sanity, which results in massive damage to the enemy but an equally severe setback to our ability to move, defend ourselves or perceive the environment around us. Resorting to such extreme magic is not a decision to be taken lightly, and one must remember before any subsequent mission to ~cancel~ the offer in order not to run into further problems, using what is the game currency, i.e. the tears of the Librom. However, the fulfillment of these obligations, as well as that of renewing the exhausted spells, seemed to us a pointless forcing. But let's go back to the ~ingredients~, which translate into the possibility of carrying out attacks or defensive maneuvers based on elements such as fire, ice, lightning, stone and vegetation. The offers can be enhanced and merged together through a procedure we have already mentioned (which unfortunately is not the maximum immediacy) and assigned to the Square, Triangle and Circle buttons of PlayStation Vita, for a total of two ~rows~ composed each with three slots, which can be switched by pressing the right back button. Many attacks can be loaded for greater effectiveness, but nevertheless each of them has a certain number of ~rolls~ beyond which the offer runs out and, if we insist, it is lost altogether. To overcome this inconvenience we can absorb new magical energy from trees or other objects scattered within the scenarios (which can be identified by activating a ~spiritual vision~ with the d-pad, the same that indicates the weak points and the state of health of our enemies) or choose to sacrifice monsters once they are defeated. PSVita trophies There are 56 Trophies contained in Soul Sacrifice. Some of them are obtained in a very simple way, that is by completing the various chapters of the single player campaign. Then there is a whole section of Trophies based on the number of kills of certain enemies, as well as the more complicated ones to obtain, which can be unlocked by reaching the maximum levels of magic and leafing through all the pages of the Librom. Salvation or sacrifice? So let's go back to the starting point, the one on the opposition. Our character in Soul Sacrifice ~dialogues~ with the magical dimension through his right arm, on which he engraves symbols that improve certain characteristics and which can move towards three different alignments: divine, dark and neutral. In the upper left of the screen there is an indicator that shows our level of experience on the divine and dark front, with the balance of the two elements indicating neutrality instead. A dark sorcerer can cast more powerful spells but has poor physical resistance, whereas a divine sorcerer resists more attacks without causing significant damage to his opponents. The middle way appears at first as the most sensible, but with the risk of not excelling in one area or the other. To enhance our divine side or our dark side we must make a choice, that is to save or sacrifice the fallen enemies. Sometimes this choice can help us bond in a particular way with certain adventure companions, based on their own alignment, and saving a boss after defeating him translates into the arrival of another possible ally. Because monsters are just that: animals (rats, cats and birds)at their most basic, corrupted sorcerers at their most devastating. Will we also become like them? Whatever the answer, the developers have done an excellent job to make the game world as evocative and fascinating as possible, thanks to the creation of truly particular and disturbing scenarios, such as the expanse of mills, in which some ~hills~ they have the wings of an angel, or the valley of enormous chains, or what appears to be the scene of a battle between gigantic beings turned into stone. The work done on the monsters is also excellent, even if on more than one occasion they are ~cloned~ to create alternatives in the name of pure grinding and the total duration of the experience, while it didn't seem as valid as what was done for the characters, whose polygonal models boast a good set of animations but at the same time are too reminiscent of the edges to which PSP owners are well used. Finally, a round of applause to the sound sector, of extraordinary quality, with orchestral themes recorded at the Skywalker Sound and melodies that are really hard to get out of your head even with the console off.", "date": "2013-05-06", "grade": "8.0"}
