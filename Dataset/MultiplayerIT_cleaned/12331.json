{"name": "Wing Island - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wing-island-recensione.html", "text": "From the first time it was presented, Wing Island reminded longtime gamers of one of the most beautiful titles of the Nintendo64 era: Pilotwings. The revolutionary Wii control system then did the rest, helping to create an aura of mystery, expectation and hope for all those who have always been waiting for a worthy sequel. Unfortunately it is no coincidence that the title is different: Wing Island is inspired by the N64 masterpiece but seems to be far from it in terms of quality and playability. The publication is by Nintendo but it is a title developed entirely by Hudson, the same software house of worldwide successes such as Bomberman and Bubble Bobble, as well as the recent Fishing Master and Kororimpa for Wii itself. Collaborations with the Kyoto house are not a rarity, Hudson was in fact responsible for all the episodes of Mario Party and other minor titles. The cute characters of Wing Island A long time ago, in a world ruled by birds, lived the young Sparrow Wing Jr., who worked as a handyman on an island in the South Seas. He had inherited from his grandfather an old airplane and his business: the inhabitants of the neighboring islands they commissioned the boy various jobs to carry it forward and live. Wing Island starts right here. History, as befits in these cases, is a mere pretext to give a more or less credible incipit to the series of missions we are about to tackle with our old biplane. The title is developed around a simple and evergreen idea: complete one by one all the available levels trying to never die, or at least as little as possible, and do so within a certain time limit. The story, as befits in these cases, is a mere pretext to give a more or less credible incipit to the series of levels we are about to face with our old biplane The cute characters of Wing Island Sparrow (a name that vaguely reminds us of someone) is the protagonist of the game and is informally called by friends: Junior. The grandfather's old company, Wing Spa, is an air services company that has numerous and valiant employees: there is Puffin, a mechanic and switchboard operator, whose job is to brief missions and repair the damage suffered by the aircraft, there is Crane, practically Junior's older brother, in the company of his girlfriend Swan. The falcon Hawk, grandfather's old friend, and a middle-aged bird named Owl will also be selectable. Wing Island: Welcome Landing The missions are quite varied and offer always different challenges to complete, even if they will soon tend to look very similar and therefore quickly wear out the novelty effect; we start with simple levels where we have to put out some fires in the woods, others where we have to hit the largest number of balloons in sequence, still others where we have to deliver boxes of medicines to different places on the island, or find the cattle escaped from a farm. The Hudson developers certainly do not lack imagination, but this is not the main problem of Wing Island. First of all, the control system could and should have been implemented in a more intelligent and functional way. To control the airplanes, you point the remote control at the television, then hold it horizontally, turn and rotate it by moving it left or right. To climb in altitude you have to aim high, while to dive, incredible but true, you have to aim low. the control system could and should have been implemented in a more intelligent and functional way Wing Island: Welcome Landing However, the control is not perfectly analog in the sense that the system does not recognize the intensity of the turn and simply rotates the airplanes at the same speed, no matter how much we rotate the remote control. By taking a click, however, it is recognized and thus a rapid change of direction is carried out. The resentment of the control is immediately evident from the very first tests: following the trail of the balloons is really tiring but above all using the remote in this way is not fun: it is not clear why, for example, it has not been exploited as a real PC joystick, keeping it vertical rather than horizontal, perhaps with the help of the nunchuk to have additional functions that go beyond simple rotation of the view. In some advanced missions it can become frustrating: since it is not possible to look under the plane, it becomes difficult to understand when to perfectly release an object on the ground to hit the target, and you risk making mistakes dozens and dozens of times before getting the shot right. Wing Island: Welcome Landing The two player multiplayer mode offers numerous options. First of all, because it is certainly the most divertense and funny, it's the tail chase, in which you have to try to burst as many balloons tied to the enemy plane. Then there is a points challenge (which is very reminiscent of Pilotwings and its red circles to cross) and a time attack, classics of many sports games. Playing in two, Wing Island becomes fun and light-hearted, a sort of cross between fox hunting and poison ball that is very nice and long-lived. An unconvincing control Wing Island is built around two main game modes: single player adventure and two-person competition. By unlocking the various missions it is also possible to explore and travel freely through the maps, performing vaults and stunts without thinking too much about duty. Before starting, it is highly advisable to do some practice through a substantial tutorial that teaches us how to perform all sorts of maneuvers and movements using the Nintendo Wii remote control. The nunchuck is used only in the single player and is used to rotate the peripheral view by moving the control stick, but does not interact with flight maneuvers. The game takes place on three islands, at the beginning it is only possible to select one of them, but after passing the special stages we will be allowed to go to the others as well. Wing Island is built around two main game modes: single player adventure and competition An unconvincing control Between one challenge and another we always return to the hangar, where it is possible to modify our planes and repair any dents on the bodywork. The customization is certainly not extreme and is unfortunately limited to a few modifiable elements. Each completed level earns us some money, which when set aside then allows us to purchase new biplanes to deploy in our formation. There are three types of aircraft: the basic model offers standard speed, handling and endurance performance, the powerful one is more difficult to break but has a weakness in speed and turning, while the fast aircraft, as the word implies, is a true elf of the sky which, however, must be piloted with extreme caution as it is very, very fragile. Technical department: graphics and sound What is once again perplexing in the latest productions for Nintendo Wii is the technical sector. Much more was certainly expected from a title developed in collaboration with Nintendo. Judging the graphic component of Wii titles is by no means an easy undertaking: if it is true that there are decidedly more powerful and performing machines on the market, it is equally true that the parameter meter to be taken into consideration for Nintendo machine games must necessarily be cut for its potential, which on paper should be slightly higher than that of the dear Nintendo GameCube. Well, this Wing Island, making a comparison, is not even comparable to the first generation titles for the Cube or Playstation 2, technically superior, rather to the latest titles appreciated on the old Nintendo64. judging the graphic component of Wii titles is by no means an easy task Technical department: graphics and sound The polygonal scarcity is disarming, excluding the planes, modeled well, the scenario is not in the least complex and consists of desolate expanses of woods, plains or monochromatic hills, occasionally interspersed with a farm, some houses or extremely marginal landscape elements. The effects are almost absent, excluding the very nice shadow of the clouds (but seen and reviewed also on less powerful consoles), there are no particle explosions, own shadows, lights and texture mapping: it seems almost a miracle that in the latter Image perspective correction has been enabled. The structures are very simple and are decorated with very low definition textures, a choice perhaps due to the fact that Wing Island manages to shoot at 60fps nailed to 480p and 16/9. One of the few things that perhaps fully convinces, however, is the creation of the characters who are all excellently characterized, both from a graphic point of view, with a very pleasant and colorful style, and from a purely character one, as everyone has their own personality , a brief history and its characteristics. As for the sound, the music is minimally invasive, catchy and nice, as are the sampled effects. The variety is certainly not exciting, unfortunately. Finally, the localization is entirely in Italian, as every title distributed by Nintendo must be. Final comment The awaited and longed-for worthy heir to Pilotwings hasn't arrived yet, and will be waiting for much longer. Wing Island is a game with enormous potential because it is built around an intelligent idea, ma sensationally loses the opportunity to be a good title as it badly exploits all the cards that could be played: the control is not fun at all, the missions are varied but they soon get boring and the graphics sector is absolutely to be forgotten, considerations that they do not at all deserve the sufficiency of the long-awaited Hudson title. Wing Island is struggling to take off. Pros: Very fun multiplayer Character characterization Cons: Despite the variety of missions, it quickly gets boring Control system Very poor technical sector", "date": "2007-04-27", "grade": null}
