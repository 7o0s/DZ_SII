Analyzing the reasons for this success is not easy, but certainly the excellent progression mechanisms developed by Wargaming.net to ensure a continuous push to return to battle, the continuous support demonstrated by the software house in recent years with a constant evolution of the contents of the technical sector and the excellent learning curve, which allows newbies to immediately enter combat but also forces them to slowly understand all the more tactical secrets in order to emerge at the highest levels represent the fundamental ingredients of the particular alchemy found by the Belarusian team. To all this we can add the undeniable charm of the tanks themselves, which evidently stimulates the collecting of players in a sort of modeling affection towards the discovery and possession of ever new models, to be modified and enhanced until the perfect understanding is found with the vehicles most congenial to the player's tactical predispositions. On all this we must give Wargaming.net credit for having seen us long: when this bizarre project from deep Eastern Europe appeared in 2010, few would have expected such a diffusion, and instead over time it has taught us many things, from the presence of a incredible amount of different tanks in the history of war conflicts to the fact that everyone likes these heavy, clumsy and lethal vehicles, it seems. The Xbox One version of World of Tanks is an improved port of the previously released Xbox 360 version, which in turn derives from the PC version but follows a different path - an interpretation that is optimal for the console environment. The result was already positive on the previous machine and continues to be excellent on Microsoft's new generation platform, remaining free, compatible in terms of multiplayer, saves and progress and with the added benefit of improved graphics. World of Tanks tanks look even more inviting on Xbox One, and switching is free and painless The evolution of the chariot As a basis, this new version of World of Tanks follows the Xbox 360 one, so we refer you to the review of the previous edition for the general description (or to the PC one for an even more global idea). The technical evolution undergone by the game in this new edition is evident, despite the fact that the base material has never been considered a monster of graphics technology. The conversion not only brought the graphics up to 1080p but involved an extensive rebuild of the graphics, involving a large amount of vehicle and map assets with highly visible results. The tank models now have a more complex and realistic polygonal structure, while the maps enjoy a much higher level of detail, as well as the introduction of a series of new effects and completely redesigned textures for many elements of the game world. Content and structure are broadly the same as those present on Xbox 360, on the other hand the two console versions are fully compatible with each other, allowing both cross-play multiplayer between the two platforms (complete with chat active voice) or seamless switching between the two editions using the same account, sharing saves and progress from Xbox 360 to Xbox One and vice versa with a painless transition between the two consoles. The maxi-update 2.0 published in correspondence with the One version also brings a large number of innovations to both versions, which move on a different track compared to the PC one, now well established and in progress for several years. Some changes concern the organization of the interface, which is extremely simple and intuitive: an initial menu allows access to multiplayer content, the formation and management of a team with friendly players, team training or the new Proving Grounds mode , which allows you to carry out a kind of advanced training against enemies controlled by artificial intelligence. In any case, the starting point is the workshop, a place where you will probably spend several hours of gameplay managing and customizing the tank, now with a greater possibility of viewing vehicles in detail and a new way of consulting the relative tech tree . In multiplayer the main modes have remained the same, i.e. the standard battle for two teams made up of a maximum of 15 tanks each and requiring the conquest of the baseattack or the destruction of all enemy vehicles, the assault and defense, focused on the conquest or protection of a base, the encounter, which requires the conquest of a neutral territory in the center of the map and some variations related to particular maps such as the ~hunt for E-100~ and the run. For collectors, Update 2.0 also brings new packs dedicated to various tanks and a plethora of new achievements and emblems to unlock, all content made available on both Xbox 360 and Xbox One. Endless War The adaptation of the controls to the Xbox One controller is obviously derived from that carried out on the Xbox 360 and still proves to work well, even if at first, for those unfamiliar with the title, the heaviness and cumbersomeness in controlling the crawlers (at least those less evolved) may require several batches of adaptation. It doesn't take much to realize that we are not dealing with a normal multiplayer shooter: the slowness in the movements, both in terms of the body of the vehicle and the turret (respectively assigned to the left and right stick) requires a strategic approach to the field of battle. Teamwork is essential, as is the positioning and exploitation of the elements of the scenario in one's defence, while in the attack phase it is necessary to strike in a targeted manner to ensure that the damage is maximized: hitting certain parts of the enemy tank and earning a tactical advantage also in view of the necessary loading time between shots. It's more like a real-time strategy game than a standard shooter, and that's something to keep in mind when approaching World of Tanks. The mechanics of combat deepen as you progress through the levels, and this not only thanks to the possibilities that open up in the research, purchase and customization of tanks, which consequently lead to tactical choices on which vehicles to use and how to employ them in battle, but also in the dynamics of the conflict itself. The expert player, as happens in many MMOs with combat classes, tends to specialize and require deeper, more coordinated and complex teamwork, while the choice of tank implies a different approach to battle which can help to vary considerably the gaming experience. In short, a reduction in the public is physiological: anyone can download the game for free (having a Gold account) and jump into the first battles, throwing it a little into the racket, but only a part of the candidates will get fully involved in the mechanism of the evolution of the tanks. also because at these levels the grinding effect is necessarily felt and only if a certain passion for the subject has matured will it be possible to move forward. A very natural selection, therefore, but it is precisely on this point that Wargaming.net's ability to keep an unsuspected number of users attached to the game emerges. It should also be noted that World of Tanks is able to provide a good dose of rewards to any type of player at the end of the games, but the accumulation of money and experience points is still rather slow and at certain levels the purchase of bonuses through micro-transactions it becomes almost indispensable, although everything can be achieved even just by playing (it is not surprising, in this sense, that this title is one of the most profitable free-to-play among those on the market). As previously mentioned, beyond the mechanics of the fights which in the long run can be tiring if some tactical variation is not introduced, the charm of tanks helps to feed a sort of modeling fetish that can captivate many users, while the constant support of the team Belarusian with new events, content and promotions provides lifeblood even after several years of launch. It is true that in terms of game modes something more could be done and those who were waiting for this new version also to give a jolt to the classic team multiplayer combat mechanics could be disappointed by the structural innovations introduced with the 2.0 update, all in all few . Xbox One goals World of Tanks in the Xbox One version contains 81 unlockable achievements for a total of 1300 gamerscore points to conquer. Obviously the complete collection is very long, since it is a game devoted entirely to online and to the constant evolution of the player and his tanks, but for those who enter the Wargaming.net game tunnel, the loot can be within reach, without prejudice to the need to invest several hours. Polished metal To give an idea of the amount of new graphic materials introduced in the versionne Xbox One let's shoot a couple of numbers relating to the assets, or about 350 elements for the vehicles and 1000 for the maps, according to reports, in addition to the obvious novelties in terms of texture and light management, partly derived from the PC version . Not only 1080p, therefore, but also a substantial reworking of the graphic elements, among which we also note a more complex creation of grass and plants that enriches the maps with further aesthetic touches. Also noteworthy are the improvements made to the modeling of the tanks, built with a greater amount of polygons (up to 50,000 for a single model) and much higher definition textures, as well as an improvement in the rendering of metals and light reflections that translate in greater realism. Here too, obviously, the two characteristic elements of the console version are present, namely the variable weather agents and the presence of different time settings during the day which lead to different light conditions, from day to night. The fluidity stands at 30 frames per second, a choice that probably also has to do with the need to provide a gaming experience as similar as possible between Xbox 360 and Xbox One, without technically benefiting a slice of user compared to the other players. 'other (as a possible move to 60 frames could have generated), but maintaining the standard at 30 seems more solid in this new version. Various additions in terms of effects (volumetric lights, fog, smoke, ambient occlusion, improvement of damage and explosions) enrich the aspect of World of Tanks, which remains a title not properly attributable to the new generation graphic showcases but certainly gets a its technical dignity even by the standards of the new platforms. Good performance also with regard to the netcode, inherited from the well-tested base of the Xbox 360 version, capable of generating functional and well-structured matchmaking.", "date": "2015-08-03", "grade": "8.0"}
