{"name": "The Blackout Club", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-blackout-club-recensione.html", "text": "We approached The Blackout Club review already being aware of its main features. The months of early access (in which we hadn't taken part anyway) served everyone a bit to understand how this particular project was managed. Stealth, cooperative, competitive, strongly narrative title, double-linked to a structure that somehow also recalls the ~monster games~ of this period and which does not disdain to dwell on stylistic features of series such as Stranger Things, as well as on themes strongly impacting. Put in these terms, it seems to be faced with a soup that can hardly find its balance and it would be unfair to say that the title does not risk on more than one occasion to explode on itself due to too many mechanics. This despite the fact that it is still able to put some interesting ideas on the plate, both from the point of view of gameplay and narration, unfortunately plagued by a realization that is greatly affected by the very low budget available. The laughing Redacre The team behind The Blackout Club, that Question Games, boasts a remarkable pedigree, being formed by ex exponents of Irrational Games (the guys behind games of the caliber of System Shock 2, Bioshock and Bioshock Infinite) and others of Arkane Studios ( Dishonored, Prey). Although the game in question is strongly detached from the works just mentioned, of these it takes up a couple of fundamental elements: the immersiveness of the first person view and a sweetened but at the same time direct way of touching on often uncomfortable and important issues. In fact, The Blackout Club starts in Redacre, a charming suburb that is experiencing particularly suspicious events. Over the course of the night, teenagers have been falling asleep for some time and waking up in a strange and particular version of their small town, completely identical to its counterpart in the light of day, if it weren't for the behavior of the adults. The latter roam the streets of the city as inanimate, similar to zombies, also divided into different types of elements. Unaware of the reasons for this strange event, the boys decide to join forces to collect evidence of what they are experiencing and constantly try to get out of it all in one piece. We will shortly analyze the gameplay implications that arise from it, but what is interesting to highlight is the game's ability to investigate an important issue such as that of the parent-child relationship. It is clear that what happens to the boys, as well as triggering classic teen horror events, also wants to get to the bottom of those misunderstandings that have always characterized this important human relationship. Who among us, as a teenager, has never looked at an adult with the eye of contempt, sometimes wondering if that specific person wasn't even making choices so much in contrast with us as to seem premeditated and totally out of context, like a walking zombie? aimlessly in the dark. The different types of opponents range from the sleeper who does not visually notice our attitudes, but is more like a real sleepwalker, to get to ~The Shape~. The latter is nothing more than a particular monster that lives in the minds of the boys and which, like a skilled mind flayer or a Freddie Kruger-style nightmare, accompanies the player in imaginative and mechanically interesting ways. The entire first part of the experience, which serves as a prologue and tutorial, also represents the most linear and conventional situation, albeit the most successful. Strictly in single player, we will be called upon to take on the role of those who first attempted to discover the mysteries of Redacre, only to end up missing. As mentioned, the narrative works and, despite the cooperative nature and the procedural nature of the individual games, it remains on discrete levels until the end, provided you deepen that famous ~lore~, which now seems an essential trait of ~knowing how to narrate~. The singularity of the gameplay Allow us the pun of the paragraph title. That singularity indicates two important details of The Blackout Club: one certainly positive, the other much less so. The multiplayer and procedural nature of the experience creates an interesting sense of singularity in the group of players. Changing the position and search for evidence is the basis of the longevity of a title that must base its very existence on enticing you to return and return again to being scared with the game. Here, however, the first of The Blackout Club's long-standing problems comes into play: the very little variety. Redacre is a tiny town, which will take you very little time to visit in its entirety andwhich certainly does not stand out for its high density of different places to explore. To make everything even worse there is a disarming repetitiveness of the missions. Despite the relocation of the tests, it is always a question of carrying out the same things, being careful not to be found and using the mobile phone and the various tools available conscientiously. In itself this would not even turn out to be such an exorbitant problem, precisely considering the multiplayer nature, but a certain tiredness and a sense of tedium is easily found, precisely because the game would like to push you to deepen the events that form the background, but at the same time moves away from this same deepening. Its dual nature is probably also its worst flaw, which is also found in the lack of variety of enemies. These range from those who are only able to hear noises to those who see you even when you are repaired, ending with a boss, precisely ~The Shape~, which probably represents the only real ingenious idea of this great minestrone . The need to pass into the darkness of the lowered eyelid triggers a series of fears inherent in man dictated precisely by the impossibility of seeing around him. Dividing reality between the night full of adult zombies, and the darkness of two eyes closed but able to observe the movements of the greatest threat in the game, also adds a fair level of organization among the players. The arrival of the entity is managed through the actions that each single player can perform during the games. Performing the so-called ~sins~ against adults will lead to the wrath of the monster, who will then hunt down the ~bad child~ and, if he manages to catch him, would leave him in a catatonic state from which only the others players could awaken it. This element is also important to understand how much The Blackout Club bases its very essence on the age-old problem of the relationship between adolescents and adults, which a bit like Godzilla in the case of our faults relating to nuclear power, has repercussions here in this essence incorporeal. Last, but not least, two very interesting features in addition to the raw gameplay. On the one hand you will be asked to modify some parameters of your alter ego with a system of upgrades managed by cards. These can both actively modify the individual games, activating characteristics and specific actions that your character will be able to perform during the mission; as well as passive ones, able to increase health or deliver you useful tools at the start. The other is instead the one relating to the Enhanced Horror System, which we prefer not to spoil by telling you too many details, but which probably represents the most disturbing and intriguing feature of the game. This consists of a sort of recording made by the player with his own voice, which can be useful for receiving clues and elements that tell the characters' facts and nightmares. As if that weren't enough, these recordings are used in the game for so-called rituals, which can be activated through specific objects and which will then require you to record something with your voice. It is such a particular and original system that it is difficult to explain, certainly more than letting yourself try it, but which easily reveals the great talent of the guys from Question Games. Hi, I'm a stalker Another interesting feature, but which at the same time tends to create problems in game balancing, is that relating to the stalker. Once you reach a specific level, you will be able to take part in slightly different adventures. When the stalker is active the title turns into a cooperative / competitive. One of the four players, unbeknownst to the others, will find himself an accomplice of the monster. His goal will therefore be to ruin the game of the other players, collecting evidence of their sins, so as to push The Shape to enter the game faster. This element is easily deactivated from the room settings, although it is an extremely fascinating detail. The problem lies in its balance. The stalker is currently too strong and you risk being really more afraid of him than of the entities present in the game.", "date": "2019-08-02", "grade": "7.5"}
