{"name": "Very Little Nightmares", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/very-little-nightmares-la-recensione.html", "text": "A couple of years ago, the indie team Tarsier rose to the limelight with Little Nightmares, with a strange adventure characterized by a dark atmosphere in the style of a horror fairy tale. Managing to offer a good mix of stealth elements and puzzles to solve, the game has become a global success, probably thanks above all to its particular style. Very Little Nightmares, which we are dealing with in this review, recovers something of those atmospheres and that game setting, unfortunately only partially succeeding in its intent. When a PC and console game is transferred to a mobile context with the creation of an ad hoc project, developed specifically for the touch screen control system and without letting go of the free-to-play money-grabbing drifts, it always attracts a certain interest and already prepares us in a positive sense. With these premises, therefore, this Very Little Nightmares is to be welcomed with pleasure, also mindful of the excellent impressions left by the predecessor. The game is a sort of alternative version of the original adventure, a spin-off whose protagonist is always the same frightened girl from Little Nightmares, or Six, with her unforgettable yellow hooded raincoat. The story would be a sort of prequel but shares many characteristics with the previous game: also in this case the girl finds herself lost in a hostile environment, about which we can only speculate since there is no explicit narration of the events, no there being neither dialogues nor written text. The Nest is a dark place as much as the Maw and this too seems to be based on the exploitation of children and small creatures for some purpose, within a sort of perverse mechanism from which we must flee, constantly hunted down by strange and evil figures. In short, rather than adding something different to the original game, Very Little Nightmares is proposed as an alternative version of that same experience, which in itself represents a good idea. Imprison yourself The structure and setting of the game change quite clearly compared to the original: being based on touch screen control, with the possibility of giving direction to Six simply by touching the point where we want it to go, Very Little Nightmare is configured in a necessarily different way from that mixture of platform and adventure that we have seen on consoles. We are therefore faced with a more traditional puzzle game, staged with an isometric shot that uses, strangely, only the vertical screen view. This bizarre choice, albeit fascinating, sacrifices visibility, also because the levels don't make much use of vertical movement and the impossibility of adjusting the zoom tends to hide important parts of the scenery, a problem aggravated by the trial and error setting that characterizes several stages. One often gets the impression that the challenge is not so much based on the depth of the puzzles but rather on the use of obstacles in a somewhat subtle way, also considering that the pathfinding that characterizes Six's movement, once the goal has been set , seems to run into some logical problem often forcing us to continuously correct the course. The good ideas put in place in the first minutes of gameplay run out quickly and for most of the time the game repeats the same solutions and patterns to tackle the levels, often resorting to backtracking due to the difficulty of visualizing the paths and the arrangement of the obstacles. Six's control system and pathfinding problems are also amplified in sections where maximum precision is required, such as in stealth phases or when we are being chased by enemies or various threats, in which case frustration can emerge forcefully. All these inaccuracies weigh down a gameplay that in itself is already made not very stimulating by puzzles that are not exactly challenging or brilliant and it is a great pity if you also look at the aesthetic aspect of Very Little Nightmares. Graphics, animations, music and characterization of the game stand at high levels and demonstrate how the artistic direction has done a great job of adapting the original idea of Little Nightmares for the mobile context, translating the same decadent, disturbing and grotesque atmospheres but melancholy and also tender with remarkable mastery. In the end it is precisely the strange world of the Nest that pushes us to move forward, with the curiosity to see in which settings we can find ourselves from level to level which turns out to be the only driving force of the whole game in the end.", "date": "2019-06-08", "grade": "5.8"}
