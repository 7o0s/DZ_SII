{"name": "Devil May Cry 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/devil-may-cry-12.html", "text": "The devil weeps very often... From the beginning of the Devil May Cry 2 project, the decision to entrust the development of the title to a different team from that of the first chapter aroused many doubts from insiders and even simple enthusiasts; if in fact it is true that the progenitor of the series was a game of absolute quality, it is equally true that a large portion of the success it managed to collect was thanks to the exceptional style that the team of programmers managed to give to every aspect. In particular, the figure of Dante undoubtedly represents one of the best examples of characterization in the field of video games: whether he appears as a very cool man or as an exalted truzzo, the protagonist of the Capcom production is a ~character~ to all effects, and not a simple alter ego of the player. The very particular and successful ~feeling~ of the first episode therefore questioned the ability of a different group of programmers to be able to retransmit it with the same effectiveness and force. On balance however, after having tested the game thoroughly, we can safely say that it was not only the aforementioned ~feeling~ that was lost in this Devil May Cry 2: the final result is in fact really disappointing in a large number of further aspects , to the point of seriously questioning the decision to continue - in this way - a highly appealing and certainly interesting franchise. A stylish demon Dante is a popular and charismatic character. Someone outside the world of video games must have noticed it and so why not sponsor this figure in a somewhat particular way? The very Italian Diesel, who has always been very active on the video game front (there are fourteen projects in which she participated, including: G-Police 2, Driver 2, 55DSL Sega Xtreme Sports and Shadowman), thought of dressing Dante and Lucia, protagonists of Devil May Cry 2, with exclusive outfits. In total there are 3 outfits, which you can obviously unlock and use within the game. But that's not all, on the occasion of the game Diesel has decided to produce a very limited edition belt for sale at its chain of stores. It is said that he has special powers... who knows!

Furthermore, Dante's first steps, between classic duels with double pistols and sword accompanied by spectacular jumps from one wall to another, seem to follow completely and for everything what already happened at his debut. Unfortunately though, it's only a matter of time for things to come home to roost; and the initial enthusiasm slowly gives way first to disappointment, then to real disappointment. In fact, the gaps highlighted by the Capcom title are too many and too obvious, starting with the management of the camera, which is absolutely inadequate. Rarely, and even more so in productions of this caliber, have we witnessed such a havoc from this point of view: the action, in most cases, is in fact followed by absolutely uncomfortable and irritating points, preventing not only the perfect vision of the location but even affecting the playability. The fact that the cameras are fixed does nothing but increase the frustration of the user, the victim of real loss of orientation or simply of hiding the area to visit. During the jump attacks, however, the virtual direction frames the innocent Dante from the bottom up, thus totally preventing the vision of the target you want to hit. And if we add to this a far from perfect auto-lock... Moving on to the technical side, Devil May Cry 2 generally stands at good levels, although it does not improve markedly as already seen in the first episode. The number of polygons on the screen is quite high, the textures more than satisfactory and the same goes for the animations, especially those of the protagonists. Yes, because the programmers have decided to add the mysterious Lucia to Dante, a character who shares the two discs that make up the game with the tamarrissimo hero. The level design is also decidedly subdued, of a disheartening flatness: all the touches of class of the debut seem to have disappeared into thin air, victims of a team in a heavy creative crisis or unable to create a title of this kind. The fact is that, wandering through the levels of DMC2, one experiences a constant and marked feeling of tedium on practically every occasion: some environments that are far too dispersive, others decidedlynonime, still others literally invaded by a swarm of enemies as numerous as they are scandalously lacking in artificial intelligence. This paucity in the design unfortunately also affects the opponents that the protagonists will be called to face, both as regards the simple aberrations scattered throughout the levels and for the bosses; in fact, among the latter, it is possible to see examples of rare mediocrity that reach their climax with the zombie-mutant helicopter of the fifth mission. More generally however, any adversary present is controlled by precise behavioral patterns, as simple and repetitive as they are embarrassing in their incompleteness. On some occasions it is in fact sufficient to position yourself in a certain point to knock down even the toughest of bosses without this being able to do anything to hit us. Unfortunately, the story that is the background to the events must also be included among the negative sides, capable of truly representing one of the lowest points reached by Capcom's productions in recent years. Apart from the plot worthy of any screenwriter's worst nightmare, what is striking is the absolute lack of a common thread between the various levels, which at this point are reduced to a series of completely unrelated settings. An example? Dante is in the middle of a ruined castle: after eliminating a very original (ironically) mutant snake, a powerful motorcycle magically appears behind a door. After a short filmed sequence in which our white-haired hero appears astride the two-wheeler, the next level opens in full urban setting. Free interpretation? The decision to greatly impoverish the character enhancement and evolution phase is also regrettable, now reduced to a simple series of weapon upgrades that really leave the time it finds, just as impalpable are the new moves introduced by the programmers. The personality, this unknown In the general drama that accompanies this second episode, the incredible demolition of Dante's character probably stands out above all the defects already listed, in the sense in which it was described at the beginning of the review. In fact, the Japanese team proved to be unable to maintain the exceptional characterization of the protagonist, who on the contrary was ~emptied~ and made little more than a puppet dressed in a ~cool~ way. The sentences, the attitudes, the actions that had contributed so much to making the Dante of the first episode a real concentration of charisma seem to have evaporated. In the same way Lucia, beyond a decidedly unforgettable design, lacks the depth necessary to transform a set of polygons into a real character worthy of the name. So what is saved of this DMC2? As far as the work of the team in charge of developing this second episode is concerned, very little; everything that is good in DMC2 is in fact borrowed from what was observed in the prequel, or rather the control of the character and the great frenetic nature of the fights. The PAL adaptation is good: the texts on the screen are entirely translated into Italian and we welcome the introduction of the 60Hz mode, which re-proposes the image proportions and the speed and fluidity of the original NTSC unchanged. Comment Devil May Cry 2 is, without a doubt, one of the most bitter disappointments of the year. The decision, by a Capcom in full crisis, to entrust the development of a game of such weight to a team evidently incapable of holding the reins of the franchise firm, has led to the birth of a product whose only merits derive from the inherited aspects from the previous chapter. Everything new, from the level design to the characterization of the characters, from the management of the cameras to the story, settles on levels of mediocrity that really shouldn't have been compared to such an important series for Capcom. A misstep, and a big one too. Pros: Frantic and enjoyable combat system Good graphics Good PAL adaptation and 60Hz mode Cons: Bad camera management and level design Non-existent characterization Inconsistent plot Too easy and repetitive Once upon a time there was Capcom, a software house capable of churning out titles of undoubted value one after the other; among them, there was an excellent action game created by the brilliant mind of Shinji Mikami, called Devil May Cry. Capable of enclosing a whole series of elements borrowed from Hong Kong filmography in a gothic atmosphere of great impact, the Captive Communication production immediately established itself as one of the most exciting and successful titles in the Playstation catalog2. About a year and a half later, several things have changed within this happy picture just described: Capcom has in fact put together a whole series of notable missteps, some more sensational than others, which have in any case affected the fame it enjoyed only a handful of months earlier. The debut of the sequel to the very good Devil May Cry could therefore have marked both the interruption of such a period of crisis, and on the contrary the persistence of the same, with all the (serious) consequences that this would have entailed.", "date": "2003-04-14", "grade": null}
