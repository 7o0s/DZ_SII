{"name": "Freedom Force - For Freedom!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/freedom-force-for-freedom.html", "text": "From now on I will be known asMINUTEMAN! Well yes this is the new name of one of the characters in the game (wait to see the costume), among the many that we will be able to check. Freedom Force is in fact a tactical-RPG and therefore belongs to that subset of Action-RPGs which provide for the possibility of ~suspending~ the action to plan the fight, similarly to Baldur's Gate and Dungeon Siege. In reality, as we will see, mentioning computer RPGs is extremely risky at this juncture. But first let's study a little history. You should know that a very distant and evil alien civilization eager to conquer the universe (there is always one somewhere) observing the peculiar predisposition to self-destruct of the human race, had the brilliant idea of sending a large quantity of of Energy X, a particular form of energy capable of awakening bizarre powers in unpredictable ways on people who are exposed to it. In this way the aliens counted on having spared themselves the trouble of a tedious invasion, having endowed the worst criminals on the planet with sufficient destructive power to set the Earth on fire. From now on I will be known asMINUTEMAN! Fortunately, someone with common sense always arrives to put a spoke in the wheels of the bad guys, in this case the good Mentor, alien too, but not evil to the core (strange!), who soon gets on his ship, goes to Earth in human form (and, alas, in superhero costume) to donate Energy X to some trustworthy people who will become the protectors of humanity. Unfortunately, his ship is shot down, chaotically pouring its cargo over the city of New York and irradiating the most unexpected individuals. One way or another, however, a team of brave heroes is formed that will begin the war against crime. Already because of course there will be those who, in possession of the extraordinary powers conferred by Energy X, will try to use them for their own shady purposes (presumably the conquest and/or destruction of the world). As I mentioned, the game is set in America in the 60s, in the midst of the Cold War, and it is no coincidence that the first of the 20 super criminals we will be dealing with will be a Russian secret agent who came to America to get a weapon nuclear, and renamed himself ~Nuclear Winter~ after gaining the power to control ice and snow. Continuing the fight against the icy evil that has come from the steppes we will find ourselves leading a handful of bizarre fearless heroes who will take the name of Freedom Force! I flex my muscles and I'm in a vacuum Superstrength, steel bodies, mental and pyrokinetic powers, ability to fly and breathe underwater... as taught by the best comic book tradition by Marvel and DC Comics, every super hero has his own peculiar qualities that make him special and superior to the mere mortals he will be vowed to protect. The single-player mode of FF presents a team of ~prepackaged~ superheroes, with their peculiar costume and set of special powers, but the game offers users what with a lack of modesty has been defined as the best generation system of characters from the history of video games, the Hero Toolkit. It is indeed a rather versatile tool: as we progress in the game, acquiring notoriety and prestige it will be possible to hire new heroes among which we will also be able to choose our creations, thus offering the possibility of replaying the same missions several times with a completely different, all to the advantage of longevity. In fact, depending on the powers possessed by a given character, the various obstacles that will have to be faced may be overcome in alternative ways: if a huge beast armed with a hammer could have difficulty knocking down an opponent hidden on a roof, this will not worry the our Minuteman who is able to make prodigious leaps right up to the top of skyscrapers, or rather the reveler El Diablo, a flying super hero with a loose tongue. Unfortunately, one of the defects of the game is that of not providing any information relating to the range of the powers themselves via the interface, to the point that by aiming our lethal microwave beams at the villain, we will often see our hero take flight and to proceed with contempt of danger in the vicinity of the enemy so as to be able to carry out his attack, suffering meanwhile all kinds of harassment. This small inconvenience will force you to use the pause key with abnormal frequency, so you can stop your favorites in time every time they undertake something.he suicide action... It would also have been a good idea to have an indicator of some kind that reminds us of the last order given to a given character, since having to manage as many as four at the same time it often happens that we forget who is about to do what, forcing us to repeat the same order several times to be sure that it is successful. For Freedom!!! It is useless to prevaricate further: if Freedom Force is an RPG, then I am Captain America. Over time our characters will actually gain experience and power, but to begin with it is possible to call up a screen of their physical statistics only at the end of each mission, moreover there is no inventory management, the dialogues are completely automated and the plot, advancing mission to mission, it's absolutely linear. Ok don't take it as something so negative: FF certainly doesn't focus on an articulated narrative, on a particularly thick setting or anything like that, but rather its main objective is to capture the essence, the spirit of the old comic d action for kids, distill it and digitize it in a video game capable of giving the same sensations that gives the reading of an Ironman or the Incredible Hulk book. The gameplay of Freedom Force therefore remains perfectly enjoyable as long as you don't approach it with the spirit of the roleplayer, who will do better to take it for what it is, a three-dimensional tactical arcade. Of course, there is also a multiplayer option capable of expressing the full potential of the character editor, although the basic setting may be repetitive. In fact, any teamplay option is missing and the only mode present is a furious Deathmatch that easily turns into a brawl of thugs in tights, where there seems to be only the need to grab a bus first and throw it on the opponents' heads. Furthermore, the total absence of closed spaces (the buildings are mere blocks) forces the players into immense open-air arenas, while the possibility of breaking into houses or jumping through the windows would have offered excellent gameplay cues even in single-player mode. Technically speaking... The graphics of Freedom Force is undoubtedly satisfactory, while presenting visible and embarrassing ups and downs. Although the characters and superheroes have been created with care and precision, not skimping on animations and excellent textures, the impression is that the game graphics have let themselves go in the creation of the environments that suffer from a certain lack of detail, often resulting a little too rough and approximate. Of course, the high coefficient of interaction with the landscape is very appreciable (it's not every day that you can uproot trees and lampposts, throw cars and vans, etc.) and the presence of a plausible physical model makes everything even more fun to play, but the graphics could certainly have been more detailed and pleasant and it is not clear whether this was a simple attempt to reproduce the simplicity of the original comic drawings or it is simply a matter of superficiality. The interface on the contrary fits perfectly with the atmosphere of the game being formed by a set of drop-down menus similar to those of Windows, made to resemble the captions that normally dot the pages of comics and the addition of numerous onomatopoeias that accompany the successful hits, gives even more the idea of being in front of a Superman table or the legendary Batman TV show. Speaking of the sound, then there is really nothing to complain about: the sound effects, very cartoonish and effective, embellish the audio tracks that are simply perfect, epic and triumphant at the same time, worthy of a glorious handful of super heroes. Will our heroes succeed... Freedom Force is a damn fun game. That's a fact, whether you like the genre or not is a whole other matter. The immediate gameplay and the ingenious reworking of all the classic comic clichs made in the USA make it an absolutely original product, an easy-to-use game potentially capable of building a solid community of enthusiasts ready to compete and exchange their favorite champions. Some technical and control system flaws, as well as a considerable amount of unexpressed potential in terms of playability do not allow it to obtain an evaluation of excellence, but we are still facing a first-rate gem. Think about it. In the beginning it was Superman By effectively inventing the cThe concept of ~super hero in tights~ the USA has made a fundamental contribution to the world of comics. Take a random American, give him amazing superpowers of unknown alien origins, and the first thing he will do, even before deciding whether to be good or bad, is to get two things: an absurd multicolored costume and a ridiculous alias like ~the 'Meteor Man the ~Defender of Titan~ and the like. It goes without saying that the programmers of the game wanted to be inspired by those improbable heroes with somewhat naive names who populated the mythical Silver Age of American comics, in the company of the traditional assortment of Russian communists, gangsters, giant insects and diabolical mad scientists grappling with their latest evil invention. Of course, there is also a large dose of self-irony in presenting bloated characters declaiming phrases that in the Italian language sound more or less like ~Damned Nuclear Winter! In the name of Freedom I will bring you to Justice!~ or ~Don't forget the tremendous power of Energy X!!~. Freedom Force is a bit of a pioneer of the superhero genre on PC, since although it now has a certain following on consoles, all the similar titles announced so far for PC (with the exception of City of Heroes) have been cancelled.", "date": "2002-04-12", "grade": null}
