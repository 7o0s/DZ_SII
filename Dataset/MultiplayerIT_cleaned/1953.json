{"name": "Il signore degli Anelli", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/il-signore-degli-anelli_a.html", "text": "Gameplay The game looks like a sort of action/rpg and will see you as protagonists with only three of the many characters: Frodo, Gandalf and Aragorn. The early stages of the game will be more exploratory than action, with mini-quests to complete, and will take place in the land of the Hobbits. You take on the role of Frodo, who tries to understand what awaits him by interviewing the various non-player characters within the vast country of these curious creatures. The local characters, in exchange for information or objects, will ask you to do something for them; fortunately they are optional missions, as the mandatory ones are not few and not always easy to complete. The main tasks to be performed go from bringing an object to a specific hobbit to looking for the alarm bell of the village. The menu is divided into two, that of objects and that of weapons: it is intuitive and easy to access. The other menu (always visible below the health bar) will be that of the items, which will contain the various information documents, the ring, the keys to open doors, potions for healing, etc. The view is in third person, and the camera can be managed manually using the right analog stick. The controls are simple; the A key to attack, the X key to examine objects, collect them and talk to other characters, Y to jump and B to implement the lock-on on enemies. The Start button takes you to the game's various menus. Those who do not prefer this configuration can be edited in the options menu. The weapons to be used are limited in number: for Frodo we will have the stick as an initial weapon, to then move on to the short sword and finish with the Elven sword which will have the characteristic of lighting up a bluish color in the presence of the ogres. Furthermore, the hobbit will be able to wear the ring that will make him invisible until he takes it off, but the risk is to amplify his presence so much that Sauron's henchmen find you. Aragorn the warrior instead, will be able to obtain only two types of swords: a normal sword, and finally a sword used during the ancient battle against Sauron, called Andril. This character, compared to the other two, will also be able to use a bow with three types of arrows: metal, wooden and fiery. Gandalf will attack enemies with his trusty magical staff, and a sword to defend himself in moments when the magic fails. The mage will have two types of magical attacks: offensive and defensive. Offensive spells include the classic fireballs, suitable for hitting single targets, lightning, and the most powerful of all, the explosion of light, effective against multiple enemies. Defense spells are categorized into healing magic, confusion magic (disorientates opponents so as to hit them more easily) and sleep magic (puts enemies to sleep for a short period of time). The fights take place in real time, and the game alternates in a non-annoying way between an exploratory section and another purely action-oriented. The musical themes are impactful and atmospheric, but slightly repetitive in the long run. The music from the film was not used due to the license, but in any case the orchestral realization of those contained in the videogame do justice to the title. Technical part Technically speaking we are dealing with a good product, but far from making people cry for a miracle. The 3D engine used by Vivendi is solid, but not without its flaws. There is a lot of attention to detail, you will even see the dry leaves falling from the trees. On the other hand, if you go towards a stream, you will find an unjustified invisible wall. Some objects in the scenario are interactive, such as wooden boxes for example; they can be destroyed and may contain valuable items. As the Xbox has accustomed us, the textures are of excellent quality, the scenery is vast, and the time factor of day and night has been implemented. The light effects are fabulous, especially when you wear the ring that will make you invisible: with a clever use of motion blur, you will have the impression of being in a parallel dimension. Unfortunately, the frame rate is not always constant, and it is the only graphical defect to be attributed to it, although the game does not have large quantities of polygons to move on the screen. Conclusions Overall, Vivendi's product is above expectations, since usually the tie-ins never come out well. The Fellowship of the Ring manages to capture the player so much that he sometimes makes him feel the protagonist of the story, others boring him with repetitive and useless passages. The longevity of the game is assured, there is plenty of irons in the fire: recommended for action/rpg enthusiasts andre of Tolkien, and to those looking for the complete plot of this great work; interesting for newbies, but only after trying it at least once. For many but not for everyone. Vivendi Interactive has managed to secure the license to develop a video game dedicated to ~The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~. Electronic Arts was also in the race, but bought the license for another game dedicated to Tolkien's novel. Vivendi's ~The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~ is directly inspired by Tolkien's book, but unlike EA, Vivendi won't be able to use faces from Peter Jackson's film. The programmers developed the game following the story point by point and adding all the locations that did not appear in Jackson's film. The plot of ~The Fellowship of the Ring~ tells of Sauron, the lord of evil, who forged twenty magical rings and gave them to the lords of other races (humans, elves, gnomes, etc.), keeping the Unique that gives the wearer supremacy over other rings. A knight of the human race snatched the Unique from the hand of Sauron, and the ring after various vicissitudes, ended up in the hand of a Hobbit, a certain Bilbo Baggins. To prevent the ring from taking over his conscience, he bequeathed it to Frodo Baggins, who will bear this burden full of responsibility until the destruction of the Unique, to prevent Sauron from returning to reign in Middle-earth. With the help of Gandalf the Gray (a wizard), Aragorn (a warrior), Legolas (an elf) and other adventurers who will join him during the mission, our Hobbit is ready to enter the legend.", "date": "2002-11-06", "grade": null}
