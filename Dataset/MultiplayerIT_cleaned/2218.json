Let's start talking about the background of this breathtaking sci-fi action. Those of you who have had the pleasure of playing the first episode of the series will surely have noticed the wisdom with which the men of Rage have been able to make the game exciting and original, while dealing with a topic on which everything (or almost) has already been said. , the invasion of the earth by alien life forms, where the player had to defend the poor and inferior human race. Well let's try to reshuffle the cards on the table and turn the scenario around; after having painstakingly and bloodily regained their freedom, the earth's population begins to fear a new invasion, the creeping terror leads to irrationality so the leaders of humanity decide (so to speak) to roll up their sleeves and taking the motto too literally ~prevention is better than cure~, they gather a terrifying intergalactic army and invade space with the intention of ~extirpating the root of evil~. Thus begins a real indiscriminate witch hunt, after having raided planets and subjugated peoples of countless galaxies to the cry of ~Who strikes first, strikes twice~, these invaders ~by chance~ will notice our small planet and will intimidate us to surrender immediately. We little Teraumans (this is the name of the population whose armies we will lead for defence) accustomed to cultivating our fields and extracting minerals from the many mines present on our planet, we are a people who are not warmongers at all but not helpless for this, on the contrary the armaments at our disposal are absolutely on par with those of the invader and terrestrial terrorist, so if they want to stop us (from doing what then?) they will have to do quite a lot. The war for the freedom of our planet will require great skill, also because humans will not turn out to be so inexperienced, and whatever the objective to be completed, let's get ready to put ourselves totally in the shoes of the valiant Terauman soldiers, a piece of advice, however, let's do it first quite a bit of training We will have to face missions in which only wild shooting and other semi-strategics will be required which will serve to ease the tension a little (and also to distract the player a little since in the long run blowing up everything what moves risks becoming boring). Weapons and Sci-fi, what a passion! How many of you have never dreamed of being at the helm of a very fast and deadly star cruiser or an atomic propulsion fighter? I think few, well experienced Han Solo wear helmet and overalls and make yourself comfortable in front of your PC screen, the result will be electrifying. Well, yes, the war of the ~infantrymen~ has long since passed and this is already known, as you will have understood, our war will be fought with weapons that defining ~space~ is an understatement; fighters armed with pulsar cannons (they never get hot is it a dream?), mine-launching tanks with monitor-shaking firepower, light tanks with formula 1 dash, not to mention defensive turrets (ah the turrets!), of the cruisers and of the ~side dishes~, in short, the adrenaline will flow in rivers during the battles that we will engage. We will find ourselves piloting fighters, tanks and turrets even in the course of a single mission, but there is no need to worry, the gameplay is the strongest point of this game, the controls are simple and intuitive, provided however that you undergo a substantial series of tutorials before embarking on the real missions, let's say a kind of driving school for ~heavy~ vehicles. As previously mentioned, all the means of our army are simple to fly, even for those who try their hand at action games of this type for the first time, but a particular note should be made with regard to the air forces, the fighters are in fact, the simplest weapons and at the same time the most effective of the entire ~violence park~, while the land units, in particular the tanks, can create some problems at least at the beginning. Everything is surrounded by a truly simple and complete HUD, we will have within sight, in addition to the classic radar and the detector of the damage suffered, also the refueling points closest to us, the ~workshops~ to repair the damage suffered on the fly and other useful information. Conclusions. Rage is known to be synonymous with spectacularity, and once again it proved it by filling this new product with effects and textures that are so spectacular that they don't seem real. The means are made with maniacal precision (polygons as if it were raining), proftotally customizable waveform, all exploiting the potential of the latest generation cards to the fullest, but there's nothing to worry about after trying it on various machines, we can say that even owners of medium-old accelerators will be able to enjoy the scenography by Rage. The multiplayer mode includes the classic one-on-one challenge and team mode, so nothing transcendental. Incoming Forces makes spectacularity and speed of play its strengths, all accompanied by a good longevity (at least for players less fond of the ~brainy plot~) and flawless playability. A sour note is represented by the Italian dubbing which often makes the dialogues unlistenable, but unfortunately we have come to terms with it. What can I say.Go and tear apart everything that passes in front of your monitorsave the cat though! Incoming forces We played the definitive version of Incomig Forces, the latest effort from Rage Softwares, as well as the highly anticipated sequel to the successful and very valid Incoming: let's see what awaits us. Three years have passed since the publication of the first episode and we must acknowledge the developers for not saving themselves in this period, obtaining, I believe, the maximum that those who had delighted in plying the galaxies aboard fighters and space cruisers at the time of Incoming, could expect. There are many innovations, especially as regards the graphics engine that exploits new technologies in terms of resolution and game fluidity, but also the background is extremely original, making this action game one of the titles to keep an eye on for this 2002. Making a sequel more exciting than its predecessor is absolutely not easy, especially if it's a game that made history, Incoming Forces is preparing to make us spend hours of pure action and fun.", "date": "2002-03-12", "grade": null}
