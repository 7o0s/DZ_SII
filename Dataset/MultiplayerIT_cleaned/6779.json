Run! it doesn't represent Sony's first experiment on mobile platforms and it certainly won't be the last, given the diffusion of smartphones and tablets. The idea of creating simple and immediate titles, like ~companion apps~, can only be useful for the Japanese company with a view to increasing the popularity of its characters. And so, after the not quite successful Knack's Quest, here we are to try Run Sackboy! Run!, a horizontal scrolling endless runner like there are many on the App Store and Google Play, but characterized by a style that recalls that of LittleBigPlanet and its fantastic worlds. In addition to the protagonist, the well-known Sackboy, the game boasts the same music and some of the graphic assets seen on the PlayStation 3, thus placing itself as a sort of ~nostalgia operation~ for fans of the series created by Media Molecule, which will soon return on Sony platforms with the third chapter. That's not all, because even the management of achievements and extras clearly mentions LittleBigPlanet, through a PopIt system from which to check the objects in our possession, buy new ones (also via in-app purchase, of course) and enhance certain skills such as the duration of the coin magnet and more. Run Sackboy! Run! is a simple endless run with lots of references to LittleBigPlanet, but without high notes Rags fly As already mentioned, side-scrolling endless runners like Run Sackboy! Run! there are many on the App Store and Google Play, and this undoubtedly represents a major limitation for Sony production. The mechanisms are in fact always the same: you run endlessly, jump traps, collect coins, kill some enemies (jumping on their heads) and, in general, try to get as far as possible. To mark the progression of the experience we find only an achievement system based on the different types of objects collected and the distance reached, but after a few games we realize that it is a little bit to expect that users who are all too accustomed to this kind of titles magically bring back the desire to play them again. There are different environments that reveal themselves during the longer games and present different pitfalls, while at the same time the speed of scrolling accelerates making things more difficult. Furthermore, the pink-colored areas slow down Sackboy's run and cause him to be reached by the monster chasing him, an eventuality that can lead to game over if you do not intervene quickly with a swipe to the right which triggers the character. The control system is the simplest and most intuitive there can be, since you just need to touch the touch screen to jump, increasing the duration of the pressure for larger jumps, to be calculated with the right timing in case there are more traps once following the other. As for the technical realization, as mentioned, there are numerous references to LittleBigPlanet: from the music to the graphic assets, passing through a whole series of details and contour elements. Only that in this case there is only one level of depth: who knows, maybe by working in this direction the developers could have added a little freshness to the experience.", "date": "2014-11-08", "grade": "6.0"}
