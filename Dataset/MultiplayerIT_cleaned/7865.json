Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon is on balance a compendium of 80s science fiction, but it is above all a continuous homage to the pop culture of the decade of Reagan and the dangerous red, which throws into the cauldron the action ~caciaroni~ full of one liners by Stallone and Schwarzenegger, the visual and sound style of the video games (and cartoons) of the time, the all decorated with a continuous humor that often leads to making fun of the player, just see the initial tutorial which immediately makes us understand the style of Blood Dragon. On the other hand we are talking about a video game in which the protagonist Rex ~Power~ Colt (to whom Michael Biehn lent his voice, the Kyle Reese of Terminator) is a cyborg Commando Mark IV who must save the world, a devastated world among other things, from nuclear war, in which the bad guy Sergeant Ike Sloane, with a metal jaw like the Masters' Trap Jaw, is studying a new bioweapon on a remote island that is obtained from the blood of dragons (read dinosaurs) capable of shooting lethal laser beams. All in a riot of pink and fuchsia sunsets, Tron armor and so on. Pure retro science fiction: as the developers have well explained, the 2007 ~future~ of the game is the one imagined in the 80s. For this reason, there is no trace of the sober and ~clean~ design so fashionable today, but it is as if there we found inside an episode on acid of G.I. Joe. In short, a real gem for ~connoisseurs~. I don't have time to bleed! With such a context, the tone can only be extremely light and sui generis, and this is undoubtedly the best part of the game. It's laughable from start to finish, from when the opening loading screen simulates VCR tracking, to the final moments where a certain song acts as a counterpoint to the epic final ~armored~ fight. In the middle, pigeonholed in static screens with 16bit graphics (complete with hot scenes) is the gameplay of Far Cry 3, or rather there's a slimmed-down version of it, but alas! even watered down and trivialized. The basics of the mechanics are the same. We must gradually conquer (always if we want to obviously, the free roaming element is dominant) the enemy garrisons, to earn fast travel points, but above all the hunting and hostage recovery missions, thanks to which new weapons and modifications are unlocked from to apply. The substantial role-playing part of Far Cry 3 has been completely eliminated, in its place an automatic experience system which, upon completion of missions and particular actions, makes us level up, making us progressively gain different skills, i.e. a good part of all those bonus that we had to choose wisely in the adventure of Jason Brody. The similarities end there. The stealth aspect, or the sandbox approach to taking outposts, or more generally of the whole fight has been heavily filed. Given the generous size of the principals, and the ~caciarona~ desire of Blood Dragon, we shoot as hard as we can, since we are generously armed from the start, unfortunately, however, such a choice shows all the limits of the shooter system of the title. We can always mislead the enemies or even exploit the dragons, but very simply we don't feel the need, also because the ~airy~ level design always gives us escape routes, not to mention explosive barrels as much as we can and an artificial intelligence often problematic. In the same way, even the alarms and related reinforcements are not as devastating as in the ~mother~ project. Where stealth returns to gratify the player is in rescue missions, where in some situations it is necessary to plan the moves with great care, given that in the event of an alarm, the hostage is dead meat within a few seconds. The most important part of the game are therefore the main missions, the ones that advance the story, in which the Rambo spirit of the game works great, also because we can immediately go around armed with a machine gun with rotating barrels. They certainly don't shine for variety, it almost always involves cleaning up twisted underground bases, and when they try to do something different they don't give a relative added value to the gaming experience, even falling into the trap of the arenas to lengthen the broth, but without a doubt entertain with their simple and straightforward gameplay. The strange thing is that when spaces shrink, the brutality and frenzy of the clashes works better than when in theory you could play with everything the combat mechanics offer: forward with your head down, shooting at everything that che moves, in a riot of hand grenades and red-hot lead spewed from the minigun, with music full of keyboards taken from any action based on steroids, M-60s and stars and stripes ninjas. Playstation 3 trophies Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon earns the player 19 trophies. In addition to those related to the progression in the game, there are several rather challenging ones, coincidentally related to dragons, or kill one with the bow and kill a total of 25. These enterprises are anything but easy. But even getting Rex to touch the level cap will be a difficult undertaking, in fact rewarded with a nice gold. You are the evil, I am the cure The streamlining of the mechanics also affects free roaming in the strict sense: the sense of exploration is lost, the island, in addition to being smaller, is less characterized both in terms of orography and of flora and fauna, hunting than in Far Cry 3 played a very important role, also due to its being ~random~ here it is in fact required to acquire new trinkets for weapons. And even the danger of dragons on the loose isn't as pressing as it should be. Furthermore, having completed the game rather easily in about four hours, with half of the garrisons conquered and therefore little hunting done and a few hostages saved, we can therefore say that the whole customization system is not that necessary. Sin. In short, Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon is unfortunately half a disappointment. Mind you, its being a stand-alone DLC of about two gigs of installation immediately makes it clear that the richness of content is not its strong point, on the other hand there are seven main missions, but we would have expected the gameplay to be more inspired and in line with that of Far Cry 3. Blood Dragon is absolutely successful from a stylistic point of view and for how it stages all the 80's action imagery in an original, intelligent and really funny way, but beyond that there is very little. And unfortunately there is also to be noted how the technical system, net of the limits imposed by being a ~downloadable~, is plagued by numerous problems. The level of detail of the structures is generally low, but above all the aliasing is really present and really annoying. Like what was previously written, here too the interiors guarantee satisfaction, but more generally the ~external~ visual picture is rather poor. Thankfully the models are really well done, with enemies dressed in Visitor helmets and suits, the same thing we can say for the lighting, a veritable feast of purple lasers, pyrotechnic explosions and blue blood.", "date": "2013-04-30", "grade": "7.0"}
