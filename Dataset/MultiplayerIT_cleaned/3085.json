{"name": "Mafia 2 Definitive Edition", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mafia-2-definitive-edition-recensione.html", "text": "The years between the 40s and 50s of the last century are among the most evocative for what concerns the American gangster scene. When the second chapter of Mafia arrived on the market in 2010, the gaming world had just known the Liberty City of GTA IV and the open world craze was slowly engulfing the entire market. After a decade the situation hasn't changed so much and Mafia II Definitive Edition arrives at a particular moment, both historical and global and also as regards the transition year between one generation and the next. Waiting to have in our hands the entirety of the recently announced Trilogy (especially the remake dedicated to the first chapter, to be released on August 28, to which is added the third released today) we were able to spend a handful of hours again in contact with the second born. The review of Mafia II Definitive edition therefore enjoys a particular duality: on the one hand the awareness of what it meant in its time and of the almost obligatory attempt by 2k Czech to give an alternative oper world to its own series; on the other, the full awareness of the production impossibility of competing with Rockstar and the strange encounter between a linear title and its rather cumbersome and uninspired open nature. Hi, I'm Vito Scaletta Mafia has always been synonymous with storytelling. The first chapter is still today an authority from this point of view and its direct sequel, despite a long and troubled development, is based precisely on its main campaign. The protagonist responds to the name of Vito Scaletta, born in Italy but soon having moved to America with his family, he represents the stereotype of the young man who emigrated overseas in the first decades of the 1900s. Poor family, a father full of debts and bad friendships are elements that lead him against his will to be caught in the act during a theft, with the consequence of being brought back to Italy to help in the liberation of the peninsula during the Second World War. Back in America due to a gunshot, he will find a way to be discharged forever from the army, hoping to resume a social climb that will make him forget his modest origins. From this plot a fifteen-hour long story unfolds and divided into chapters. Marked in the middle by a further and long passage of time, useful to tell the psychological evolution of Vito, as well as the radical social change from the post-war period to the economic boom of the fifties, strengthened by the abandonment of the winter and snowy climate in favor of a milder and more luxuriant. Mafia II is, like its homonymous brothers, a work that pushes hard on emotions, wanting to tell an adult and raw story, which spares nothing and nobody, as life has taught the protagonists themselves. Vito is a man of low lineage who, as often happens, is willing to get his hands dirty in order to live with his head held high among the greats. He will discover the joys and pains of his choices, up to a bitter but somehow right ending. An interweaving that never reaches the glories of the first unforgettable chapter but which still today, ten years later, will be able to give you some moments of the highest scenic value. An all too linear free roaming Mafia II received several high praise upon its release. We have already analyzed the period of the arrival on the market and undoubtedly the push of the memory of the first chapter has helped a lot in the general reception, both of the press and of the fans. As time went by, we realized, despite ourselves, the important problems and the difficulty encountered in creating a highly linear game within an open world. The difficult coexistence with GTA, which at that time reached the fourth chapter and was able to show off a splendid and enormous Liberty City, evidently weighed on the minds of the guys at 2K, to the point of deciding to work even more assiduously on their vision of the open world which, unfortunately, never really worked. Mafia II is a schizophrenic title, which launches the player into a series of missions that mark the passage of time between an awakening and a new moment of rest. There is never the real feeling of having freedom of movement, dictated only by a city full of details, but reduced in size and mortally dull. Apart from a handful of restaurants, clothing stores and workshops, the rest of the interiors are entrusted to campaign missions that limit the area only to that specific moment. Forget the freedom to choose which mission to undertake, just as it will be useless to try to think of finding secondary assignments (here called jobs and reduced to the bone). From thispoint of view Mafia II miserably fails its purpose and, what makes it more angry, is that it does it for the one and only need to satisfy a market that would not have accepted it otherwise. As if that weren't enough, this pushes into the background a shooting system and a driving model that are still able to make school within the genre. Even aficionados of completionism who are not yet tired of collectibles will be able to hunt down about fifty Playboy magazines and more than a hundred wanted posters, closing the set of accessory elements here.Obviously this ~definitive~ version inserts it also contains all the DLCs sold separately in the days and months following the original release. We can't help but talk about it because these packages totally go beyond what we have analyzed so far regarding the free exploration component of the game. Whether it's Jimmy or Joe (the two protagonists of the additional content) they do nothing but push right on the freedom of movement, choice of assignment and ~juggling~. Furthermore, the first of these packages was already installed in the original game at the time, however requiring the purchase separately to unlock its use. The Mafia II DLCs only confirm unequivocally how the free roaming structure of the GTA was conceived and created as something totally collateral, perhaps even added to more than advanced development. Paradoxically, the stories of Jimmy and Joe (who in the first case does not even have cutscenes, but only signs with written texts), dramatically lengthen the duration of the game, precisely by bringing into play robberies, firefights and secondary pursuits that raise the name of the arcade experience. On the contrary, however, they are also preparatory to definitively unmask an artificial intelligence so deficient and scripted, as to make even that of the progenitor, who has been out for almost twenty years, pale. What remains in the gameplay is a discreet system of escape from the police that is not limited to play with meetings with steering wheels, but which also requires you to eliminate the traces of your crimes by changing clothes, car license plates or repainting. The Definitive Edition Mafia II was technically sumptuous already at its release and if you were to start the day one version today again you would be surprised at how well it could have aged, especially on the management of lights and reflections, as well as in the car models. This revision, made by the d3t guys, doesn't distort the final result but pushes up the resolution of all those elements previously left on the sidelines. This results in a generally frightening level of detail, which doesn't renovate models or add polygons where none exist, but works with light and refraction in an honestly frightening way, reaching extraordinary heights in the exteriors and interiors of cars, a deeply felt element of the production.Less impressive are the models of secondary characters and passers-by, as well as backdrops that feel, in this case, the weight of time and the lack of care already on its original release.Dubbing into Italian remained the average discreet ten years ago, which alternates sufficiently interesting characters, with others totally out of place. The soundtrack, both original and licensed, is splendid as always, with a series of songs that made radio history between the 1940s and 1950s.", "date": "2020-05-19", "grade": "8.0"}
