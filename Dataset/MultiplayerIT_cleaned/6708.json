The only ones who were unable to express their opinion were the owners of Wii U, excluded from the original release of the title and forced to have to wait until later to be able to get their hands on the game. Now that their turn has finally come, let's see if the wait served Watch Dogs to show up for the appointment in the best possible shape. Six months and not hear them As is our custom in cases of this kind, we refer you to our original review to find out everything there is to know about Watch Dogs, while here we will focus exclusively on the features of the conversion for the Nintendo machine. Usually, a title that comes out on a console so many months away from other platforms enjoys favorable treatment, at best offering some extra thick content capable of making even those who had already enjoyed the gaming experience falter on a different system. Unfortunately this is not the case with Watch Dogs on Wii U, which can't even count on an extra vehicle, weapon or mission, for the sake of all those who still harbored some faint hope of a sort of gift from by Ubisoft to make amends for a six-month late port. Adding insult to injury, given that - as has already been widely known - Nintendo users will not even be able to download the Bad Blood DLC released last September, and will also be excluded from any further expansions. A very small consolation is represented by two paid packages available from the launch on the eShop, called Conspiracy (4.99) and Access Granted Pack (6.99), which consist respectively of a new Digital Trip and a set of three extra missions, six new skins and a couple of additional skills for Aiden. On the other hand, the online features of the product remain unchanged, providing players with the ability to invade other users' games and try to steal data packets to get experience points. Moving on to the age-old question of the exploitation of the GamePad, Watch Dogs does the proverbial minimum wage: the controller display is only used to host a trivial albeit comfortable map in which destinations can be set with simple taps, while the option to move the game screen from the TV to the touch screen at any time. Devoid of extras and with an imperfect technical realization, Watch Dogs on Wii U is only a modest port The old man advancing Moving on to the technical side, Watch Dogs on Wii U is not exactly what one could define as a manifesto of the potential of Nintendo hardware: far from representing a middle ground between versions for new and old generation consoles, the work of Ubisoft Bucharest is much more aligned with the latter, showcasing some slight improvements but also some less refined elements. The game runs at a resolution of 1152x648 with anti-aliasing in post processing, offering image clarity and texture definition that are almost indistinguishable from those seen on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Going to nitpick, you can notice some graphic details that are more cared for on Wii U, but these are small things of the caliber of some more likely surfaces or vaguely more full-bodied shadows. It can be said that the glance on Wii U is still more pleasant thanks to the constant activation of the V-sync which removes the typical tearing phenomena, for example of the PlayStation 3 version, but unfortunately this is a factor that has consequences quite serious about the frame rate, which is generally lower than its older generation counterparts. The phenomenon is easily bearable if you go around on foot, but it starts to become a problem when you use a vehicle, which is not exactly a negligible detail for a free roaming that involves extensive use of means of transport: driving a car , Watch Dogs on Wii U dips well below 30 frames per second, suffering further drops in wet weather and visibly stumbling when things get a little crowded and maybe even a few explosions get in the way.", "date": "2014-12-03", "grade": "6.8"}
