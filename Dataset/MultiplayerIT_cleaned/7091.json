Keiji Inafune and his colleagues from Comcept, assisted by SCE Japan Studio, have in fact interpreted in the best possible way the need to create a product that on the one hand was similar to the very popular (at least in Japan) Monster Hunter, on the other introduced unique elements and strongly characterizing; in this case a very inspired narrative, which manages to be original while boasting numerous contaminations, projecting us into a dark world, vaguely medieval fantasy, in which an order of sorcerers takes care of protecting people from the threat of monsters. But what happens when one of these mystical warriors loses his mind and becomes too powerful? We find out in the incipit, a sequence that mixes cutscenes and real action to put us in the shoes of a prisoner who is about to meet a horrible end, ~absorbed~ in flesh and soul by the evil Magusar. The character casually comes into possession of a talking book, the Librom, which offers him a pact: by reading the stories written on its pages, he will be able to acquire the powers of a sorcerer and try to challenge his tormentor, with a view to a rite that has the scent of reincarnation. And so the adventures of this nameless warrior are relived, who is immediately faced with very difficult choices and comes into contact with supporting actors and shady figures during his numerous missions, aimed at eliminating dark creatures as they get stronger and dangerous. A sequence of bosses, in practice, regulated by two peculiar mechanics: the combat system, based on a total of six ~offers~ that we can modify and enhance, and which include elemental or physical type attacks, ideal for short or long distances; and the choice of saving or sacrificing defeated opponents, so as to respectively increase resistance and health rather than power and availability of raw materials for spells. One of the peculiarities of the game is in fact the need to use the offers sparingly so as not to run out of them prematurely, trying to ~recharge~ them as soon as possible so as not to have to give up one of one's offensive possibilities. Soul Sacrifice Delta is an optimized and richer version of the original: not to be missed The ultimate sacrifice Soul Sacrifice Delta in many ways represents a new launch for the survival action produced by Sony, which evidently in the first stint had not completely convinced the owners of PlayStation Vita or had failed to act as the driving force for sales that the publisher hoped could also be in the West. It is clear that those who already own the original game will have turned up their noses at the news of the release of an ~extended~ version, which however has a relatively accessible price (29.99 euros) and the possibility of importing the save file of Soul Sacrifice, so that we can continue the long and challenging campaign where we left off, without losing progress and having to start over. The news, let's face it right away, goes beyond our expectations: the developers didn't limit themselves to adding a series of extra missions, but they worked on balancing the gameplay to smooth out the more cumbersome situations of the first version and also carried out a technical optimization that makes the graphics more defined and fluid. Accustomed to certain ~Monster Hunter-like~ dynamics for boss fights, we found ourselves moving in a much more agile and safe way in the scenarios, certainly also thanks to the experience already gained last year, and to conclude in acceptable times clashes that originally lasted too long. Some animations have therefore been speeded up, it was decided to ~unlock~ the evasive maneuver in case of need and also the behavior of the virtual camera seemed more attentive to us, less inclined to throw tantrums. The end result is a faster and more intuitive gameplay, less wooden and therefore inclined to welcome all those who want to try their hand at the Soul Sacrifice experience for the first time without being stunned and frustrated. PSVita trophies There are 56 Trophies obtainable by playing Soul Sacrifice Delta. Some of them are unlocked simply by joining the three factions and completing certain narrative arcs, but there is also the ~numeric~ component in many cases and that relating to the quality of the performance, i.e. battles completed without suffering damage and in particularly short times. Dark fairy tales Beyond the filings, Soul Sacrifice Delta also stands out in terms of content. The presence of an editor for pemuch richer and more multifaceted characters, which now also allows you to blend together some solutions to get exactly the look we want, paves the way for an adaptation of the already substantial campaign with respect to the grafts of DLC and other completely new missions. This is how you come across the faction system. Our sorcerer belongs to the order of Avalon, characterized by the ruthlessness of its warriors towards demons, who are seen as aberrations to be erased at any cost and to have no mercy on. At a certain point in the story, after the first narrative phases that some of you will undoubtedly remember, however, we are given the opportunity to move on to the Sanctuary faction, which was introduced with the ~Saviors of Heresy~ DLC and is made up of individuals charitable, who aim to save the souls of demons rather than sacrifice them; or to the third, unpublished Grimm faction, which with its name recalls a fairytale world from which it draws in an at least original way, putting us on the trail of a bizarre ~Little Red Riding Hood~ in an enchantress version and placing us in front of terrible opponents such as The Three Little Pigs ( an armored aberration with three pigs' heads in his chest, shield and mace), Snow White (a sort of soul locked up in a mirror, with lots of horrible minions that cause it to move, like a centipede) and Little Riding Hood Original Red (with the fearsome face of an old woman peeking out from the chest of a wolf's head armor). The decision to inspire the aesthetics of the new grafts to the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm appears successful and fits perfectly into the artistic dimension of Soul Sacrifice, already ~sick~ in itself, with the introduction of scenarios such as that of the fairy tale land, with nice houses and huge donuts decorating the streets, or the disturbing one with the remains of an enormous queen with a long neck like a snake, to close the circle of an imaginary in which one often came across the remains of mysterious titans. In addition to the new missions, the new monsters, the new supporting actors and the new offers, the faction system also introduces a different way of conceiving the combination of salvation / sacrifice, to which is added the ~case~, or the pressing of both keys backbones (or the sides of the touch screen) where the fate of a defeated opponent must be decided. Depending on the order in which they belong, the three options produce different results with respect to our character's ability to attack, recharge offers, recover energy and health.", "date": "2014-05-28", "grade": "8.5"}
