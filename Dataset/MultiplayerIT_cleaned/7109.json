The authoring team of the Batman: Arkham series has shown the world how to reconcile character fidelity and quality, innovative ideas and cinematic storytelling, free roaming action and progression, framing it all with a very high level technical sector. This is not a trivial result, so much so that so far the English studio is the only one that can boast of having done so well with a comic book hero, paving a furrow in which Warner Bros. Games Montreal has been able to move in all safety for the realization of Arkham Origins. On the other hand, the guys from Beenox are anything but newbies, given that they have been dealing with the Spider-Man license since 2005, albeit with full responsibility only since 2010 with the interesting Shattered Dimensions; and the improvement made to the franchise is evident, which in the wake of the recent cinematic reboot was able to introduce new and fascinating mechanics, however, borrowing various elements from Batman. However, when playing, the distance between the two teams appears clear, a gap that we will hardly see filled with the arrival of the next gen platforms and which takes the form of a general lack of ~weight~ for the charismatic protagonist and attention to detail, even especially in terms of storytelling. This means that yes, the mechanics governing web swinging have been improved and the touch of ~realism~ that leads to throwing webs with the right and left hand (using the respective controller triggers) based on position is appreciable of the buildings, without which one cannot advance in the same way (with the exception of the park, too bad); and the shifting of the view is exciting when we pass grazing the vehicles of a city that does everything to appear alive and pulsating, as it should be for a daytime Manhattan that is very different from the uninhabited and nocturnal Gotham City of the Dark Knight. However, even here the further cue capable of making the difference is missing: the character sometimes gets stuck in the walls and all of a sudden you no longer feel like Spider-Man swinging from one skyscraper to another, but rather like an Alex Mercer of the poor, forced to run on the windows after crashing into it to regain altitude. It lacks the ~weight~, as we mentioned earlier; and when the physics aren't convincing, when the character we control is too ~slippery~, with collisions that often appear approximate, well, you can see the difference between a development team with the attributes and one that - for heaven's sake - knows he tries his best but does not achieve the same amazing result. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a decent sandbox-based action game, but it lacks something to convince Variety and regrets When we say that Beenox ~trying hard~, we mean just that: the ten, twelve hours that make up the campaign of The Amazing Spider-Man 2, more or less lasting depending on the number of secondary issues with which you engage, express clearly the desire to go beyond what has been done previously, play with fan service and stealth action, exploit the well-known spider sense while also taking some liberties and guaranteeing, in all this, an extended playground, perhaps not splendid to see (criminals are all the same and there are many, perhaps too many concessions to a way of rendering graphics not one but two generations old - see Aunt May's hair) but undoubtedly full of things to do and of encounters that gradually lead us to explore the comic universe of Spider-Man rather than the filmic one, thanks to the presence of characters such as the Black Cat, Kingpin, Shocker, Kraven the hunter and then clearly Goblin, Electro and so on. We are faced with a tie-in in line with the modern tradition, the one that avoids adapting to the screenplay to offer new interpretations net of some inevitable narrative appeal. In this context, there are also extra costumes, skills to be unlocked by spending experience points, the possibility of taking photographs, of having a conversation (albeit an end in itself) with the supporting actors, of balancing our attitude between good and evil (influencing the secondary missions) and even to turn in the role of Peter Parker, even if unfortunately this latest idea does not seem to have been exploited properly. Spider Fist The good thing is that if the movements based on cobwebs can often be problematic, the same cannot be said of the fights: in this fragent, more than in any other, Beenox was in fact notoriously inspired by Rocksteady's work, inserting a counterattack system that works very well and which makes the action quite dynamic and frenetic, as it should be with someone like Spider- Man, also calling into question the spider webs to disarm opponents or hit them with a ~slingshot~ style maneuver. In short, it beats well, despite the shortcomings of the game physics, and the speech extends from standard enemies to bosses, with some nice solutions. Too bad only for a fluctuating artificial intelligence. In terms of technical implementation, the PC version of The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is confirmed as the best of the lot due to the 1080p and 60 frames per second, as well as a whole series of adjustments that allow you to scale performance based on power hardware: improved depth of field, v-sync, motion blur and customized settings for texture quality, anisotropic filtering, anti-aliasing, effects, lights, shadows, city density and lastly visual horizon. Despite this, the game suffers from poor optimization leading to unexplained drops in frame rate, even in supposedly smooth situations. Furthermore, as mentioned above, the graphics do not make one cry for a miracle and indeed in too many respects it appears dated. Particularly the fault of the textures and shaders (after all we are still talking about DirectX 9), but also of low quality ambient occlusion and animations that too often appear out of context or prove to be poorly cared for. As for the sound sector, there is good music and average effects, while the Italian dubbing is definitely not saved: the tone of the dialogues is too detached, which needed greater involvement, and the choice of some voices is bad.", "date": "2014-05-21", "grade": "6.5"}
