Actually, we won't. Final Fantasy XIV is the past, Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn is the present, and in this case digging up the past would be like doing an injustice to Naoki Yoshida and his team, who have literally performed a miracle, turning like a sock a lost cause and turning it into one of the best MMORPGs we've happened to play in recent years. We won't even describe in detail every single mechanic and feature of the game: let's assume that you have read our previous articles (like this one and this one) in which we talked above all about the first steps taken on Eorzea five years after the ~calamity~ that closed the first version of the game. Here, therefore, we will talk about the impressions gained after more than a month of play, after reaching the so-called ~endgame~. Always remember that A Realm Reborn is an MMORPG, an ongoing game that can get better or worse: the vote we assigned it, however, refers to what we played until the publication of this article. The Final Fantasy we wanted Until recently, when we spoke of Final Fantasy, we generally spoke of beautiful stories, of emotions, of characters that remain etched in the memory. In recent years, however, the franchise has weakened, offering far from memorable casts - apart from a few ~lightning~ exceptions - and too intricate plots, lost in a sea of pseudo-science fiction and petty philosophy. From this point of view, A Realm Reborn, despite its ups and downs, rewards all those fans who have patiently waited for a return to the themes and atmospheres of the past, immersing them in a completely fantasy world in which technology represents a foreign body and almost alien. The medium, however, is always that of an MMORPG, and its limitations must be reckoned with. Those expecting an experience similar to that of Star Wars: The Old Republic might be disappointed: there are no choices that change the outcome of the story, the dialogues are often rather long-winded and very few voiced ones, the main story missions tend to lengthen the broth a little, proposing the battle with the terrible Garuda one moment before and the next the collection of meat to prepare a stew. But overall, especially from level 30 onwards, the plot of A Realm Reborn is a continuous crescendo of twists and turns and epic situations, assisted by a perfect sound accompaniment in every situation, by decidedly spectacular non-interactive cutscenes and by a always interesting. Unfortunately, there are some missed opportunities: in addition to the aforementioned slowdowns and some unoriginal narrative gimmicks, one especially feels the superficiality with which some key characters have been treated. Some supporting characters are excellent, such as the fantastic Biggs and Wedge or the gritty Y'shtola; on the other hand, the four ~bad guys~ of the Empire were wasted, who are eliminated without having had the opportunity to mature and blossom despite the promising introduction of their personalities. Behind the scenes move the Ascian, practically the Organization XIII of Eorzea, which promises to combine even more trouble in a post-credits cutscene with enormous potential. In short, a Final Fantasy from other times, set in a world that is finally alive and rich, strongly inspired by the unforgettable Ivalice and Vana'diel: if you decide to dedicate only the free month to the game to complete the main storyline, A Realm Reborn stands as a respectable iteration of the franchise, despite the atypical genre of belonging which makes the pace of the narrative a bit fluctuating. The ignorant FAIRIES The progression in the main story of A Realm Reborn alternates with the numerous ~fetch quests~ characteristic of theme park MMORPGs: kill a certain number of enemies, take this object to Tizio, talk to Caio, collect this or that for Sempronio.. we got the idea. Fortunately, the number of actions required is always very limited and the sense of ~grinding~ that often afflicts productions of this type is completely absent. Quests alternate with other ways to grow our character: levequest, guildhest, dungeon, FATE, hunting log, there really is something for everyone. Unfortunately, not all of these systems are equally effective. The quests, in this case, end sooner or later: once completed they cannot be repeated, and the growth of a secondary class, in a game that allows it, foresees and even encouragesia, is entrusted to the alternatives. Among these, the FATE undoubtedly stand out for their practicality, comfort and efficiency, especially when you begin to feel a certain discrepancy between the experience necessary to level up and the available quests, especially noticeable in the last ten levels. The FAIRIES, on paper basically the Square Enix version of the dynamic events of Guild Wars 2, are the cross and the delight of A Realm Reborn. The idea is attractive, all in all it works, it pays well in terms of experience points (less in money) and makes each scenario much more alive. However, it is a mechanic that ~kills~ the strategy and develops into a chaotic barrage of special effects where it is not clear who is hitting what when, how and why. The technology that supports A Realm Reborn often does not seem to bear the weight of all those dozens of players on the screen and the ~culling~ system, which needs to be reviewed completely, hides precisely those enemies who are just waiting for our misstep to kill us: it is even it happened that the entire server collapsed under the weight of the hundreds of players gathered to face - to no avail - an invisible Odin or Behemoth. In short, the FATE represent the vulgar way to level up, especially recommended for those who want (or have to) grow another class in the shortest possible time, rarely satisfying even because of a community that abuses it by turning into a swarm of locusts ready to asphalt all the enemies in the field. Much better dungeons, in this sense, which promote teamwork, strategy, precision and perfect knowledge of one's class. And that brings us to another chiaroscuro of A Realm Reborn. The PlayStation 3 version We mainly played the PC version of A Realm Reborn, but for the record we also downloaded the PlayStation 3 client and played for a couple of hours to realize two things: first, the interface designed for the joypad and console users is much more comfortable and intuitive than we thought; secondly, the full weight of the generation now at sunset is felt. Uploads take longer, frame rate isn't always stable, image looks dirtier; nonetheless, A Realm Reborn on PlayStation 3 is still a pleasure to watch and play, and bodes well for the already announced revised and corrected version for PlayStation 4. The only problem concerns precisely the FATEs we have just talked about, which in certain moments on PlayStation 3 they are practically unplayable: those with Odin and the Behemot, in particular, are delirium of particle effects in which the lag kills the fun more than the Zantetsuken. I was sure I moved on time! Just as happened with Final Fantasy XI, also in this new MMORPG signed Square Enix the possibility of changing class turns out to be a winning feature capable of making us overlook some structural and balancing problems. Of course, a level 50 Warrior who decides to pursue the career of the Lancer will simply have to wield a spear to change class, but he will start over and will have to face a growth phase without the already completed quests to help him; on the other hand, he will be able to rely on the equipment already collected, on the money accumulated, on the transport or combat Chocobo already unlocked, on the borrowed skills ready to be placed in the hotbar. It is an interlocking game that literally makes us want to start a new class all over again without losing any advantage. The classes, in A Realm Reborn, are sufficiently diversified from each other, despite some small mediocrities: the peaks of excellence in the gameplay of the Pugilist/Monk, with his dance around the enemy, and of the Marauder/Warrior, with his regenerative skills from activate strategically, they alternate with the more mundane rotations of Archer/Bard and Lancer/Dragoon, for example, but it never feels like you're always doing the same thing just with a different weapon. If anything, the sensation of a somewhat forced structure is strongly felt, built on the anonymous basis of the original Final Fantasy XIV to make the fans happy: everything works, be careful, but the same Job system in which the predefined classes ~evolve~ , looks like a proverbial patch. Mixing skills at will is neither possible nor practical, and the limit of skills borrowed from other classes ends up turning all players at the level cap into clones of each other. In short, the system works within the limit of the possibility of changing role and style of play at will, not in creating imaginative builds. The problems, however, are others. The entire combat system, certainly fun and functional, is plagued by two technical flaws that Naoki Yoshida, ain our opinion, he absolutely needs to fix if he wants his game to really break through. The first is the ~global cooldown~ (GCD) which characterizes the use of practically any skill, preventing you from immediately using another one: if on the one hand it makes the combat system a little more tactical and relaxed, on the other it makes the hellish life to roles of decisive importance and which rely on reflexes such as those of ~tanks~ and healers. A GCD at the wrong time kills, there's little you can do, and in the most frantic fights it feels a bit like you're banging your head against a wall, repeatedly pressing the keys as if in the throes of hysterics. The other flaw, however, concerns the absence of latency compensation. One of the most interesting mechanics in A Realm Reborn is characterized by the visualization in advance of the area where an enemy's attack will land: the player can then move and dodge the attack, and mind you that that ~can~ to a at some point it simply becomes ~must~. Well, a movement at the last second is not contemplated: the movement must occur well before the enemy completes the ~loading~ of the attack, and often this means that one must move with a reactivity bordering on precognition, on pain of a good blow in face. It is not easy to establish the identity of the problem. Is it server side? Is it caused by the variable length of the animations? When does the code establish the interaction: at the end of the attack animation or at the end of its loading? In any case, it is a problem that must be solved as soon as possible, because in the most difficult fights it is downright frustrating. A Realm Reborn is the Final Fantasy that fans of the franchise have been waiting for for years Crafting: a world apart No longer wearing the role of warrior armed with a giant axe, you just need to hold a hammer to become blacksmiths, a pickaxe to become miners, a saw to become if--- um, carpenters. The crafting in A Realm Reborn is, hands down, the best in the diverse MMORPG market. It is not an optional and parallel activity to combat, it is not a useless hobby to cultivate in your spare time between one dungeon and another: it is a real separate game that requires the same commitment, if not even more, placed in growing a fighter class. It is an intricate world, made up of interlocking recipes, materials obtained through different professions, frequent visits to the auction, continuous exchanges between players, direct or indirect. A better arrangement of focal points in cities (the auction or the postman moogle, for example) would certainly have alleviated the titanic but often incredibly satisfying task of crafting a single ingot of mythril. You can't just press a button and sip a coffee while watching a bar rise by itself. Or rather, you can, but you have to be of a much higher level than that recipe if you don't want to waste resources and experience points. Every commercial profession learns new skills that make it possible to increase the quality of the object being manufactured, to complete the work faster, however, risking failing it and perhaps even losing materials, and the various actions must be used sparingly, one eye to the result and the other to the available resources. In short, a game within a game that requires time and perseverance. The same goes for the harvesting professions (miner, fisherman and lumberjack) which are decidedly more boring and repetitive but in turn structured as a mini-game that still arouses interest, without ever being an end in itself. We really enjoyed the crafting of A Realm Reborn, but again there are some 'infancy' issues that need to be kept an eye out for. Firstly, the very scope of crafting is quite limited: everyone can produce everything and most items quickly lose their value, apart from the really useful ones whose value is even too high. Crafting would allow you to independently repair your equipment, but one click is enough to do it in one fell swoop from the appropriate NPCs. Crafting would allow matter to be embedded in objects, but the differences are marginal and much of the pre-endgame equipment is simply disposable. Crafting tends to get too intricate: soon the recipes require materials from other professions, requiring a very tiring simultaneous growth or a nice wallet that, once deflated, struggles to regain substance due to the limited rewards and the cost of the materials. Nonetheless, crafting is a rewarding, challenging experience that one could devote oneself to without even touching combat classes for hours.
