{"name": "X-COM: Enforcer", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/x-com-enforcer_a.html", "text": "First impact. It must be said that I had never heard of this game and, after the failure of Alliance, I did not think there would be others. Thus, I found myself in front of the monitor waiting for a prodigy capable of dispelling the mists of this mystery. Once the installation is complete, I launch the game and I am immediately faced with a rather spartan interface, which betrays a certain haste in the programming phase. Anyway, in short, I start a single player game and I'm faced with something I never expected, not for the X-COM series at least: an arcade! First impact. Here is that the tactical management of the teams, the planning of the clashes, the strategic control of the resources, the search for new technologies by exploiting the alien remains and the great involvement I was used to instantly went up in smoke. Now remains the usual Rambo, fully armed and almost invulnerable, who has to shoot hundreds of little monsters that appear all together on the screen. Nothing more, nothing less. The first impact, therefore, was disappointing... but you must never give up and so I said to myself: ~and if instead of having the X-COM brand it had a name I've never heard before?~ In short, let's put aside the prejudices and see how this game really is... The game at first glance The game is the classic 3D shoot'em up, in third person, and with tons of enemies, points and bonuses. It starts with a training stage (calling it a tutorial is a bit exaggerated) and then continues through levels created always with a view to massacring aliens like hell and continuously scoring. Our alter ego can only carry one weapon at a time but can always find new ones and collect various power ups scattered throughout the levels. By killing enemies, you can collect DATA-POINTS, or technology points, which they drop and which will then be used between one level and another to buy upgrades of various kinds. But what is this Enforcer? The Enforcer is the last frontier in the fight against the invading aliens. It is a concentrate of power and technology, a single man/machine that can face entire hordes of the most beastly monsters. At the beginning of the game, we find ourselves in the shabby laboratory of a very sketchy professor, who looks little like a scientist and a lot, instead, like a maniac who has just escaped from a nursing home. Our enforcer will have to free the earth from the alien scum that has taken possession of it. We will have tons of enemies to defeat and some hostages to save. Each mission will have objectives and these will be illustrated to us via radio by the omnipresent professor, who will always be able to show us the correct direction to reach them one after the other. But what is this Enforcer? Between one level and another, we will be able to stock up in a laboratory, where we will have the possibility to buy weapons, power ups and structural improvements of various kinds. Of course, all this has a cost, i.e. the points we have collected during the previous levels and which we can now spend happily. In the beginning, the nature of the available upgrades will be quite traditional, so bonuses on damage, defense or speed, together with classic weapons such as the flamethrower and the shotgun. In the long range, however, we will find devastating weapons such as rocket launchers, freeze-guns, energy cannons and even the Air Strike and miniature nuclear bombs. But what is this Enforcer? The gameplay, in the end, is always the same: shoot, shoot, shoot, collect bonuses, shoot again and try not to get stuck in the hordes of enemies. If on the one hand this poses a serious threat to the longevity of the title, on the other it will certainly make the many fans of the genre happy. After all, it's a simple and repetitive game and certainly doesn't shine for creativity. A curiosity: in the game, some maps have been created in order to reproduce the same scenarios seen in the first chapters of the series, the isometric ones. Thus, we will be able to fight in cities, built along the lines of those famous 'terror sites' that have made our souls damned in the past, or among the cornfields of a haunted farm, with fences demarcating its borders, just as happened in UFO: Enemy Unknown. The secret of technology. We've talked about the game so far, but we haven't talked about its technical aspects. The engine that moves everything is not new from zecca, but it is the multi-used (and evergreen, I add) engine of UT, and it shows. Graphically you can't cry out for a miracle, nor can you be amazed by the visual effects, especially as the level designers have saved on the refinements of the maps. It is therefore possible to find a 'forest', on the edge of a farm, but which is actually just a wall of drawn trees. But X-COM: Enforcer is not a game to watch, there is no time for it. Here, firepower counts, while the fights are always furious and full of aliens. The secret of technology. A non-secondary aspect that should be discussed is that of the computing power needed to run this game. Given the disproportionate amount of enemies and objects that appear all together on the screen, it is easy for older machines to experience slowdowns. Luckily, the amount of polygons used for each model is not that high, so an average pc can handle the calculations just fine. The level of detail, as mentioned earlier, is not particularly high, but fortunately this does not affect its playability too heavily, since after all there is never time to look around. Even the sound remains at average levels and particularly beautiful and exciting music is not noticed. From a strictly technical point of view, therefore, X-COM: Enforcer is rather mediocre, despite taking advantage of UT technology which, although dated, could do better. Life can exist elsewhere... Here we are, finally, drawing conclusions about this game. We have already said that it is a repetitive and boring title, as well as technologically outdated, so it is easy to predict that this judgment will be negative. But not entirely, because in the end I enjoyed it, because I got a taste for shooting without criteria and seeing a thousand colored aliens explode all together and because boredom didn't come too soon. Life can exist elsewhere... What, in a certain sense, saves this game is the simplicity of its scheme combined with the frenzy of the fights. For heaven's sake, it's not a masterpiece, but it can be fine for those cloudy afternoons, when you want to rest a bit. If, on the other hand, you are looking for a game of greater weight, even within this genre, then I can only advise you to look elsewhere, for example there is the beautiful Expendable, even if old, which certainly wins hands down in comparison with X- COM: Enforcer, and I could go on because the list is long. 22 The importance of a name X-COM is an acronym that often occurs in the video game world and brings with it a load of meanings, very often conflicting with each other, which has been growing over time. Although many have heard of it, there are few who have been able to know the first episodes of this saga. Without going to exhume what is buried, it is enough to say that these were two titles where tactics, strategy and a strong fifties b-movie atmosphere mixed in a highly explosive mixture. Success was very rapid and indisputable. 12 What followed was a series of pathetic attempts to make innovative products that, in one way or another, distanced themselves from their own origins. Thus, under the brand name of X-COM, a deeply mortified version of the old tactical scheme and even a mediocre space flight simulator was born. Today, many years after the first glorious chapter (it was 1992), here comes this X-COM: Enforcer, born from the ashes of the too ambitious X-COM Alliance project, which was supposed to exploit the UT engine and which instead, he was miserably shipwrecked due to lack of money. And here we are, in these pages, analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of this last chapter of the saga.", "date": "2001-10-30", "grade": null}
