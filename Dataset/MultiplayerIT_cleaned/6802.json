So let's see if this virtuous path has also continued with the Ones & Zeroes present here, which represents the halfway point of Hope's adventure. In the middle of our Hope's journey The story picks up exactly where the excellent second episode ended, without however that there is any summary to refresh the player's memory: a lack for which we feel like clapping Camouflaj's hands, who should learn from Telltale colleagues how to behaves with a product whose episodes come out months apart from each other. In any case, we find our protagonist Hope inside a gigantic structure called Terminus, characterized by a central area from which a whole series of paths branch off to be tackled in a very linear way (initially only one of the many doors is accessible) and having to undergo a slightly more pronounced backtracking than in the previous chapters. Also for this reason, Episode 3: Ones & Zeroes establishes itself as the longest-running episode of the three released so far, and also takes the lead in terms of plot and plot twists. Without wanting to anticipate anything, we can say that Hope will find the unexpected help of a character who until now had remained shrouded in a certain aura of mystery, and that the relationship with this figure will be the leitmotif of the entire chapter. The narrative maintains a good pace for the duration of the adventure, however undergoing a very pleasant surge in the finale with what is certainly the best twist placed so far by the series. However, not everything is roses and flowers, and Camouflaj's writing denotes some weaknesses especially on the occasion of some sequences which, in the intention of the screenwriters, should have put the user in front of uncomfortable moral questions, but which in reality prove to be rather harmless . Rpublique - Episode 3: Ones & Zeroes doesn't revolutionize, but it is perhaps the best episode of the series Moving on to the gameplay front, in Rpublique - Episode 3: Ones & Zeroes there are some small changes compared to the previous ones, which obviously however do not substantially change a game structure that remains fundamentally identical to that of the first two chapters. For starters, the terminals where upgrades to the OMNI View can be purchased have been updated with new features, specifically one that allows you to locate enemies on the map and another with which you can jam the guards' radio communications to distract them and allow Hope safe passage. Speaking of opponents, there is also a new type of Prizrak to take into account, equipped with gas grenades that can immediately KO the poor protagonist if discovered. To balance the situation, the developers have well thought of inserting a new gadget at Hope's disposal, or a proximity mine that allows anyone who passes by it to be rendered unconscious. Beyond these new nuances, the gameplay of Rpublique - Episode 3: Ones & Zeroes remains fundamentally unchanged compared to what was seen in the previous episodes, for better or for worse: if therefore the stealth mechanics are well done, on the other hand the The artificial intelligence of the protagonist is not so, and it is not uncommon to see the girl move by misinterpreting user inputs, perhaps ending up right in front of the eyes of the guard she was trying to avoid. Net of these minor nuisances, Camouflaj's work is confirmed to be of excellent quality, also as regards the purely technical aspect: despite almost a year having passed since the release of the first chapter, the graphics of Rpublique continue to appear pleasant and very accurate in detail, benefiting above all from a truly excellent design of the menus and the scenario, while the English dubbing once again establishes itself as one of the best ever in the mobile sector.", "date": "2014-10-29", "grade": "8.2"}
