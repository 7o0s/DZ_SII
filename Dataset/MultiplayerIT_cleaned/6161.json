{"name": "Opera prima", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/153693-zenzizenzic-opera-prima.html", "text": "Funded last year on Kickstarter with just over 2,500 Euros, Zenzizenzic is probably one of the most interesting and curious videogame projects passed through the famous crowdfunding platform, starting from its bizarre title which evokes an old mathematical notation from the 17th century to indicate the 'eighth power of a number. Designed by Ruud Koorevaar, a Dutch boy from Rotterdam who is very passionate about video games and in his first experience as a developer, the game is a traditional twin-stick shooter inspired by the stylistic features of the brilliant Geometry Wars, while offering several peculiar features that underline its personality. Strengthened by a dynamic and deep gameplay, as well as a simple but artistically refined technical system, this first work is one of the tastiest surprises published on Steam in this scorching summer. Here because. The first work from a young developer, Zenzizenzic is an inspired, deep and very entertaining shooter Deadly geometries The so-called shooter genre has its roots in the primordial soup of the videogame medium, yet, despite having experienced a period of crisis with the advent of three-dimensional graphics, it has never ceased to excite its supporters, finding a second youth thanks to the modern and experimental independent market. Zenzizenzic is a shining example of how a conceptually simple project can still amaze in terms of mechanics and involvement, driven by the insights introduced by its developer. The title is basically divided into two main sections, namely the Classic one, which can also be played in a local cooperative, and the one defined as Macro, which winks at some typical characteristics of the so-called roguelikes. Let's proceed in order. In the classic mode it is possible to face five distinct levels in three difficulties, namely Normal, Hard and Very Hard, and the aim of the game, as well as accumulating the best score to be placed in the online ranking, lies in reaching and defeating the huge boss of the moment . The levels are conceived as single entities, but for the more daring it is possible to tackle them in sequence in the so-called Gauntlet mode, added through a stretch goal (the only one hit) in the Kickstarter campaign. The player controls a sort of square ship that can move freely in space and fire in any direction, with a much more in-depth control system than one would expect from such a title. First of all, it is possible to change the speed of the movements by holding down the two triggers on the Xbox joypad, with a direct effect also on the power of the shots fired. These commands not only become essential to dodge the rain of enemy bullets, which can literally flood the screen, but also to get the better of the so-called bonus levels, a series of unlockable challenges by obtaining a certain score before facing the boss. They are all linked to the millimetric precision of the movements, and in the first, for example, you have to control the ship through a labyrinth trying not to impact on the walls. The fire system is also very thorough, with a series of upgrades and above all secondary weapons (to be launched with the RB and LB keys) ranging from huge laser beams to homing missiles, passing through black holes, teleporters and so on, all related to the consumption of the special rechargeable bar. At the start of each level you have three lives, but by investing a part of the accumulated points (at the Normal level they are five hundred thousand) and by pressing the X key it is possible to regain the lost ones. Then there are the shields and the moves that can get us out of the way by destroying all the projectiles and the surrounding enemies, at least the weaker ones. One of the most intriguing aspects of Zenzizenzic lies in the total absence of frustration despite the considerable level of difficulty; this is also due to the fact that failures always lead to earning points, which can be invested to buy new levels (only the first is available at the beginning), training missions for bosses and stage bonuses, new secondary weapons and new modes. There is always something to do in terms of objectives, and being able to complete each level 100% is a very satisfying undertaking. The second mode called Macro is an ~open world~ variant of the classic one, offering larger maps with randomly generated enemies, a shop where you can buy upgrades, slots with consumable items, secrets and bosses so large that they occupy several screens. Even speed control is no longer free but linked to a special indicator. In this mode to raise the score is much morecomplex than in the classic one, just as the confrontations with the bosses are more difficult, which appear after filling a completion bar and require a necessarily strategic approach to be killed. Each classic level introduces a new element to the gameplay, such as the homing projectiles of the third, and these details are also reflected in the Macro mode maps, which represent a real evolution of the basic ones. The artist's touch A large part of Zenzizenzic's charm lies in its very particular graphic style, where simple two-dimensional geometric figures contrast with backgrounds sometimes enriched by 3D elements. The skilful use of colors, at the total service of the gameplay, gives the game the appearance of a picturesque painting with constantly changing fractals. The result is even more incredible when you consider that you practically never suffer the chaos generated by bullets and enemies, even when they occupy the entire screen: only in the last level, where white, black and gray dominate, i.e. the colors dedicated to power-ups, there is some confusion, but it is an effect desired by the developer precisely to increase the level of challenge. The commendable graphic sector, created with Unity, is accompanied by a spectacular electronic soundtrack that remains impressed and significantly increases Zenzizenzic's level of involvement. Composed of Bignic, it can also be purchased on Steam separately.", "date": "2015-07-27", "grade": "8.8"}
