Although they came out just over a month apart from each other, it almost seems that the developers of this new title have decided to intervene on the criticisms made to the previous work to give League of Legends fans, or those who are in love with Arcane, a truly unforgettable experience. Riot Forge, the Riot Games label designed to create a whole series of externally developed spin-offs that expand the imaginary of League of Legends, and Double Stallion Games have hit the nail on the head because they have managed to produce a really solid platform game, with a clear sense of progression, a simple but intriguing story and a decidedly charismatic protagonist: Ekko. LoL's time traveler will accompany you among the roofs and sewers of Zaun, the underground city that lives in the shadow of Piltover, to foil a conspiracy that has to do with those same crystals around which the plot of Arcane revolves. In this review of CONVERGENCE: A League of Legends Story we will tell you about the very classic mechanics available in the combat and exploration of this game and how, thanks to a well-developed universe and a layered narrative, this title can be considered the most successful of Riot Forge so far. Time jump, double jump and rewind CONVERGENCE: A League of Legends Story will give you access to new exploration and combat abilities once you reach certain milestones in the story CONVERGENCE: A League of Legends Story will give you access to all the most classic skills of 2D platform games: jump, double jump, dash, wall walk, court skating (railgrind) and bounce jump (walljump). . What makes this game both unique and nostalgic is the ability to rewind time at any moment, both during combat and during platforming. This ability immediately brought us back to the days of Prince of Persia and the Sands of Time and reminded us how less frustrating video games can become simply by being able to retry without having to restart from a checkpoint. The charges you have available are limited, but the resources needed to fill your reserves can be found quite easily around the game maps. Exploration is particularly satisfying because it is almost never punishing and there are rare moments when a particular section will force you to use a specific skill. Like in Hollow Knight, skills like double jumping or the ability to briefly walk up walls are used to unlock certain sections of the map until you receive them as a reward for natural story progression. It's a little frustrating at first but we understand the stylistic choice because it's a good way to mix a linear narrative with an almost open-world design. Layered combat CONVERGENCE Boss fights are always preceded by a short cinematic and represent the pinnacle moments of the game where exploration and combat skills are combined The other activity that will take up the bulk of your time, along with exploration, is combat which is simple to learn and becomes more and more multifaceted as the campaign progresses. The primary weapon remains Ekko's great sword throughout the game, the main changes coming in the form of scouting abilities which can all be used to also damage enemies in some way. The teleportation ability, for example, in combat transforms into an attack capable of breaking enemy shields, the power to move large objects with the force of the Zero Engine (the device that allows Ekko to travel through time), then , becomes a repulsor that drives away opponents. To these tools you can add techniques that can be learned in exchange for in-game currency obtainable by breaking objects scattered throughout the levels. We advise you to learn the parry as soon as possible because it is essential to stun some of the strongest enemies you will encounter starting from the third level. As an extra layer of customization, Ekko can build gadgets that translate into passive modifiers that add effects to your abilities and enhance them. Each of these takes up a certain number of slots based on its effectiveness, but by defeating bosses Ekko can increase the number of slots available to him. These powerful enemies are mostlypart well done even if one of them is reproposed practically identical three times, but with a different costume. When the other League of Legends champions act as the final enemy, however, the clashes are simply incredible. We won't give spoilers, but two iconic champions from Zaun and Piltover will make you sweat thanks to multi-stage battles, each with different attacks. A map that evolves with you The art direction is certainly one of the best parts of CONVERGENCE because it will give you breathtaking landscapes and very inspiring backgrounds as you explore Zaun One of the aspects that have left us most satisfied with CONVERGENCE: A League of Legends Story is the art direction. The style halfway between cartoon and comic of both the settings and the movies is very much in line with the light atmosphere that reigns in this video game. The Italian dubbing is very well done and perfectly restores the exaggerated personalities of the villains and protagonists. The level design then evolves very well along with the new abilities that are unlocked always having a short introductory section explaining a new mechanic before mixing it into the flow of exploration and combat. The most visually satisfying part, then, are the backgrounds of the platforming sections. Here the Double Stallion artists really outdid themselves and managed to restore very well and in their style that decadent but richly decorated atmosphere to which Arcane has accustomed us for Zaun and Piltover. In terms of progression, then, we appreciated the decision to imagine the different sections of the map almost as linear levels which, however, once the mission is over, can always be revisited to try to obtain the game's many collectibles. There is no backtracking, retracing your steps to a finished level is never required by the story, but is at the discretion of the player. Collectibles are different and have two main ways to be obtained: the first through mini platforming challenges with a chest at the end, the second through dedicated sections of the map that contain either a relatively difficult exploration challenge chasing a robot or a tough fight with 3 or 4 groups of enemies one after the other. The only glaring flaw of this game is the lack of variety in the enemies who, with the exception of a few elite units, are not very varied throughout the game. The problem is, as the opposing faction changes, it is evident that most of the base enemies are the same as the previous faction with a slightly different color scheme and slightly more health. It's a shame, but it's absolutely not a hindrance to enjoying the mechanics and beautiful environments.", "date": "2023-05-27", "grade": "8.0"}
