In short, the endless approach is in the ropes of this group of talented artists and programmers, but after a few years it was necessary to change some ingredient of the mix in order to be able to offer an experience on the one hand different, on the other capable once again of catalysing the attention of many users. So what to invent? The answer is Radical Rappelling, a vertical endless runner, with a personalized rhythm, set in the high mountains, in which we can take turns at the command of two different characters and launch ourselves into a frenetic descent, made urgent by the progress of a sea of lava that threatens to dissolve if we try to stop for more than a couple of seconds. So this is the simple but fascinating concept behind the game, available for a few days on the App Store and Google Play in the now traditional freemium format, downloadable for free and usable without particular constraints: no tokens that are consumed or energy to top up, but only the ability to use real currency to unlock achievements and upgrades faster, so as to achieve noteworthy results in less time. Radical Rappelling is an immediate vertical endless, fun and with a solid achievement system give me rope! The control system of Radical Rappelling is extremely simple and is in line with that of Jetpack Joyride, although the single pressure on the lower part of the screen serves, in this case, to determine the amplitude of the downward jump. The rock wall, which is on the left, serves in all respects as a platform, but it is not the only thing we will find ourselves jumping on, in an attempt to proceed downwards as quickly as possible. In fact, we will have to be careful to avoid the numerous spikes that are found along the way and which, from a certain point on, will not only become more frequent but will also be arranged in the right end of the display. To make the progression more interesting, there will be the many opportunities to earn points, multiply them and activate special modes, such as the downward rocket effect, the ~trampolines~, the portals and so on. All elements that push in the direction of a precision that will have to be gradually higher, and which naturally does not accept compromises: a false step will be enough to incur the game over; but we can always make another attempt, and then another. If the goal of Halfbrick Studios was to pack a new ~video game drug~, we can say that it has been achieved: the gameplay of Radical Rappelling is immediate, the achievements and upgrades keep the involvement high, while the traditional graphic style ~cubed ~ conquers from the first glance, assisted by an effective musical accompaniment, which is so arcade. The only drawback of this production, if we really want to find one, is inherent in the very nature of the game: if you've had enough of endless, simply changing perspective won't be enough to bring you back to your old passion.", "date": "2015-06-13", "grade": "8.0"}
