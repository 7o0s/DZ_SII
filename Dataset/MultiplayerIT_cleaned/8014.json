Instead, the house in Orange Country, California, is not managed to raise even half of the $75,000 it had set out to raise through the ever-popular Kickstarter. Luckily the wealthy New Zealander Chris ~Mobius~ Davies came to help, a real fanatic of Descent 3, the immortal shooter to which the Retrovirus reviewed here is far more than inspired, which allowed the team led by the courageous Spencer Roberts to conclude the alpha phase and to arrive, albeit three months late, at the appointment with the major digital stores (naturally Steam, but also Desura and GameStop). Six shades of freedom It is therefore a ~6DoF~ FPS, an acronym that indicates the possibility of moving on the three dimensional axes: so much freedom of movement, recently taken up by another indie production (Miner Wars 2081 by Keen from Prague), can scare less players ~ hardcore~ and it is for this reason that the programmers have decided to enable the auto-roll by default, i.e. to prevent the spaceship from rotating on itself: to obtain full control it will therefore be necessary to tick the inconspicuous option in the configuration menu. Computer retroviruses are those viruses that manage to disable firewalls and antiviruses, leaving the computer exposed to all types of threats, just like what happened to the software within which the action takes place. Taking inspiration from Portal and Tron, without forgetting the mixture of hi-tech and organic material dusted off with great pomp by Quake III Arena, with countless purple nodules that infest square meters of walls, the Californian developers put the player in command of a spaceship /tool (Agent) Deputy to eradicate the infection from the operating system. The controls can be mastered quickly: the WASD plus mouse combination is responsible for the usual task of managing movements, while the Left Shift and Space keys are used to vary the flight height. Both the right mouse button, which is used to accelerate, and the F key, which activates a scanner whose primary purpose is to highlight the position of enemies and other sensitive objects within the area, deserve a mention. but which can be combined with weapons to obtain particularly effective explosions. The latter are divided into the canonical arsenal which includes the equivalent of shotguns, laser pistols, machine guns and the like: a pity that none is able to return a satisfactory sensation of destructive power. The ammunition regenerates automatically, while constant attention must be paid not to waste a shot, given the ease with which they overheat becoming temporarily unusable. The game structure is basic: it will be sufficient to destroy every threat that lurks within the locations, occasionally solving some puzzles that rarely go beyond the classic ~find-the-key-and-open-the-door~. The action tends to become more engaging as the levels progress: initially, in fact, the guns and the vehicle's mobility are limited, but by eliminating the infected parts of the code, ~kilobytes~ accumulate which allow you to enhance various aspects of the spaceship, from movement speed, rate of fire, shield strength, and so on. The structure of the levels is, pass the term, extremely ~linear~ and repetitive: in the typical situation, after having eradicated the room from the opponents, it will be necessary to slip into ~pipes~ (some memorable sequences) which will allow to reach the next location and so away until the map is completed; from time to time it will be required to retrace your steps (the famous backtracking) after having collected objects that allow you to unlock initially closed portals, but there is nothing that requires a careful study of the surrounding environment. The exploration of the levels is made more interesting not only by the presence of power-ups of various kinds but also by trashed e-mails which help to understand the reasons for the infection that is threatening the system. There is no shortage of goodies scattered here and there that make you appreciate a good screenplay job. Ten thousand shades of purple However, the degree of challenge is raised by the psychedelic color palette adopted by the designers: often and willingly the enemies blend in (involuntarily) with parts of the scenario, making the player's task even more complicated, already struggling with the aforementioned shortage of ammunition. The game engine performsge his work without infamy or praise: certainly we note a certain scarcity of polygons and more generally a poverty of special effects that could have given Retrovirus an edge, but for which more investments would probably have been needed. At least even systems that are not exactly cutting-edge will have no problems managing the title even in maximum detail. What is less convincing, however, is the level design: as already written, chromatic choices and repetitiveness of the maps (all too similar to each other) are not free from criticism, but what is most lacking is an engaging stylistic direction capable of returning the impression of being inside an operating system; Cadenza was not asked to reinvent the myth of Tron, but at least to put some interesting ideas on the plate that could represent added value to the gaming experience. Similar considerations for the audio apparatus, with a soundtrack that soon gets boring and a series of samples already heard in a thousand other productions and in any case not very effective. On the multiplayer front, the offer is complete for a low-cost title: there is an appreciable cooperative mode that allows two players to complete the long main campaign and the competitive one in which up to 16 users can challenge each other; unfortunately the youth of the project has prevented us from finding populated servers (the only often active one is precisely that of the major financier, Mobius), therefore the judgment on deathmatch and team deathmatch remains pending.", "date": "2013-02-08", "grade": "6.5"}
