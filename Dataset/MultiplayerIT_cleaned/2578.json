{"name": "Gunship!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gunship.html", "text": "The first impact Let's start from the package which reveals a beautiful white CD complete with a Military-style label, the Manual and the useful Quick Start guide. Let's say right away that the game hasn't been converted to our language, just as the inadequate manual (consisting of about 100 pages) is also in English. In a Simulator, paper documentation always assumes primary importance and I must say that Gunship! not the best I've seen. It is clear and understandable, but it deals with some aspects in a rather superficial way and this must be considered a defect especially for the type of target that wants to cover this title. In fact, I remind you that we are not dealing with a simulator ~for experts~ and that therefore the technical aspects must be explained to be understandable to everyone. In any case, there is a substantial in-game tutorial which partially compensates for this shortcoming. The installation proceeds without problems and in the end we find ourselves in front of a very impressive menu that looks like an MFD (Multi Function Display) and from here we can access all the game's options. Of all of us, we immediately choose Fly Now to give a first look at this simulator and after a short loading we find ourselves inside the cockpit and from here we realize that there are actually two simulations: it is in fact possible to fly the helicopter or co-pilot. Each of the two figures involves quite different tasks and procedures. Flight model, avionics, and controls Flying a helicopter is no small matter, indeed! There are three controls to control perfectly, the cyclic, the collective and the tail rotor. Holding in Hover (i.e. upright at 0 speed) isn't a feat for everyone, because the three controls interfere with each other, let alone perform evasive maneuvers in combat. But don't worry! In fact we find three simulation models in the options; a simplified one, suitable for beginners, one called Enhanced which simulates the reactions of the vehicle more correctly, but which does not take into account external agents (for example the wind) and finally the more strictly simulative one which is very close to real flight. However I can assure you that the feeling in the flight is one of the best things of the game, with an excellent sensation of speed especially in low flight. Another aspect that scares newbies is avionics (it scares me too, n.d.Pucci). Even to drive a combat helicopter we need to take a crash course to understand, even partially, avionics. Let's say that the latest generation helicopters do not have analogue instrumentation and basically have two information systems. One is represented by the IHDASS (Integrated Helmet And Display Sight System) which is nothing more than a sophisticated system whereby information arrives directly on the rider's helmet and is superimposed on what the rider sees. This is for the obvious reason of never taking your eyes off the action. The other system consists of the famous MFDs (Multi-Function Displays) which are nothing more than small monitors (one or two depending on the vehicle) in which it is possible to see a whole set of supplementary information (maps, radar tracks, reports of damages and so on). Even for avionics there are simplified models suitable for beginners or for those who do not want to waste too much time learning the necessary knowledge to make the most of these tools. However it must be said that the avionics present in Gunship! is not at the level of that of LongBow 2, mainly for two reasons. First of all it is simpler and less complex and then it is not possible to use the mouse in the virtual Cockpit to press a button or a lever which are therefore all drawn and with no active hot-spot. Instead, what left me perplexed is the Way-point system for navigation. On the one hand we find an articulated system that allows us to plan, both in the briefing and during the mission, many parameters relating to our flight, on the other the inexplicable lack of a quick command to scroll through the Way-points. In practice we are forced to activate the communication system and from there, through a tedious series of inputs, choose the next Way-point. Another annoying inconsistency concerns our co-pilot. You should know that when we are in command of the vehicle, our co-pilot behaves as one would expect, except on one occasion: when he can execute one of our commands, he communicates a laconic ~Unable~, but does not specify the reason for his refusal . Imagine what this means during a fight! Speaking of clashes, it must be admitted that the AI is attested to excellent levels, above all thatlla relating to other helicopters. Not so performing is instead the damage system which is very approximate. Ah I almost forgot to tell you that in Gunship! we have the opportunity to drive four different vehicles, the famous Apache AH-64D, the same version but supplied to the British army and characterized by the abbreviation WAH-64D, the excellent UHT-2 Tiger supplied to the German forces and finally the Soviet Mi-28N Havoc. Graphics and sound It 'just the case to say that the pictures speak for themselves! We are facing an excellent visual show, where the 3D models of the vehicles, both air and land, are the masters. The execution speed is also excellent and with the test machine it has never given signs of letting up. The textures of the ground are a bit washed out, but this is not necessarily a defect, while the cities created with splendid 3D buildings are absolutely convincing. Also noteworthy is the representation of atmospheric phenomena such as rain or fog. In short, full marks across the board. The sound isn't far behind either. Everything is faithfully and convincingly reproduced, especially the atmospheric phenomena (hearing the rain from the cabin has a certain effect). The communications are also very well done and are accompanied by the relevant subtitles, also because it is possible to select the voices in the original language of the pilot (the Russian communications are fantastic). Campaign, singleplayer and multiplayer modes After Jane's Longbow 2 the world of simulators is no longer the same. Why? It was the first simulator in which a dynamic campaign was introduced, i.e. it was equipped with a complex software that changed the conditions of the campaign based on the results obtained. You understand the importance of such a system. In practice, you can always replay the same scenario, being sure that this will change every time. Also other titles adopt such software and also in the Microprose house, such as the excellent European Air War (even if it does not reach the levels of complexity of the Jane's title). Unfortunately in Gunship! this system is absent, and the campaign is nothing more than a set of predefined missions. However, it must be said that it is possible to participate in the campaign from five different sides, four from the Allied side and one from the Soviet side. I almost forgot to tell you that the theater of operations is Eastern Europe. Another important feature is represented by the presence of a Mission Builder that allows us to create our customized mission. Multiplayer provides the classic connection options, IPX, Serial, connection via Modem and obviously TCP/IP. Conclusions gunship! it's a good title that can provide you with hours of real fun, and I would recommend it especially for those who want to enter the world of Simulators as it features excellent graphics, a good flight model, as well as a convincing sound. Certainly the manual is not the best, as the mission system and some controls are a bit perplexing. But perfection, you know, is not of this world and I don't see why it should be of the simulated ones. Introduction Microprose offers us a new combat helicopter simulator with the unmistakable name of Gunship!. It seems to me right to make a distinction immediately, given that the market offers us two very different types of titles: real simulators from those that are not. For example, the excellent Longbow 2 by Jane's belongs to the former, while the long saga of the Comanches by Novalogic belongs to the latter. And this title from Microprose? Exactly in the middle, with all the strengths and weaknesses that this solution requires.", "date": "2001-04-27", "grade": null}
