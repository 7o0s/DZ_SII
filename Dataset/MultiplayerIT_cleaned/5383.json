Well, certainly its game formula, which we believe does not need any particular insights, is so simple and engaging that there is probably no video game enthusiast who hasn't played a game at least once in their life, or has tried some of the its innumerable imitations. Well, let's say it right away, despite appearances this Tricky Towers, created by the Dutch team WeirdBeard, does not really belong to this category. The game, as we shall see, is undoubtedly inspired by the most famous title by Aleksej Pazhitnov, but in reality it is a frenetic action-puzzle game based on the physics of the bricks and on some variables consisting of the presence of random magic and the conformity of the levels. Tricky Towers is a fun mix of Tetris, Puzzle Bubble and Puyo Puyo for PlayStation 4 Playstation 4 trophies There are 18 Trophies in Tricky Towers: 13 Bronze, 8 Silver, 6 Gold and 1 Platinum and you can get them challenge after challenge by connecting seven bricks with an ivy spell, or by building a tower of 99 bricks in a infinite survival challenge without losing hearts. Brick by brick The gameplay of Tricky Towers is quite basic and brings to mind many other games of the same genre, especially Tetris, Puzzle Bubble and 99 Bricks by WeirdBeard themselves. In fact, the main scheme requires the user to correctly stack a series of objects that fall from the top of the screen, also looking for the right fit. But unlike the classic game invented by Aleksej Paitnov, you don't have to fit the pieces perfectly together to generate ~stripes~ which, by aligning, then make a portion of the structure disappear, but to build a ~tower~ taller and more resistant than that of your opponents. And to do this you can even resort to the use of white magic to help the structure resist, to compact itself better or to protect it from enemy attacks; or black, to knock down those of others, perhaps by enlarging the pieces of the ~enemy~. The spells are independent of the type of character you choose as an avatar, since they are random. The basic problem is that when the bricks land on the others they do not remain stable as in Tetris, but instead tend to move and with their weight, if balanced, make the structure sway dangerously with the risk that it falls disastrously, marking the defeat of the 'user. It is true that in addition to the support spells, other moves can be used to try to make the foundations of the tower solid, for example by exploiting the movement of the bricks which does not only take place on predefined tracks and can therefore also be positioned halfway between them , or their conformation to hit gently and move the firm ones underneath a little to adjust their positioning, but these are actions to be carried out with caution since a sudden movement is enough to make the omelette. There are obviously variations to the basic structure, such as a series of bonuses/penalties that even ~physically~ modify a level or the pieces, three selectable difficulty levels going up from Easy to Special, which represents the highest, with Normal being obviously the intermediate, and some single and multiplayer modes. The former is divided into two areas, namely Test and Infinite. The latter consists of reaching a goal positioned at the top of the screen first with your elements stacked one above the other. There is a variant of this mode called Battle Survival which imposes instead of stacking all the bricks within a certain amount of time without, among other things, dropping them, on pain of defeat, and another called Battle Puzzle where instead you have to prevent your own bricks come to touch a laser placed by the developers always at the upper end of the TV. The Test mode takes up these three game options but revises them in terms of tests, to get the hang of the controls, with the schemes and the game structure. All the results are then recorded on a special list which compares those of the various users on the web to form a ranking of the best worldwide. But the real strength of Tricky Towers is in our opinion the multiplayer part, available locally and via the Internet for two or up to a maximum of four friends on the same console, or on the Net. For the multiplayer, all the rules described above apply, with the added ability to change the rules and take advantage of special ones to customize the challenges. Side note for the technical sector, simple but suitable for the context, with nice and colorful graphics, plus a soundtrack that becomes repetitive and annoying in the long run.", "date": "2016-07-27", "grade": "7.2"}
