In truth, we are talking about an ancient technique that has characterized so-called roguelike video games for decades (literally ~Rogue style~, a 1984 Artificial Intelligence Design game that gave the genre its start), but let's not quibble. Basically, the system attacks ready-made pieces of the world together following certain conditions defined by the code, in order to create maps that are always different, but solvable, i.e. without insurmountable blocks. The combinations are never infinite, but there are so many that it is not possible for a human being to exhaust them all. Despite the charm of the system itself and the excellent application in various titles, such as Minecraft, The Bindig of Isaac, Rogue Legacy, Downwell or Spelunky, to name a few famous names, there are many unsolved problems that characterize it. For example, the poor characterization of the maps, which end up being piles of level fragments attached to each other, perhaps with an underlying theme, but without a logic other than a playful one. More problematic is the intrinsic repetitiveness of the system itself, which is usually fought by increasing the difficulty and favoring very rapid games, in order to make the player's progression more central to the experience. All this speech does not serve to make an academy, but to introduce Sublevel Zero, a Descent-style space shooter with procedurally generated maps, which draws both great benefits and equally great problems from its nature. What works The story that forms the background to the action is very superficial, almost non-existent. Our goal is only to raid ancient structures, looking for objects scattered throughout the levels. It all translates into exploring the maps by killing the enemies you come across and collecting what they protect. During the first hours of the game everything works like a charm. The tutorial explains well how to move and how to switch primary and secondary weapons. There are also some ships to unlock, all with their own characteristics, and increasingly powerful weapons to find. The variety of the arsenal is very good, even if it doesn't deviate much from the standard of the genre. So there are machine guns, missiles, lasers and so on. What risked being the biggest flaw of the game, i.e. the ease of losing one's sense of direction, which is quite frequent in the 6 Dof (six degrees of freedom), is solved by a convenient and essential map that can be recalled at any time, which brings the risk of getting lost close to zero. The control system has also been studied to perfection, with fluid movements of the spaceship accompanied by a good pointing inertia, which makes the flight model convincing, but without pretensions to realism and without burdening the player's life. Having become familiar with the game world, you can think about exploring it and developing tactics to deal with enemy defenses. All in all, so far everything seems to be working fine. But is it really so? We have reviewed the interesting and problematic Sublevel Zero: find out with us What doesn't work Sublevel Zero has only one very big flaw: it quickly becomes repetitive, to the point of no longer arousing any interest. It only takes a handful of hours to see everything in the game. Of course, in a short time it is not possible to find all the objects, but it is a secondary problem since the difficulty is low, euphemistically speaking. When we talk about low difficulty in this case we do not mean that an accessible title for everyone, but one in which it is easy to find modus operandi with which to deal with practically any situation. We do not want to reveal the tricks of Sublevel Zero, but it is undeniable that having discovered a certain combination of equipment to be used in a certain way, continuing in the levels becomes a walk, to the point of nullifying any interest in hunting for loot. In a similar case the procedural generation system of the levels is harmful, because if at least there was an aesthetic motivation to continue (new levels, a story and so on), one could partially accept the rest. Unfortunately in Sublevel Zero there is none of this and the levels, although equipped with a pleasant graphic style, made up of stylized models, essential textures and a wise use of lights and colors, after a few games they all end up looking alike. In short, the interest curve for the Sigtrap Games title does not have a simple physiological decline, but undergoes a sudden collapse. The lack of alternate modes or other supplementary content makes playing a bit of a pain.", "date": "2015-10-31", "grade": "6.0"}
