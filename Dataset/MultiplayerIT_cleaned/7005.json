Color Zen is also a very difficult game which in the more advanced levels, despite the always friendly mood, can push the player to pull down several saints from the calendar: to remedy this situation, which in reality was not unpleasant at all, Large Animal Games has just released Color Zen Kids for both Nintendo consoles, which, as it is easy to infer from the title itself, is nothing but its children's version. Encore success? Color Zen for the little ones arrives on Nintendo Wii U and Nintendo 3DS! Zen for the little ones The game concept hasn't changed one iota, so let's examine it. As we said in the review of the original, it is one of those classic mechanics that takes longer to explain in detail and you get a worse result than holding the stylus and solving the first level, after which you grasp everything in one instant. But the good Zen reviewer does not let himself be discouraged by these details and tries his hand at the enterprise anyway: the game screen is crowded with various geometric shapes (which, while in the first one often formed abstract figures, here they form nice, but always stylized, representations of animals, but we will deepen this discussion later), each characterized by a color. Some of these shapes can be moved with the stylus, and when two similarly colored shapes meet, they blend together, coloring the entire background with the color from which they were distinguished. The goal is to ensure that after the last move the background color is the same as the screen frame, the only one that cannot be changed during the game. A very simple concept therefore, but which requires, especially in the more complex internships, considerable strategic thinking and a certain planning; requests, however, favored by the very soft and relaxed atmosphere, by a game system that does everything to avoid anxiety and various worries, in full line with the oriental philosophy that peeks out in the title. How, however, does Color Zen Kids meet the needs of the little ones? In the first place, we said, with a graphic characterization which, while not abandoning the stylization and vaguely artistic ambitions of the original, veers towards the ~nice and cuddly~, with representations of various tender little animals, always appreciated by a pre-adolescent public, and in general with larger shapes and brighter, more vibrant colors. Even the music, one of the most valuable characteristics of Color Zen, plays its part: Steve Woodzell has composed for the occasion a new soundtrack, always electronic and very ~chill-out~, but with more lively and cheerful tones, which as always, it blends perfectly with the few, but incisive, sound effects present. Yes, but which version do I (not) buy? However, the main change to the game formula concerns difficulty and longevity, but be careful, because the two speeches may be less connected than it seems. A downward leveling of the level of challenge in the ~Kids~ version of a game is at least something to be expected: the first stages are on the same, very low level of the predecessor, but, where this immediately raised it significantly, here the curve of difficulty rises constantly, but in a very very sweet and gentle way. More experienced players, and even more so those who have already successfully dealt with Color Zen, will find practically no obstacles in solving Color Zen Kids. This immediately makes clear the fact that the title is actually dedicated only to the public of pre-adolescents: although we know several capable of humbling us to more technical games, you want a FIFA or a Street Fighter IV, one cannot fail to say that, as a sort of ~My first puzzle game~, Color Zen Kids fully hits the target. While the lowering of the difficulty is something justified by the public to which the product is aimed, therefore, the same is unfortunately not true for the drastic decrease in longevity. One might expect that a lower hosticity necessarily corresponds to a lower longevity, but, apart from the fact that this is not necessarily automatic when we are talking about an audience that is little or not at all accustomed to similar mechanicsand, the fact is that where Color Zen had 4 game modes, even if only one really different, for a total of 460 levels, the little brother stops at just one mode and 100 stages. Not very few, mind you, but having the two offers the exact same price, one cannot help but think of a commercial operation. Color Zen Kids would have been perfect if included in the original, perhaps even increasing the price a little, or as DLC; as it is, given the presence of such an alternative on the eShop, perhaps it is advisable to direct the little ones to the original, undoubtedly more difficult but with an extremely more advantageous longevity / price ratio. This situation would have been mitigated by the presence of the cross-buy, unfortunately absent: Nintendo has only recently taken this path and Color Zen Kids would have been a perfect first attempt, given the fact that the two versions are substantially identical. On Wii U we are faced with a better show than on Nintendo 3DS, which does justice, at least on an HDTV, to the beautiful art direction, but the game is designed for a mobile device and this is demonstrated by the fact that, strangely, on the Kyoto home console the beautiful soundtrack can be listened to only and exclusively via GamePad, GamePad where 90% of the player's attention would be concentrated, given the touch control system.", "date": "2014-07-16", "grade": "6.5"}
