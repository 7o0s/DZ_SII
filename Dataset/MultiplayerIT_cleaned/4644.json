Initially released in 2013 on the Nintendo 3DS eShop, the title starring the robot Rusty quickly gained, especially through word of mouth, such popularity as to allow subsequent conversions on practically all platforms, both portable and fixed. The reason for such success is easy to say: Steamworld Dig was a really good game, a sort of Metroidvania in the mine, in which the main activity was represented by making your way with a pickaxe by destroying rocks and collecting resources to resell. All supported by a graceful plot but above all by an intelligent level design, capable of continuously offering new stimuli to the player. After the interlude of Steamworld Heist, a spin-off set in the same steampunk universe but based on a completely different turn-based strategic gameplay, the arrival of a sequel was rather obvious: it was less trivial instead to be able to churn out a product capable of confirming the quality of the predecessor and not to disappoint the expectations of the fans. Full steam ahead Yet Steamworld Dig 2, we say it right away, managed to hit the full target: bigger, more beautiful, richer, even if perhaps less original. In fact, the formula has remained almost the same, but with a new protagonist: this time it's Doroty's turn, also a robot, determined to do anything to find her missing friend Rusty. Yes, because nothing more is known about the hero of the first chapter, except for some clues that lead Doroty to concentrate research in the mines under the town of El Machino. Those who have had the opportunity to play Steamworld Dig will take a second to find the same basic mechanics again on this occasion: the aim is always to use the pickaxe supplied from the beginning to break rocks and make their way into the depths of the earth, collect materials and then return to the surface to sell them. The money obtained can then be used to upgrade your inventory, while the discovery of special machinery inside the mines allows you to expand your skills perhaps with new tools and objects. Among the former there is in fact a pistol to shoot explosive rockets, a pneumatic hammer to break the hardest blocks and a grappling hook to reach heights otherwise out of reach. As items are acquired, the gameplay becomes richer and more robust, making progression more rewarding. But Steamworld Dig 2 is not only made of rocks to crumble and enemies to defeat: often within the explored areas you can find accesses to caves that lead to limited and limited areas, each with a different challenge. On these occasions the puzzle and platform elements gain more space, offering a different type of challenge. The reward is often represented by artifacts and gears, these too usable once back on the surface: the former allow you to obtain new projects, the latter instead further expand the RPG element of the game, guaranteeing a further level of customization of the character. In fact, each tool has a series of modifiers, in short perks, thanks to which it is possible to activate additional skills or bonuses in the use of the objects. Some of them weigh more on the overall game economy, perhaps guaranteeing the ability to find treasures or hidden areas with less effort, or even to pass over lava and acid without suffering damage. The interesting thing is that the gears can be freely reassigned at any time, thus allowing you to experiment by creating different combinations until you find the most pleasing and effective one, or adapting the profile to the most suitable one in a specific area. Shovel and pickaxe The greatest virtue of Steamworld Dig 2 is undoubtedly in the balance of its ingredients: exploration, platforming, combat, RPG are all carefully and intelligently dosed, and it is precisely this wisdom in game design, together with a constant and palpable sense of progression , which makes the work of the Swedish team so good and convincing. Even the level of difficulty is well studied, because it manages to find the right compromise between stimulus and frustration, leaving a margin of freedom to the player: the bag in which to collect minerals and resources, while expandable, is in fact limited, and once filled it is necessary rise to the surface to turn the contents into hard cash. To facilitate this operation, transport pipes are scattered within the vast game world, or in essenceza the tool for making fast trips. But even these must be discovered, and finding yourself with little energy far from the closest one can become a big problem, because death also brings with it the loss of almost everything collected up to that moment. From a technical point of view, however, Steamworld Dig 2 represents a significant step forward compared to its predecessor which, despite all the improvements it was able to enjoy in the console and PC versions, was in fact born on 3DS. This time, however, the technical capabilities of the hardware for which the new episode is intended are far superior, and the result is evident from the first glance: Steamworld Dig 2 is much richer in detail, detailed and varied, and can also count on a series of very pleasant lighting effects. The result is a product that is beautiful to see both on the TV screen and in a portable version on Switch, colorful and brilliant, which perhaps only lacks a more inspired artistic direction than the good one it possesses. The ten hours needed to get to the end of the adventure are more than enough overall, and possibly there is the possibility of continuing to play even after the epilogue to try to recover all the finds and explore every corner.", "date": "2017-10-02", "grade": "9.0"}
