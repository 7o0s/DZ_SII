In fact, the boy finds himself catapulted into the dark halls of the castle of Harnakon, where he soon meets an evil ghost who tries to devour his soul ... but fails and remains trapped in his body. Together with the unusual guest, with a view to a ~coexistence~ that generates frequent exchanges of jokes, Daniel is convinced that he has fallen asleep and is dreaming, therefore he enters the part and tries to understand where he is and why. On his path stand monsters and enemies of various kinds, characters to interact with and deadly traps, while he explores the dungeons of the enormous manor in search of missions to complete. Released on PC in 2011 as a self-produced project, and then landed on Steam last June thanks to word of mouth from fans and the notoriety acquired through the channels dedicated to indie titles, UnEpic is a mix of platformer and RPG basically created by a single person, Francisco Tllez de Meneses, who dedicated every free moment to his creature over the course of two years, to then be assisted by some collaborators for the finishing and localization operations. A mammoth job, considering the numbers involved: two hundred rooms, one hundred weapons divided into seven categories, seventy spells, seven dangerous bosses, four difficulty levels, three different obtainable endings. More than two years after the original release, here is the debut on Wii U in digital format. How did it go? UnEpic is a great RPG platformer, full of things to do and quite challenging Double screen, double fun? There are some differences between the PC version of UnEpic and the one available for a few days on the Nintendo eShop, but they concern the feeling of the experience rather than the technical aspects of the same, re-proposed in an identical way and without any additions: we, at least, do not we noticed no difference at that juncture. The game boasts decently crafted bitmap graphics, featuring smooth scrolling and decent animations, as well as good characterization for the characters and scenarios. It's all very ~small~ and playing on TV you have to get used to this approach, which clearly refers to the ~metroidvania~ style also for the key aspects of the gameplay, which include a generous dose of mandatory backtracking. We were talking about the feeling: managing Daniel's movements using the GamePad offers better control than the keyboard, and the use of hotkeys for the ~on the fly~ selection of weapons and objects has been replaced by a fairly intuitive recall system . By opening the inventory, it is in fact possible to select any of the objects or weapons available and assign it to a combination of the back and main keys. You can therefore quickly equip the sword by pressing, for example, the backbone L together with the X button, or quickly drink a healing potion by holding down the backbone R and pressing the A button, and so on. However, the most interesting feature of the Wii U version of UnEpic is the ~TV Off~ mode, which is activated simply by pressing a button on the GamePad. Enjoying the experience as on a portable console is really pleasant, and a convenient zoom function allows you to avoid the small size of the graphics and always have an excellent view of what is happening on the screen. For the record, the action doesn't even play on the controller's touch screen when using the TV screen, so you have to choose one or the other option. Metroidvania As already mentioned, beyond the controls and the GamePad display mode, UnEpic is structurally identical to the PC version, with four difficulty levels to choose from that allow even novices to be able to advance in the adventure without running into insurmountable problems . Certainly the approach to the genre is hardcore, there are checkpoints but the management of vital energy often involves the use of teleportation to reach a ~safe~ room where you can save your position and restore your health, after which you have to return to the current quest by doing some backtracking. It is an element that may or may not like it, but it is part of the gameplay and fans of the genre will hardly have difficulty accepting it. On the other hand, the fights are different, which despite the large number of usable weapons and objects are often resolved in a simplistic way, through dynamics in which the victory is generally achieved by hitting first, without the opponents being able to react too much. Respawning of enemies ensuedand rules that are not particularly stringent and therefore it seemed to us adequate for the traditional needs of ~grinding~, given that increasing the level of the character implies the possibility of improving its characteristics and being able to use advanced objects. Finally, the publication on the eShop appears a bit bizarre, considering the fact that Nintendo has never taken steps to promote its digital platform that much, but it is possible that users decide to reward this experiment and that perhaps the next step is the landing on Sony consoles, from this point of view much more ~receptive~.
