{"name": "King Oddball", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/127642-king-oddball-il-re-del-terrore.html", "text": "King Oddball doesn't waste time with tutorials, explanations or introductory cinematics: once we touch the screen to start the game we are immediately catapulted into the heart of the action. At first you feel a little lost, but the concept is so simple that a single glance at the screen is enough to immediately understand what to do. At the top is you, King Oddball, a... face stuck in a meteor or something. In reality it is not clear and nobody explains it to us. That big pissed round face is you and its very long tongue grabs rocks and then swings them left and right, left and right, endlessly, until you touch the screen. At that point, the monster will release its ~grip~ on the boulder, which will follow the trajectory established by the momentum and undulation of the head. The goal is very simple: you will have to get rid of the pathetic resistance of planet Earth, made up of tanks, helicopters and toy soldiers. They just stand there, frozen and helpless, and you have to make sure that the stones King Oddball throws at them. And this is where the fun begins. Here is an original physics-based puzzle game in which we play the part of the villain Balls to the leap The world map is divided into sectors and to go from one to another we will first have to complete all the missions proposed in the sector we are in. This therefore means wiping out all enemies and unlocking the bonus content offered by each sector, such as timed challenges and more. If the first missions may seem rather easy, given that we will be called to destroy just a couple of completely uncovered enemies, already from the second sector onwards the situation will become more complicated due to the structures and buildings that protect the planet's defense forces . King Oddball, in this sense, works a bit like Angry Birds: we will have to exploit physics, perhaps causing chain reactions that bring down a hiding place on our opponents' heads. Some structures, needless to say, are indestructible, and others can be cracked and blown apart by exploding nearby enemies. None of them will do anything to directly attack the monster that came from space (... are we sure it's an alien?) yet taking them out won't be easy. The toy soldiers, for example, are almost endearing: what can they do, tiny as they are, against the end of the world? Well, to begin with, hitting them with the boulders will be far from easy precisely because they are small and, on them, the boulders do not bounce. On tanks, yes, but some will be protected by force fields and therefore two shots will be needed to take them out. Furthermore, helicopters are very annoying because the shock waves caused by explosions or by the movement of elements of the scenario will change their position, forcing us to review our launch strategies. The problem, if anything, is that if there is no Game Over and it is possible to start the mission over again at any time, it is also true that our ~ammunition~ is limited: we will only have three boulders available, and in some cases even less, to eliminate enemies arranged in increasingly complex and diabolical patterns. Here, therefore, the skill and sense of physics of the player takes over who, perhaps by bouncing the boulder from one enemy to another, can produce real combos by killing two or more birds with one stone. If you then manage to bounce a stone directly at King Oddball's head, you recover that projectile and can immediately use it again. It is all a question of intuition and strategy, in short, based on a physics that is reproduced in a very convincing way in King Oddball, even if there are those moments in which - either due to an inaccuracy of the code, or due to our error of evaluation - frustration doesn't take long to show itself, perhaps blocking us in missions that we just can't overcome or that we fail by a whisker. The loading speed of the stages and the variety of unlockable challenges and missions, however, help to alleviate the sense of repetitiveness of the gameplay.", "date": "2014-01-21", "grade": "8.0"}
