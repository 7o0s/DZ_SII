So after having ranged in various fields such as role-playing games, party games and point-and-click adventures, even if atypical, the series now tries it with driving titles. MySims Racing is in fact the latest product developed by EA Games for this franchise focused on car racing, a product that can be defined as a sort of simpler and less complete Mario Kart DS. However, if you love this kind of games and maybe you have tried the aforementioned Nintendo title at least once in your life, you will find the title that we are about to analyze still interesting from different points of view. Let's see where. MySims Racing offers three game modes: they are Story, Quick Race and Multiplayer. The first option provides, after choosing and creating a character, to move within a small town where you can carry out other activities in addition to those related to actual car racing. In fact we are dealing with a sort of mini-adventure that offers a variant of the classic race-upgrade-race scheme. In fact, in this session, the character you control meets other ~individuals~ from the MySims world who are ready to offer him tasks of various kinds in exchange for a reward. For example, they can ask you to get them a certain object in a specific point on the map, or to win a race on their own, or even to accompany them somewhere. After having accompanied them to their respective destinations or in any case satisfied their requests, the characters in question will reward you with colored crystals, which can then be spent to buy new items to customize your virtual alter ego or to upgrade his car. Dizzying rhythms Your avatar, let's call him that, in fact also has his own house with an adjoining garage in which he can intervene on the vehicle in his possession and improve the car through the aforementioned gadgets and in particular weight, speed, acceleration and other key elements of the vehicle. The other available modes, i.e. Quick Race and Multiplayer, offer the possibility to challenge the CPU or three friends, even online, in fast races to the last breath. But at this point you are no doubt wondering how the real race itself takes place. Nothing could be simpler: you have to drive unusual little cars along variable routes such as layouts and settings at high speeds, three laps at a time, using particular objects to slow down or eliminate your opponents. These objects, many of which are collected in real time along the way, include for example a soccer ball to be thrown at opponents to push them off the track, or a sort of explosive mine to be placed under another's car at the right moment competitor or even an acorn which, thrown on the course, creates a gigantic tree which acts as an obstacle for the incoming cars driven by the opponents. Furthermore, shortcuts or special teleporters can also be used to bypass the pilots in a more advanced position than yours. In all cases the commands respond quite well to the inputs received so you will find the game controls very natural and immediate. With the D-Pad you move the car, with the upper buttons you can accelerate, brake or activate the turbo while with the back buttons you can shoot or activate some trap. The interesting aspect of all this is the artificial intelligence that manages the drivers of the competing cars: it is quite valid and aggressive at the right point, so the races will never be a walk in the park, obviously remaining the peculiarity of the title, which remains an arcade and also an easy to use game. Final note on the visual component which is one of the best aspects of the game. The characters are the cutest and nicest you can find in a video game of this kind and the cars they drive are no different. The tracks and scenarios are very beautiful: even within the hardware limits of the Nintendo console, the EA graphics have managed to create very well-finished environments. And just follow the track near the volcano or the one that passes through the submarine tunnel to realize it. Even the town where the part of the game relating to the adventurous phase takes place is quite accurate and has a cartoon look. On the other hand, the matter is different as regards the sound part, which presents very nice but repetitive tunes in the long run, a good sampling forthe voices of the characters (which are however limited to short exclamations) and the roar of the engines of the cars, similar for each car without distinction, but on the other hand we are certainly not talking about a Formula 1 simulator and therefore it seems acceptable. Too bad for the lack of general longevity of the title, only partially mitigated by the possibility of replaying everything from the beginning by playing a new character (and therefore new car, new skills, new objects to unlock), since in the long run it can be repetitive.", "date": "2010-10-25", "grade": null}
