{"name": "The Edge of chaos: Indipendence War II", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-edge-of-chaos-indipendence-war-ii.html", "text": "Still a Sequel? Not exactly. Those who played the first I-War will remember that the game was a typical Space Simulator set during a stellar conflict and in which we play the role of a pilot grappling with war missions. In this The Edge of Chaos differs markedly from its predecessor, given that this time we find ourselves impersonating a boy named Cal whose father, a quiet and honest Space miner, was killed by a gang of space gangsters. At this point the young Cal is forced to flee and only thanks to Jefferson Clay (whoever played the first I-War will remember him for sure), a war hero, manages to save himself and reach his grandmother's abandoned base paternal Lucretia. Here he discovers that his grandmother was a space pirate and since he has no other choice, he decides to follow in his grandmother's footsteps in an obvious attempt to get the right revenge. I forgot to tell you that Jefferson Clay is actually dead, what remains of him is his consciousness that has somehow been entered into a computer. Furthermore, Clay has the important task of supporting us throughout the game, providing us with a lot of important information and suggestions. But the news doesn't end with just the plot. The game sports a good deal of strategic/tactical components, which make it resemble even simulators like Elite. It seems evident that, despite the originality and interest aroused by such a plot, this represents a defect of The Edge of Chaos. On the other hand, the thickness of titles such as Wing Commander or the incredible Star Wars saga makes the comparison with any other game unequal, including The Edge of Chaos, even if the Particle title has the advantage of showing off many other interesting technical and gameplay innovations that in part manage to make up for this circumstance in an excellent way. A true universe One of the biggest frustrations of playing a space simulator is the lack of depth of space. We always have the impression that the surrounding space is ~finite~ and that if we always fly in one direction, we will get nowhere. In fact this is not just a sensation, but the reality due to a system of pre-established and predetermined missions, in which there are only the objects necessary for the correct execution of that mission and nothing else. In The Edge of Chaos this is twisted as it sports a real universe, which has a life of its own. In which it is possible to move from one system to another seamlessly. Before continuing this discussion, I must tell you that spaceships have two different propulsion systems. One traditional and suitable for covering small distances and another, called LDS, which allows us to cover huge distances in a very short time. So I was saying that to go from one point to another you can activate the autopilot and use the maximum speed, but no one would stop us from traveling the space at moderate speed (of course we would stay there for a thousand years, but that's another matter! ). But that's not all: the numerous space stations scattered throughout space have their own life, in this sense a system that generates traffic independently has been implemented. Furthermore, the space around the stations is regulated by precise navigation rules that we will be forced to respect. Then the space is very varied and graphically well done, with planets, moons, suns, nebulae and anything else you can expect to find in space. A real simulation, real spaceships and a real interface One of the features that made I-War famous consisted in the particular implementation of the physical model of the spaceships which were equipped with an inertia in the movement. We all know that a body continues to maintain its motion until a force intervenes to modify it, obviously the lack of any form of friction (there is no air in space. Uh did you know heh heh) only increases the effect drift. This implies some considerations, such as the fact that the centerboard and the weight of a ship are directly proportional. This behavior is such an important component that a useful course tracking system has been envisioned that vectorically displays the trajectory of an object. This system proves to be very useful especially in fights where we will always have to try to ~predict~ the movement of our target. But the physical model goes further. You must know that it is possible to hook and transport objects. Obviously the weight of our spaceship will vary accordingly and therefore the famous drift will make movement much more difficult. The spaceships are numerous and beautiful rgraphically, it is also possible to make very marked customizations on the various types of chassis. Like any good self-respecting simulator, there are so many components on which it is possible to act. A particular mention must be paid to weapons that have a very sophisticated aiming system, which allows you to shoot at an enemy even if he moves from the center of the viewfinder once he has been hooked. It is also possible to manage the energy of the 3 main subsystems: Weapons, Engines and Shields. Nothing new will anyone say! In fact, what should be pointed out is that for the first time this system has very marked effects on the systems subject to regulation. The excellent interface deserves applause, very clear, simple and immediately understandable, even the one that allows us to manage the Lucrezia base, with the various messaging systems, upgrades and all the rest. And the flaws? The Edge of Chaos is a good title but it also has some flaws that it is worth examining together. The first, which left me somewhat dumbfounded, is the absolute lack of a system for configuring the keys from within the game. In fact we will be forced to manually edit a configuration file. Meh! Furthermore, the difficulty of the game does not seem to be dosed correctly and therefore we would find ourselves facing very difficult missions with others that turn out to be excessively simple. Another questionable choice consists in the rescue systems that are possible inside Lucrezia's station, and if considering the difficulty of some missions, this appears to be a questionable choice at least, also because many times the area in which we operate is very far from the our base, and therefore in order to save we are forced to make the long journey home. The multiplayer also turns out to be a bit disappointing, not because of the construction, but because it is limited to the usual Death Match and Capture the Flag modes. I would have expected something with greater depth, but evidently I was wrong. Many positive aspects and some neo characterize this beautiful title of Infogrames. In summary, The Edge of Chaos is a title that re-proposes old concepts in an interesting way and that will not fail to interest many of you. Finally, I remind you that the Italian version is about to come out. Wing Commander or Star Wars? Better Independence War! When it comes to space simulators, the titles that immediately come to mind are always those of Origin and Lucas Arts, but there are also other less famous, but no less inferior games, such as the excellent Freespace or I-War. Today we are going to review the sequel of this last game, already the subject of our in-depth preview available at this address. So are you ready? Well!
