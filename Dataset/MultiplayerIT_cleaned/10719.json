{"name": "Peggle", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/passione-per-le-palline.html", "text": "Peggle's name is certainly not a novelty in the world of video games, far from it; Appearing for the first time on PC at the beginning of 2007 but then also passing on mobile phones, iPods and more recently Xbox 360 and Nintendo DS, the PopCap Games title is one of the most successful casual games of recent years. With almost 50 million copies sold, a title that perfectly embodies the concept of immediacy and simplicity could not be defined otherwise, but also associating it with an uncommon depth and longevity. The latest version to appear on the market is the one for iPhone and iPod Touch, available on the App Store at the price of 3.99; and fortunately for owners of Apple's smartphone, all the qualities of the original have remained absolutely intact. For those who don't know what we're talking about, just know that Peggle is a cross between a pinball machine and a pachinko (popular Japanese game) in which there are very few rules to keep in mind; it involves having to choose the trajectory of a marble and launch it from the top of the screen, to hit and thus eliminate as many ~pegs~ as possible. Pegs are colored balls or rectangles, blue and orange; only the latter have to be cleaned up to get the passage to the next level, while the others provide extra points useful for improving one's overall final total. There is no shortage of green pegs with bonuses of various kinds linked to the various stages, and purple pegs capable of providing additional bonuses. In reality, therefore, Peggle is all here: throwing marbles and having fun seeing which trajectories they take, how many balls they eliminate and the rebounds they collect. But as often happens, the description in words is very little representative of what the game is actually once you pick up the iPhone. Americans would call it ~addictive~; we just say it's really hard to stop, with the constant urge to reach the next level or improve your records. The large element of luck present is not a frustrating element, but adds unpredictability, making every single ball launch a surprise. The version in question maintains all the levels and characteristics of the original (unfortunately without the additional stages of Peggle Nights), adapting perfectly to the touch screen; to aim, you can simply touch the desired area of the screen, or use a much more precise and reliable sort of lateral wheel. Furthermore, the ability to zoom has been added to further increase the view of the desired area. There is also a two-player challenge mode and a series of ~challenges~ to try once the main adventure is completed. The tested version is 1.0", "date": "2009-05-18", "grade": "S.V."}
