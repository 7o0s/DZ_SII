{"name": "La fatina dei denti", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/133830-payday-2-the-big-bank-heist-la-fatina-dei-denti.html", "text": "A professional appearance, an undoubted charisma and some excellent arguments: the business cards of the ~Dentist~, the contractor played by Giancarlo Esposito in the new DLC of Payday 2, The Big Bank Heist, are certainly inviting and the gang formed by Dallas , Wolf, Chains and Hoxton can only accept his proposal. Firstly because the Dentist says he has a plan to rob the very rich Benevolent Bank, which in the course of its history has never been robbed; secondly because he claims to be able to free the old Hoxton, who ended up in jail after the events of the first episode of the series. Deceived into his lair, as seen in the trailer below, Dallas accepts the assignment and therefore introduces us to this interesting expansion for the excellent shooter developed by Overkill Software. It is, as written in the hat, the most ambitious and complex heist ever made, capable of literally earning us a mountain of dollars if successfully completed, but at the same time full of pitfalls. To make life potentially easier comes a whole new feature, the so-called ~preplanning~, i.e. an advanced and interactive planning of the operation that we can carry out with the members of the group before catapulting ourselves into the action, indicating the ~hot spots~ of the map, the things to pay particular attention to, the objects we want to find already in the building (by paying someone to bring them to us), and any procedures to adopt in case of problems. Those, you know, never fail. The Big Bank Heist is an immersive and potentially fun DLC for Payday 2 Hi, I would like to make a withdrawal Like all Payday 2 heists, The Big Bank Heist can also be completed in stealth mode, although doing so is very complicated and requires the possession of certain skills, especially those needed to hack devices and silently open of the doors. Similarly, it is essential that the players talk to each other and therefore that there are previous experiences for the team, so as to prevent the ~noob~ on duty (usually the writer) from screwing up what has been done up to that moment by being discovered by a guard holding his rifle. Having entered this huge bank in civilian clothes, the first thing we have to do is take note of the security systems and the way the security guards do, in order to be able to silently neutralize them. Then you have to access the server room and hack a first terminal, which will inevitably bounce us towards four other computers. Only one of them is the right one, and while there is a way to figure out which one it is, by then the alarm will probably have gone off a while ago and riot police troops will have started peeping around the entrance. main, down the hall, shooting on sight. The waits between one hacking attempt and another, as well as the time necessary for the vault door to open, are potentially lethal and it is therefore necessary to position oneself in the best possible way, avoid exposing oneself to enemy fire, target any snipers who have placed on the roof and always know where to take refuge when things take a wrong turn. Out in sixty seconds Without going into the details of how the heist goes on, which we leave you to discover for yourself, we can say without fear of contradiction that the developers have done a great job with The Big Bank Heist, giving us a truly complex and multifaceted mission, the ideal crowning of what has been the experience offered by Payday 2 so far, especially at the higher difficulty levels. The map is in fact really large and develops both horizontally and vertically, lending itself to various approaches and strategies. The rifle that is unlocked by purchasing the pack, the Falcon Rifle, also proves to be a powerful and reliable weapon, perfect for this type of operation. Of course, the selling price of the DLC seems relatively high to us if we consider that it is a single mission, however well done and full of potential; however we doubt that fans of the title will have big problems buying it, also and above all in the future, or to prepare for the shots that will be commissioned by the Dentist in the coming months. However, greater attention is needed with respect to the glitches that still afflict the game, with embarrassing polygonal interpenetrations, police officers who remain glued to the scenario without being able to eliminate them and a management of ~witnesses~ that sometimes shows the side of some inconsistencies, particularly annoying when we are trying to complete the mission swithout setting off alarms. For the rest, the things said in the Payday 2 review basically apply: the ~gunplay~ is pretty solid, there is no shortage of strategic elements and everything is held together by a rich and multifaceted progression system.", "date": "2014-06-24", "grade": null}
