{"name": "Agatha Christie: Assassinio sull'Orient Express - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/agatha-christie-assassinio-sullorient-express-recensione.html", "text": "Istanbul-Paris one way However, drawing an adventure directly from such a famous novel can prove to be a double-edged sword, as legions of yellow enthusiasts are waiting to see what it can be like to relive the mystery of one of the most famous criminal stories, with the great risk to be disappointed. Although an alternative ending to that of the novel may tickle the palate and intrigue, we still cannot hide the fact that AWE Games is far from discovering the secret that made Agatha Christie the undisputed queen of the icy suspense in which her readers remain trapped . In other words, we all expected more from this game. Dead of boredom Although the title is one of those that do not go unnoticed, it takes little to realize that something fundamental is unfortunately absent in the AWE Games version. Right from the Istanbul station, an omen welcomes the shrewd player: in fact, it is sufficient to leave behind the first puzzles, which are a bit forced, to understand that nothing manages to recreate the unmistakable atmosphere of yellow. After almost half an hour of play, not even a thread of anticipatory tension is felt, that hint of events close to the horizon. You will soon realize that your stay in Turkey served only to take care of minor annoyances before starting the real story, which sets in motion without fanfare or passion. The interface does not require particular introductions, being fundamentally based on the now institutional concept of point and click; once you have identified the sensitive areas of the screen, all you have to do is press a button to interact, while the other button has the function of opening the inventory. From here you will not be able to mix green and red herbs or load a gun, but you will be able to read fingerprints, get bored with the manipulation of objects and distract yourself with the unlimited accumulation of resources beyond all reasonableness. Dead of boredom Even if from a purely playful point of view there is nothing that awakens from the torpor of the ~already seen~, we would have expected to enjoy it at least for the screenplay, even if unfortunately Murder on the Orient Express definitely misses the target. Much of this journey will in fact be deadly tedium; absent any type of narrative rhythm, you will be forced to literally witness long exchanges of jokes, which, however well written, fail to provide any bite that captures the user and transports him into the thick mesh of the adventure. It is also disconcerting how the amount of information does not correspond at all to the small research request that the solution of the puzzles presented entails. It's fine to want to be faithful to the work of the same name, but at least we give the player something to do, because otherwise they might (re)read the novel. It is not possible that to solve a trivial riddle relating to the lack of supply of bacon, which takes no more than a few moments, it is necessary to swallow a conversation as long as it is soporific between Poirot and Antoinette. Although the dialogues are of excellent workmanship, especially in the linguistic form, the dubbing manages to extinguish any spark of personality in the characters, already mortified by the poor animations of the faces. we give the player something to do, because otherwise they might (re)read the novel Dead of boredom We now come to the puzzles, the leak that sinks a boat already about to take on water. From the beginning something is not right. We understand the coherence, which in any case comes and goes depending on the situation, but forcing ourselves to go back along the market to return a vase that Antoinette ~would never steal~ seems a bit excessive. Then someone blocks our way, in a completely unbelievable way, because they don't find their own walking umbrella, provides the player with what will be the tenor of the adventure from its very early stages. Unfortunately the situation tends to worsen until it stabilizes on a series of actions that will become the routine of Murder on the Orient Express. On the one hand, in fact, we will have to collect an infinity of objects and documents, while in a second time, we will be asked to go through a phase of continuous comparisons, analyses, combinations and new comparisons of the material found. There is no room for any dazzling intuition or elaborate association of ideas, nothing that can bring to mind the brilliant gait of the investigation so well described by a writer who has projected yellow into the history of literature. Antoinette looks more like a bureaucrat intent on archiving work, with the only requirement on your part of great patience and a thread of intuition to understand howassociating objects that often have no logical connection, but without the taste for the absurd that could benefit a more carefree and less reflective adventure. It goes without saying that from such a cumbersome license we all expected a serious and pressing title, while we find ourselves on the pointer a dull adventure richly decorated but lacking in depth. An empty stage The dress doesn't make the monk, and that's especially true in the case of Murder on the Orient Express. The period reconstructions are faithful and finely studied in detail, while the graphics engine gives us solid and convincing scenarios. There is nothing that can be defined as unsatisfactory in the interior scenes, clearly preponderant compared to the outdoor sections, even if greater care in the animations of the characters would undoubtedly have been preferable. While the sound is acceptable, the version we tested is fully dubbed in English. At the moment we don't know if the final game that hits the shelves will have a dialogue translation or not, but if not, be warned that a good knowledge of the foreign language is required, not so much to solve the puzzles as to assist with a minimum of participation in the constant interrogations that you will have to carry out. Conclusions After Ten Little Indians, the anticipation for this sequel gives way to bitterness in front of a pale and boring title. No attempt has been made to offer anything new outside of a nice graphic package, which is only meant to force the player to watch a long series of cutscenes and dialogues, far from capturing the unique and intriguing atmosphere of the novel. When the word finally passes to us, the only thing left for us to do is face a series of repetitive and not at all stimulating tests, failing precisely on the only side that should remain central in an adventure that can be defined as such. Perhaps the most diehards will want to play it anyway, but it remains far from satisfying a demanding public or even just curious to take an excursion into the point and click world of graphic adventures.Pros Excellent dialogue texts Effective scenic reconstruction It was born on the basis of a great novel Counter Riddles totally unbalanced Repetitive and lacking in appeal Istanbul-Paris one way Murder on the Orient Express reminds me of the day when Pierpaolo, disguised as a NintendoWii, tried to poison me on the Milan-Paris route due to delayed deliveries. Poirot, the detective created by the well-known writer Agatha Christie, wasn't there with me, but despite this I'm still here. On the other hand, in this videogame reinterpretation, in addition to Poirot, relegated to the role of shoulder, Antoinette Marceau will make an appearance, who will direct the investigations supported only verbally by the old Frenchman, confined to bed following an accident. You will therefore play the role of the manager sent by the railway company to make sure that everything goes as planned, which probably excludes people stabbed to death or anything that is not covered by an insurance policy.", "date": "2006-12-19", "grade": null}
