There are those who would answer by simply referring to Destiny and vaguely speaking of the famous video game. However, there are those who would begin to tell entire stories of their adventures, talking about themselves and the many other guardians they met during their travels on the planets of the solar system. You will hear him talk about impossible challenges overcome only after strenuous struggles, you will hear him talk about evenings in the company of many friends from all over the world, or even how much everything he has built up over the years on Destiny means to him. Bungie has definitively answered the question, only confirming how incredibly strong the relationship that can be created between us and our virtual alter ego is. This is how Destiny 2 is presented, the sequel to the very successful game published by Activision which put the concept of shooter in a new light, introducing the mechanics of the world shared with other players, loot and instances. The game was shaken by profound problems, including connection errors, weak narration, various balances to be reviewed, absence of content and extreme grinding, which quickly caused players to lose interest, not to mention the considerable cost due above all to the DLCs. One thing is sure: while some players still didn't understand Destiny, many others believed in the project and expansion after expansion the popularity of the title has only continued to grow. Among the reasons for the success, Bungie's skillful ability to listen to the feedback of its players and to utter a very strong commitment to build and improve the game around them. This is how the expansions The King of the Corrupt and The Iron Lords arrive, which confirmed once and for all the direction taken by the title. September, on the other hand, marks the beginning of a new era for the Bungie shooter, which sets itself the task of embracing an even wider catchment area and of recovering all those who, for one reason or another, have abandoned the first chapter. Destiny 2 made its console debut on September 6, but due to the complex structure of the game, we took a little extra time to analyze it properly and write a review. Your story A big flaw in the first chapter of Destiny was in the first place the complete lack of a narrative at the levels of previous Bungie games. With the sequel, the promise was made not to repeat the same mistakes again and to narrate a much more linear adventure, accompanying it with twists and cinematics with a high emotional impact. After about twelve hours of just the main campaign, skipping the secondary adventures and various activities, we are ready to tell you about the plot that outlines its boundaries. Destiny 2 tells our story, the player and the Guardian. At one with our virtual alter ego we will find ourselves dealing with one of the greatest challenges ever, the defeat, the loss of years and years of loot and victories against the darkness. At the beginning of the game we put our hands back on our guardian, automatically imported from the first chapter, but something immediately goes wrong, the armies of the Cabal strike a huge blow to humanity, attacking the last city on earth and trapping the traveller, depriving light all Guardians and making them vulnerable to death itself for the first time. After the initial mission, as shown in the launch trailer, our guardian is defeated and the tower destroyed. Ghaul, captain of the Red Legion, throws us towards the Earth and from here begins one of the most intense introductory phases seen in the last period. Abandoned by the light and exhausted by our strength, we find ourselves in the suburbs of the same city we have watched over from the top of the tower for four long years. Finding ourselves alone and far from the other guardians, we will make our way through the city in the midst of its defeat, gradually going more and more to the suburbs terrified of death and facing those few enemies who patrol the area. In the desperate escape route, we witness some of the most beautiful and inspiring scenarios ever. Thus begins our real solitary journey, accompanied by a breathtaking soundtrack that manages to perfectly evoke all the emotions of the on-screen scene, further emphasizing how much the music of a game can be worth a thousand images. Destiny 2 tells of our guardian, of our own relationship with the game universe, of our journey into the solar system in order to be able to rebuild all that has been lost. Starting from scratch is one of the central themes of the game and Bungie has managed to tell it in the best way, even moremore for the player who was able to experience and appreciate the first chapter but without forgetting the newcomers. The journey faced by the player, as already mentioned, is solo, but this only lasts until we reach the first social area, from which we can begin to interact with other guardians and embark on our journey in the company of old and new friends. The promise regarding full single player support is however kept, indeed, the campaign is specially designed for lone wolves and revolves around our actions. The implementation of the kinematics between one mission and another not only increases the level of entertainment, but gives us for the first time the opportunity to get to know the antagonist closely, delving into his motivations and ideals and occasionally picking up a narrative similar to that seen on Halo 2. In addition to this, the main characters of the game are finally well characterized and play key roles within the narrative, managing to assert themselves and be absolutely memorable and never banal. The avant-garde, formed by Zavala, Ikora and the extravagant Cayde-6 will manage to create, together with the rest of the characters in the game, a worthy tale in pure Bungie style, characterized by epic scenes and a dramatic narrative, broken from time to time from simple humor and some gags that completely transform the mood of the player making the story very pleasant to follow. The music accompanies every single action on the screen, creating one of the most beautiful audiovisual works ever. In fact, the sound sector assumes a narrator function in the latest Bungie effort, radically sculpting the mood of the scene. Destiny 2 is confirmed as a game in which the soundtrack is not a simple side dish, but is transformed into an active element of the narrative itself. Companies, patrols and worlds to explore. The narrative component is not limited only to the main story. Each planet, in addition to being drastically larger in terms of game map than the previous chapter, offers its own storyline through adventures and businesses. Regardless of the planet, we will have a non-player character at our disposal who will assign us real missions to carry out. Unlike the patrols, which do not include any narrative component, the adventures aim to tell the events that are affecting that planet, also leading the player to better explore the game map without this being boring or trivial. Speaking of the game map and exploration, the lost sectors are introduced. These are real dungeons in which the player can enter to finally defeat a small boss and obtain precious loot. The care of the scenarios is exemplary and some Lost Sectors only confirm it. The collectible system almost completely disappears, with the exception of some objects to examine, replaced by secrets to discover and loot to collect in the various game areas. However large, the game maps do not sacrifice detail by providing highly suggestive scenarios and seasoning the more open areas with mini events, lots of enemies and public events. The latter dynamic has been slightly revised, it is in fact possible to trace the public event we are interested in from the game map and have a precise timer on the start time so that we can make a quick trip to the nearest area and catapult in the action when the event has started. The promise concerning the disappearance (or almost disappearance) of the need to go into orbit to move from one destination to another is also kept. Whatever the planet we will have various areas available with relative rapid travel: it will therefore be enough to open the map and select the point to move to and in a matter of seconds we will find ourselves ready to massacre enemies without having to deal with eternal uploads. In case you want to reach another planet, always through the game map you can access the various destinations and choose a point in which to land, however here we will face the classic journey into orbit with consequent loading, but the immediacy with which you choose now a destination makes it unthinkable to go back to the old system. In short, if the exploratory component of the first Destiny was almost a side dish to the game itself, limiting the player to go over and over again in the same areas, here we find ourselves with incredibly larger and more detailed maps and a drastically more fluid navigation system that make the game universe an adventure to be discovered. Endgame and PvP While the previous paragraphs are so confidently written, the endgame and PvP are the only two aspects we still have much to discuss.open. At present, the game includes a playlist made up of 6 standard assaults (one of which is exclusive to PlayStation 4) of low light level and which cannot be defined as a challenge for a well-equipped guardian. A small exception is the Cala la Notte playlist, a single assault available in two different difficulties and with very generous rewards but with a high level of challenge, which requires coordination with your companions to be overcome. The Cala la Notte is one of the weekly rituals, an unmissable appointment that sees the attacks that are part of it completely transformed thanks to the system of modifiers that alter its behavior. Once he gets his weekly reward, the player will then want to move on to other activities and, in the absence of anything else currently, will probably end up moving into the PvP component via the Crucible. As we have already explained in our previous articles, this mode has been completely redesigned to favor 4v4 fights characterized by a longer time to kill and more reasoned and less impulsive fights. Individual ability is abandoned in favor of team play, which is necessary regardless of whether you are playing in a quick or competitive game. Precisely these last two entries are the only two playlists available at the moment, depriving the player of any freedom of choice. Note once again the absence of a ranking system also for the competitive component, currently leaving a very mysterious and not very transparent matchmaking. Taking a look towards the future, the Destiny 2 endgame is already well defined compared to the past: the incursion mode will be introduced as early as the second week of the game, a cooperative PvE challenge where 6 players will have to face various bosses and deal with complex mechanics in order to be able to triumph and obtain exclusive rewards and to level up further. On the PvP side we find instead the competitive tournament ~The Trials of the Nine~ in which the guardians will have to clash in competitive modes and come out completely unscathed after 9 games to be able to overcome them and access their rewards. By the end of the month the factions will then be introduced, placing the player in front of the choice of his own alignment and then begin to actively contribute with each activity done. In this regard, Bungie has stated that the faction system has been completely overhauled and that they will play a key role in the entire gaming experience. Last but not least, the Iron Banner will return in October, guaranteeing frenetic PvP matches and lots of loot for our Guardians. Overall, it's extremely early to talk about Endgame as we've only been able to taste the first week of the game. The calendar of activities for the month was recently unveiled by the development team, undoubtedly piquing our interest and reassuring us about the upcoming content, but until we have been able to try a little bit of everything, talking about all this is still premature and we will have way to explore it all at a later time. All very nice but how long can it last? At this point you will have had a fairly precise idea of what Destiny 2 is able to offer you but you will have understood equally well that the work by Bungie is, and will always be, constantly evolving. It will vary and transform with the release of DLC and additional content but these will never be simple marginal additions to the game ecosystem, instead resulting in fundamental components that will change its DNA. It is precisely for this reason that our review comes out today, to make you understand the central experience of Destiny what it is, while we will be able to follow its evolution in the future with constant specials and insights. However, conclusions can be drawn to date for what is on offer: once you get past the main campaign and get to the twentieth level, Destiny almost completely puts aside the beautiful storytelling and epic tales to leave you in a world full of things to do but extremely repetitive. The grinding and farming necessary to reach a sufficiently high level are still there waiting for you, with infinitely repeatable missions and activities that in any case deplete the original initial thrust quite quickly. Destiny 2 is, like its predecessor, a game that wears out quickly, it's a content voracious title, like a car that needs constant refueling in order to continue quickly. However, the starting package is worth all the money spent at the moment, given that between the new raid released these days (completed in about six hours from launch), the twelve or more hours of the campaign and the dozens of hours to bring at least one character at approx", "date": "2017-09-14", "grade": "8.3"}
