{"name": "La Gang del Bosco", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/la-gang-del-bosco.html", "text": "Mutant turtles The protagonists of this new animated feature film are some, er, wild animals; mainly a raccoon, a tortoise, a fox, a skunk, a couple of hedgehogs etc. etc. They all live together in a forest and obtain food and comforts by stealing them from neighboring houses, thus winning the dislikes (euphemistic term, in this case) of a series of people. The scenario is somewhat that of an all-out war, which repeats itself every time the ~gang~ carries out a new expedition. The game takes up the main scenes of the film, transforming them into as many stages and therefore adopting rather classic solutions. Instead of varying its structure depending on the situation, however (how many times have we seen ~mixed~ tie-ins in terms of genre between one level and another?), The Bosco Gang prefers the path of brevity, trying to enrich as much as possible the few internships present. The result is an extremely short product, which can be finished in a very short time but which lends itself well to replayability for a number of reasons: firstly, each level can be tackled again and with a different character, in order to access areas before inaccessible; secondly, as a compendium of the ~normal~ stages there are some nice minigames. Furious foxes The game mechanics are extremely simple: you start with the two main characters and in each stage there is a series of simple objectives to complete, with the appropriate side elements: collection of extras, replenishment of vital energy, collection of weapons etc. etc. The obstacles are represented first of all by the hostile environment full of technological traps, secondly by some unfriendly rats who will attack us in groups. To defend ourselves we will have a main attack, or a blow with a club, and a secondary attack from a distance, with which to carry out targeted shots. It is interesting to note that it is possible to create offensive pair maneuvers if the two characters get on top of each other. And equally interesting are the possibility of switching from the first to the second character by pressing a button at any time, and the flexibility with which La Gang del Bosco lends itself to cooperative multiplayer: even once the game has started, a second player can take control of our partner and support us in the fight, just as he will be able to leave the game and return the management of the character to the CPU. Once all the stages have been completed, which are obviously interspersed with animated sequences taken from the film to give a narrative thread, we find ourselves in the ~headquarters~ of the gang and it is possible to replay each level with different characters, to access situations previously hidden. Or you can try your hand at minigames, which represent a pleasant variation in gameplay even if they don't have a thick system. Technical realization La Gang del Bosco is a product that in some respects is rather well-finished and well made, in other respects it leaves much to be desired. First of all, the graphics contrast well-designed characters with good animations with often spartan and poorly detailed scenarios, which can be interacted only according to the game objectives and whose ~view~ is blocked in a predetermined way. This means that we will not be able to adjust the virtual camera as it is most convenient for us, but that we will have to submit to deliberately limited visions, where facing the same stage with a different character will open up ~new horizons~ for us. As for the sound, the first thing that jumps, er, to the ear is the good dubbing in Italian. As is often the case, the voice actors used for the localization of the game are not the same as in the film, but they do it adequately and offer a good level of performance, which you really can't complain about. In all of this, music and effects take a bit of a back seat: strength or weakness? Comment Equipped with the classic setting for a tie-in, La Gang del Bosco is a product aimed only at fans of the film from which it is based, or at younger and less demanding gamers. A simple but nonetheless simplistic gameplay is accompanied by an at least questionable stage management, lacking the curiosity for ~what comes next~ given the small number of locations, which must possibly be tackled all over again with different characters. The presence of minigames, fun but technically below the actual game, is a good surplus but does not change the cards on the table of a video game from which something more could be expected. Pros: Immediate Dubbed in Italian Technical realization with highs ... Cons: ... and lows Not long-lived Only for fans of the film From the homonimo film Dreamworks the videogame of ~La Gang del Bosco~ arrives on time. And in this introductory paragraph one could ditch the usual rigmarole on the relationship between the film industry and videogames, talk about the fact that the only certain things in this world are only death and tie-ins, underline that often and willingly this kind of products exploit the popularity of the film but they turn out to be qualitatively poor. Here, you might as well not do it How? Did we do it without even realizing it?", "date": "2007-02-16", "grade": null}
