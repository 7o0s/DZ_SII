'was for the recent Kinect Adventures on Xbox 360. The same goes for Wii RemotePlus, the new version of the Wii remote control that integrates Wii MotionPlus technology inside, thus allowing greater precision without the need to purchase external support. Among the developers who decided to make a game that supported the new remote control were the guys from Artoon, whose curriculum is dotted with both poor quality products and more high-sounding names, such as Yoshi's Island DS and Blue Dragon. This time, unfortunately, all that the developers have managed to get out of the hat is this FlingSmash, an adventure whose main, if not the only purchase pretext is to be almost given away together with the new remote control. A hero ball The rather trivial plot tells of an evil spirit who has decided to bring chaos to the peaceful island where the game is set: to stop him, the locals decide to summon an improbable chubby hero, whose rise is narrated through illustrations heavily reminiscent of the introduction of Zelda: The Wind Waker. The aim will predictably be to restore peace to the island, eliminate the evil spirit and save the princess in danger. However, what makes FlingSmash interesting, at least potentially, are the game mechanics: to simplify, it could be described as a sort of mix between Arkanoid and the sport of baseball, in a continuous succession of very linear levels and worlds. The idea behind it is at least original: each horizontally scrolling scenario is full of blocks to be destroyed by throwing the protagonist's ball at them, and to do so the player must continually hit it with the Wii Remote, exactly as if he were hitting a baseball with a bat. But alas, here the first problems arise: although an on-screen indicator shows how precise and responsive the remote is, once you hit a shot it doesn't always feel like the ball is going where you want it to. The cause is to be found both in a certain approximation in the Remote-protagonist collisions, and because, in the absence of real tactile feedback, the player does not know exactly when the impact occurs. Some ideas try to make the action more varied and frenetic: if you stay too far behind, for example, a three-headed dragon will end up devouring your alter-ego, while by tilting the remote control and remaining motionless for a few seconds, you can charge a shot more powerful, capable of destroying even the most resistant blocks. Just like in Arkanoid, some timed bonuses make life easier, by enlarging the protagonist, making him more devastating or by making three appear at once. Really, FlingSmash tries hard not to bore you, so one moment you're kicking penalties against a miniboss, and the next you're transformed into a heavier and more difficult to control metal ball. But unfortunately that's not enough: after a while the action is resolved in a simple and monotonous swing of the Wii Remote, in a continuous back and forth that will make your wrist very unhappy. The clashes with the bosses are predictable and not too funny: each of these must be hit in a precise point, and only a huge crab will try to put a spoke in the wheels by trying to grab you with its dangerous claws. To pass a level and move on to the next it is necessary to collect at least three medals scattered along the way: since their number is very limited, this trick ensures that the player remains focused on the action and does not just shake the Wii Remote without even looking at the screen. But, since the scenario flows by itself and some medals are in the possession of enemies or enclosed within some blocks, once one has escaped it is no longer possible to recover it, making it practically useless to continue and forcing you to restart the level . At the end of each scenario you find yourself in front of a series of luminous blocks which, if hit at the right time, allow you to earn more points: this, together with the possibility of using a female character, is one of the many small ideas that would like to add little more irons in the fire, but which in the end turn out to be only futile and gratuitous. A little more interesting is the multiplayer mode, despite the absence of brilliant mini-games or dthe more elaborate gameplay continues to weigh heavily on the enjoyment of the title. Technically the game doesn't shine, but it still does a good job, with more than decent music and colorful graphics to counterbalance an unattractive and, in some cases, decidedly tacky style. In short, it's a real shame that the Artoon developers missed the opportunity to properly exploit an interesting concept and which, above all thanks to the bundled distribution with Wii RemotePlus, could have reached a potentially high share of Wii users.", "date": "2010-12-13", "grade": "5.5"}
