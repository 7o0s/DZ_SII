{"name": "Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mortal-kombat-deadly-alliance_a.html", "text": "Sub Zero, Raiden and company come to Xbox The game modes The main menu that will appear after the introductory movie will give you the possibility to choose between different modes that we will show you one by one. ARCADE is the most classic. You have to select a fighter and travel through the worlds to try and find the Demon of the Occult World and other opponents. The function of the arcade mode , however , does not allow you to go around the world freely with your character , but is completely structured in the form of fights . Playing in Arcade , you will earn Koins after each fight . Koins are one of the many innovations of this game and we will see later what their specific function is. The VERSUS mode, on the other hand, allows you to fight against a friend (it's the multiplayer mode) which will take you directly to the character selection screen. The third choice is TRAINING. Mortal Kombat : Deadly Alliance is different from its predecessors . Even Mortal Kombat veterans may need a fair amount of training with the new combat control system. In fact, another great novelty that contributes to making everything even more interesting and long-lived is the fact that each fighter has 3 fighting styles. During the match, simply press the Left Trigger [L] to select a different one . Each style has completely different moves from the other (from 10 to 15) Furthermore, each wrestler has some special moves that can be performed in any combat mode (these are the most characteristic ones, such as, for example, Sub-Zero's ice, or Scorpion's harpoon...). The control of these styles is quite immediate as, during the fight, the mode that is currently being used is always indicated in the lower left corner. Another common feature of these fighting styles is that one out of three always implies the use of a weapon, capable of doing a lot of harm to the opponents Sub Zero, Raiden and company come to Xbox But these KOINS Two other innovations that will immediately catch your eye from the main menu are the possibility to try your hand at the KONQUISTA mode and the KRIPTA. It is in the KONQUITA mode that you really learn to play. Faced with hundreds of different challenges (more than two hundred), the player will learn to perform all kinds of moves in various fighting styles. In the meantime, the aforementioned KOINS will also be earned which (now we can reveal it) will be useful in the KRIPTA , a huge room with 676 chests (dead). Using the Koins (which can be of six different colors) that the player has earned in the fights, it will be possible to buy the chests to discover the hidden content inside. Sometimes they will contain big items like new characters or backgrounds to fight in, other times something smaller, sometimes they will be empty On each chest is indicated the number of koins that are needed to buy it (and therefore open it, the number can vary from a minimum of about 60, even up to more than 600). In the instruction manual there is an interesting section dedicated to these 676 cases. In fact, there is a diagram regarding their arrangement, so as to cross out the cases already opened on the booklet, in order not to run the risk of opening the same case twice or more (it is difficult to remember how many and which cases have already been purchased, if they are 676) . Also in the manual it is possible to write down a six-character code. What is this code? Soon said! In order to try your hand at KONQUISTA mode and to gain access to KRIPTA , you will need to create a personal profile (including a nickname , and an icon ) to which the game will ask you to assign a six-character code (a kind of password) . You will have to choose the characters from the various buttons on your joypad (an example of code could be: Y, B, A, Y, X, B) and this password will have to be entered every time you start or resume a game. Sub Zero, Raiden and company come to Xbox The last choice in the main menu is the OPTIONS section, which includes: difficulty level (there are 5), rounds to be won in a match (two or three), round duration (from 10 to 90 seconds, or with unlimited duration), activate  deactivate the mini-games (be patient and we will also tell you about these), blood level (settable from zero to MAX), sound and controller. Mini-games are another exciting addition to MK:DA. They appear from time to time to vary the pace a bit. Examples might be Test your vision or Test your strength . In the first case, an MK medallion will be shown. Observe the cup that covers the medallion as it changes position. When it stops , controller buttons will appear showing how to select the right cup . In the second example, however, you have to reach the goal before the time runs out. You need to quickly press the joypad buttons to increase the level of the strength gauge, then press the right trigger [R] to break an object. Sub Zero, Raiden and company come to Xbox FATALITY! In addition to these new features, there are also all the features that have made the MK saga famous, such as the Fatalities (the secret moves through which it is possible to excruciatingly kill the opponent once defeated, which are not shown in the moves screen , but it is possible to download them from the internet), the possibility of interacting with the surrounding environment by collecting objects or throwing the opponent into some very dangerous areas of the arena, the presence of historical characters from Mortal Kombat, already present since the first chapter, such as Sub-Zero, Scorpion, Johnny Cage, Shang Tsung, Raiden, Sonya Blade, Reptile and Kano. In addition to them, Kenshi , Bo'Rai Cho , Cyrax , Drahmin , Frost , Hsu Hao , Jax , Kitana , Kung Lao , Li Mei , Mavado , Nitara , Quan Chi and Moloch are available at the beginning. There are others as well , but you will discover them as you progress through the game . Analyzing the technical part of the game , one must surely praise the graphics . It is a game that has been taken care of down to the last detail and the fights are characterized by a very high realism. There is little to complain about the sound, as in this kind of games it is not given much importance; however it must be admitted that an up to date job has been done here too , since the tunes and sound effects seem spot on and help to give the idea of the atmosphere of the game , in some cases very splatter with spills of horror movie blood Sub Zero, Raiden and company come to Xbox The aspect of playability is also taken care of properly, the buttons are simple to use, the moves are not extremely difficult to perform (of course, especially for MK newbies, there will be some practice to do, but you learn quickly ) and in one of the three combat modes (which have different names for each wrestler) a function that is always very useful in fighting games has been assigned to a button (so it is very easy to use it): escape . Many times, in fact, you will find yourself hand to hand with the opponent. Since the latter will not give you kisses and caresses, but will try to beat you to death, by pressing the little black button, you will be able to leap backwards to separate yourself, at least momentarily from him. Ultimately ... And we have come to the advice for purchases ... first of all I would recommend the purchase by the fanatics of the Mortal Kombat saga. It could also be a title which , thanks to its excellent realization , could bring even those who do not know it yet or who were not very satisfied with the previous episodes closer to MK . PROS: +Long-lived +It's Mortal Kombat CONS: - The full 3d may not appeal to the purists of the first Mortal Kombat Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance is the new chapter of the Mortal Kombat series (which saw the light way back in 1992 with the first episode). This new game is supported by a very innovative engine which , in addition to fully satisfying fans of this saga , will also be very pleasing to new gamers , who will not give up trying their hand at this chapter . Indeed , it must be admitted that this game was really made excellent manner. The plot, as for most fighting games, isn't that great: there are the usual two bad guys on duty (in this case they respond to the names of Shang Tsung and Quan Chi) who have teamed up to achieve a common goal: bring back the vanished army of the mythological Dragon King in an attempt to take control of the realms . Since, if they succeed, they will be unstoppable, the heroes of the Earth will have to venture once again into the Outer World and fight the forces of evil, and they will have to act immediately, to neutralize this deadly alliance", "date": "2003-03-24", "grade": null}
