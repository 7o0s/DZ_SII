Cinematographically speaking, the idea is unanimous that no one has ever been able to kidnap and amalgamate the most disparate situations better than Quentin Tarantino has been doing for twenty-five years. Within the videogame industry instead, what we tend to recover as much as possible in recent years is the ~difficult~ RPG setting that Miyazaki and From Software have made great with the various Souls and the spin-off Bloodborne. The talented Italian team RuneHeads in turn takes another big step, inserting in this quotation broth a mechanic similar to that of Ico, called to carry the ball and chain with Yorda. This choice inexorably leads to the double consequence of raising Fall of Light to a highly inspired title, but risking equally brutally burying it. Good and Evil: Light and Pain The narrative assumption from which Fall of Light starts is certainly not among the most original. In a world where both light and darkness exist, we are called to experience the fourteenth era of men, the first dark one, which arrived after thirteen cycles of peace and prosperity. The intro already represents a tribute to the initial scenes of the various Dark Souls, complete with a narrator and relative acting, which masterfully recall the narrator who introduced us to Lothric and the dormant flames a year and a half ago. Once the setting has been assimilated, what you will find before you will be none other than the struggle of a father who ardently tries to save his daughter Aether, in order to bring his world back to light. We don't intend to tell you more than what you might discover or deduce with the first few minutes of the game, this for the simple reason that Fall of Light owes so much to its ability to effectively narrate the story: also borrowed from the titles of From Software, is divided into a few dubbed scenes and a myriad of documents to retrieve around, useful for fully understanding the background of the world in which we live and for instilling the right curiosity, at least until a turning point that will put a second plan on the plate narrative. It will be up to you to discover these elements, reassuring you that if Fall of Light can be said to be substantially successful, it is precisely under the narrative aspect. The relationship between Nyx and Aether, initially inconsistent and pretentious, will soon turn into the main reason for your journey. What unfortunately works less is everything that instead has to do with mere gameplay: between shortcomings and only sketchy mechanics, the total independence of the product has radically undermined its success. Dark Souls/Diablo - Diablo/Dark Souls - ICO What is really strange is not the excruciating need to carry the ballast named Aether with us as we try to clean up rooms and corridors of dozens and dozens of enemies. The real point against Fall of Light lies in the choice of an isometric setting a la Diablo. If, as mentioned before, you will be able to wait for the relationship between father and daughter to take shape and justify a few bitter tears, it will be impossible to digest a combat system that hopelessly tries to reproduce the situations that made Hidetaka Miyazaki great, but which an isometric view often making it incomprehensible. What makes Dark Souls' combat the current yardstick for the genre is its incredible accuracy and ability to return hit feedback that borders on the miracle. This peculiarity is what overshadowed any other Souls like that arrived in the following years (with the sole exception of Team Ninja's masterful NiOh). Finding yourself therefore fighting with a view so far from your alter ego, but which requires precision of movement and superfine counterattack, is what is most unbearable the game has to offer. The limited availability in terms of inventory and the total absence of your opponent's characteristics - even if only the vital bar - only accentuate a sense of frustration that will often risk making even the most hardened of players give up. In itself this would not be a problem, but only an additional stimulus: what doesn't work is that this difficulty is often artificial due to some not exactly very happy design choices, albeit dictated by a rather noble basic idea. Hence, by combining everything with an artificial intelligence far from memorable, Fall of Light reveals itself as a discreet conceptual work, unfortunately achieved by making compromises perhaps greater than necessary and which fails to make that leap that would allow it to dramatically expand its catchment area. Making a comparison with another atypical Souls Like thatresponds to the name of Salt & Sanctuary, the latter had succeeded in adapting the formula to a two-dimensional world, however leaving aside the narration, deeply forgettable. Between swords, broadswords, axes, halberds, crossbows and company, Fall of Light will put you in front of a decent arsenal from which you can (and always have to) choose, delegating the growth of the character and his own statistics to the accumulation of a quantity of souls left on the field by defeated enemies. Once the appropriate bar has been filled, it will be possible to go and pray with Aether at an altar (which takes the place of the bonfires, however present in Fall of Light) and also increase one's own amount of life points at the same rate. The lack of weapon statistics, except for the specific skills that each one is able to attribute to you, makes everything more difficult to understand, even if it makes it easier and painless to give up a previously obtained weapon. All this is combined with the particularity given by the presence of Aether herself, which close to you will activate a buff of easily recognizable characteristics from an aura generated around your weapon. The characteristics are closed by the possibility of the girl dying and being kidnapped, with the consequent need to search for her (locked up in a cage) in the maze of the area you were crossing. Beauty in low polygons Fall of Light is a title that makes self-production a possible weakness, but also its expressive strength. The visual aspect of the RuneHeads title is certainly not synonymous with high definition textures and striking polygonal models, but the choice to make the game in low poly, accompanied by the isometric view and far from the action, allow Fall of Light to offer some interesting and well-inspired glimpses, even if the overall quality is often subdued and reveals little attention to the details of the setting. Going forward with the adventure, in the handful of hours that will be required to reach the end credits, different settings will elicit more than a smile of satisfaction from you, thanks to a love of the developers that transpires at every step (and which is the which is really important for a production of this type). The optimization is good, and the game is not affected by any problems whatsoever, practically always settling on its sixty frames per second, apart from some sporadic emergency situations. The audio sector is not particularly memorable.", "date": "2017-10-18", "grade": "7.0"}
