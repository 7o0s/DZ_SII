{"name": "Bullet Echo", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/bullet-echo-recensione.html", "text": "Bullet Echo's review reveals how it is actually possible to take a very fashionable genre such as multiplayer-based shooters, including battle royale, and reinterpret it according to strategic dynamics, introducing a top-down view, the new element of darkness and a formula very close to that of twin stick shooters. In short, the ideas are very interesting, and it is no coincidence that they come from a creative development team such as ZeptoLab, the English studio author of the famous Cut the Rope series, which has tried to characterize this new experience with its own cartoony style while having to make some compromises, first of all the many visual limitations of the top-down style camera. Familiarizing yourself with the gameplay of Bullet Echo is very simple: drawing on a roster of twenty different characters, progressively unlockable, in the three game modes available (one of which is team-based for up to fifteen participants), you find yourself participating in battles which take place within randomly generated scenarios but with a common denominator. The environments are in fact immersed in darkness and we will have to cleave it with our laser sights in search of the opponents, identifying their position on the basis of the noises and trying to intercept them by moving slowly so as not to decrease the shooting accuracy of the equipped weapon. Gameplay As mentioned, Bullet Echo's formula corresponds almost entirely to that of traditional twin stick shooters, although the controls have been remodeled to add strategic depth to the experience. In fact, where the left virtual analog stick is used to move our character, the one on the right determines its rotation and not its aiming, which can therefore take place with a certain slowness in the event that you have to turn completely in order to have a target within reach. shooting. It is a cumbersomeness desired by the developers, a bit like the tank-style controls of the first episodes of Resident Evil which served to increase the tension, because it helps to create that simple tactical advantage of a player who manages to get behind the 'other and to open fire, in this case thanks to a system that automatically pulls the trigger when there is an enemy in our viewfinder. The element of darkness also helps to create interesting situations, in which perhaps we perceive the footsteps of nearby opponents, represented visually, and we can move accordingly to intercept them, perhaps remaining behind one of the many shelters present within the scenarios. A typical battle royale mechanic is also emphasized, i.e. the unbridled looting once projected onto the map: you start with a minimum rate of fire and without armor, therefore you have to use the first moments of the game to get ammunition, armor, medical kits and useful modifications for the weapons. To make it all even more interesting, the great variety of characters takes care of it, which as mentioned must be progressively unlocked, collecting experience points, gold and coins, as well as opening the traditional boxes hidden behind the usual advertising trailer. The freemium dynamics appear permissive and there are no limitations of any kind, however the management of the upgrades and the fact of being able to substantially accelerate them by spending real money inevitably opens up to some pay-to-win implications. Technical realization There is no doubt that the guys from ZeptoLab have a certain familiarity with the cartoonish graphic style, and have tried to exploit it in the best way to create a group of visually captivating characters, divided into four teams that share some color choices and the details of the uniforms. We therefore go from a team that seems to have come out of a radioactive area to a post-apocalyptic urban team, passing through a group of futuristic soldiers and a handful of fighters with clothes designed for camouflage. The problem is that the view from above ends up deeply undermining these efforts, giving a feeling (wrong!) of poor realization care and approximation, in particular as regards the scenarios. Random generation, in fact, on the one hand ensures great variety of situations, on the other hand it often ends up creating improbable architectures full of obstacles. Finally, the sound sector appears only functional to the action, without high notes.", "date": "2020-06-02", "grade": "7.8"}
