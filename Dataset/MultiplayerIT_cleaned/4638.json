No, it's not the slogan of a bad time travel movie or one of those notes you find in Chinese fortune cookies, but what Nintendo and AlphaDream must have thought of when they realized they needed new ideas, a little more of time and perhaps even a pinch of nostalgia for a Mario & Luigi RPG that was able to amaze us like the first. The latest iterations of this spin-off, which made its debut in 2003 on the Game Boy Advance, beyond their quality, have begun to show shortness of breath in terms of innovations, and yet they show us every time how crazy and addictive know how to be the ~parallel~ world in which our favorite mustachioed brothers fight in turns against their bizarre enemies. 2017 was also the year of remakes at Nintendo, just think of Fire Emblem Echoes and Metroid: Samus Returns. Just announced in June, Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Henchmen joins the chorus after just four months to remind us of the origins of the series, introduce it to gamers who maybe weren't even born in 2003 and have fun as we once did, but with something extra. Even plumbers eat beans Set in the magical world of Beanland, rather than the usual Mushroom Kingdom, Superstar Saga tells us the misadventures of Mario and Luigi, engaged in a desperate search after the evil witch Ghignarda has stolen Princess Peach's voice. At first, Bowser himself will team up with the two brothers to restore Peach's voice - and kidnap her better! - but the airship carrying our heroes is shot down early in the game and our heroes find themselves separated from Bowser and lost in an unknown realm. It will then be up to Mario and Luigi alone to reach Ghignarda's castle, while Bowser's ~faithful~ followers look for their ruler in a parallel story that gives the game a new title, Bowser's Henchmen. But let's go in order. Superstar Saga is an almost slavish copy of the original dated 2003, only newly coated: AlphaDream has in fact employed the same style already admired in Paper Jam, the 2015 episode/crossover with Paper Mario, playing on precise and accurate lighting which embellishes the beautiful two-dimensional graphics, transforming each screen into a colorful combination of old-school sprites. Mario and Luigi explore Beanland as in a traditional Japanese RPG, engaging or avoiding enemies and solving small environmental puzzles. The camera frames the action from above and from the side, turning the game into a bizarre hybrid between an RPG and a platformer. In Superstar Saga we jump a lot and most of the puzzles revolve around the skills that made the plumber brothers famous: the spin jump allows us to overcome ravines, the double jump takes us to raised platforms, the hammer obviously paves the way for us and so saying. On the map, the player controls both Mario and Luigi: the two heroes move simultaneously and the A and B keys correspond to Mario's and Luigi's jumps respectively, while X makes both jump at the same time. Actions on the field temporarily change the mapping of the keys and can be scrolled by pressing the back keys or, in the case of this remake, simply selecting them on the touch screen if you are not viewing the map. The new Superstar Saga is in fact full of small adjustments that make it an even more accessible title than in the past. The first that immediately catches the eye - also due to its inconsistency, in fact - is also the one that allows us to save at any time by pressing the appropriate icon on the touch screen: it is a very useful solution but, as we said, inconsistent, because save blocks are still scattered around the world, despite their redundancy. At times, therefore, one gets the impression that AlphaDream has reprogrammed the game ~on a 1:1 scale~ and then modified it later. Not bad: some news are really very welcome. Saving at will is one of them; the detailed map, complete with zoom and customizable reminders, is another, while less experienced players will probably find the option that allows you to adjust the difficulty level - in fact the only option on the specific screen - and make the much easier fights. The battles of the Mario & Luigi series have always divided the public in two: there are those who adore them, like us, and those who prefer a more classic and reasoned structure. The fights are effectively turn-based, with Mario and Luigi lined up on the left and the enemies on the right, but the gThe player is led to play an active part in the battle that goes beyond the simple choice of the attack to launch or the object to consume. Pressing the keys at the right time allows you to amplify the damage of Mario and Luigi's blows, as well as dodging and countering enemy attacks in real time. Sometimes these maneuvers require over the top timing, so AlphaDream has implemented a mechanic introduced in the most recent episodes and now you just need to hold down a button to parry attacks, taking only a small amount of damage. In this way everyone is happy, and the traditional form of turn-based JRPGs is also respected, but in our opinion the series has always given its best also thanks to the interactive fights, much more engaging than in the vast majority of RPGs especially when it's about taking on the bosses. Don't call them Minions Once you reach the Borgo di Fagiolandia, about a couple of hours after starting the adventure, Bowser's Minions is finally unlocked, the new mode that enriches Superstar Saga and which from that moment on becomes accessible at any time after have paused the game. In fact, Bowser's Minions is perhaps the weakest addition to the remake, despite the fact that it is an actual minigame rather than a simple feature. The story of Bowser's Henchmen proceeds parallel to the misadventures of Mario and Luigi in the kingdom of Beanland: in the role of a Goomba and a small army of minions we will have to look for Bowser, who disappeared at the beginning of the game following the attack by Grine. In reality, what we will do is watch numerous, hilarious cutscenes in which the clumsy henchmen who give the game its name end up clashing with each other and with their new enemies in simple battles with a strategic flavor that are distantly reminiscent of Fire Emblem. Before each conflict it is possible to modify our team, since the balance of power between the units in the field respect the rules of a simple Chinese paper: enemies in melee are stronger than those at a distance, those at a distance have the better of the units flying and the latter, of course, have an advantage over those in melee. The player must therefore form his team based on the composition of the enemy team, if he wants to have the upper hand, since once the battle has begun his role will be reduced almost entirely to that of a simple spectator, even if in some cases it is possible to intervene directly but limitedly, for example pressing a button at the right time to inflict more damage. Bowser's minions is therefore a pleasant but not particularly elaborate pastime which nevertheless acts as a counterpart to the ~campaign~ of Mario and Luigi, crossing with it to the point that its completion unlocks the last battles and the true ending of this extra mode. Obviously we shouldn't expect who knows what complicated narrative plot: the story, already simple in itself, is almost an excuse to catapult Mario and Luigi into the most disparate situations in the name of very funny quotes and gags. Fortunately, the new Superstar Saga, among other things, also solves an old problem of the original: its verbosity. Often the characters get lost in very long rounds of words, perhaps prolonging the cutscenes a little too much, but now you just need to hold down the R key to speed everything up.", "date": "2017-10-04", "grade": "8.7"}
