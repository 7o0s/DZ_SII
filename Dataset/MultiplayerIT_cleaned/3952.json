If you are reading this review with the interest of those who know the franchise, you will undoubtedly know that if on the one hand the television series has the merit of having made Robert Kirkman's creature known to the masses, on the other hand the show produced by AMC has struggled to maintain the same quality of its first seasons over time, losing much of the initial sequel along the way. In the videogame field, the fates were more or less similar, starting with the famous Telltale Games adventure: after having amazed with its first season, the last few episodes of Clementine's story were affected by the turmoil faced by the development team. Looking further, the situation doesn't have much to offer: in addition to a couple of titles for mobile devices, there is in fact The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct, a survival horror that unfortunately hasn't done anything in particular to be remembered. For this series of reasons, when Overkill's The Walking Dead was announced four years ago by the creators of Payday, fans of the zombie-themed franchise were once again able to hope for a video game worthy of its fame: after a long wait, we can finally see if that expectation has been well placed. Plot and characters Despite being a game that sees its dynamics take place mainly online, Overkill's The Walking Dead makes the effort to present itself with a story featuring the usual group of survivors, settled in a field near Washington D.C.. Respecting the tradition of The Walking Dead, our people are called to defend themselves not only from the hordes of zombies that infest the area, but also from other human beings who have in turn gathered in a group and intend to take possession of their possessions. In the case of this game, the enemy faction we are dealing with bears the name ~The Family~, around which revolves a plot made up mainly of attacks and retaliation of various types between the two groups. As you progress through the game, however, you realize how the plot is actually just a pretext to propose the missions that we unlock by completing the previous ones, thus dismantling the expectations in this regard that we had all created by watching the trailers character introductions. It is from this emblematic point of view that the aforementioned films are much more effective in establishing an empathic bond with the four protagonists than what is actually shown to us by Overkill's The Walking Dead. In spite of the trailers, the game does not bother to hint at the stories preceding the zombie apocalypse, or in any case to introduce elements capable of characterizing the quartet in a significant way. For the moment, on the narrative front, therefore, we do not find anything memorable, and it is a pity precisely because it is a game dedicated to The Walking Dead: also considering the presence of Robert Kirkman on board, we would have expected more emphasis on this component to go beyond the banality of situations similar to those already seen in abundance between comics and television series. The hope is that the second season of Overkill's The Walking Dead can bring a breath of fresh air to the plot: to find out, there won't be long to wait, given that it will arrive by the end of November and will be included in the price of the base game. Returning to our four characters, their names therefore represent for now only an indication of as many classes, well-known to those who know the genre: Aidan is the tank with the most health to send to the front line in battles, Heather is the silent ranger capable to shoot down enemies without making any noise with his crossbow (does this remind you of anyone?), Grant is the specialized technician with the sniper rifle, and finally Maya is the support you can rely on to obtain additional medkits in times of need. The gameplay The missions of Overkill's The Walking Dead can be divided into two different types: the defense ones, in which we have to protect our Anderson Camp from zombies and family, and the attack ones in which we instead carry out sorties in the opponents' structures. While the first ones generally end in about twenty minutes, the second ones can last even more than an hour, depending on how things go. In these terms, the game knows no half measures, immediately proposing a very complicated mission even at the lowest level of difficulty. This is just one of the examples in which the design of Overkill's The Walking Dead proves unable to accompany the player through its dynamics, which in turn lame in some fundamental aspects. In the same mission above comes for andexample a stealth approach is encouraged to avoid attracting zombies with noises, but when it comes to clashing with Family members it doesn't offer any options other than attacking with weapons drawn hoping to do as soon as possible, so as not to bring the noise indicator to the maximum level . The artificial intelligence of computer-controlled humans appears to have super vision and hearing, thwarting any attempt to silently approach enemies to eliminate them. He also doesn't seem to care about the possibility of attracting zombies with the use of weapons, thus rendering even our efforts to remain silent useless. Apart from a cutscene in the menus, the tutorial is also completely absent, thus making much of Overkill's The Walking Dead a mystery to be discovered with your own hands. In fact, there is a whole managerial part to take into account, linked to finding the materials necessary to enhance the field through the five branches that are proposed to us. Similarly, the four characters can expand the number of weapons at their disposal, leveling up and acquiring skills by collecting experience points. Some missions act as a barrier as they require a particular level, thus pushing the player to grind the previous ones to get the right level of progress before tackling them. Even when we put ourselves in the shoes of the chosen character, Overkill's The Walking Dead offers mixed sensations: if on the one hand the gunplay is quite satisfactory, on the other hand the shortage of ammunition forces us to often resort to close combat which is instead not very convincing . Whatever the weapon in our possession, in fact, we find ourselves constantly pressing the mouse button to hit as many zombies as possible, dealing with a system that is a little too cumbersome and with the frustration of seeing the energy bar necessary to carry out the shots drop with speed. Graphics and sound Even without touching particularly high peaks, from a technical point of view Overkill's The Walking Dead seemed to us to have improved compared to what we had seen in the closed beta. The game gives its best in the composition of the models of protagonists and zombies, as well as the creation of internal environments where you can find messages left by people before they die, or other elements capable of making exploration a little less monotonous. The animations unfortunately don't prove to be at the same level, making some movements awkward or even unnatural due to a lack of ~fitting~. Considering that there are no dedicated servers but in each game one of the players acts as host, the gaming experience can vary significantly based on the connection status of whoever is connected together. Unfortunately, it often happens to see elements that teleport due to lag peaks, highlighting also in this respect a failure to optimize the dynamics which do not even provide for the migration of the host in the event of the latter being disconnected. We also note a certain heaviness in uploads, as well as some bugs that undermine the overall experience here and there. The sound is perhaps the aspect where Overkill's The Walking Dead convinces the most, proposing a soundtrack appropriate to the genre and a series of audio effects that make moving between groups of zombies very engaging without attracting attention while the latter emit their verses characteristic.", "date": "2018-11-14", "grade": "6.0"}
