The game, developed by Amaze, is basically an old-fashioned hack'n'slash. You take control of one of the three main characters of the film, i.e. Jack Sparrow, Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, and you face levels during which you have to fight enemies, move forward and still beat, repeating the process countless times. This genre, apparently of a disarming simplicity, has undergone considerable changes over the years, to the point of merging, in order to improve, with other types of games. Among the latest most important exponents we find Phantasy Star Online and, even if it is not a pure representative, The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords. The first was able to bring the genre to the highest levels, expanding both its strengths and weaknesses, making fans fall in love even more and definitively removing the detractors: many different highly customizable characters, many statistics, many weapons, as many enemies and objects , network game. The second managed to prove that even without statistics, through genius, it is possible to create a varied and fun hack'n'slash. In Zelda there were some wonderful puzzles, and the whole experience in general was permeated with originality, albeit devoted to immediacy. The Curse of the Phantom Chest does not hang on either side, resulting conceptually to be associated with the first exponents of the genre, now twenty years old. Fighting in the Caribbean The story sees Jack Sparrow facing yet another problem, something as trivial as eternal damnation. To avoid it, the famous pirate, played in the film by Johnny Depp, will have to find a way to circumvent or cancel the blood debt that binds him to the legendary Davy Jones, the captain of the Flying Dutchman vessel. The six levels that make up the adventure are often interrupted by skits, unfortunately poorly cared for, which should show the evolution of the plot: the risk of seeing the plot ruined is still minimal, if not in the key points, it is so difficult to understand what is happening to the protagonists of the story. The incredible logical inconsistencies certainly do not help to facilitate the understanding of the narrative plot, since, if at the beginning the choice of the character is obligatory, continuing in your adventure you will have the possibility to decide who to impersonate. You will be so free, in fact, that you will also be able to control who in that level you should save: if in a stage, for example, Elizabeth were to free Will, you could use the latter to save himself from enemies. The story sees Jack Sparrow facing yet another problem, something as trivial as eternal damnation Fighting in the Caribbean Although annoying for fans of the saga, these defects would go into the background if there was a game with a valid play structure to counterbalance them, but unfortunately this is not exactly the case. The characters are not customizable, and this is a problem especially considering that, apart from the aesthetic differences and a few single special moves, they are practically identical to each other. Everyone has essentially the same weapon, a sword, which can be alternated for a limited period of time with those found along the way, such as pistols, rifles or stones. The moves available to the protagonists are not few, they constantly increase as the adventure progresses and certainly represent one of the best features of the game. By tackling the adventure at the lowest level of difficulty, most of them are useless, since almost all enemies can be eliminated with the basic attack, while complex combos become indispensable by trying out the more difficult mode. The weaker opponents don't differ much from each other, while the end-of-level bosses have been created with great care. Where the title shows the worst flaws, however, is in the level design, as the playing area is terribly limited. You can only go where the programmers intended, and often the situation is frustrating, as the levels are full of doors, stairs and side streets that are blocked by annoying invisible walls. In addition to being harmful to the quality of the product, they also make the situation very chaotic, as it is often necessary to take one of these routes to continue: a route that obviously you would never have imagined having to cross, since it is generally precluded. The interaction with the surrounding environment is therefore decidedly revisable, as well as the trivial puzzles that you will have to solve to continue on your way. Longer than the movie If you are a fan of the series capable of passing over the defects listed so far in order to relive the adventures of your favorites, thena know that the game will at least guarantee you a few hours of fun. Although passing one of the stages does not coincide with the increase in difficulty of the same, the passionate player will still be able to find bread for his teeth in the search for rubies, four for each setting, at least one of which is well hidden. Furthermore, the various difficulty levels are well balanced. Every time you kill an enemy, it will leave coins on the ground, money useful for buying extras ranging from simple artwork to particular weapons that can be alternated with the standard sword. The Touch Screen, essentially useless in the adventure, is only used to show a kind of menu in real time. The lower screen of the DS is instead indispensable in the three mini-games, all quite obvious and not very funny, unable to capture the attention for more than half an hour. The developers have evidently focused more on the aesthetic aspect of the game than on the playful one, trying to attract the many fans of Jack Sparrow and his companions with a faithful reconstruction of the atmosphere of the two feature films. The graphics are excellent, except for some animations, and certainly the locations that form the backdrop to the adventures of the pirates in the film are well recognizable in the video game. The pieces that make up the musical background are also precise conversions, with due limitations, of those heard in the cinema. The sound effects, on the other hand, are not up to par, even ridiculous in some circumstances. As a game, ~Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest~ is above all the victim of an excessive retro spirit in its mechanics, so much so that it often recalls the now twenty-year-old forerunners of the hack'n'slash genre. Now that the genre has reached unexpected heights, a title like this assumes a value that is not entirely sufficient, in the face of defects such as non-customizable characters, few and not very varied enemies and weapons, multiplayer limited to two players, trivial puzzles and interaction with the world very limited. The adventure would not be short, but the will to face it to the end unfortunately disperses with the progress of the same. Despite this, the game will still satisfy fans of the saga, thanks to the good graphics and the reproduction of the many elements that populate this imaginary world, accurate and faithful to the original. Pros Excellent graphics Scenarios and music faithful to the original Quite long and challenging Cons Minimal interaction with the environment Few enemies and few weapons Non-customizable protagonists Logical inconsistencies While in the United States the film is breaking all box-office records, the videogame adaptations of Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest are invading the store shelves, expanding the titles park of almost all platforms from commercially active game; could not miss, of course, the version for Nintendo DS.", "date": "2006-07-25", "grade": null}
