Sure, Diablo III seasons and Path of Exile patches continue to keep the genre alive, but new titles that can really jolt the many fans out of their seats are still on the way. With Diablo IV still very far away and a Torchlight III completely revisited in the last period, with a sudden design change that gets rid of the MMO vision, the hopes of being able to have some fun during this long quarantine seemed to have vanished completely. Wolcen Studio then takes care of coming to our rescue on one of the horses of the apocalypse, which decides to release its Wolcen: Lords of Mayhem almost as a surprise after a long period of early access. However, the Mayhem of the title pours into the players when, at launch, nothing seems to be able to work as it should. In short, on February 13, when Wolcen arrives on Steam exclusively for PC, the hunger for the title causes players to flock to the online servers making them literally explode. A situation that seems to be the exact copy of what happened at the launch of Diablo III, but this time on the shoulders of an independent development studio and not a gargantuan video game giant. The aftermath extends for at least a full week, during which very few of the million first-hour buyers manage to play consistently and without disconnections. It takes several days before everything gets back to normal, and not because of the upgrading of the servers but because of a constant drop in players that continues today for the reasons that we will see in the Wolcen: Lords of Mayhem review. Chaos reigns supreme Wolcen interests the public because it is a niche game, with attention to the graphics and what it transmits is the constant feeling of being hunted by darkness in a world infested with demons and the undead. Everything brings to mind the glories of Diablo II and an immediate comparison is undeniable even when even the character selection screen seems to have been torn by force from the Blizzard hack and slash. However, no class to choose this time, in Wolcen you can create your alter ego freely and only then worry about how to specialize it with a range of possibilities in line with what Path of Exile offers but with a pinch of innovation that never hurts. Before being able to indulge in the study of skill points and statistics we are overwhelmed by a story that is not particularly brilliant but capable of showcasing convincing characters, respectable settings and scenes rendered in real time by the unusual violence for this type of product. We don't have top quality but the result is still very valuable and the CryEngine 3 used to give life to Wolcen shows its muscles especially in the detail of the armor, on the shiny reflections of the blades and on the lighting in general, lending its side only on the effects of skills. Being filmed in engine, the same considerations obviously apply to the actual game where the breathtaking views alternate with gloomy scenarios teeming with creatures of all kinds. The control system is easy and immediate, which does not present any particular novelties: a simple point and click with the basic dodging which is added to the skills of the protagonist, borrowed in full from the console versions of Diablo III: Reaper of Souls. However, this time it is not only an aesthetic tinsel but rather the only way to prevent fatal blows from hammering us on the ground. Dodge is managed through a system of Stamina balls that are consumed with each roll. Within the normal combat session, to tell the truth, this feature is used little, often only to speed up movements during exploration since, on balance and without studying the talents too much, you will go asphalting with great ease everything that comes your way. Beasts and demonic creatures throng Wolcen's levels, exploding, writhing and screeching as you, tank-like, fire energy projectiles, arrows or summon golems and holy shields around you. You can therefore decide to structure yourself as a solid tank, a warrior dedicated to the use of white weapons to rangers who love long distances or any mix of these without any penalty. As a final decoration, imagine being able to transform yourself into a huge apocalypse demon to vent all your repressed anger and have a few seconds of total invulnerability, a basic structure that should not be underestimated. The Wheel turns The passive skill system is a spherography divided into three concentric circles, which you can rotate at will. AssignmentScore the points you want by drawing sensible constellations and you'll have no problem having fun carefree, at least until the end-of-level boss arrives. Here the balance of difficulty goes down the drain and the peak of difficulty rises to exorbitant levels, completely lacking in logical sense. In fact, the game does not prepare you for these clashes in the least and if up to that moment you felt like demigods in the midst of pathetic mortals, the roles will be reversed here and the saints, this time, you will be forced to forcefully call them back to be able to overcome these insurmountable obstacles . The boss fights, three in all, become duels to the death like in Dark Souls where often missing a dodge at the right time means dying and having to start over. Luckily Wolcen Studio hasn't included a penalty for death and, on the contrary, trying to mitigate these drops in health from zero to one hundred in two seconds flat, inserts three chances to recover on the spot after the knockout. Brutal trials and errors that risk making you want to play if you are experimenting with the higher difficulty of the two available. Excluding the boss fights, the three acts available in Wolcen won't take you more than ten hours to complete, however allowing you to experience very little that system of talents and skills discussed above. Indeed, having arrived at the endgame with hundreds of points available, the desire to do a good reset will be close to zero, almost pushing you to want to repeat the experience of the story with a brand new character and dedicated equipment. There aren't many unique objects, about thirty and the sets are missing, now a trademark for games of this type. The weapon wielded instead establishes which skill you can use. Staffs and daggers usually allow you to cast spells while two-handed weapons and shields give you close combat combinations. Skills level up by keeping them equipped but can be made more powerful by spending ~primordial affinity~ in the city, a tiny hub with just three viewers. Primordial affinities are the second currency in the game along with gold and are acquired by destroying duplicate abilities, to be collected from the corpses of enemies. Too bad for a drop system that is not convincing, with statistics unrelated to your specialization and a really low drop rate for what concerns the most interesting tools. Big trouble between demons and heroes However, not all skills are useful or work as described and this is just the tip of the iceberg of a game plagued by bugs, often minor and sometimes heavy enough to completely break your game session. The most annoying and most frequent situation is the lack of precise hitboxes, which does not allow you to easily select enemies or even more trivially hit them and, when it happens in excited situations, this could mean premature game over. Other enemies will get stuck in the walls and sometimes even the bosses risk getting stuck somewhere, becoming immortal or worse, disappearing altogether. These are many problems for a game that is sold for around forty euros, a disproportionate price compared to the general cleanliness and global duration present. In fact, the end game is not convincing and is perhaps the weakest part of the whole package. Once the story is completed, all you have to do is continue to enter the procedurally generated portals and farm to restore the former glory to your hometown, or until boredom gets the better of you.", "date": "2020-03-30", "grade": "6.0"}
