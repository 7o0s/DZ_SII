Rumors, turned backs and even serious accusations dismantle, piece by piece, the road that we have painstakingly built, forcing us to abandon everything, flee and try to regain our place in the world - albeit in a different way than we would have expected. The premises of Midnight Caravan, an Italian visual novel in which we ourselves will be the creators of our destiny, are precisely these: in the role of an unknown protagonist, we will be called to choose our past (noble, common man or soldier) to find out that an individual named Cassini, for no apparent reason, has brought us into disrepute to the point of forcing us to escape and eventually become a criminal - the leader of a caravan offering gambling and prostitution, moving with the favor in the evening to attract less attention. Midnight Caravan, to be precise. It may not be the life we imagined but it's still a life, we've somehow managed to take the reins back... until Cassini gets back on our trail, probably to bring us down once and for all. Who he is and what he wants from us, at this point, is a mystery that we have to figure out out of pure survival instinct. Either us, or him. Let's find out Midnight Caravan in the review of the PC version. Story and gameplay Set in 19th-century Rome, Midnight Caravan puts us in the role of the manager of the caravan of the same name as he tries to understand why Cassini ruined his life and, above all, to take revenge for what he put him through. After reaching the city gates and deciding where to grow our business, a choice that will have daily repercussions, we don't have time to relax when an old acquaintance comes asking us for help in hunting down a man on commission: that man it's really us but, after being forced to change our lives because of Cassini, we have adopted a different name. Few therefore know who we were before and apparently our ~companion~ is not among them: deciding what to do about it will kick off a series of events that will reveal how behind Cassini there is much more than just a man committed to ruining the lives of others. We were a bit disappointed by the fact that the introduction, linked to the protagonist's past, was resolved so quickly: while we understand the desire to leave us in the dark as much as possible, we would have welcomed greater involvement, even passive, in those events. How Cassini managed to ruin his life, what lies did he tell, what crime would he have committed to the point of being hunted down, what happened to the people he left behind (for example his family, in case one chooses the path of the noble or the common man) and also how he built his new life as owner of the Midnight Caravan. In short, details could have prompted us to feel empathy towards him and feel more involved, having to decide his fate step by step. Instead, everything flows too quickly and when we should, logically, feel Cassini's grip tightening around us once again, we know too little to experience that genuine terror in which the protagonist lets himself be seized. Midnight Caravan, the adventure will be studded with at least bizarre encounters Having said that, we must also specify that Midnight Caravan is indeed a visual novel, but one in which we determine our path: a sort of very lean role-playing game, in which every choice counts and too many mistakes could lead us to a premature game over. In fact, there are three main elements that determine our defeat: the health of the protagonist, the money and the level of suspicion that we generate within the city. If only one of these should go to zero, with reference to the first two, or reach the apex in the case of the third, the game ends and we start again from the most recent save (automatic or not). Not only will our responses to certain situations lead us to obtain advantages or disadvantages, but every day we will have to deal with the bonuses and maluses determined by the position of the Midnight Caravan: for example, choosing to start our business in a place with little traffic he will lower the level of suspicion by one point and at the same time take away fifty points of fame; the latter is necessary to unlock different options during the adventure. Conversely, by deciding to settle in a more prominent place, we will quickly gain notoriety but just as quickly we will be suspicious to the guards or to those who govern the city in general. This does not make Midnight Caravan a management system, anzi, beyond the values preset by the position of the caravan, everything else goes very to luck: it is rather difficult to predict where some of these decisions will lead based on the dialogue options offered. This ties into one of the game's biggest frustrations, which is that for a mechanic designed to push us to manage at least three of the four elements at our disposal wisely, there is little room to do it consistently and reliably. Trying to balance these indicators could have proved interesting to add some depth to an otherwise very simple adventure, however the opportunities to increase our health or decrease our suspicions are rare and it is very difficult to anticipate them based on the decisions we make permission to do. In some cases, however, they seem to have no effect and could be a bug: to give a practical example, a prominent exponent of the Church has asked to spend a night with one of our women and we, to thank him, have decided to don't charge him and offer the service as a gift. This has on the one hand increased our fame and on the other hand lowered the level of suspicion by ten points. Too bad that, going to see the count the next day, nothing had changed. Given the rarity of these occasions, we turned up a bit, above all because even loading the game the outcome always remained the same. Midnight Caravan, in the diary you can retrace the events that occurred Rescues and bugs are two other aspects that unfortunately go hand in hand. Midnight Caravan allows us to save the game almost at any time, which is great, but there is only one slot to do so and this becomes a problem when we encounter bugs that prevent us from continuing the game: our first adventure it went completely to waste when, at one point, the game simply crashed. Reloading the save, closing and reopening the game, making different choices, nothing helped and since there was only one slot available, we had no choice but to start over from scratch, retracing the exact same steps because we were curious to know where it would go anyway to parry our story. We would not have expected such disabling problems from such a technically simple game (we are talking about a visual novel anyway), yet they have occurred on several occasions. Too bad, because the story itself is enjoyable and undoubtedly offers numerous solutions based on availability of the moment, whether they are economic, famous or due to the presence of characters with whom we have established a bond. However, it must be said that replayability is mitigated by the fact that the description that we can ~choose our own adventure~ exaggerates a bit on the question of choice. Although we are granted decisions capable of impacting the secondary aspects of the story, such as the aforementioned optional characters who can join us, the main story is quite set in stone and these choices do not particularly affect it, beyond penalizing sometimes health for making a really bad decision. Playing a second game opposite to the previous one made us realize that when one of our choices should have significantly diverted the story, the game intervened to prevent this from happening by bringing the narrative back to pre-established tracks. Sometimes it also happened in slightly more secluded situations but overall it is the plot that does not move much from its positions. While the presence of often locked multiple choices generates curiosity as to how things might go if, the fact that the story isn't really impacted as we would have expected doesn't entice you to play more games. Too bad, because the art style and especially the soundtrack they are valuable elements of the game, in spite of a certain recycling of assets and a font that does not always help reading. Just as there are moments in which the story becomes engaging, with its twists and turns and unpredictable situations. On the other side of the scale, however, we have a few too many problems.", "date": "2021-07-25", "grade": "5.5"}
