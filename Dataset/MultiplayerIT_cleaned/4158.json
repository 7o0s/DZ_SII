{"name": "Best Rally", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/best-rally-recensione.html", "text": "Best Rally is just the latest exponent of a genre that has always been very popular on mobile: that of short but intense arcade experiences, often based on the concept of trial & error, and in which you therefore find yourself trying again and again a mission until you successfully complete it. The idea is declined in this case in the form of a racer with a three-quarter view from above and controls relating to the car, with memory, precision and readiness to act as the main ingredients. The game offers a single player campaign made up of thirty-one increasingly complex tracks, which we will have the task of covering as fast as possible, being careful to start drifting at the right time so as not to get off the ideal trajectory. We must also avoid the obstacles along the way, which once hit would slow us down to the point of frustrating the attempt. It's all a question of practice, in truth: car management responds with a calculated delay, in an inertial physical habit that pushes you to anticipate inputs in order to aim for the best possible result, perhaps aided by a pinch of luck. To support everything we think of decidedly simple touch controls, which allow you to steer right or left, where acceleration is automatic and the brake is not even contemplated. We are talking about the rest of really minute circuits, which are completed in seconds and which, precisely because of their compactness, lend themselves well to quickly transforming the experience into a sort of videogame drug. One more game and it's over, right? Gameplay and structure Best Rally doesn't do anything particularly original, neither in terms of gameplay nor in terms of structure. The latter provides for a linear, well-paced progression, which relies on obtaining the traditional stars to be able to proceed with the next tranche of tracks, but without ever asking too much: generally it is enough to obtain two out of three points in each mission to have the requirements minimum required to move forward. There are also variations on the theme, i.e. tracks with a peculiar connotation, in which we are asked, for example, to collect a certain quantity of objects within a time limit; but the focus remains on the asphalt, which we find from time to time crowded with new obstacles, whether it's tires piled up at the edge of the track or ruthless traffic dividers which, with an impact, can completely ruin an otherwise flawless race. You make a mistake and try again, in Best Rally, again and again; and it is precisely this aspect of the game that the developers have decided to exploit for the inclusion of freemium mechanisms, represented by short commercials that can be skipped after a few seconds, and which are ~announced~ by the interface. To eliminate them completely, you have to spend 3.49 euros or make any purchase from those available, in this case three extra vehicles (with the same performance as the default car, mind you) which cost 4.49 euros each. It's too much? Is it little? It depends on how much you appreciate the experience developed by the Oddrok guys, who also seem to have hit the target on the technical front. The tunes that accompany the action are in fact nice and remain in the head, but above all the cartoonish graphic style appears lively and radiant, with its pastel colors and a style often close to the voxels that are so fashionable now.", "date": "2018-07-11", "grade": "8.0"}
