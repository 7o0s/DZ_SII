In the case of Toki Tori, we are talking about a product born in 2002 on Game Boy Color, revisited in 2008 on the WiiWare digital platform and now starring in a sequel for Wii U (and PC). In short, from its origins to today, many things have changed and nevertheless the game has changed, which in its initial connotation was a fundamentally fast puzzle platformer, full of enemies to fight and special powers. The transformations undergone by Toki Tori 2 compared to the prequel are profound and numerous, and truly constitute a change of philosophy and approach for the title developed by Two Tribes. The character we play hasn't changed, which is still the chubby chick we know so well, but his abilities have changed, since he can't do much except shake the ground and whistle. It goes without saying that the new gameplay formula sees puzzles play an absolutely central role, so much so that you have to solve a small puzzle even just to climb a step higher than a few centimeters. The Wii U version of the game uses the peculiarities of the GamePad in a relatively limited way: there is the feature to play with the TV off (just press the Select button to make one or the other screen main) and the gyroscope is used during play. use of one of the ~spells~ that Toki Tori learns during his adventure, and which allows him to photograph other characters and characteristic objects. Total puzzle The entire experience sees the presence of scenarios and supporting actors that you need to involve in the action and exploit to achieve your goals. As mentioned before, if Toki Tori finds himself in front of a step that is too high, he cannot climb it directly and must find an alternative solution, in this case calling up by whistling the crab that hides inside a box and which, by moving, can create the ~staircase~ that he needs. And if the obstacle to overcome is even higher? In this case you can resort to a frog, feeding it a ~sticky~ creature. At that point the frog inflates and, by means of a jolt, we can make it spit out an air bubble which ~captures~ the chick and carries it upwards for a few metres. There is also a third possibility of an exploratory type, represented by large birds which capture everything that comes within range, unless it is found in the tall grass, and carry it up to their nest. Each of these situations is first proposed in a simple way, as it is, to then go on to gradually compose more complicated puzzles, in which maybe not only you have to make sure that a frog swallows a little creature to inflate itself, but that it does it in the right point on the map for it to be spotted by a bird and transported a few platforms higher up, right where one of its bubbles is needed to reach an otherwise inaccessible area. In short, from the gameplay point of view, the developers have shown a great imagination and have not even stopped there, introducing the magical melodies that can be activated by whistling and which will be taught to us every so often by a small white bird. The first magic you learn is the one that ~resets~ our progress and sends you back to the last checkpoint, because perhaps you have ended up in a cliff from which it is impossible to get out; the second magic is the ~camera~ which we already talked about at the beginning, which is controlled by moving the GamePad thanks to the integrated gyroscope; the third recalls a much larger bird than all those seen in the game, which takes Toki Tori into the clouds and allows us to view the world map and select the scenarios where we want to go without engaging in excessive backtracking, and so on. ...no half measures The guys from Two Tribes have underlined in more than one interview how some precise design choices have been made to obtain a certain type of experience, and this is demonstrated in the first place by the absolute lack of texts and any suggestion or indication in the game . The idea is that the things we discover about the environment around us, as we go forward and solve the puzzles, will later prove useful in understanding how to access levels that are still sealed, and there is no doubt that it is a fascinating vision. The problem, as we have been able to personally experience, arises when intuition is less clear than perhaps thought and therefore translates into a via crucis of attempts and backtracking which, thanks to the particular connotation of the gameplay, are very little fun or stimulants. The very idea of delegating access to the world map to particular sections of the scenarios is in itself inexplicably awkward and cumbersome, becauseit would have been enough to assign this action to a button and at least partially avoid the possible dead spots. Menu and interface follow the same philosophy and are therefore a little too essential. Fortunately, the list of ~serious~ problems ends here, leaving room for a technical sector that we found very pleasant, thanks to an excellent use of colors and some expedients designed to make the most of the ~depth~ of the scenario (see the polygonal elements placed in front of the view and deliberately blurred). The animation of the characters and their design isn't top notch, but it's functional to the action, while the sound accompaniment didn't excite us. Finally, the addition of a level editor through an upcoming update should be noted, an editor that will be completely controlled via stylus and touch screen.", "date": "2013-04-03", "grade": "7.3"}
