{"name": "Midnight Club 3: Dub Edition", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/midnight-club-3-dub-edition-3.html", "text": "Wild porting Direct conversion of the homonymous title released on PS2 and Xbox, Midnight Club 3: Dub Edition for PSP is in some ways a truly amazing work. Everything, absolutely all the content present in the home console versions has been transferred into a single UMD, and anyone familiar with the Rockstar product can immediately understand the extent of such a process. Animated menus, background music, FMV movies: the presentation of Midnight Club 3 PSP version is substantially indistinguishable from its home counterparts. However, the facade elements are only the tip of the iceberg, considering how the three cities (San Diego, Detroit and Atlanta) in which the game is set have not undergone any cuts whatsoever and how the fleet includes the same dizzying number of specimens to buy, unlock and win. Victories as always to be achieved in the numerous competitions present within the game scenarios. For the uninitiated, Midnight Club 3 is a free roaming title, which therefore sees you busy driving your car in the city streets looking for individual drivers to challenge or for races in which to participate: suitably marked on the map, these are divided in races on circuits, at checkpoints or point-to-points, interspersed with a series of acceleration duels. In short, nothing has been left behind, and Midnight Club 3 on PSP offers the same playful features as its older brothers. Even on a graphic level, the work done by Rockstar Leeds is (at least in part) commendable: the cars appear very detailed, the visual effects are all in their place and the city scenarios do not seem to have been affected much by the passage on the Sony handheld. An almost perfect conversion, then... but only on paper. Because in motion, Midnight Club 3 highlights a number of truly embarrassing limitations. Loading...loading...loading...loading... If it is true that a portable console is also - and above all - made to fill the empty scraps of time of the day, then the products that run on it must submit to the characteristics of immediacy of use: I insert the disc, turn on the console, I play. Midnight Club 3: Dub Edition, on the other hand, cares highly by presenting incredibly long and frequent uploads as a price for the abundance described in the previous paragraph. Loading times of almost a minute mark the start of the game, the change of the car, the start and finish of a race, and even the reset of the car in the event of an accident. It's no exaggeration to say that Midnight Club 3 spends more time staring at the loading screen than playing the game. Which, needless to say, is really unacceptable, especially on a handheld. In any case, even during the actual playful phases, the Rockstar title certainly cannot be defined as an example of optimization: this mainly due to a frame rate that runs at low speeds, invalidating the global cosmetic quality of the product and above all cutting the legs to the sensation of speed. And it's a real shame that this conversion of Midnight Club 3 is penalized by these serious flaws, because otherwise the title has the same characteristics as the home versions: many races, a plethora of modifications available to make your car as tacky as possible , a responsive control system and tasty arcade-style gameplay. Even the wireless multiplayer has been done in a way, potentially able to offer good ideas for challenges to the last drift: provided that there are friends willing to buy the game and able to stay awake during the loading screens. Comment Midnight Club 3: Dub Edition is an example of how a port conversion should not be done. If it is true that the developers of Rockstar Leeds have had a good time in transporting all the contents of the home version to the PSP, on the other hand it seems they have completely forgotten the fundamental pillar of handheld gaming, i.e. rapid usability and immediacy. Already characterized by a not exactly ~pick and play~ play structure, Midnight Club 3 suffers on PSP from an unfortunate series of exhausting length uploads, which by themselves manage to frustrate the efforts of an otherwise valid product. Pros: Midninght Club 3 in the palm of a hand Remarkable graphic design Potentially very long-lived Cons: Absolutely monstrous loading Low frame rate AI and control system could be improved As is known, the concept of portable video game differs in some fundamental aspects from the home one. A handheld platform, however much a techno jewel it may belogical like PSP, it still remains a console originally designed for the purpose of providing substitute play experiences to the home ones, and consequently structurally differentiated from the latter. Precisely for this reason, it becomes a sort of moral obligation for developers of portable titles to adapt a product to the needs of fast use typical of the handheld format. But for Rockstar Leeds, evidently, this is not the case.", "date": "2005-10-12", "grade": null}
