The idea is simple but not obvious, and the developers (coming from Halfbrick, not for nothing) have managed to put it into practice with remarkable consistency, managing to build a game capable of entertaining even beyond the surprise in the initial impact . A somewhat weak track to support all the gameplay load and its limits inevitably emerge over the distance, with the game not offering great progressive depth or multifaceted and varied gameplay, but for short sessions Land Sliders manages to maintain a remarkable freshness. The secret probably lies in the feeling given by contact with the touch screen, and it is not a matter of course. The speed and precision in the response to the commands together with the excellent balance of inertia make the (indirect) control of the character simply pleasant and in some way provide the real incentive to return to the strange game world. It is, in fact, the perfect strong point of the casual game, a definition in which this title fully fits and without too many worries, with its structural simplicity that makes it both easy to manage and immediately enjoyable, thanks to the perfect control system focused on the touch screen. Even the decision to rely on the procedural generation of the levels is part of this typical vision of the mobile game, with scenarios that are always new and fresh but conversely necessarily simple and devoid of a real level design study that can provide a reasoned challenge. In short, Land Sliders is a game that is not afraid of being casual, but rather makes the most of the strengths of this position to offer instinctive fun that can be appreciated by everyone, moreover offered for free with its free-to-play scheme. Moving the earth under your feet has never been more fun than in Land Sliders Moving earth On this bizarre ~overturned~ control system, which puts the player in control of the world surrounding the protagonist, an action game is grafted that would in itself be quite simple and banal. It's about exploring the levels and collecting the objects scattered within them in order to unlock access to the next scenarios. It is clear that the idea of indirect management of the character here represents the core of the gaming experience, because the need to calculate the movements based on the movement of the background, together with the perfectly calculated inertia to make things more fluid but also less predictable, are the elements that break a playful structure that would otherwise have very little to say. Obviously the search for objects is hampered by the presence of various enemies, characterized by rather different behaviors but all particularly intent on hindering our free sliding between the elements of the scenario, while switches, traps, special passages and elevators further explore the possibilities of movement and pose other possible obstacles to be addressed. The game routine is occasionally broken up by the insertion of puzzles to be solved: within the levels, secondary quest lots are placed in certain houses which allow you to obtain additional points, in some cases also requiring a certain amount of reasoning . In principle, however, it is a question of collecting objects or completing sequences of actions by passing over switches or sensitive elements of the scenario but the order in which one must act often requires a certain interpretation of the symbols and cryptic information that is provided, representing a sometimes quite interesting challenges. The procedural construction of the levels has the dual purpose of always making the action varied in each game and not making the roguelike mechanics frustrating which forces us to start over from the beginning with each death of the protagonist. Having as a counterpart a physiological simplicity of the level design, this basic randomness still has the great advantage of helping to make this a particularly appreciable game in short and frequent sessions, just to stay on topic with its perfect mobile location. The other feature which, together with the control system, provides a precise identity to Land Sliders, elevating it compared to the average of other mobile action games, is its particular graphic characterization which gives great charisma to the game world and also stimulates the accumulation ofpoints to be able to unlock new usable characters, the main element of progression.", "date": "2015-10-01", "grade": "7.8"}
