{"name": "Assalto anfibio", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/131950-battlefield-4-naval-strike-assalto-anfibio.html", "text": "Naval Strike is undoubtedly a DLC eagerly awaited by Battlefield 4 fans. The reason is obvious: the focus is all on amphibious assaults, no more deserts or prairies to put on fire under the tracks of the tanks. But above all in Naval Strike there is the return of a modality, obviously in a revised and corrected version, much appreciated in the past: Aircraft Carrier Assault. This ~unreleased~ mode is none other than the much loved Titan Mode played in Battlefield 2142, way back in 2006. Of course, the content doesn't end there. Each DLC released so far has always hosted weapons and vehicles alongside maps and modes. In this case we will have only the hovercraft, as fast and slippery, both in water and on land, as it is unarmed; therefore perfect for infiltrations and stealth movements, but perfectly useless as close support to the troops. For that, boats are the preferred means. As per tradition, the weapons included in the package are five, but to these we can also add the 3GL repeater grenade launcher to be applied under the rifle barrel. In detail of the new arsenal we have the Beretta AR 160 assault rifle, supplied to our army, comparable in performance to the SCAR-H, the SR338 sniper rifle, similar to MK11 Mod 0, the lethal short-range SW40 drum pistol , the compact Russian-made SR-2 ~submachine gun~ and the AWS support machine gun with a standard load of one hundred rounds. Finally, as a gadget we find the ~anti-aircraft mine~, a small mortar designed for helicopters, the perfect complement for all those armed with Stingers and Iglas. There is substance, then. So let's try to figure out if it's worth the usual fifteen euro expense, obviously starting from Aircraft Carrier Assault. Beaches, sun and lots of lead in the new Battlefield 4: Naval Strike DLC! Playstation 4 trophies Five trophies for Naval Strike, three bronze and two silver. Nothing particularly complicated, just do a round of Carrier Assault, explore the map up to the highest point, make a kill with the anti-aircraft mine, with the cannon of the fort (here maybe there's a bit of a sweat) and with the hovercraft . Holiday village Carrier Assault is certainly an added value of the package, but it does not reach the ~tactical~ and complexity peaks of Battlefield 2142's Titan mode. Even if streamlined, Carrier Assault is undoubtedly very fun and full of possibilities, halfway between Rush and Conquest . We start on the islands, trying to capture the control points: when a team's return tickets arrive in half, it is possible to launch the assault on the aircraft carrier. However, this is not obligatory, given that the game is won by blowing up two points on the huge ~carrier~ but also by resetting the opponents' tickets while keeping one's ~mothership~ intact. Challenging, fun and also strategically ~full-bodied~, if you will. The heights of the Titan Mode will not be reached, but without a doubt Aircraft Carrier Assault, among the ~new~ game modes released so far, is the most successful. The map that we liked the most, from a purely scenographic point of view, is Operation Mortar. Simply say that it is possible to fire the cannons of an old fort (nineteenth-century stuff!) in the group of islets below, or if you have good aim we can also target the helicopters trying to storm the mountain. Phenomena from YouTube aside Operation Mortar is a really nice battlefield, very vast and articulated, mixes water, close combat and, as previously written, high mountains, complete with secret passages to get to the fort and suspension bridges, all within sign of an archipelago full of islets with different orography which therefore complicate even more the clash of the infantry. Probably the best battleground in the pack is Operation Breakwater. A map that manages to balance naval open spaces with great mastery, close combat and interesting Levolution moments (nothing to do with sandstorms or skyscraper collapses anyway). A mountain by the sea shelters a dry dock for submarines, so we have two different gameplay styles. The setting is somewhat reminiscent of Operation Metro, but without those huge ~smash~ in the hot spots that made us so desperate. Here, once inside the base, we can also dedicate ourselves to changing the layout of the map. It is possible to close the entrances to the bunker to avoid a real amphibious assault, to bring down a submarine under repair on the heads of the opponents, but also to turn off the lights to make everything even more pyrotechnic. In short, a small level design masterpiece, which commits us so much to esternum as above all inside, with its narrow, dark spaces full of shelters, between stairs, containers and high walls that surround the different marine ~lanes~ of the bunker. The sea is the absolute protagonist of Nansha Island. Shallow waters and the central islets cry out for infantry, with objectives being captured often around fortified structures. An undoubtedly pleasant map, which revolves around moving quickly by sea between the largest island, with the conquest points well spaced and properly positioned to maximize the amphibious gameplay of the map. A setting, this, which undoubtedly works, but which struggles to enter the group of favorites of the package. Mind you, its continuous flow between land and water makes battles extremely fluid (pardon the pun) but it doesn't seem to have that extra something that makes a particularly thrilling map to play continuously. The last setting of Naval Strike, Lost Islands, is really interesting. Still obviously an atoll, a group of islands full of small fishermen's huts, very close to each other, in the center of which we find the wreckage of an aircraft, around which there are the control points, conveniently positioned higher up so as to make it more complicated. Likewise, the aforementioned proximity between the islands and the fords that connect them make this map very popular with quads, who can also use the plane as a ramp to jump. In addition, the jetliner can be detonated via Levolution, thus making the interior accessible for extra cover. Thumbs up here too for the scenarios, for the more tropical setting of the DLC. Beaches, caves, stacks and caverns. A true paradise on earth to be destroyed inch by inch. A DLC, this, which we therefore feel like recommending: never before has quality been added to quantity. Aircraft Carrier Assault, although streamlined and tactically ~nerfated~ compared to what was played in Battlefield 2142, it is still a game mode that works, amuses and entertains; the same thing could be said for the maps, among which Operation Mortar and Operation Breakwater undoubtedly stand out. ~Service~ levolution, with few destructive and spectacular events, but all devoted to interaction with the scenarios.", "date": "2014-05-19", "grade": null}
