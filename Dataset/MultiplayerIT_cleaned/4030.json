{"name": "Black Command", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/black-command-la-recensione.html", "text": "We would not have easily expected to find ourselves writing a review of such a title from Capcom, being a genre and an atmosphere that seem quite distant from the standard productions of the Japanese company, which greatly increases the curiosity about Black Command. It is in fact a sort of real-time strategy game with a military setting (or militaristic, given the general atmosphere worthy of the best warmongering Yankee film), which however offers a rather particular approach to the genre and a mechanic that seems perfectly designed to work at the better on mobile devices. The latter aspect shouldn't necessarily mean a budget production, set up in such a way as to launch a free-to-play full of micro-transactions on the market, yet Black Command often gives this impression. There isn't much of the cleanliness and quality typical of Japanese games (and Capcom in particular, in this case) among Black Command's simple screenshots. One can easily agree on the fact that the graphics have been studied in such a way as not to be confused and always allow you to have a clear eye on the situation, but a certain sadness cannot come after yet another map identical to the others and just hinted at with some strokes on the screen and anonymous menus for managing characters and weapons. However, where the game proves its worth is actually in action, on the battlefield, when you start to master the tactics and progress to more challenging levels, which require some decision-making ability to be able to carry finish the mission and make the mercenaries survive. In short, the idea is a bit trite, the realization is somewhat disappointing but its mechanics are built in a perfect way for the context in which it must be enjoyed, however overall some doubts about Black Command remain. Professional soldiers The game stages various imaginary conflicts but with a very realistic characterization, in which we are called to intervene as captain of a patrol of a PMC, or a private military company, hired from time to time as a contractor by various factions all over the world. of international crises. No particular insights into the history and events that form the background are carried out, here the action counts more than the political fiction, as demonstrated by the instructor captain who introduces us in the early stages of the game. On a simple map the various missions to be undertaken are placed, which include various objectives such as eliminating enemies, destroying bases or rescuing allies, and clicking on these gives access to the action on the field. This is framed from above and without particular representations: the map is a sort of map on which your soldiers and enemies are represented as simple dots and arrows, with which you can interact with short touches on the screen. We therefore find ourselves moving the troops and making them attack, trying not to let them be detected by the enemies so as to be able to take advantage of the surprise effect and reach the objective without suffering losses. During the firefights, some pre-established ~archive~ images revive a bit a graphic setting which in any case always remains extremely spartan, also to maintain the simplest possible approach to the game but ending up being rather monotonous in a short time. The success of the clashes depends on the quality of the weapons you have, the surprise effect and the position you are in, so each phase of moving around the map and of the attack must be conducted with some attention, looking for the trajectories best out of prying eyes and keeping as low a profile as possible. The interface is simple but sometimes not very clear and above all it doesn't always respond perfectly to inputs, even if the pace of the game still allows some inaccuracies, in any case Black Command is well designed to be played with one hand and in sessions that are also very short. Squad management adds depth to an otherwise too basic strategic setting, with the ability to manage your arsenal and party composition to change characteristics in battle. Being a free-to-play, micro-transactions are obviously present, here mainly linked to the purchase of ammunition: although the sparing use of these is an integral part of the tactical approach to battle, the scarcity of shots emerges early and tends to force the purchase of the packages, even if there is no real obligation. The game is entirely in English.", "date": "2018-10-04", "grade": "6.7"}
