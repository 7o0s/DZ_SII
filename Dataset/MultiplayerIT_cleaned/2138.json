{"name": "Jerusalem", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/jerusalem.html", "text": "How hard is the adventure! At times, the intrigue manages to be engaging and it must be admitted that excellent expedients have been devised to unite these three religions in a graphic adventure, but in principle many puzzles are impossible to overcome, often too cumbersome and improbable. This is essentially due to two factors: certain active objects are very difficult to identify on the screen and above all there is a lack of descriptions of the objects and environments with which one finds oneself interacting, which makes them virtually impossible to use intuitively for the overcoming puzzles. Furthermore, the ease with which our character tends to lose his penniless is exasperating: in the most unexpected moments it is possible to die for the most absurd reasons and this can only be frustrating from the very first scene, set in an oasis full of pitfalls  not to mention the mocking messages that pop up every time the game ends tragically and prematurely! In short, the motivation to persevere in the game with attempts is sometimes really lacking. The interface is rather basic but not necessarily intuitive, because some commands tend to have different effects depending on the circumstances and there is the risk of finding yourself desperately looking for a way to exit a zoom screen or reach a specific destination. The left mouse button selects items on the screen and performs various operations, while the right mouse button opens a menu at the top of the screen and you can access the inventory, Adrian's travel diary and the main menu. How hard is the adventure! The idea of the cursor that changes shape and animation according to the type and level of interaction with the objects is original, but at the same time it risks creating some difficulties. For the purposes of the actual game, the solution adopted in the dialogues to speed up the pace and isolate the historical and cultural notions surrounding the main story is particularly useful: the topics of conversation that are not indispensable to the solution of the adventure are highlighted in orange and can be omitted. The graphics are discreet and the settings, as mentioned, very realistic. The shots and the play of light and shadow are also interesting. Since most of the scenes are quite dark, it is a pity that it is not possible to adjust the brightness and contrast, parameters absent in the options menu which only provides for the selection of subtitles and the change of audio settings. The animations of the characters are a bit unnatural: they follow cyclical movements but often freeze and vaguely recall Sicilian puppets, especially during the dialogues, also because sometimes they even forget to open and close their mouths and communicate with their interlocutors telepathically ! In this regard it should be noted that the dialogues are not dubbed into Italian, but simply subtitled; in any case, those who do not understand English do not miss much, because the speech is terrible and in some cases even hilarious. The atmospheric soundtrack, on the other hand, is noteworthy, which contributes enormously to the atmosphere of the adventure with Middle Eastern motifs and mystical choruses. Perhaps it is appropriate to add two other flaws to those already mentioned: often at the climax, the game invites us to change discs (there are two CDs in all) and this is repeated several times, regardless of the progress in the plot; the lack of the Examine command seriously damages the involvement and overall realism of the game, as well as subtracting essential information for solving many puzzles. The conclusions It is difficult to express a synthetic judgment on a title of this type: as an adventure it is undermined by serious playability problems and certainly does not offer major innovations, but as an educational product it is quite valid. For those who know how to approach it with the right spirit, it will be able to provide a relatively exciting gaming experience and more than food for thought on the religious and cultural issues that the protagonist finds himself facing. On the back of the package, it is explained to us that this adventure aims to teach ~universal values such as overcoming differences, sharing wisdom and knowledge~ but to be honest, once this journey into the past is concluded, one has more than ever the impression that certain differences are too difficult to overcome, if not downright impossible: in short, without false moralism and without detractingDespite the good intentions of the developers, one has the suspicion that practically nothing has changed in Jerusalem in two thousand years of history. Ultimately, I would heartily recommend Jerusalem to most modern catechists and religion teachers, but not to all conventional PC adventurers, at least not those with no interest in theology! Historically speaking... Jerusalem is presented as a ~historical adventure~: in reality, despite having a plot and being based on puzzles to be solved with the point and click system, it falls into the category called ~edutainment~, which embraces those educational programs that aim to teach while having fun (not always with the hoped success). By its very nature, therefore, a title of this kind is not aimed at all audiences of adventurers. In fact, the aim of the game is not to save the world from the threat of the bad guy on duty or improvise a spy to thwart an international intrigue, but to ensure the already precarious balance between the exponents of the three major monotheistic religions no less than in Jerusalem, where for centuries Jews, Christians and Muslims have struggled to coexist in a melting pot of cultures and beliefs that are as similar as they are different. There is a beautiful girl to save, as in any self-respecting game: in this case the girlfriend of the protagonist, a 20th-century Scottish archaeologist who, no one knows why, has drawn upon himself the wrath of the goddess Ishtar . This condemned him to travel back in time in order to save the incarnations of his beloved Sofia three times: after having explored Pompeii in the first century AD. and found the woman shortly before the eruption of Vesuvius, Adrian Blake is thrown into Jerusalem in 1552 - and, if life there is hard even today, let alone in those days! This game is therefore the sequel to ~Pompeii, the legend of Vesuvius~ and good things come in threes, given that Cryo already foresees the release of a third final episode. The simple and decidedly linear plot, presented to us in a chilling introduction to say the least, is nothing more than the pretext to encourage us to know and compare the universes of Jews, Christians and Muslims, exploring realistic and meticulously reconstructed settings thanks to the collaboration of the leading experts and of the French Runion des Muss Nationaux. In addition to the experience of immersion in the past offered by the game, there is a Visit mode, which allows you to wander undisturbed in the most famous mystical places in Jerusalem, and an Encyclopedia (in my opinion a glossary), which brings together and explains the terms philosophical and religious which we come across during the adventure and which perhaps, in consideration of the goals that the developers had set for themselves, could have been made a little better.", "date": "2002-05-06", "grade": null}
