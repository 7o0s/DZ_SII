Someone could define it simplistic in its desire to put the player in the role of a small badger who must survive the adversities of nature, managing to feed his puppies, without however involving the complications that the role would impose. Despite all the criticisms, the work of Might and Delight has obtained a good response from the public, such as to convince them to build a sequel. In Shelter 2 the animal changes, this time we are a lynx, always with offspring, and the game structure is completely changed. Forget the linearity of the previous chapter, with a challenge of increasing difficulty managed on progressive levels, and welcome to an open world in which to roam freely. At the beginning of the adventure our lynx has to find a shelter where to give birth, after having escaped in the night from a pack of wolves, so she has to bring some prey to her cubs to make them grow up. When they are old and strong enough, they will follow her around the wide world until they are adults and can start their own offspring. In short, the main objective to be pursued is to make them survive predators and hunger, a bit like what happened in the first episode, with the difference that a lynx is not a badger and must hunt to feed itself. We reviewed Shelter 2 and found that even bobcats can stumble sometimes Cosmic void The developers probably thought they could solve the problems of the first Shelter by expanding the game world and making the relationship of the protagonist animal with nature more dynamic, choosing an excellent species both in the role of prey and in that of predator. Unfortunately our lynx, apart from hunting or running away, can do absolutely nothing else. Someone must have noticed this when it was decided to scatter collectibles around the map as a filler to pass the time for the player. In reality, at the beginning, hunting is an interesting activity, with the small animals of the forest running away in every direction trying to escape us and the lynx mercilessly biting them, killing them, and then devouring them or taking them to their puppies, provided that the stamina bar allows it. and don't have to stop to catch your breath. Alas, the excitement doesn't last long and you soon realize that the hunting system itself is very limited, with most of the time spent chasing prey, not caring where you are. Theoretically there is a stealth system that should allow the lynx to attack the still living food by surprise, but it is managed directly by the artificial intelligence and works badly, making us discover it in most cases. The management of the map and the amount of huntable animals is also malfunctioning. Perhaps it is a simulative quirk that has not made the distribution of prey homogeneous throughout the map, but there are some occasions in which the emptiness that we find ourselves admiring becomes a source of profound frustration. For example, it happened several times to see our puppies starve to death because we were unable not to capture, but to find prey for entire minutes. Is this realistic? Definitely, but we would have preferred game dynamics less entrusted to chance, with the player sometimes reduced to impotence in the face of the inclement nature. Is it a metaphor for life? Maybe yes, or maybe it's just hasty planning. Predators and prey Related to the previous problem is that of predators. Incidentally, these are mainly wolves, which aim to feed on lynx cubs. Not bad, if it weren't for the fact that on many occasions they manage to kill the wolf cubs suddenly, without being able to intuit or perceive the aggression, perhaps because they are engaged in a chase. As before: it's realistic, at least ideally, but does it work in terms of gameplay? The question is not useless, also because these are really the only two mechanics of Shelter 2, and in the end they both work halfway. For the rest, don't expect to do anything else, so don't hope for escape routes from the monotony of the gameplay, which remains unchanged from start to finish: whether you are prey or hunter, you simply have to run. In a similar picture, the captivating graphic style, close to the cut-out one of Tearaway, is of little use, because everything else is really missing. In a certain sense, Shelter 2 does not even believe what it would like to be, since it simulates very little the life of the lynx in its various aspects, limiting itself to representing only one. It's a shame, because walking around exploring the map isn't even bad, as some of the landscapes are really nice, but it's impossible to ignore how under-exploited the open world is.", "date": "2015-03-16", "grade": "5.8"}
