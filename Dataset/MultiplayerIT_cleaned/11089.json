In writing this review of Ni No Kuni II: The Fate of a Kingdom Prince's Edition for Nintendo Switch, tears fall a bit. At the beginning of 2000, Hino's team was the champion of new age JRPGs and stood out for the production of games with a precise artistic, musical connotation, its own personality well distinct from the most popular Japanese role-playing titans, with PlayStation 2 as master console. Also on Nintendo DS there were memorable works, but the beginning of a portable transition was already smelled. Ni No Kuni: The Menace of the Ashen Witch was a nice bolt from the blue, a compact JRPG, not very dense, but inspired, capable to excite, albeit in 2010 - the year of release of the title on PS3 - it came after an impressive JRPG ride between Xbox 360 and Wii. In retrospect, the work did not scratch as it should have and it took the sequel to bring the brand back to consoles with a weighty product, albeit still underestimated today. The Prince's version arrives on Switch these days, complete with DLCs, which finally dusts off the JRPG catalog of the Kyotense hybrid with the title which, for Level-5, represented the return to the peaks it deserves. Ni No Kuni II was a brave enough product, capable of proposing a good mix of novelty and tradition head-on, seasoned with fun elements and mini-games that refer with heart and head to the splendid Rogue Galaxy Factory mode.Let's see how Hino's study concludes the portable transition of his most recent triple-A JRPG. Performance on laptop Artistically, Ni No Kuni II always remains inspired, even on Switch Evan and Roland are certainly not an original duo, but in the alchemy of the Ninokunian multi-verse they are a couple that works, immersed in a beautiful riot of characters, colors, styles and ecosystems. How is the performance of the little prince in portable mode? Having said that we had already tested the Revenant Kingdom in portability on Aya Neo, at settings that are certainly more attractive than the Switch ones, the Nintendo console defends itself with discreet dignity. To draw a parallel with the PC world, we are talking about medium settings in the characters and medium-low in the environments, to which we must add the absence of anti-aliasing, which is then a bit the usual Achilles heel of Switch. To ensure discrete fluidity, the developers have converted the game by lowering the resolution: if you notice a little less in docked mode, the glance is a little more evident in portable mode, in which cutscenes and gameplay are penalized by the cleanliness of the image that cannot fool an expert player. Only problems then? No, absolutely not: as much as the technique has its weight, what matters in portability is playability and the product works well, juggling a dynamic frame rate with due sagacity. There are moments of enormous fluidity, others of greater effort, but the conversion grinds clashes with sufficient familiarity, without ruining the experience. We are always talking about portable mode, the one in which Switch has always lowered the bar a little to at least promote playability; in docked mode, the title is more stable and the resolution also increases, in general the performances are obviously higher, but there is always room for improvement. However, the product is perfectly playable, thanks to a seamless action combat system that gave the franchise so much openness, confined in the first chapter to a splendid albeit limiting turn-based time system. Always nice to see Roland is a character from the colorful multi-verse created by Level-5 Even with a clearly portable soul, Ni No Kuni II on Switch is always a pleasure to see and savour. Even when he doesn't commit himself or doesn't seem to want to - and this is clearly not the case - Level-5 has an incredibly recognizable and appreciable style and trait: it is no coincidence that Studio Ghibli has repeatedly crossed paths with Hino and companions, capable more than all the others of inheriting a clean, delicate, sometimes naive, splendid design. The writer has finished the remaster of the first on Switch, alternating portability with docked mode; in this sense, Il Destino di un Regno is a more complete, full-bodied, expensive product in terms of resources and playful flow thanks to a combat system designed to be without dead spots, thus weighing down the general weight of the engine and the loaded scenario. We are therefore pleasantly surprised by the fact that on Switch, a machine from 5 years ago, Ni No Kuni II runs and is playable with relative fluency, thus bringing to the small screen a JRPG architecture of the past made up of exploration, combat, characters and mini-games.The realms and environments remain the focal point of the production, bringing all the mastery of Japanese creatives to the Nintendo console who now, thanks to the vast potential audience, have the opportunity to redeem the software and make it established as a flagship JRPG on Switch. Tough task? Not too much, given the balance and perfect playability. However, we are also launching a little further, in a few weeks, when Switch OLED will be available with its 7'' display and its bright colors: if on the one hand the color rendering will certainly be amplified, we have some doubts about the ability to keep the technical sufficiency of resolution and anti-aliasing (not) applied on the bar, which will inevitably be called upon to mix Evan and Roland's adventure on a slightly larger display.", "date": "2021-09-16", "grade": "7.7"}
