But no one has succeeded yet, because the problem, with voodoo, lies precisely in finding the ingredients. For this reason it is fortunate that in the trio protagonist of the adventure there is Papa Doc, an expert shaman of Caribbean invoices. Sure, her ritual knowledge would be nothing without the help of the cook Blue Belly and the lethal Jane Starling, but it's still a good place to start. Yes, because our heroes are dead and, at least in the beginning, they wander like tormented spirits. The spell was cast by Papa Doc's turncoat wife, a certain Zimbi, who allied herself with the pirate Greenbeard to capture Captain Flint and make his crew a handful of ignorant and sane zombies. Of course, much more is boiling in the cauldron, but these are spells and machinations that we will discover during the adventure. For now it is imperative to return from the realm of the dead. Group individualism In Ghost Pirates of Vooju Island you can switch from one character to another at any time, because everyone lives an independent story, even if connected to that of the companions within the broader global plot. The most interesting aspect, however, concerns the sharing of the inventory: it is not possible to exchange objects between group members, but only to show them to one of the two characters who are not present, thanks to a telepathic bond that Papa Doc has managed to activate. In this way the puzzles are enriched with an unusual component, which adds depth to the classic mechanics. Also a little interaction between the characters increases the sense of immersion in the story. In fact, and the game makes no secret of it, it's useful to switch to another narrative branch when we find ourselves stuck with a character, so as to let our minds rest and later return to the puzzle that made us sweat. Not that there's much to lose sleep over to solve the puzzles - by the way, there are so many - also because they are mostly based on the combination of objects, and the screens are few. It must also be said that most of the puzzles suffer from a certain detachment from the narrative moments; you will probably forget almost all of them at the end of the sensational final slide. We won't reveal anything to you, but when you reach the climax of the game, right at the climax, you will feel as if after having trembled at the idea of finding Cthulhu in the cellar, you had discovered that the noise you heard was that of a cat. Talent begins where budget ends If you're an adventurer with a long history, you may have turned up your nose at the prospect of playing a pirate adventure signed by Bill Tiller, art director of The Curse of Monkey Island and A Vampyre Story. The fear that it might mimic the atmospheres of the historic Lucas adventure was justified, but fortunately unfounded. Ghost Pirates has a personality of its own, especially when it comes to some of the supporting characters. Tiller's hand makes the splendid two-dimensional backdrops shine, also saving the 3D models of the characters, which, although sparse due to limited resources, enjoy a personal touch from an artistic point of view. It's just a pity that among the many jokes they make, few are really hilarious, also due to the many obvious and insistent references to the sexual sphere. Apart from this, the story does not fall into a boorish or childish levity, and even more mature players will like it. The speech is in English, and it is a merit, considering that the accents help to characterize the three characters. And anyway there are subtitles in Italian that save understanding. Only one flaw: you can not skip the dialogues. This means that we will have to listen to even three paragraphs of speech to the end. We could tolerate it if the writers were excellent dialogue writers, but this is not the case. Nothing dramatic however, the trip to Vooju Island is well worth a few small sacrifices. And it doesn't end there, does it Bill?", "date": "2010-05-17", "grade": "7.2"}
