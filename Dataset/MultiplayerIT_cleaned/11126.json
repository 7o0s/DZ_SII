{"name": "Guitar Hero III: Backstage Pass", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/guitar-hero-iii-backstage-pass.html", "text": "Despite technological progress and the new consoles, with all their polygons and special effects, sometimes a winning basic idea is enough to make an excellent video game. This is certainly the case with Guitar Hero, which has had the merit of revolutionizing the rhythm game genre. Developed in 2005 by Harmonix, for PlayStation 2, the game was sold together with a very particular controller, shaped like a guitar: you had to play the sequences shown on the screen on it, trying to keep the rhythm of the song in the background as as accurate as possible. After the acquisition of the team by MTV Networks, the series remained the property of Activision, which entrusted the development of subsequent episodes to Neversoft; all while Harmonix, for its part, was building Rock Band. Guitar Hero III has already enjoyed a mobile conversion, which unfortunately suffered from the typical problems of Java applications with regard to sound. For this Backstage Pass, will the developers have solved these problems? The first stages of the game see us becoming familiar with the control system and with the structure of the musical phases: on the screen there is the reproduction of a guitar neck, on which the ~notes~ that we are going to play by pressing the keys 1 , 2 and 3 of the mobile phone. As usual, precision comes first: press the buttons at the right time and we'll get high scores, which in turn will allow us to unlock other songs from the repertoire to be able to perform in a club. It is at this point that Backstage Pass differs from the ~simple~ Guitar Hero III: if in the latter we limited ourselves to playing, reproducing the mechanics that made the series famous on PlayStation 2, in the new Hands-On Mobile product we will have to take control of our alter-ego in more ~extensive~ ways. We'll practice songs, scout venues for us to perform, advertise our nights in busy venues, and have the usual power-up shop at our disposal. In short, we will be able to manage the matter as a whole, even paying attention to the times and needs of our guitarist, at least when it's time to go to sleep. As we progress, the game map will give us access to all the places present, we will be able to unlock all the pieces of the repertoire and our fame will increase dramatically. The graphics in Backstage Pass don't differ much from those of Guitar Hero III in their mobile reduction: we have the same design style for the characters, a very similar quality of animations and the same interface. In this case, various elements have been added to represent the life of our guitarist outside the stage, but unfortunately, an exceptional job has not been done in this sense, with very bare settings, devoid of details and with some visually mediocre solutions. But what matters most, i.e. the sound sector and its functionality, has it been improved? The answer, unfortunately, is no. Indeed, if possible, the gaming experience appears even worse: on the test phone (Nokia 6120 Classic) there is no correspondence between the rhythm of the song and the ideal timing for pressing the keys. In short, there is no synchronization between sound and graphics. Although the game may work well on other terminals (although the concept itself does not go well with the Java platform in terms of audio functionality), this is a significant problem. PRO Lots of things to do besides playing Proven game mechanics Good repertoire of songs AGAINST Defects in the sound far from negligible Response to commands often inaccurate The experience varies greatly depending on the mobile", "date": "2008-10-16", "grade": "S.V."}
