Very many or almost none, depending on how you look at the Level-5 series: the visual novel structure full of puzzles and enriched by an exceptional audio-video sector has made school, giving millions of enthusiasts dozens and dozens of hours of fun; on the other hand, however, it is undeniable that a certain immobility, shaken only by some technical evolution and a growing variety of puzzles, gives the impression of an immutable series, stopped in 2007, the year of the first arrival on Japanese shelves. Anyone who has come to ponder the purchase of the sixth and final chapter starring Layton, the final one of the second trilogy, need not fear however: Professor Layton and the Aslant legacy is a worthy conclusion, a tour around the world that will English professor and his assistants in the face of a threat on a global scale, evolving at the same time personalities and relationships. Layton takes leave of his audience with an excellent closing chapter The 3D effect Professor Layton and the Aslant Legacy uses the 3D effect for aesthetic purposes only. The result is successful and not particularly tiring for the eyes thanks to the fixed screens and very limited camera movements. Well done but certainly not essential. The living mummy Every adventure of Layton begins with a letter of invitation, a call impossible not to listen to the inquiring soul of the good Hershel, and the Aslant legacy is no exception. This time the destination is Karpograd, on the shores of the lake where Professor Desmond Sycamore invites Layton, Luke and Emmy to investigate the discovery of a ~living mummy~, the one who after the very first hours of the game turns out to be an emissary of the very ancient and lost Aslant civilization. Things turn out to be more complicated than expected and the searches of the agents of the Targent, a secret organization moved by the worst intentions, are also focused on the girl, the key to deciphering a mystery dating back to a million years earlier. If the characters of the plot do not differ from those of the previous chapters, it is difficult not to give Level-5 the credit for having surpassed itself: the mystery initially limited to a small village perpetually buried by inches of snow soon becomes a race around the world through several different locations, the showcase for dozens of more or less primary characters but always well characterized as are the subplots that intertwine and overlap, to then find a common conclusion. In short, brilliant dialogues, high-quality animated cutscenes and the usual atmospheric soundtrack form the basis for a playful structure that returns roughly unchanged. Of the 500 overall puzzles, about a fifth are directly related to solving the mystery of the Aslants, a solid skeleton built from classic puzzles, perhaps revised so as not to look too much like those of previous episodes, and some novelties. Compared to The Mask of Miracles, we had the impression that the Japanese developer wanted to abandon certain innovative playful ideas, in favor of a return to the origins made up of many puzzles and varieties. We would certainly have appreciated a little more courage, perhaps returning to experiment in an attempt to exploit the specific characteristics of the console, but even so there is so much iron on the fire that it is difficult to complain. As per tradition, the three mini-games also return which, once unlocked, you carry with you throughout the course of the adventure, gradually collecting levels of increasing difficulty: Boutique is a sort of Gira la Moda in a Laytonian sauce; Squirrel asks us to help the little rodent in an attempt to save the precious acorns; Lastly, Gardener stimulates the green thumb of the players by giving them complex lawns to color with flowers that have blossomed from a limited number of seeds available. They are three tasty extras, of course, but although they do not fail to amuse, they perhaps leave us indifferent more than on other occasions. On the other hand, it is interesting how Level-5 stimulates the hunt for the last pixel, given that in addition to the inevitable aid coins, available in industrial quantities for the talentless puzzlers, by exploring the depths it is possible to identify some secret finds to collect and a series of objects with which to challenge the users met through StreetPass. The rewards for attentive hunters are souvenirs taken from the locations visited and a variety of extras. The outline of Professor Layton and the Aslant legacy is therefore rich and designed to entice you to apdeep the narrative universe of the series, with goodies such as news from the world collected in the newspaper clippings of World News, to testify to the love of the Japanese team for their creature and for details. Between daily puzzles, bonuses, mini games, StreetPass options and assorted secrets, there's really a lot in The Aslant Legacy for those who are not satisfied with the full-bodied story. The visual sector is equally well done and uses the same 3D of The Mask of Miracles, also taking up the controls and the interface. The result is accurate and convincing, once again able to not make us regret the 2D of the beginnings too much.", "date": "2013-11-06", "grade": "8.8"}
