The Bit.Trip series as a whole has been quite a journey and has single-handedly contributed a good deal of quality and originality to the WiiWare platform. Not only that: the characterization studied by the team has managed, albeit with ups and downs, to overcome simple retro-chic self-satisfaction (pixel art for pixel art's sake?) and convey good level playful content, representing a functional environment for video game experimentation in various fields, focusing on the game itself rather than on the various and possible communicative potential of this medium, which is particularly fertile ground for the more intellectual indie productions. With Bit.Trip we have returned to the pure, archetypal, almost stereotyped video game, where the use of the pixel demonstrates on the one hand belonging to a consolidated universe with solid roots, on the other the search for a simple and almost alien trait, which is perfectly associated with the deconstruction and reconstruction of the videogame structure starting from its fundamental elements: pixels to touch, pixels to avoid, eye-hand coordination, empty space, constant danger of game over. Bit Trip Flux therefore closes the circle of the series, returns to its origins proposing the same structure as the first chapter - Bit Trip Beat - but reversing its scrolling and overturning the elements on the screen. It is not a simple reissue of the first chapter but a symbolic homecoming of Commander Video, which carries with it all the baggage gained with the entire Bit Trip series. Perhaps not the best Commander Video ~trip~ but most likely, in terms of finish and shape, the summa of the series. Commander Video goes home It is no coincidence that Gaijin has decided to overturn the scrolling in Bit Trip Flux, we said, because in fact in that sense opposite to the first trip of Commander Video there is the taste of a symbolic return ~home~, to the setting original, however a path that keeps track of what has been achieved during the entire series, enriched by new experiences gained in the course of the other chapters, perceptible in graphic and sound references, as well as in the maintenance of certain ~conquests~ made by the protagonist in his progression, such as the health bar and mid-level checkpoints that allow for a less frustrating enjoyment of the game. Conversely, the difficulty compared to Beat seems decidedly increased and those who do not know what they are getting into having never tried other chapters of the series should keep in mind that it is one of the potentially most frustrating videogame experiences of these years. It is certainly a more aesthetic than substantial reworking of the progenitor, but the additions made have smoothed the characteristic and penalizing roughness of Beat and we notice a further refinement in the graphic and sound sector that elevates this Flux to the pinnacle of what has been seen in the series. The structure is the same as the original and sees us engaged in a sort of scrolling Pong, in which we control a bar (mostly stylized representation of the protagonist) by moving it on the vertical axis simply by tilting the Wii Remote. So going up and down we have to reject the myriad of pixels of various types and behaviors that arrive from the left side of the screen, trying to make as few of them escape as possible so as not to drop the energy and ultimately send us back to the check point. Also in this case, the absence of a Game Over screen and the direct reference to the game contributes to leaving us glued to the screen in an attempt to progressively improve performance, gradually pushing us one step further in the continuous tension towards the discovery of further digital marvels, an addictive capacity that Flux shares with most of the other installments of the series. As a minus, there is a certain inconvenience in setting the controller which forces an unnatural and comfortable movement of the wrist, which moreover does not allow great sensitivity and precision. Epiphany of pixels There is something narrative behind the minimalism of Bit.Trip and in this Flux the idea becomes more evident, although the interpretation is by no means easy, at first glance. The three levels have significant names such as ~Epiphany~, ~Perception~ and ~Catharsis~, and that a narrative substratum is hidden behind such high-sounding words is also clear from the enigmatic animated sequences that introduce the three macro-sections, but the decoding ofmessage is probably entrusted to the sensitivity of the player rather than to an objective narrative sense. It's a marginal question, however, because the semiotics of Bit Trip Flux are played out entirely during the game, in moving between the different dimensions given by the active multipliers, in the action that becomes music, as is the tradition of the series. It matters relatively little to appear in a ranking (moreover not online) at the end of the session, here the search for the high score and the best behavior in the game is linked solely to the audio-visual crescendo that derives from the progression between the multipliers, which profoundly change the appearance and audio accompaniment once engaged in a veritable sensory feast, starting from the dull greyness of the base level to reach the heights of the ~Meta~, a psychedelic epiphany of pixels, colors and music. Although from a playful point of view, as pure entertainment, Bit Trip Runner probably remains the best chapter of the series, Flux has moments unattainable for the other chapters, in terms of sensations and aesthetics, in particular as regards the amalgam of sensory stimulations which, in some cases, really make instinct take over rational thought in the movement of the bar on the screen.", "date": "2011-04-19", "grade": "9.0"}
