We don't talk so much about the charisma of the characters who are part of the group or about the mythologies built on individuals, who indeed have always shown themselves to be rather rigorous and ~professional~ as musicians, at least compared to the many excesses to which the musical environment has accustomed us. rather than a general vision of his own music which has always proved to be extremely coherent and defined, set in a representation with fantastic contours - a real ~lore~ - which has strongly contributed to fueling the Iron Maiden myth. At the cost of flattening the band on the more commercial elements of their production, it cannot be denied that the particular iconography of the group also plays an important part in their impact on the common imagination, distilled starting from 1975 in the works of illustrator Derek Riggs is become something of a parallel epic of Eddie and his creepy nightmare world. Iron Maiden: Legacy of the Beast, the official video game of the British band available for mobile platforms, refers to these elements. Obviously the story of Eddie grappling with divinities and creatures from the afterlife is a bit pulled by the hair but the Riggs-ian atmospheres are particularly spot on and in line with the history of the band, as well as maintaining that somewhat grotesque spirit that it is typical of heavy metal band. We therefore find ourselves controlling the mascot of the group in a strange adventure with metaphysical contours, in search of fragments of one's soul and in an attempt to fight the great threat represented by various evil spirits intent on dominating the world. With a non-trivial choice, the game is in practice a sort of RPG focused on the particular lore of Iron Maiden, set as free-to-play and therefore obviously containing the inevitable references to in-app purchase packages which, however, do not seem to be too necessary to continue. The official Iron Maiden game obviously focuses on Eddie as he embarks on an epic adventure Eddie the multiple hero Eddie is a somewhat quick-change character, he appears on album covers with different aspects and in decidedly different situations and this characteristic is exploited in the game to propose a protagonist with changing characteristics. Along the way, therefore, different types of Eddies are collected (mummy, cyborg, British soldier, zombie and so on) each characterized by different statistics and specializations in attack and defense, to be used if necessary during the fights. Legacy of the Beast takes place on a map made up of different locations, always drawn from the vast lore typical of Iron Maiden, with convincing reinterpretations of atmospheres and settings seen in the group's various albums, in which progressive fights are scattered, which take place in turn in the most classic RPG style. The combat system provides for controlling a party made up of three characters, one of which is precisely the changeling Eddie and the other two are various creatures of your choice that can be conquered by investing fragments of soul conquered in combat, through a system that guarantees a certain drive to conquer the loot that can be transformed into new battlemates or various increases for the latter and for Eddie. The mechanics of the combat system is based on the typical ~rock, paper, scissors~ relationship which pushes to combine the skills of the companions in the best way together with the right configuration of the protagonist to exploit the weak points of the enemies, thus also guaranteeing a certain depth strategic during battles. Obviously, the microtransaction system is played precisely on the experience levels and special skills, which considering the sudden increase in difficulty found in the more advanced levels can become an important shortcut for those who have less propensity for grinding.", "date": "2016-07-11", "grade": "7.0"}
