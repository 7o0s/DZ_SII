Now, however, we always talk about Pokmon. And how to blame them? The umpteenth annual version in double edition is enough to climb the sales rankings and remain on the podium for months, in any country in the world. Then, every now and then, it's easy to pull a spin-off or a parallel episode out of the magic top hat like the various Pokmon Rangers or Pokmon Mystery Dungeons... they won't be bestsellers, but they make a good number, especially among the little ones , which perhaps poorly digest the well-hidden complexity of the main series. And it is to this audience that PokPark: Pikachu's Great Adventure is aimed, a rather particular mini-game container. Pikachu to the rescue There is no doubt that among the almost five hundred pokmon currently existing, the most famous is Pikachu, the yellow electric ~mouse~ which, moreover, has been raging in cartoons since the very first episode. And Pikachu is also the protagonist of this delightful adventure: the PokPark is in crisis and Pikachu will have to save it, reassembling Mew's Celestial Prism before it's too late. To do this, Pikachu will have to make friends with the various pokmon who, depressed, wander around the areas of the park. The story is really very simple and naive, a pretext to put the player in the role of Pikachu and entice him to interact with the other little creatures in the game: Pikachu will in fact be able to become friends with the pokmon by winning the challenges that they will offer him, whose variety unfortunately it is one of the weaknesses of the game. Essentially there are only four mini-games that are repeated for the various types of pokmon in the park: in Tag Team you will have to reach the opponent; the Athletics Test will ask you to face a sort of obstacle course; in the Quizzes you will have to choose the right answer to the questions that the pokmon will ask you; finally, Challenge is the action minigame in which you will have to fight against another pokmon using some simple skills, a bit like in the original series. Some pokmon will join you when defeated and can be selected to face the Supergames, that is, those races that will guarantee you a fragment of Celestial Prism: some pokmon are in fact more suitable than others to face certain challenges, facilitating or not the task of the player. The idea behind PokPark: Pikachu's Great Adventure is not at all evil and will amuse children a lot, but the simplicity of the very few mini-games offered, combined with the total absence of a multiplayer mode, makes the experience rather boring and anything but. which lasts for adults. A ticket to the PokPark PokPark: Pikachu's Great Adventure is clearly a low-budget product, yet it turns out to be unexpectedly well-groomed. The proposed world recalls the one already seen in games such as Pokmon Snap, a colorful and varied fauna in which the various pokmon roam, caught in the various generations of the main series. However, we are not talking about a stratospheric creation: the textures are decidedly bland and monotonous, the three-dimensional models do not show off who knows what number of polygons, but it is certainly not a technical department to be rejected, if only for the very welcome presence of the ~verses~ typical of pokmon, which come directly from the cartoon to replace the old electronic sounds of the portable editions. The music, on the other hand, is certainly the weakest aspect, cheerful and carefree but really repetitive and, at times, annoying. The biggest flaw however remains the control system: although it is possible to move Pikachu within a completely three-dimensional setting, the developers of Creatures Inc. have avoided the approach of games such as Super Mario Galaxy, relegating the movements and actions entirely to the horizontally positioned Wiimote. The discomfort of the grip, combined with the slow and unsatisfactory response, is certainly a defect to be corrected in the event of a second episode.", "date": "2010-08-05", "grade": null}
