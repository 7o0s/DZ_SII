Will it be thanks to the perfect coexistence and alternation between the strategic/management phase (exploration of the map, search for resources, assembly of troops) and the tactical phase (arrangement of troops on the battlefield, turn-based battle against enemy armies)? Or for the versatility of the game system, which aims at thoughtful and intelligent gameplay? Don't worry, we certainly won't be the ones to make the usual gamer revisionism attached to the sofa on the reasons for the fame of Jon Van Caneghem's title, also because we wouldn't have good reasons to do it: despite the past years and a not exactly agile interface, however, nothing that lovers of virtual strategy cannot digest in a few hours, the masterpiece is always the same and we confess that once again familiar with its many mechanics, we have not struggled to get caught up in long game sessions. Unfortunately we can't turn a blind eye to certain problems related more to the HD operation itself than to the actual gameplay. Let's start with a test: look at one of the images that adorn the article. No, there is no need to go and compare them with those of the original edition. The crux is not how much the HD graphics improve the appearance of Heroes of Might & Magic III, which by itself was not the top from a technical point of view even in 1999, but how effective it is in communicating the technological renewal that the acronym ~HD ~ he assumes. Of course, certainly the legibility of the scenarios and sprites is better than in the past, but evaluating it for what it is, can we really say that it adds something to the game? A job like the one done a few years ago by LucasArts with the first two Monkey Islands is one thing, in which the graphics were not only revised, but completely redesigned and rethought (with fluctuating, but still appreciable results), another story is this lazy tracing of the original, moreover equaled (and surpassed) by some free mods, not compatible with this version, which even allow you to get to higher resolutions. In short, we don't want to say that it's not nice to find Heroes of Might & Magic III in a version more suitable for modern video cards and the latest monitors, but to be honest the added value, if we have to limit ourselves to examining the implications of high definition , it's really minimal. Isn't something missing? So far we have talked about the Heroes of Might & Magic III - HD Edition underlining that it is the masterpiece of the time to which the high definition graphics do not add much. Unfortunately now comes the painful notes. The developers have stated that the two expansions of the game, Armageddon's Blade and The Shadow of Death, were not included because the original sources have been lost and redoing them from scratch would have required too much work. We can believe it, why not, but it remains a significant problem, especially for those who loved the original, who are the ideal audience for this reissue. In short, forget the city of Conflux, forget some scenarios and some incredibly powerful artifacts. Above all, forget the random map generator, one of the most used functions in the original, much loved playing in lan or local multiplayer, but also playing alone after the conclusion of all the scenarios and campaigns. Sure, there's an editor that lets you create your own maps, but it's not the same thing, at least in terms of speed. We also add: forget you can install all the mods and additional content created over the years by the not very vast, but very active community born around the original. Sure, there are seven campaigns and around fifty skirmish maps, but it's still a lot less stuff than enthusiasts are used to. The only real new feature included in the HD Edition is support for multiplayer via Steamworks. It doesn't work great for now, but it still makes it easier to play online on modern operating systems. Of course, without a random map generator you have to be satisfied with those already present, which enthusiasts know by heart, but at least you don't have to go crazy with connection protocol configurations that are no longer supported. Unfortunately, however, even on the multiplayer side there is a small flaw: the cut of the LAN option. Nothing decisive, since very few would have used it, but since it was in the original, it is not clear why it shouldn't be in the HD edition. Will the high definition graphics of Heroes of Might & Magic III - HD Edition be worth its price?", "date": "2015-01-30", "grade": "6.0"}
