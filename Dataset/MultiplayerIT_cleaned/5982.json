Tons of text, tightrope turn-based combat, shortage of bullets, moral choices, abilities galore, obstacles of all kinds, a team of extreme characters to keep at bay and traps placed almost everywhere are the hallmarks of a game demanding role-playing, long, often slow and almost never condescending with the player. It is the latter who must read, explore in detail and choose the way forward through an arid radioactive desert that crosses Arizona and California, dosing the water and deciding towards which call to direct your group of rangers who have the thankless task of facing madmen, marauders, political crises and ever more dangerous and powerful factions. And taking a road, participating in an event or making a choice translates into important changes that enhance the player's role. In essence, Wasteland 2 has everything it takes to sit in the pantheon of the great classic RPGs despite the obvious lack of refinement especially in relation to the technical sector. But the graphics, whose most obvious change is related to the models of characters and monsters, is not the only novelty of this Director's Cut which, among other things, comes in the form of a free update for those who have already purchased Wasteland 2 on PC. The revised and corrected version of Wasteland 2 promises an even more intense and immersive experience Beauty is not everything Unfortunately Wasteland 2: Director's Cut does not bring us the official adaptation in Italian (made in combination with users regarding the PC version of the basic title) but it brings us several new features such as the transition to version 5 of the Unity engine. After the introduction we finally find ourselves in the game, the camera rises to frame our characters and here we are in front of the new Wasteland 2 which, thanks to brand new effects and models, is undoubtedly less crude and more pleasant than the original. But the change is certainly not overwhelming. The lighting has improved and the decidedly more defined models clash less with respect to the more refined details of the scenario but Wasteland 2, despite the destructible covers that play more on the gameplay than on the graphic rendering, remains a modest and not particularly inspired title from the point of view stylistic not counting the travel map which is still an eyesore. Fortunately, as we have anticipated, the technical improvements are just one of the novelties of this special edition which brings us the dubbing of 8000 lines of dialogue, improves the combat system, adds various talents and adapts the interface to the pad. And it is here that we run into a first problem. Wasteland 2 is a title born for the mouse that has to adapt to a completely different control system on consoles. Controlling the characters out of combat, simply by moving the stick, is more comfortable but the automatic selection of objects does not work well especially when there are many interactive elements around us. For the rest, things are much better even if the automatic management of some aspects of the combat can cause some problems and that is why it is always good to check that the character's mode is that of movement or shooting before starting the action in order to avoid filling your teammates with lead or running into a horde of angry giant frogs. The X key allows you to quickly reload your weapons while Y allows you to examine and pass the round with the possibility of saving time units which will be added to those of the next round until the maximum possible limit is reached. The character menu, navigable with triggers and shoulder pads, includes everything from the inventory, upgradable character sheet, perk purchase window, skills, and diary. Pressing the left stick allows you to change the mode of use of the same which can be used to rotate and zoom the camera or to move it to study an area and finally change the size of the dialog. Instead, the right trigger activates the shooting mode and the left one allows you to choose the skill with which to interact with an object. Xbox One goals Excluding a couple of secrets to find and some cumulative achievements, most of the objectives are linked to the story and to the various possible choices of a decidedly long and articulated title that does not allow you to obtain allyou get the achievements in a single match. In essence, a generous investment in terms of time is required to obtain all the thousand points up for grabs. Headshots! Wasteland 2: Director's Cut fills one of the biggest gaps compared to the first two Fallouts by introducing a system called Precision Strikes that allows you to aim at a specific part of the body of enemies. The percentage probability of hitting is obviously lower but a blow to the head causes more damage and can stun while a center in the legs can cripple the opponent, guaranteeing us an advantage that should not be underestimated in a rather difficult title to face. On the other hand, even if some encounters have been rethought and precision shots increase the balance of the experience, the level of difficulty, especially in the first hours of the game, remains very high and the composition of the party is decisive for being able to get away with it. Without a character skilled in trade, exchanges are problematic, without a burglar it is necessary to break through every door with the risk of triggering traps and without a sniper preferably placed in an elevated position, the fights can get decidedly tough. Each skill is vital for a title whose evident legacy is that of Fallout starting from the gameplay passing through the design but is less forgiving towards the player so much so that a few minutes from the start of the game it can happen to take the wrong road and meet certain death . What Brian Fargo wanted with tenacity and decision is a hard, long and difficult role-playing game, full of details to take into account, full of texts and full of rather important dialogues to understand what is happening around us. A title that has been deprived of a real stealth system and is built to allow infiltration and approach without providing the player with too many tools to deceive enemies and alter the level of challenge. And fortunately the balance and the arrival of the title on consoles do not change the importance of these factors, all desired and defended by inXile. The gist, in essence, does not change, including the controversial impossibility of exiting the fight which can put even the most savvy players in crisis even if, it must be said, it forces the player to carefully evaluate each step and makes the experience even more intense . Furthermore, as the level of the characters increases, things become more balanced but it is undeniable that the first hours of the game can be a real nightmare and this is why the customization of the rangers, unfortunately poor in aesthetic choices, is a truly precious possibility . Creating a versatile and varied team exponentially increases the possibilities and variety of gameplay in a title that, like the first Wasteland and the two two-dimensional Fallouts, gives great importance to role-playing dynamics. Dynamics that translate into the possibility of choosing the approach with which to face a large range of situations that includes relationships with other characters, important dialogues influenced by perks and characteristics, alarms, explosives, elevators, computers, disputes, atomic bombs, cannibals, giant scorpions and everything you'd expect from a post-nuclear Brian Fargo title.", "date": "2015-10-12", "grade": "8.6"}
