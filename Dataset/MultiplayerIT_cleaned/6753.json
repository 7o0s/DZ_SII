Recently, however, the debate has reached a wider audience when Comedy Central aired ~Freemium Isn't Free~, an episode of South Park that points the finger precisely at the dubious mechanics and the use of microtransactions on which they are based most often games of this type. In short, criticisms of the free-to-play model and games that abuse it have long been on the agenda, but while most developers are looking for ways to mask the aspects least appreciated by users, the US FizzPow team has done the exact opposite, embracing the dark side of so-called ~clicker games~ and using it to your advantage. The result is Bitcoin Billionaire, a mobile game which, although it clearly enhances the free-to-play model, ensures that the user never feels frustrated or taken for a ride. Bitcoin Billionaire is a new mobile game where you become a billionaire with just a few taps. More or less... Free to tap How Bitcoin Billionaire works is very simple: locked in his own bedroom, the player's avatar must accumulate bitcoins and reinvest them in various sectors that allow him to earn more money (to be reinvested in turn in more expensive sectors). In practice, to get bitcoins you simply need to touch the screen: the faster the touches, the faster you earn. The markets in which it is possible to invest give a further boost to the bitcoins earned, and as they become more expensive they also become more unlikely: you can invest in the video game market or in the energy drink market, spend all your bitcoins on building of hoverboards from Back to the Future or in a wellness center on Mars, up to time travel with Dr. Who's Tardis. Similarly, the user can gradually purchase more advanced software to get more bitcoins with each touch of the screen. Thus a vicious circle is created which is based on the sole objective of increasing one's bank account and beautifying one's bedroom little by little, perhaps by changing the desk, buying a cat or installing a window with a view of the sea. The authors have succeeded in the evil intention of creating a system of small rewards, so much so that not even a minute goes by without the player being given a prize or a bonus that stimulates him to continue his activity as an ~obsessive clicker~. Above all, however, advertising and microtransactions are present in massive form, but the developers have been very careful to integrate them so that they are not absolutely frustrating for users. For example, a market collapse could occur in one of the sectors in which investments have been made, but the player is given the possibility of avoiding the temporary malus by watching a video of a few seconds; likewise, a multiplier can be further increased by displaying an on-screen banner for a few seconds. The choice is up to the player. In fact, it is possible to play Bitcoin Billionaire without ever spending a cent and without ever watching a second of advertising, but since the goal is to earn more money in the shortest time possible, one is constantly tempted to sit through a few seconds of advertising for the sake of the own virtual wallet. As a further stimulus there is even a counter that shows the speed with which bitcoins are being earned, while a system of objectives gives small goals with which to keep busy.", "date": "2014-11-17", "grade": "7.8"}
