Assassin and executioner, ~shield, sword and only hope~ of the oppressed in warring Louisiana and protagonist of this contemporary spin-off - but fundamentally unrelated - to the third installment of the ~regular~ Assassin's Creed series. Aveline is probably the greatest strength of Assassin's Creed: Liberation HD, as well as of the original version, a charismatic character with a well-defined identity, obviously starting from her being the first female assassin to appear within the Ubisoft series. In the charm of Aveline and New Orleans, the excellent plan developed by the publisher stands out to best characterize what is in all respects the reduction to a small size of a standard chapter of Assassin's Creed. Not being able to count on the vastness, complexity and variety of the grandiose settings that animate the main chapters, the portable adaptation had to compensate for a necessary and substantial reduction with a greater concentration of features, thus staging the deeds of a bewitching protagonist within an atmospheric city and its surroundings. Even without going into the details of the actual quality of the original chapter, already at this point the logical discrepancy on which these conversions from portable console to home platform are fundamentally built appears clear: how to justify the compromises that a handheld production necessarily faces, once instead we find ourselves within the domestic context, where the limitations of the portable environment basically do not exist? How attractive and convincing can a reduced chapter be in the technical and content aspect after the orgy of amplitudes, graphics and freedom of movement of Assassin's Creed IV? Aveline gets a makeover and prepares to face the ~big~ chapters A charming stranger The narrative structure has remained substantially unchanged from the original version for PlayStation Vita, staging the deeds of the assassin Aveline de Grandpr within the New Orleans area between 1765 and 1780, or the period of the Creole rebellion in the colony. Against the background of the conflict between Spain and France for control of the area, the characteristic intrigues of the series intertwine, which re-propose the eternal struggle between the order of the Templars and the Assassins. Herself of French-African origins, Aveline represents a perfect example of the cultural melting pot that characterizes the Louisiana area, of which various aspects are highlighted by focusing on the one hand on the racial issue of slavery and on the other on the clashes between European powers with the hidden war inside between the two secret factions in eternal struggle. Within a rather solid script, there is an in-depth study of the origins of the character and his deep motivations that is less developed than what was seen with the other protagonists of the series. The HD re-edition has included some new sections that help to better complete the picture of the character, who however still can hardly compete with the space reserved for the other protagonists of the series and their respective stories. On the other hand, this constraint on the tracks of the script is felt throughout the structure of the game, which for reasons of space and resources has had to reduce various surrounding elements such as the management components (present in the form of controlling the family businesses, but not at a deep level like that seen in other chapters), not to mention the freedom of exploration and non-linearity seen in the last major chapter, clearly at the antipodes of Liberation's philosophy. Strangely, the multiplayer sector has also been removed, with a decision which, although it does not risk raising major criticisms given the consistency of the mode present in the original, is still rather strange, given the context in which the HD version is placed. The impression that derives from the impact with Liberation HD is therefore that of a substantial step backwards in the evolution of the series, with a restricted playing area in which to move and a tight succession of events that are imposed on the player, who remains as the only freedom the possibility of carrying on the classic secondary objectives of a sandbox that stimulate exploration but offer very little in terms of in-depth study of the story and gameplay. From this point of view, it fits the parties perfectlyparticular collocation studied by Ubisoft for this chapter within the series, presented as an Abstergo software offered directly to the player, without going through the intermediary Desmond Miles (or whoever for him) and therefore staging the events exclusively on a ~historical~ level by Aveline. Assassin and gentlewoman At the time of its release on PlayStation Vita, Liberation most impressed with its ability to bring the core of the classic Assassin's Creed experience to a portable console, for the first time. With this HD re-release, the structure of the game makes the journey back to the home consoles, on which the revival of the classic elements of the series obviously does not cause a particular sensation. The movement and combat system of the protagonist is largely borrowed from the almost contemporary Assassin's Creed III - practically representing the only point of connection with the chapter in question, in addition to the location in the American continent and a brief cameo by Connor - while the gameplay offers the usual mix of exploration and action within a rather simplified level design compared to what was seen in the major chapters, due to the small size of the setting and a lower variety of situations in which it is possible to find oneself. The main novelty introduced by this chapter in the classic mechanics is the possibility of using different clothes that allow the protagonist to go more or less unnoticed, however influencing her movement and combat skills. In addition to the normal assassin's outfit, which allows Aveline to act exploiting her maximum potential but being rather showy, our heroine can disguise herself in order to blend in better and act undercover, using for example a ~slave~ outfit, more easy and modest, or one for a rich lady that allows you to go unnoticed and fascinate the guards, at the cost of major limitations in terms of movement, however. It is a rather apt addition but which is also somewhat guided by the game, given that the use of one or the other costume is often forced by the progress of the missions. The combat system has been partially adapted to the use of the classic controller but does not present substantial variations compared to the original, which already carried with it the chronic strengths and weaknesses of the series: in the face of a high level of spectacularity, the usual not very high level of challenge, based above all on the right timing with which to carry out the counterattacks, even if there are some decidedly more demanding events, such as when you find yourself fighting as a ~lady~. Xbox 360 goals The game contains 30 achievements for a total of 400 Microsoft Points. Being an exclusively single player experience, the achievements are partly scattered along the plot in correspondence with some fundamental events and partly reachable through various performances related to exploration, the collection of objects or the amount of killings or actions completed. As per tradition for the series, full loot takes some effort. A great facelift The original Liberation suffered in particular from a rather uncertain technical realization, despite the overall positive impact, the partial limitation of the hardware or perhaps a lack of optimization manifested itself in a series of quite evident problems between framerate drops, management problems of polygons and pronounced aliasing. None of this has remained in Assassin's Creed: Liberation HD, which is presented in the glory of high definition with a decidedly renewed appearance, so as not to look too bad next to the major chapters of the series. Of course, the polygonal structure has remained more or less the same as before, with the same limitation of the explorable areas and the relative scarcity of elements shown on the screen, especially when compared with the other episodes, but the evident reworking carried out on the models polygonal and the change of assets with textures and materials associated with high definition have significantly changed the entire graphics sector, presenting itself as one of the most convincing HD transposition operations seen so far (within the limits of re-adaptation and without considering the real own remakes). Furthermore, the major framerate problems that affected the gaming experience on Vita have been resolved, a minimum wage for a transposition on a home console but still a welcome feature. Also note the change in the lighting system which significantly brings the rendering of Liberation HD closer to that of a normal titleor for current gen home consoles. In short, the make-up operation on Aveline proves to be a success, to whose calculation must also be added the content additions made by the developers with the addition of about fifteen unpublished missions that expand the story and the background of the characters, although do not contribute much to change the pace and overall quality in terms of gameplay. The audio has been completely remastered and is in line with the average quality of the chapters on home consoles.", "date": "2014-01-15", "grade": "6.5"}
