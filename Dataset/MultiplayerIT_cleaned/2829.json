{"name": "Pumpkin Jack", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pumpkin-jack-recensione.html", "text": "As we will see in the course of the review, Pumpkin Jack screams Halloween and MediEvil from each seed contained in the protagonist's pumpkin. Developed by a single person, Nicolas Meyssonnier, it's a title that doesn't claim to revolutionize anything, betting everything on humor and an artistic direction with a very marked cartoon style. In essence it is a 3D action platformer with puzzles to solve, lots of fights, some collectibles to find (crows' heads that can be used to buy skins, that's all) and various extra sequences, such as a ride on a mine cart or an escape from a burning building. What is surprising is that, despite the production level not being very high, everything works as it should and, indeed, even does something more, reserving quite a few surprises. History As soon as Pumpin Jack is launched, one expects to be faced with an amateur product. In some ways it is, but in others the ability shown by Meyssonnier to know how to manage his limits is truly astonishing, that is, to never have claimed to do more than his means allowed him. The game begins with the rebirth of Jack, a damned soul to whom the devil himself entrusts a mission: to defeat the wizard hired by the inhabitants of Arc En Ciel to counter his infernal armies. Jack is a criminal at heart, while in his new incarnation the body is no longer that of a human, but of a scarecrow with a pumpkin for a head. He doesn't like working for the devil, since he doesn't like taking orders, but what else can he do? His adventures begin with the most classic tutorial that teaches us how to jump, climb and dodge obstacles. So let's take our first weapon, or rather, our first two weapons: a crow, which will be with us for the rest of the game, and a shovel, which we will fortunately change for something more effective already from the second level (of six). We will soon discover that the crow is also a useful tool for solving some puzzles to get us out of trouble from situations that are not exactly peaceful. For example, we can use it to lower drawbridges, or to remove obstacles. As for the more traditional weapons, however, they have only one use: to smash objects and enemies. The attack keys are only two (one for the weapon and the other for the body), a fact that alone should make you realize how simple the combat system is. In the advanced levels, more powerful weapons are unlocked and the enemies get stronger, but in general you have to go ahead and give blows as if there were no tomorrow, dodging when necessary, without spending too much time making mental comparisons with the technicalities of a game Platinum or other modern action. Gameplay In Pumpkin Jack everything is simplified to the bone, starting with the story that flows clear and light like the water of a stream. Every now and then Jack and the other characters get a few jokes right, but there's never really anything shocking. To vary the basic formula a little, the platform phases take care of it, generally well done, but with problems in some sections that make them a bit frustrating. In particular, every now and then the camera ends up not making the scene very legible, leading to otherwise avoidable mistakes. Nothing destructive, mind you, but in the long run you notice. As you notice the basic repetitiveness, broken only partially by the aforementioned mini-games, of which the possibility of detaching Jack's head from the body to solve some specific puzzles deserves a separate mention. For example, in the second level we will have to be able to bring a bomb to its destination using Jack's tentacles to throw it along suspended platforms. Too bad that these are predetermined moments and that you can't take your head off when you want. After all, doing so would have created more than a few stumbling blocks in terms of game design, so it's for the best. Graphics From a technical point of view Pumpkin Jack is a decent title, especially considering that it was made by one person. The graphic elements that make up the levels are very simple, almost stylized, but Meyssonnier has composed them with taste, creating a perfect fresco for Halloween... maybe too much, in the sense that it really looks like a kind of poster game for the upcoming holiday, with a particular eye for the little ones. Probably the effect is intentional, but the result is really breathless from a strictly artistic point of view. The same goes for the rich cast of enemies: it too seems to come out of a Halloween book for children, including zombies, knights dumb humans like zombies, living skeletons and whatnot. Note that each of the six levels ends with a boss, usually a tougher enemy to take downking and from the most complex attack patterns. The first ones are not very difficult, while the last three give a few more headaches. Nothing insurmountable, however, so much so that you get to the end of Pumpkin Jack in five or six hours. The only reason to return to the game is to have missed some collectible. Of course, it must be said that it doesn't cost very much, given that we are talking about  29.99, but if you are clear about what you are about to buy, it can definitely be worth it, without expecting who knows what.", "date": "2020-10-30", "grade": "7.0"}
