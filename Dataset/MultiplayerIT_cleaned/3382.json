After all, the remastered edition of Age of Empire 2 already exists: it's called Age of Empires 2: HD Edition and it came out a few years ago, followed by at least three major expansions, which have been added to the original ones. In short, what is the meaning of this new operation? Meanwhile, Microsoft wanted to continue the experience of Age of Empires: Definitive Edition, continuing the operation of rejuvenation of the franchise; he also wanted to perfect his own formula, proposing an edition of the game that goes beyond the remastering of the contents, proposing itself as an attractive product also for those who own and have played the previous editions of the game. In short, if Age of Empires 2: HD Edition was the original with some tweaks, Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition is Age of Empires 2 to the nth degree, with more profound changes in the interface, content and graphics. Revised mechanics For those unfamiliar with it, Age of Empires 2 is a real-time strategy game based on the collection of resources and the historical evolution of the controlled civilization, whose buildings and units significantly improve from one era to the next. Without having to re-describe what is rightly considered a classic of the RTS genre, let's focus on the novelties of this edition, which are not few. As we said, Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition has undergone a complete overhaul of some game mechanics. The developers went to find all the little problems that plagued the original and worked hard to fix them. For example, now there is no longer the risk of selecting citizens together with the army, sending them to die in war, given that the system automatically distinguishes them, excluding non-combatant units from multiple selections. Another welcome simplification is that of production, both economic and of units. Incidentally, now the work of the fields can be automated and there is no need to restart it every time a harvest cycle is completed. The interface also allows for clearer management of the activities of individual buildings, showing the production queue clearly on the screen through icons. This way you no longer run the risk of getting confused about the units you are training and the time required to deploy them. These are small comforts that greatly rejuvenate the gameplay of Age of Empires 2, now decidedly more in line with modern real-time strategy. Honestly, after trying them we didn't feel any need to go back to the old version of the interface, also because many of the revised aspects were actually nuisances, rather than features, annoyances that nobody really misses in the world of strategy games. Gameplay However Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition does not offer news only in the field of the interface. Much has also been done to give owners of older versions a reason to replay. For example, the artificial intelligence of the highest difficulty level has been revised, in order to make it more reactive and more human in tactics, eliminating the advantages it had in the old versions, perceived by many as tricks. Also added new content, such as challenge missions, designed as an extension of the tutorial for players who want to try advanced tactics. In fact, defining them as tutorials is quite improper, because they are decidedly demanding, but it gives an idea of their purpose. For example, it is taught to ~run~ between the eras, i.e. how to reach the Castle Age as soon as possible, or how to curb opponents' rushes and so on. As you may have guessed, these are tactics designed essentially for playing online, where the access barriers are now very high, given that it is frequented by players who have been studying the game for years. Knowing them won't make you win right away, but at least it will allow you to realize what's happening. Challenge missions also offer another benefit: they remove some of the barriers to entry to the genre, never considered by traditional tutorials. In short, learning how to produce units is right, just as knowing how to manage the army is right, but having a tutorial that explains some concepts so far linked only to practice is a pretty good entry bonus. Graphics and new content In addition to all this, Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition also includes a new expansion, called The Last Khans, which joins the three released in recent years and which offers three newcampaigns, which allow you to use new civilizations and which give access to three little-known but excitingly told stories, in the style of the series. In total, the contents of Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition are considerable in quantity, given that we are talking about a total of thirty-five civilizations included for twenty-seven campaigns. The official numbers speak of at least two hundred hours of play, excluding online, but in our opinion, if you really want to try everything, replaying some campaigns at the highest difficulty levels, you go even further. In short, what better appetizer waiting for Age of Empires IV? Also note the excellent graphics revision work, which not only maintains all the new features of the HD version, but also adds a high definition texture pack, excellent for those who play with 4k resolution. Also added brand new animations, among which those of destruction of buildings stand out, really well done even if they clash a bit with the style of the others. In short, it is really a lot of stuff for a game whose price has been set at just under twenty euros. Obviously he's old, but if Age of Empires 2 hasn't tired you yet, or you've never played it and want to try it at its best, the Definitive Edition is definitely a recommended purchase, regardless of any other possible evaluation.", "date": "2019-11-12", "grade": "8.8"}
