On personal computers it is a real institution, an excellent game, very realistic and with an infinite longevity guaranteed by the numerous teams of enthusiasts who circulate on the net. The console conversion was not as traumatic as one might think, but certainly quite radical, the immediate arcade imprint that the title assumed is certainly not faithful to the original. The Xbox 360 version follows in the footsteps already traced for the conversion to 128-bit consoles, winking at an arcade shooter rather than a concentration of realism, but first things first. The EA title, unlike its PC counterpart, has a decidedly enjoyable offline mode. The plot, despite being well orchestrated and managed by numerous interventions of fake networks in real time and by interviews in the field, is little more than an excuse to set up our battles which for the occasion see the US and Chinese armies opposing each other in the territory of Kazakhstan devastated by numerous internal riots. We will play both in the role of the Americans and the Chinese and it will be quite engaging to face from time to time those who were our comrades in the previous battle, as it will be equally exciting to see how much the war told by the networks differs from that experienced on the battlefield. The offline single player mode consists of twenty missions, in which we will have the opportunity to use all the classes of our soldiers and also all the means at our disposal. We will start as simple soldiers advancing from grade to grade, we will be able to drive tanks, helicopters, small boats and armed jeeps. We will be devastating as stormtroopers, or cynical and precise as perfect snipers. The missions are very varied, from defending and attacking bases aboard a tank, fighting near a refinery to flying with the helicopter in exploration in search of a ship to eliminate, and we have to tell you that we had a lot of fun bringing them to an end. At the end of each level we will get an evaluation that is based on some parameters: enemies killed, allies lost on the battlefield and time taken. The overall level of challenge has been increased compared to the version that appeared on Xbox and PlayStation 2 First Person Shooter The overall level of challenge has been increased compared to the version that appeared on Xbox and PlayStation 2, it is not impossible to finish the missions, however it is much more challenging to complete them with high scores. The heart of the offline mode is the so-called hot swapping, practically during the campaign levels by aiming at one of our fellow soldiers or one of our vehicles and pressing the X key we will literally step into the shoes of this soldier or combat vehicle. This is easier said than done, however imagine an instant teleportation system from one soldier's body to another. We cannot hide that this possibility has innumerable implications in terms of gameplay: first of all it allows you to move from one end of the game map to the other in a few moments, then it allows you to always face the enemy with the right ~specialist~ at the right point. Furthermore, thanks to this possibility we will never die, in fact we will always be able to migrate into the body of another fellow soldier. However, hot swapping also has a small problem, related to the A.I. limited number of allied soldiers, in fact once we abandon the body of an almost dead soldier left in a strategic position, these, instead of defending the position, will throw himself into the fray as if he were perfectly healthy. Arcade The arcade breakthrough can be grasped not only by the easy and immediate control system, but also by the extreme ease with which we will lead the vehicles on the battlefield. Bonuses such as those that increase health and our offensive capacity, which appear from time to time during battles only increase the ~console~ turn given to the title. Technically speaking, the months of delay compared to the release of the 128-bit version have served the DICE developers to improve the game engine which now features much more defined textures, soldier models that have undergone an increase in polygonal mass, explosions much believable with a very good smoke effect. You immediately notice the attention paid to the small details added, such as the holes made in the walls by the bullets and the empty cartridges, which are deposited on the ground after having come out of the magazines of our rifles. The frame rate remains mostly stable both offline and online, without suffering too much from hectic situations. The levels are large and sufficiently detailed even if in some of them the buildings aretoo similar to each other and a bit ~dull~, without considering the fact that it is not possible to enter all the buildings. The increase in power, due to the passage of hardware, has also benefited from the visual of the ~sniper~, now much sharper and deeper, unfortunately not so some animations of the soldiers who sometimes seem to slip on the battlefield. Technically Battlefield, since its genesis, was born to be played online and it could only be the same on Xbox 360, thanks to the excellent support of Xbox Live Arcade combined with the efficiency recovery of Electronic Arts servers. The EA title supports online matches of up to twenty-four players simultaneously in two main modes, assault and capture the flag, playable in any of the sixteen available maps. The servers are fully customizable, being able to establish not only the game mode but also the size of the map, proportionate to the number of players. Online you can play quick, custom, ranked or just free games. Unfortunately it is not possible to take advantage of the character that we have created in the offline universe, however even via Xbox Live it is possible to increase our rank and with perseverance we will be able to become real professional soldiers. The maps have been created very well, with many tactical points and respawn areas improved compared to previous versions. We said it at the beginning of our article, Battlefield is certainly one of the longest-running titles on the current videogame market, and we owe this not only to the goodness of the product but above all to the many online communities that have formed over time. Real clans that continue to challenge each other, organized like real armies and eager to always defeat all their opponents, making their strong point not only in action but above all in tactics. All this now lands on the Xbox 360 version that supports the creation of clans, with the possibility of recruiting new members from time to time and creating real team tournaments. Comment Battlefield 2 is a decidedly successful product, an almost obligatory purchase for every Xbox 360 owner who loves the genre. We could instead discuss the attractiveness of the title towards all those gamers who have already played it on 128-bit consoles, in this case the interest is destined to drop dramatically, being improved only in some small nuances, first of all the graphics . We specify it here in the comment, do not expect programming miracles, the game engine while exploiting high definition is substantially the same dedicated to the ~younger brother~, and it is clearly perceived that its genesis was not based on the hardware next generation from Microsoft. Pros Good offline mode Great online Technically improved... Cons ...but it wasn't born for Xbox 360 A.I. elementary After being released a short time ago on 128-bit consoles, Battlefield 2, the beloved first person shooter from Electronic Arts, arrives on Xbox 360, were the months of delay enough to improve the already decent product? The answer is not so simple and immediate, but we will try to shed light on the improvements made by the DICE developers. War is once again the protagonist on the new Microsoft console, and obviously it does so by betting a lot on online gaming.", "date": "2006-04-28", "grade": null}
