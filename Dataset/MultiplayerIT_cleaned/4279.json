It is therefore a matter of special surveillance, also because in these cases the game often finds itself poised between two possible outcomes: a title that can aspire to great results if the license is supported by a certain study on the play front, or a simple commercial operation without too much concern. Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery manages to be both, but its dark elements go beyond what might be the normal shortcomings of a simply bad game. The fact is that it is not a bad game, on the contrary it has some interesting ideas and we note a good job done by the developers in the reconstruction of the atmospheres of Hogwarts and above all in the writing of a completely original script, able to fit properly into the lore created and carefully controlled by J.K. Rowling. Its problems emerge from the drifts of the monetization system and in a certain sense they represent an even more serious threat, because they border on ethical issues that cast a bad light on the whole operation. But let's go in order: the game is a sort of adventure with elements that could be defined as an RPG set in Hogwarts, where we find ourselves playing a new character admitted to the first year of the school of magic. We find all the typical elements of the Harry Potter saga, with the same teachers, the classic locations of the institute, the obvious references to known events and the situations that we might expect in the life of a Hogwarts student, from the choice of the House to the lessons about spells, potions, flight and so on with all the characters faithfully reproduced digitally. In addition to this there are the original elements, given by the introduction of the new protagonist and a completely new group of students, among whom friendships, rivalries, enmities, mysteries and assorted adventures will emerge. To further enrich the plot there is also a dark past surrounding the protagonist's family, of which it is rumored that the older brother, previously expelled from Hogwarts, has remained involved in unsavory matters and there is someone who even whispers the name of the one-who-must-not-be-named behind the whole thing. Raise your wand and wait We are faced with a sort of multi-event, in which different game situations follow one another through direct connections from one setting to another, therefore without the possibility of freely exploring an open world. We go from phases of dialogue and cutscenes to various tests to be completed between lessons, exams to be taken, quests and magical fights that take place with a somewhat cinematic cut. The graphic style adopted tends to cartoonish but manages to capture the basic characteristics of the characters and settings as we are now used to seeing them from the film adaptations and this, in addition to the good writing, makes Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery an excellent side experience for all fans of the series. From a purely playful point of view there is not much to do, to tell the truth: it is basically a question of touching various elements on the screen and possibly tracing signs in correspondence with the casting of spells, or taking part in other tests of this type based on timing and precision of movements, without these ever representing very demanding tests. The mechanics of the ~quests~, so to speak, is extremely simplified with the need to tap around the screen and ~tap~ several times to charge energy bars that allow you to advance in the test and earn experience points and rewards your choice of money, gems, energy and stat boosts. The latter are divided into empathy, courage and knowledge and based on their level they allow you to adopt different choices and solutions in the various game situations, opening up interesting possibilities in the development of the story. So far a rather convincing picture of Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery emerges but the biggest problems emerge when its system of waiting and micro-transactions is taken into consideration. We are now accustomed to free-to-play titles that depend on energy consumption and force you to wait or purchase refills in order to move forward and this game is no exception, but here the matter is taken to the extreme by the linear structure of the adventure and duration andquest mechanics, scientifically designed to push the micro-transaction. Each test in which we take part must be completed within a certain number of hours or minutes, otherwise we will have to start from scratch if this limit is not respected. If we add to this the fact that every action carried out within a test consumes the famous basic energy, and that recharging this requires waiting even for several minutes (one energy point requires a four-minute break ) it is clear that a somewhat perverse mechanism emerges whereby, in addition to waiting, there is the need to respect the time limit imposed in order to be able to complete the mission and not lose the progress made. This gets worse as the game progresses because in the more difficult tests every single action involves a greater expenditure of energy forcing more frequent breaks, and it is practically impossible to do anything in the waiting phases, since it is also a linear development adventure. After the umpteenth wait imposed in the face of a few minutes of game played, the hypothesis of relying on micro-transactions can become quite concrete for some less patient users and considering that this is also a title aimed at a rather young audience, the picture that emerges is not really uplifting.", "date": "2018-05-04", "grade": "5.8"}
