In this specific case, the developers' philosophy was to favor gameplay and keep fluidity high, with rather stable 60 frames per second in both docked and portable modes. A sensible choice, which succeeds in the ambitious attempt to translate the experience offered by the NetherRealm Studios fighting game on the Nintendo platform in an almost perfect way, preserving its many facets and technicalities net of a control system that is sometimes problematic due to the lack of a actual d-pad and the excessive sensitivity of the Joy-Con analog sticks. Nothing the adoption of a Pro Controller can't remedy, of course. However, the price to pay for such a rich and solid package lies in the pure and simple visual component, substantially lower than what is seen on PC, PS4 and Xbox One. In this case, sophisticated instruments or the proverbial bionic eye are not needed to distinguish the downgrade: just connect the console to the TV to notice the marked decrease in resolution when passing from cinematic sequences to in-game action, with rather evident aliasing phenomena and the general feeling of being faced with a sort of ~low preset~ which influences the quality of the polygonal models, the textures, the assets in general and above all the lighting system, which more than anything else hits the characters mercilessly, making them flat and sometimes confused with the background. The conversion We have accompanied this review of Mortal Kombat 11 for Nintendo Switch with images captured in person, so by looking at them you can get a pretty good idea of what we are saying. The authors used a dynamic solution with some reconstruction techniques, and this is particularly evident in the rendering of the hair, full of artifacts. Furthermore, the shots that accompany the transitions to the contrary are very annoying, that is, when during the campaign you pass from fights to cutscenes: there are moments in which the hiccups are so strong that even the audio skips for a few moments, and it is something that hopefully it will be fixed reasonably quickly with an update. The lowest point, however, is touched with the controversial Kripta mode, which on the Nintendo console seems to recall the spatiotemporal themes of the campaign, sucking us into a vortex that apparently projects us to the times of the GameCube between muddy textures, repetitive assets and a shot of eye that is decidedly old-gen in its entirety. It is clear that the edges highlighted up to now are strongly rounded off when playing in portable mode, a feature that also represents a strong point for the NetherRealm Studios title but which must be subject to some rather annoying limitations; in this case the obligation to remain connected to the network so that the game can synchronize any unlocked object with the servers, which in fact makes modes such as the aforementioned Krypta and the Towers of Time inaccessible, with their modifiers and rich rewards, when we are out and about with Nintendo Switch and we don't have Wi-Fi. It is strange that the authors wanted to be inspired by certain freemium productions, especially present on mobile, as regards the management of the loot, but at the same time they did not understand the fundamental features, such as a system that keeps track of the objects obtained offline to then actually unlock them on the first reconnection. We hope that an update will bring order to the matter, also because the community has already widely expressed its disappointment about these and other controversies related to microtransactions. Among the positive aspects of the conversion, the local multiplayer mode must obviously also be included with the two Joy-Con held horizontally: although in this case the controls are even more problematic, it is still positive (and far from obvious) that this option is present, as well as support for voice chat in online competitive multiplayer, to be activated via the official Nintendo application for iOS and Android. In this regard, we ran into a series of unexplained network errors that made it as difficult to test the matchmaking as we would have liked, but the system seems to work well, without episodes of excessive latency that could compromise the enjoyment of the experience: anotherplus point. Structure and gameplay If you have read the review of Mortal Kombat 11 for PS4, you already know how abundant the package packed by the guys from NetherRealm Studios is. The fulcrum is represented by a rather long campaign, made up of twelve chapters each divided into four missions that use long cinematic sequences as a narrative glue to tell us a story that is a bit b-movie at first but which acquires meaning and brilliance as you progress. proceeds, alternating at the command of different characters to counter the new threat represented by Kronika, a goddess capable of controlling the sands of time who has projected into the present several fighters who disappeared in previous episodes. A clever expedient to enrich the roster, initially characterized by twenty-four warriors with the possibility of adding Shao Kahn as a preorder bonus and further protagonists in the pipeline with the DLCs. The variety and validity of the individual characters is unquestionable, there is a great abundance of moves and Fatalities, the novelty represented by the Krushing Blows and the possibility of resorting to the spectacular (and perhaps all too accessible) Fatal Blows when the vital energy falls below 30%. Winning or losing is almost always a matter of measures, the range of each single blow is an aspect that must be assimilated in order to be able to fight with maximum effectiveness and score the inevitable combos, in this case a little less emphasized than past but still capable of dealing significant damage. Then there is the whole question of the RPG elements, presented in a different way compared to what was done with Injustice 2, with greater attention on the memorable layouts and the predefined variants for each fighter, the possibility of equipping maneuvers and above all the wide availability of aesthetic unlockables whose obtaining, however, is linked to mechanisms that are a little too oriented towards monetization. This can be seen in particular from the aforementioned Kripta, which, moreover, on Nintendo Switch seems to require higher figures than on other platforms (but we have not yet been able to verify the matter, watch out) to open boxes whose content remains random, however, in an evident attempt to push towards microtransactions. The traditional story modes are present with the Klassic Towers mode, which also in this case allows you to select a more or less long, more or less difficult path, to finally face Kronika and watch the ~animated comic~ style ending for each character.", "date": "2019-04-26", "grade": "8.0"}
