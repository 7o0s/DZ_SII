In this case it was decided to make it a management software, entrusting the work to Frontier Development specialists, who took up part of what was already done with Planet Coaster and re-read it and repackaged it in a Jurassic key. The goal of the player, the manager, is to transform the Isles Muertes into theme parks, using Hammond's DNA research to literally incubate what will be the main attractions: dinosaurs. Free-roaming carnivorous dinosaurs eat guests The parks are all structured in a similar way: on one side there are the fences, inside which you have to put the friendly beasts, and on the other side there are the structures dedicated to managing the park and entertaining the paying public, which include research, shops, hotels, but also small power plants, galleries to allow visitors to admire the dinosaurs and some security buildings which we will discuss later. The creation of dinosaurs is divided into several stages. First you need to get enough DNA of each species to be able to start the incubation, then you can modify the same to create unique species which, for example, can be more aggressive, or less prone to certain diseases and so on. If DNA modifications are to be researched in the laboratory (along with building and unit upgrades), obtaining the actual DNA requires sending expeditions of scientists around the world to hunt for fossils from which to extract it. The latter is a slow operation, but also useful for finding fossils to sell to make money. In Jurassic World Evolution, incubating a dinosaur costs more or less depending on its values and dimensions. For example, incubating a brontosaurus costs much more than incubating a velociraptor, to name two known species. In any case, when creating dinosaurs, various factors must be taken into account, the most important of which is their nourishment: putting a small herbivore together with ferocious carnivores is the right choice to see it mercilessly mauled in a matter of moments. In addition to this, the compatibility of the species must also be taken into consideration, since some just cannot stand each other. It is here that Jurassic World Evolution gives its best, asking the player to learn about and manage dinosaurs to meet their needs. The missions of the main campaign are also built around the nice beasts, made up of various requests that aim to get us to gain the trust of the main departments of the Hammond industries, often also making reckless gestures, such as freeing a dinosaur in the crowd to study the systems security, or sell freshly incubated ones for less than they cost. Herbivores and carnivores don't go well together Despite some absurdities, carrying out the assigned missions is quite pleasant and helps to involve the player in the intrigues of the Hammond industries, at least until one realizes that what should be the substance of any management is unfortunately made with great superficiality. Economic system The economic system is the real weak point of Jurassic World Evolution. Frontier has partly taken over that of Planet Coaster in which there is practically no possibility of passive, with the parks generating income continuously, more or less quickly depending on the quality of the design. In that context however, a similar model is acceptable, because Planet Coaster is thought of more as a simulator of attractions than as a follower of Theme Park, with the player having the goal of creating parks that are above all beautiful, perhaps by adding rides personalized created with the powerful tools made available by the developers. In Jurassic World Evolution this part is completely missing and therefore the weight of an overly simplified economic system, almost like a free-to-play title, makes itself felt. Of course, you have to be careful how you spend in order not to run out of funds and there are some events that can cause heavy liabilities (in any case always recoverable), such as for example the killing of guests by dinosaurs who have escaped from the fences, but in In general, the only real difficulty, if we want to call it that, is choosing what to build first and what after, starting from the assumption that some essential buildings will necessarily have to be built and that, regardless of their positioning, they will in any case produce earnings against management costs that they can hardly get out of hand. The same shops for guests, those who sellfood, drinks and gadgets have been extremely simplified in management. For each activity the player can choose only one product to be sold from three available, balancing the price based on the cost and hiring more or less staff depending on the number of customers. That's all. After all, the Jurassic World Evolution parks do not seem to need other forms of maintenance. For example, the guests are all very polite and do not throw litter on the floor, since we don't need cleaning services (not even toilets, for that matter), while the rangers take care of the maintenance, able to repair any building in less than not to mention with their magic guns, which Doraemon must have provided them. Guests roam the park, but have little interaction with the attractions also because when they do they are usually killed. A gameplay without challenge The only challenging moments in Jurassic World Evolution gameplay are due to the environmental factors and the escapes of the dinosaurs. By environmental factors we mean tropical storms of various types that occasionally hit the park with violence, damaging the structures and forcing guests to lock themselves up in some bunkers built for this purpose. In the first islands they are very rare, but in the advanced ones they become decidedly more frequent, often forcing the player to open the shelters. Dinosaurs, on the other hand, are much more problematic to manage. Each of them reacts differently to the enclosure in which they find themselves and to the companions they are forced to live with. Stress factors (little vegetation, water or food, presence of other unwelcome dinosaur breeds, and so on) decrease the beast's comfort. When a dinosaur is too stressed it can freak out, starting to throw itself against fences, destroying them. If you want you can organize real clashes between dinosaurs As you can imagine, such a creature thrown into a crowd inevitably causes a massacre. Carnivores in particular have a nasty habit of eating guests whose families will inevitably sue us, forcing us to spend fortunes on lawyers. Apart from making dinosaurs happy and lawyers, much more dangerous, where would be the difficulty? In the cumbersome way to contain them. We try to explain ourselves. Retrieving a specimen involves launching a security helicopter, sedating it, then using recovery units to return it to the pen. At the same time you need to repair the fence with the rangers. Everything must be managed manually, i.e. each task must be assigned by clicking with the mouse. Now, when only one dinosaur escapes, bringing it home is no big deal. But if a fence with, let's say, three carnivores inside breaks, the park's safety operations become terribly long and frustrating. The vehicles can be driven in first person, perhaps to cure sick dinosaurs, or to take some photos to sell to publishers If you want you can take direct control of the vehicles and really do everything by hand, but in this way the cumbersomeness increases even more, since you are forced to change view several times. We understand that this path was chosen to try to add some spice to the action, but at this point it wasn't better to make the management part more complex, automating all these operations in order to focus the player's attention on the problems of the park? User interface The user interface is also deficient in terms of management which, like many other aspects of Jurassic World Evolution, has been made minimal so as not to oppress the player too much, however creating some problems in accessing information, which always requires an extra click than necessary to be achieved. We understand that this is very modern and helps camouflage the nature of the game, but sometimes you really feel the need to have more indicators on the screen that point us towards the problems at hand. Not that the statistics are missing, but they are all hidden and must be recalled manually. In the first islands, less attention is paid, but when you start to have more enclosures for dozens of dinosaurs, having some visual indications would not hurt. The game engine does its job This is not an insurmountable defect, also given the staid rhythms of the game, but it is clear that everything has been designed for an audience less than specialized in the genre. One side where Jurassic World Evolution excels is the technical one, which is positioned at the top of the genre with dinosaurs modeled very well and animated just as well and fascinating settings full of details, which do not disfigure even when you look aboard a ranger jeep or a propellertter. Also excellent is the ability to lock the shot on a dinosaur to see it in action directly. The need for a few more buildings is rightly felt, but it is just a detail out of tune in a very positive overall picture, with the fluidity remaining high even in the presence of hundreds of guests. From the point of view of the soundtrack there is little to report: music and effects are taken directly from the film series, while the dubbing of the various characters has been entrusted to professional actors, among which Jeff Goldblum stands out in particular, who gives the voice to Dr. Ian Malcolm, who he actually played in some of the movies. In terms of atmosphere, it is an extra touch that will make fans happy.", "date": "2018-06-18", "grade": "6.0"}
