Before continuing we ask you to use your sense of smell. Open a screenshot and smell (don't roll your eyes and do it). Perceived? Weird to smell organic manure in a snowy toy, isn't it? Don't be surprised, because under the white blanket there is actually a beating heart made up of plowed fields and tractors. What do we want to suggest? Well, on balance Ski Region Simulator is a not too hidden clone of another Giants Software title: Farming Simulator. Now it remains to understand how it is possible that two such different activities as agriculture and the management of a mountain tourist place share the same mechanics. To find out, just examine the underlying logic that regulates them. As in Farming Simulator, also in Ski Region Simulator you control the resort in first person, in the sense that you have to go to the various buildings to buy new infrastructures and check the status of the old ones. There are summary screens, but the substance changes little. The action is framed from the eyes of the manager and all the main activities of the resort must be managed by interacting with them directly (with some limits and shortcuts to cut some dead time). Paradoxically, it is precisely the different activities that represent the greatest weight of the game, but we will come back to it later. Here we just want to underline how everything closely resembles the other Giants title and often one gets the impression that it would be enough to change some textures, and swap the related vehicles, to transform one into the other. A practical example will help us to better understand what we mean. A shameless clone of Farming Simulator with snow instead of plowing fields Combing the snow One of the work activities of the good ski resort manager requires maintaining the ski slopes, combing the snow or spraying it fresh with the special cannons in case of scarce snowfall. If you have played any Farming Simulator, then you clearly remember what you had to do to work a field: drive over it several times with the right vehicle (for ploughing, for sowing, and so on). Well, basically you went back and forth to the field trying to work the entire surface to get the greatest possible harvest, using the best vehicle available for a given activity. In Ski Region Simulator the same is done with ski fields, only that doing it makes much less sense and offers a number of not indifferent criticalities. The first is that the activity itself does not offer specific problems, as happens in reality, the second is the presence of skiers. Why never? Because they walk over us like we're ghosts. Well, is such a detail tolerable in a simulator? That is, why is it possible to maintain the slope while there are active skiers? Of course, if you wish, you can choose to work at night, when no one is skiing, but the point changes little: skiers ride over it, completely breaking the illusion required for a simulator to work. The Ferrari on the dirt road Another major problem of Ski Region Simulator is the introduction to the game. As usual, Giants hasn't bothered too much with newbies and, while they've scattered help messages all over the map, they haven't created an organic introduction to the gameplay. This translates into the fact that only the most convinced players will end up getting involved, also because not knowing what to do involves a large series of complications. For example, it is not clear how to recover the vehicle if you have to return to the starting point, and then end up walking around the resort. Calculate that it takes several minutes to go from one end of the map to the other, so it is not a secondary problem and, especially if you are at the beginning, it is better to start the campaign again than to go hunting for the lost vehicle, often for Always. Of course, walking around allows you to recover the hidden garden gnomes, which are a nice bonus, but in general we would have preferred to manage everything through the classic menus, which offer much less complications and which the average management player does not disdain at all... also because the graphics of Ski Region Simulator are really bad! Now, no one expects such a title to show triple A assets, because it would be absurd, but if you decide to show models of skiers, orof cars with the driver in it, it would be good if I did something better than come up with models that would have been embarrassing even in a game from the late nineties. In short, who would have noticed these shortcomings in a title like this? On the other hand, the scarcity of details in the settings is more marked, with the buildings that seem to rest on the snow, which is also ugly, with their proportions completely wrong and with a poverty of texture details that leads one to wonder a second time why not a menu setting is chosen instead of the first person (let's clarify that Farming Simulator 2013, although very poor graphically, is more convincing from this point of view, which is saying something). Don't roll your eyes, because it is important to underline certain shortcomings, given that one of the strengths of the game is the possibility of driving vehicles rebuilt with painstaking care. In short, the vehicles are beautiful and well simulated, the context in which they move is ugly. Imagine having a Ferrari and being able to drive it only on a stony road and you will understand what we mean.", "date": "2014-03-06", "grade": "5.0"}
