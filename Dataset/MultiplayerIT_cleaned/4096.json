{"name": "La recensione di Guacamelee! 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/recensione-guacamelee-2.html", "text": "Let's start by saying that, for the writer, metroidvanias are perhaps the only 2D genre to have passed the passage of time in an excellent way. After a period of lack of inspiration, in recent years these titles have experienced a new youth, thanks to interesting design choices and also thanks to an inexpensive technical sector, but capable of giving stylistically incredible glimpses. Again for the writer, the first Guacamelee! by Drinkbox is perhaps the apotheosis of this new line of metroidvania, pace of the acclaimed Ori and approached, albeit very laterally, only by that other great masterpiece that responds to the name of Hollow Knight. Five years after the first chapter and after the very interesting but probably only half-successful Severed experiment, the Canadian team is back to talking about luchadores and the mexiverse and does so with a sequel which, although it responds affirmatively to the call for more of the same, adds many small details that raise it even more than the progenitor. Probably those who didn't love the first one for its graphic style and strong combat component won't appreciate this second chapter either. On the contrary, those who lived an exhilarating and sufficiently demanding experience five years ago will find it in Guacamelee! 2, its worthy heir. The history of the Mexican universe Drinkbox has never denied that it loves Mexican folklore linked to luchadores, as well as all the legends of the place. Despite this, the spirit behind Guacamelee! he is clearly light-hearted and goliardic. Narratively, the second chapter begins right where the first ended, indeed, repeating precisely that final battle with Calaca that had put an end to the plan of the tremendous antagonist. He does it with a choice that is always over the top, making the fight ridiculously simple and confirming everything by giving away a trophy with the name ~I remembered it harder~. These first five minutes are enough to understand with what kind of spirit the whole campaign will be tackled in the course of its ten hours (something less if you are confident, potentially much more if the genre is not your thing), all without forgetting the nature of a title that we are sure can give some plot surprises even in its second passage, as did the progenitor. From this moment several years pass and Juan is now a father of a family with a belly and who can hardly jump more than a few centimetres. The world is safe from the threat of Calaca and there is no longer any need for the great luchador who saved the world. As in the most classic of situations, something goes wrong and we discover that another masked fighter, Salvador, is intent on recovering three artifacts useful for opening a passage to Otromundo, a conflagration of all timelines where the great Guacamole Sacra is hidden. Juan is then called to save the Mexiverse again and to do so this time he is also helped by his former enemies. Following a rather linear progression, thanks to the obvious need to acquire skills to continue in some areas, the campaign unfolds between increasingly articulated rooms and encounters with an infinite series of skill statues. At the end of the race it will obviously be possible to continue to collect all the collectibles, as well as start a new adventure in difficult mode. Despite all these details, which enrich the title but which also tend to keep it on a certain level of caution without ever experimenting too much, it is not the gameplay side that is enormously surprising (despite some great gimmicks that we will talk about later), but the ability to grafting into the game a series of paradoxical and ingenious situations, all or almost all linked to optional moments in the various timeline portals. These already recall the names of great classics or different genres and adapt them to the style of Guacamelee! Believe us, we don't want to spoil any of these surprises for you, because they are small digressions lasting a few tens of seconds, but we assure you that you will find yourself on more than one occasion applauding the genius of the Drinkbox guys, the way they are managed to hit some hot topics of the medium in recent years and also how their level of self-irony is at an all-time high. The gameplay, the (almost) perfect one Who knows Gaucamelee! knows that it is the metroidvania that has best known how to mix platforming and combat system. The first title was an almost perfect set of sections of jumps, flights and climbs, all topped off with a large amount of enemies to fight against. This second chapter takes what made the first great and does itperfect, leading him to chain together a variety of skills and attacks like never before. Accomplices of the very articulated and much larger maps than the previous ones, the Canadian boys have made a precise design choice: to give you all (or almost all) the powers of the first Guacamelee within a couple of hours of campaign and immediately put you in the condition of be able to turn most of the maps. This has the double result of not exhausting those who already knew the first chapter perfectly, but probably of slightly confusing the novices, as well as drastically reducing the inaccessible areas and to which it is necessary to return later. It will be up to you to decide whether this element will translate into good or bad for your sensations as a player. We appreciated the willingness to quickly get behind the wheel of a Juan that we remembered well, without forgetting the importance of the progression of a metroidvania. For this reason, a series of new powers have been added, few in reality as regards Juan's human form, and many for his ~chicken~ version, which becomes fundamental in this second chapter, and which, among other great inventions , lives its own completely separate plot and linked to the ~Illuminated Chickens~, a sort of sect in search of the Golden Egg. The mixture between the two forms of Juan has allowed the developers to set up an ecosystem that is understandable but articulated, even if it seemed to us slightly less prohibitive than the first chapter. The game runs fast and we almost never found ourselves in the position of repeating a section more than a handful of times, pace of the bosses, which are probably the only real sore point of this second chapter. They are few and not particularly inspired, as well as being extremely simple to defeat (we always talk about the normal difficulty, the only playable during the first run) culminating in a final battle with Salvador of a disarming banality, even if grafted into a truly evocative. Also noteworthy is the skill tree, very rich with five different ~instructors~ and a myriad of upgrades that can be acquired after meeting certain requirements and paying the right amount of gold coins. Playstation 4 trophies Gaucamelee! 2 puts trophy hunters in front of 37 commendations. Of these, 22 are bronze, 9 silver and 5 gold, obviously including the coveted platinum. Nothing too different from what one would expect from a title of this kind. We have trophies related to progression, those that require you to finish the title 100% and those that push you to the limit on hard mode. So get ready to go hunting, aware that, for some of them, there will be the proverbial seven shirts to sweat. Technically a show One of Guacamelee's great strengths! his technical-stylistic sector has always been exciting. It is clear that when you choose to apply such a particular design, you may run into the possibility of meeting players who do not appreciate a graphic style like this. Despite this, objectively, Guacamelee! it is a feast for the eyes: colorful and full of character, it contains all of Drinkbox's love for Mexican folklore and every single hand-drawn element is a joy to see. Each map has its own character and colors, each city thrives on the possibility of being visited both in the world of the living and in the world of the dead and the models and animations are of such a high quality that they recall a real 2D animated film . Also as regards the sound sector, Guacamelee! 2 doesn't hold back, arranging different melodies for each environment and each situation, seasoned with sound effects in fights and during the use of some skills, of superfine quality. To conclude, we think about a pertinent and fun Italian adaptation in puns, which enriches an already hilarious campaign with some stroke of genius also in the texts.", "date": "2018-08-21", "grade": "9.0"}
