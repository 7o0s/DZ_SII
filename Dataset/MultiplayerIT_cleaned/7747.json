After all, it's no secret that the guys at Level-5 are fans of Shu Takumi's series, and the crossover Professor Layton vs Ace Attorney is clear proof of this. Mystery Room shares little or nothing with the classic adventures of Hershel Layton, instead getting very close to the investigations of Phoenix Wright, which shouldn't surprise too much if you think that only a couple of years ago the project was announced in a completely different guise . The result of several postponements and obvious changes in terms of characters, settings and plot, Mystery Room was initially planned for Nintendo DS, transformed into a Layton spin-off only later and finally transferred to tablets and smartphones. Considering how difficult it is to draw attention to an immense market like the mobile one, the reason behind the choice of using a strong brand like Layton in a completely disconnected product is the only mystery that doesn't need investigators to be revealed. More than a spin-off from Professor Layton, Mystery Room looks like the illegitimate child of Phoenix Wright A confused personality Compared to the version of Mystery Room that was announced in 2009, the most important change of course clearly concerns the protagonist characters. Case after case, the game follows Alfendi Layton, a Scotland Yard inspector who claims to be the son of the better known Hershel and who finds himself mentoring the young and inexperienced Lucy Baker. From a narrative point of view Mystery Room absolutely does not exploit the weight of the franchise it has inherited: Alfendi mentions his father only in passing, but otherwise the story is completely independent from the episodes of the main series. From the second case on, things get more interesting, gradually revealing a hidden personality of Alfendi and justifying the ~brothers~ in the title. Unlike the traditional chapters of Layton, this time the two protagonists have to solve a series of murders and mysterious cases, analyzing evidence and questioning witnesses. Cutting-edge technology allows the duo to recreate a model of the crime scene directly in the Scotland Yard office, a trick that saved the developers from processing the back and forth between one setting and another, as happened for example in Ace Attorney, but which is obviously the cause of less visual variety and a lack of narrative dynamism. Witness statements, profiles of possible suspects, clues and collected evidence are all immediately accessible through a series of multi-screen menus, with the player having to use them to get an idea of who the real culprit may be . It must be said that, although further on there are some exciting cases with a well-formulated mystery behind them, some solutions seemed quite far-fetched to us, perhaps because the crime was too complex or not very credible: the tutorial itself revolves around a play on words in English (Mystery Room is not localized in Italian, mind you) and some clues, to say the least, improbable. Then when it is necessary to analyze the crime scene, things do not improve too much: the large iPad touch screen allows you to navigate comfortably on the scenario, bringing the camera closer or rotating the model in an extremely simple way. Most of the time, however, it is only a question of touching each of the objects already highlighted to collect further clues thanks to which to reassemble the puzzle. When the player feels ready and is convinced that he has solved the case, we move on to the final confrontation with the suspect, a question and answer with shots of evidence and objections that once again seems to draw heavily from the Ace Attorney's court trials . Unfortunately Level-5 has failed in the least to create the same pulsation, sense of unpredictability and involvement typical of the Capcom series, both from an artistic point of view, with subdued music and poor visual composition, and in terms of mechanics, since the verbal confrontation takes place in a completely linear way, with the only exception of the tests to be shown in a few moments required by the game. One never gets the feeling of participating personally in the confrontation or of really pressing the opponent, and even the last case ends with a plot full of unresolved issues that perhaps will be explored in a possible sequel. A huge shame, given that Mystery Room has evolved over the course of development into a project from the goesdecidedly higher production rates, showing off more pleasing and stylistically more consistent artwork with those of Professor Layton's chapters, appreciable even more thanks to the large iPad screen.", "date": "2013-07-09", "grade": "6.8"}
