{"name": "FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/flatout-ultimate-carnage-recensione_a.html", "text": "More than a year after its release on Xbox 360, FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage finally arrives on PC, the platform where the Bug Bear series was born in 2004, immediately enjoying some success in sales and criticism. FlatOut belongs to a separate genre of driving games: not only arcade, but also focused on dirty driving and spectacular accidents. From the first Carmageddon and Destruction Derby, up to the present day with MotorStorm and Burnout. However, the series developed by the Bugbears has always remained in the background compared to its direct competitors, failing to match them in media appeal and objective quality. Will anything change with this new chapter? Let's go see it together. Twisted sheet metal The main mode is the one that takes its name from the game, that is FlatOut, and in essence it is the canonical career, which allows the player to buy vehicles, participate in races and progressively advance in level. The races are divided into three categories called ~Derby~, ~Race~ and ~Classe da Strada~, each characterized by a particular driving style and naturally by ad hoc cars. Each category is made up of several championships and special events, ranging from the classic ~time attack~ to real arenas to the Destruction Derby, where victory is achieved by demolishing the opposing cars. By obtaining victories or placings, you will raise the money necessary to buy new cars or upgrade those already available with a decent list of spare parts. FlatOut mode aside, the player can choose from numerous other options in both single player and multiplayer. To necessarily mention is Carnage which consists of a series of tests, often bizarre, which can vary from dry accidents in the Burnout style to real Deathmatch races always based on the destruction of the opponents. As far as multiplayer is concerned, however, we find the fun Party Mode, full of curious mini-games and single events to be tackled in light-heartedness and without too much effort. But it is of course going online that things get really interesting: Ultimate Carnage can be played by up to 8 people at the same time on official races (with ranking and points) and player races. World leaderboards are also supported. This PC version is part of the Games for Windows series and is ~Live enabled~, which means unlockable achievements just like on Xbox 360. Speed and malice Once driving the cars, you realize the strongly arcade nature of Ultimate Carnage, with fairly simplified controls that forgive the mistakes made by the driver in a very good-natured way. Of course things get complicated with a damaged car, but as long as you can keep the vehicle intact the drive itself will be quite smooth and not particularly demanding. Much attention, in these cases, must be placed on the balance between pure driving and accidents: according to the FlatOut philosophy, neither element must prevail over the other, except in the specific ways. As with the Xbox 360 version, the AI is annoying, and, pardon the pun, too contrived. In order to make the races more exciting, a trick seen in some old arcade arcades is used, which makes the cars that precede and chase us unnaturally faster or slower regardless of the skill of the virtual driver and the quality of the car. . This forces the player to make no mistakes, and to stay focused constantly, but it takes away a lot of realism from the race and, in various circumstances, it is quite irritating. The problem with FlatOut is that, especially in the single player, interest could suddenly drop after a few hours of play, given the non-extreme depth of the mechanics and a certain feeling of repetitiveness that gradually mounts. The multiplayer helps a lot, but fails to make the Bug Bear title a true champion of longevity. Graphics and sound The graphic sector of any chapter of the FlatOut series has always been one of the strengths, with excellent polygonal complexity, effects and choice of palette. Ultimate Carnage is certainly no exception, and shows off features on the screen that have nothing to envy to the most famous direct rivals. The level of detail and interaction of the tracks is perhaps one of the best ever seen, and is especially surprising in the event of accidents, when the polygons and particle effects on the screen reach peaks of excellence. The cars themselves are modeled quite well, and while falling short of the competition's results, they look great. The deformation of the metal sheets, essential in a title of this kind, is rendered excellently, as well as the physics applied to every clash and every possibleobject that we can hit with the car. As for the audio, the sound effects and the noises of the various engines are not exciting, but the rock soundtrack defends itself, counting on several pieces from the alternative scene such as 32 Leaves (Waiting), A Static Lullaby (Hang' em High) and Art of Dying (You Don't Know Me). Comment FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage is an adrenaline-pumping and fun game, which, although it arrives a year late compared to the Xbox 360 version, is not too affected by the past, also thanks to a certain lack of similar titles on the PC scene. Fans of the genre will certainly find a solid and exciting game, which however could get tired sooner than expected precisely because of its structure. A purchase recommended for all fans of the series, but on which the less passionate should reflect for a long time.
