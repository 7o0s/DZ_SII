In the land of the rising sun, the game developed by Cygames was released in mid-2016 and has been available on Steam since mid-October; two expansions (Darkness Evolved and Rise of Bahamut) of cards have already been released and a third is arriving at the end of March. There are several elements that have contributed to the success of this title: it certainly has a good single player campaign mode, divided into chapters of increasing difficulty, which helps familiarize yourself with the seven classes present in the Shadowverse (which we will discuss in more detail at short), then, despite the numerous cards released, the game takes new players by the hand, immediately giving away a very high number of packs and, finally, has a system of objectives and daily missions with rewards useful for the purchase of other packs or for entrances aimed at arena mode. All of this will help keep your hands off your wallet. Yes, because Shadowverse, also released for iOS and Android mobile platforms, is a completely free title with a Hearthstone-like purchase model and the possibility of destroying and building cards and in which you can also buy packs for real money or virtual coins called Rupies However, playing normally, you get a satisfactory number of them for free even without spending a cent, unless you want all the cards immediately and at any cost. The number of cards present in a deck is 40, while in arena mode 30 are used, and the gameplay, beyond the differences between the classes that we will examine later, is very classic, so each card has its own casting cost and can be a creature with power and toughness that respectively identify how much damage it deals and how much it can take, spell with immediate effect and a type of card, amulet or seal, which remains on the field permanently or until certain situations occur . The effect of the card is not written on it but it is possible to click on it at any time to bring up the box in which the operating rules are described and this has the undoubted advantage of leaving much more space for the artwork, one of the highlights of Shadowverse, especially if you are a lover of Japanese designs. The launch cost of a card must be satisfied using orbs (another way of calling mana) which increase as the turns progress and, to win the game, you must bring the opponent to zero life points from the 20 that he has they have at the start. Let's take a deep dive into the original Shadowverse game classes and mechanics. Shadowverse combines the art of Japanese drawing with a card game with very original mechanics Evolutions Before introducing the seven Shadowverse characters, each with a personal style of play that identifies their class, we have to talk about the other unique element, the evolution mechanic: all the followers (the minions have a rather ~social~ name) have an ~evolved~ version and, after 4 rounds from the start of the game, each player will activate two or three evolution indicators (those who start second will receive three and two who start first) which can be used to enhance a creature just summoned or already played in previous turns. When the evolution is activated, if the creature has just been launched it can only attack the other creatures of the opponent, otherwise you can choose any target. This element varies the game strategy substantially since many other cards activate their effect in the presence of evolved minions or when an evolution occurs. As we said, the game's classes are identified by unique characters: it's time to get to know them. Arisa is a singer... um, she is a young archer of the Forestcraft class and the peculiarity of her style of play is the presence of many cards that fill your hand with 1/1 Fairy followers at the cost of 1; these little creatures are used to help you cast much more powerful spells or creatures, in fact, the bonus effect is activated if they are played as the third card in the same turn: visually, the game interface will indicate how many cards have been played, making it even more immediate and simple to use. Erika belongs to the Swordcraft class whose peculiarity is represented by the servants who interact by enhancing themselves or giving themselves advantages rand reciprocal depending on the military rank so, for example, an officer-type follower could obtain advantages if he enters the game and a commander is present. Rowen is a knight of the Dragoncraft class who, a bit like the druid in Hearthstone, tries to increase his orbs quickly with cards that can give you an extra one and this is necessary to reach the Overflow threshold (7 orbs) which allows you to play your most powerful cards. Magic Classes Isabelle is a busty sorceress belonging to the Runecraft class and her unique characteristic is that she activates a skill called Spellboost every time a spell is played (in the game every card with the ~spell~ identifier is considered a spell) and, when we play the next spell, if Spellboost is active we will have an enhanced effect: also in this case (as with practically all the unique characteristics of the characters) the game interface will help us understand when the bonus will be active. Luna is an innocent little girl with a macabre past who has lost her parents and is a devotee of the Shadowcraft class (a sort of small necromancer). This particular school uses spells or minions that can increase the shadow points available and necessary to activate more powerful effects than other cards, provided you have the right number, but be careful because, once used, these shadow points are consumed and must be recharge yourself. Urias is a vampire who belongs to the Bloodcraft class (reminiscent of Castlevania characters), has a game type that becomes more powerful when the Vengeance ability is present but, to activate it, you need to be at 10 life points or less, therefore, many of the cards you play will inflict damage on you to get to the boost condition as soon as possible where you can use really devastating cards. The last of the seven characters is the inevitable priestess, her name is Eris and her school is Havencraft: it is particularly difficult to master, given that her cards are above all amulets that enter the field with ~countdown counters~ on them ~ that decrease their value once per turn, activating when they reach zero; this effect can be of any type, from summoning particularly strong creatures to simply drawing cards or destroying the enemy creature, in any case, Eris has many cards that heal minions or herself. Each of these 7 characters makes use of unique cards that can only be used by them even though there are, of course, neutral cards to be played in all decks and which also include spells (unlike what we saw in Hearthstone in which, among the neutrals, there are servants only). Differences... substantial As happens in Hearthstone, even in Shadowverse each minion can have different abilities but, due to how the game is structured, the implications are very different: the battle cry is called Fanfare but it has the same effect and is activated when a follower enters the battlefield, while Last Words occurs when a minion dies and is the equivalent of the deathrattle. But be careful: in Shadowverse there is the possibility, through specific cards, to banish (banish) a minion who will disappear from the arena instead of dying, making the Last Word ability useless. A follower with the Bane ability can kill any opposing minion to which he deals damage and the Storm ability allows a newly summoned creature to attack immediately, moreover, remaining on the effects common to the Blizzard title, the Ward ability corresponds to creatures with protection and, therefore, must be killed before attacking the opponent; finally, some minions activate a certain effect at the end of each turn as long as they remain on the field. So all the same? Absolutely not, here's what makes Shadowverse unique: first of all, we have already pointed out the difference due to the possibility of banning some cards, then, the unique characteristic of each character affects, in our opinion, more significantly than the hero power of the Hearthstone classes , but the part of the gameplay where Shadowverse is very different is the Evolved mechanic explained in the previous paragraph. Finally, we underline that the random component, which causes so much discussion in Hearthstone, has a much lesser impact in the Cygames title, limited to some situations that do not change the outcome of the game as often as happens in the Blizzard title. Making a criticism of this game we could say that, although there are many cards for each class that remove the minions on the field, there are some that seem really exaggerated and, sometimes, so powerful that the starting 20 life points seem few, for who happen to lose the game if u is not in handa prompt reply; in consideration of this, perhaps 30 starting life would have been better. In addition to the story mode, Shadowverse includes several game modes: it is possible to challenge the artificial intelligence at different levels of difficulty, duel with a random opponent in friendly or in ranked mode, moreover, there is an arena similar to Hearthstone but in which two cards are chosen at a time instead of one and 5 games are played regardless of wins and losses with a prize commensurate with the number of games won. Japanese art and colors The illustrations of the cards and of the main characters are really very beautiful and you will appreciate them in particular also for the fact that each minion has a further drawing for its ~evolved~ version which makes everything more spectacular in the way in which, during a game, transforms from the basic version to the enhanced one. Even the creation of the game interface is simple and clear, despite the fact that the explanation of the cards appears in a separate box instead of on the card itself; it is also very easy to build the deck with many filters available. It is evident that the interface has been designed for mobile devices, it remains very functional even when used with the mouse, but the sour note of this high-level graphic sector is the lack of clarity of the colors of the edges of the cards which identify their rarity, so you won't always be able to understand it, however, if you have any doubts, we advise you to check how many ~vials~ the destruction of a card would give you to immediately know its rarity. The musical themes are quite varied and suitable for the game arenas, some are epic, others more macabre but seem well done; even the melody present in the game selection menu is pleasant even if after a while it becomes repetitive: perhaps they should have chosen at least a couple of themes since a good part of the time is spent building decks. For now, the game is in Japanese and English, but the complete localization in Italian is expected by June 2017 and the total number of cards between the base and the two expansions is over three hundred.", "date": "2017-03-15", "grade": "8.0"}
