The protagonist is a rookie of the Orbital Drop Shock Troopers corps who, separated from the team, finds himself wandering around a dark New Mombasa devastated by the alien onslaught. Given to the first buyers of Halo: The Master Chief Collection as amends for the numerous problems of the online package, Halo 3: ODST had its share of troubles at the launch but not having to bend to the online one, given the clean cut of the mode Firefight, doesn't seem to have any other problems. 343 Industries probably went overboard by wanting to bring four different titles, all with their own specific online support, to Xbox One. With the arrival of a large number of players, major problems erupted and it took several weeks for the situation to be considered acceptable. But the Master Chief Collection package remains, even only from the point of view of the single player, something absolutely massive and it is even more so with the addition of a particular piece that does not include Master Chief but which has a great value and is to completely change the tone from the classic Halo. We can define ODST almost as a noir even if there are no particular detective-type mechanics. It is a classic-style shooter but the gloomy atmosphere full of dark corners leads us through silent exploration phases interspersed with mysteries, diaries and moments of flat calm that are abruptly interrupted by exploding in sudden fights. All elements that give a completely different flavor to an experience that not all Halo fans have enjoyed but that many have enjoyed viscerally. The noir charm of Halo 3: ODST comes to Xbox One in high resolution at sixty frames per second Xbox One goals In addition to the classic points for completing missions and the campaign on maximum difficulty, Halo 3: ODST brings with it an incredible amount of small objectives related to finding the secrets and thirty audio diaries scattered throughout New Mombasa. Exploration and advancement, in essence, are the two key elements to bring home the bulk of the points even if there are several objectives related to skill such as multiple killings with different weapons or the completion of at least one level at the two most difficult elevated by respecting a series of conditions ranging from giving up the use of the VISR to not dying. Up and down New Mombasa The ODST missions appear in the Halo 3 campaign playlist. No Firefight but, however well done, the classic horde mode is certainly not essential. Instead, there is the coop which, while not particularly adapting to the narrative dimension of this particular Halo, is perfectly suited to the game mechanics. In ODST the ~open map~ dimension typical of Halo is even more marked with the patrols of enemies who move even for long stretches in a map that gradually expands and which we have to cross several times even passing through a series of complex flashbacks. These retrospective missions start when we find particular objects that allow us to reconstruct the movements of teammates by impersonating them one by one in specific missions that vary significantly both in setting and in setting. If for most of the title the protagonist moves on foot crossing a dark city silently, the flashbacks often offer us different situations which include light vehicles, companions controlled by artificial intelligence, a session aboard the banshee, the inevitable ride aboard of a tank, a siege and the classic open zone filled with vehicles that enhances the versatility of the series' artificial intelligence. In essence, there is no shortage of variety and the possibility of using companions, all differentiated by ability and character, also increases the narrative depth. A depth that also passes through the audio diaries, long and full of action, which are important to give depth to the title. The effects of the New Mombasa disaster surround us and the testimonies of those who lived it make our dramatic adventure in the role of the newbie even more engaging. The differences also involve the gameplay even if at the root the formula is that of Halo 3. The Orbital Drop Shock Troopers do not have a movement radar and cannot wield two weapons but can carry three grenades per type and have a silenced machine gun with 2X scope, a semi-auto pistol with 4X scope and a special sight. The jump has a generous reach even without lSpartan armor but the shield is less powerful and this means that the health bar, visible in this case, must be constantly monitored and recharged through medipacks and regeneration stations. Furthermore, the player cannot use the special devices of Halo 3 even if these are present in the game and are often turned against us by opponents who preside over the squares and almost never charge with their heads down, resulting in decidedly dangerous. If in normal mode it takes about eight hours to complete it, on heroic and legendary difficulty things get decidedly more difficult also given the large quantity of heavy weapons and explosives that characterize the arsenal of the brutes. And if this is not enough for you, it is possible to further increase chaos and difficulty by resorting to the skulls which can all be activated immediately. To face the challenge we have stealth mechanics available that integrate perfectly with enemy patrols and a city setting full of tunnels that allows us to get around the enemies. In addition, the arsenal includes an essential tool called VISR. It is a powerful technology that provides the player with a decidedly advanced interactive map and an augmented reality interface that allows you to visually identify enemies and allies as well as trace the outline of all objects. But it is not possible to exploit it constantly. When the light is too much, the light intensification produces a blinding effect and the object highlight system makes it very difficult to see an enemy hidden by the grass despite the solid graphics that can still have their say with the necessary precautions. The 1080p pushed to 60 frames per second enhances the cleanliness of the original by giving us glimpses of New Mombasa that are decidedly suggestive and embellished by the peculiar effect of our viewer. Unfortunately, the increase in resolution also highlights the low polygonal amount of the title which is fortunately balanced by good quality textures. Some, to tell the truth, do not enjoy the same quality as the others but the dark and suggestive lighting does not allow us to linger on the detail while we are also distracted by the memorable soundtrack that starts from the foundations of the series to be tinged with jazz and further enhance the noir atmosphere. The Italian dubbing that accompanies it is not up to the English one but despite presenting some not too apt voices, overall it is well made. Firefight mode is missing, but Halo 3: ODST is free, via code sent via email from Microsoft, for those who bought and played Halo: The Master Chief Collection between launch and December 19, while it's a cheap purchase for those who don't have entitled to the free code and can still purchase it for  4.99 from the Xbox store. For those who have not bought the Master Chief Collection but would like ODST, there is still hope that the stand alone version will arrive in the coming months even if nothing is certain yet. So what is ODST? On the one hand there is an investigative component interspersed with rather difficult fights and on the other a set of situations that together recall the classic Halo experience. These are the two souls of ODST that give life to a unique title both compared to the others in the series and in absolute terms. Not everyone loved the exploratory component of this experiment, far too slow in the final stages of the game and decidedly far from the classic dynamics of the saga, but those who were captured by the atmosphere literally fell in love with a title that was born almost by mistake. This is why we can only recommend its purchase unless you are among the lucky ones who bought Halo: The Master Chief Collection in time and therefore have the opportunity to download it as a free expansion.", "date": "2015-06-08", "grade": null}
