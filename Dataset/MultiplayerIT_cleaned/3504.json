{"name": "Gears 5", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gears-5-recensione-pc.html", "text": "The review of Gears 5 for PC comes a few days after the article dedicated to the Xbox One version, so that we can tell you not only how the new episode of the series developed by The Coalition behaves on the most powerful Microsoft platform, but also how it works online multiplayer with open servers, although for the moment reserved only for users who own the Ultimate Edition of the game or a subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. Let's take a step back, however, back to the big picture. After a rather conservative fourth chapter, made without daring too much in order to take measures for the franchise, Rod Fergusson and his collaborators have finally introduced some important innovations in Gears 5, both from the point of view of the campaign and from the online sector. The first, divided into four acts, sees a real passage of the baton from JD to Kait in the lead role, bewitching us with a traditional introductory phase in terms of mechanics and structure but damn beautiful to look at and capable of proposing a much more mature narrative and profound compared to the past, in particular as regards the characterization of the characters. The second and third acts are the freshest and most original ones, since they adopt an open world approach with a freely explorable map, providing us with a vehicle (the Skiff, a sort of sailing sled) useful for covering long distances from a point of interest to the other and inserting for the first time a set of secondary missions that add to the main ones, increasing the duration of the experience. The novelties do not stop at the level design, however, extending to a new aesthetic, which passes from the cold shades of the snowy lands to the bright red of the expanses of sand, in a work of chromatic enhancement that clearly cuts ties with the ocher shades of the original trilogy. The fourth and final act returns to the classic tracks for a dramatic and never so spectacular final confrontation, which for a particular event also opens up to replayability and therefore allows you to enjoy a second run, perhaps in online cooperative (or locally via split-screen) , raising the level of difficulty for an even more consistent challenge. In short, we are talking about an extraordinary campaign, which on PC can count on an even more intense atmosphere thanks to the incredible detail that can be obtained on high-end configurations, as we will see shortly. The multiplayer The multiplayer sessions organized by the developers before the release of Gears 5 obviously did not provide us with a real picture of the situation with open servers, and so on the occasion of this second review we were able to better try the online sector. After a first day with a few too many uncertainties, especially in accessing matches via lobby selection, things started to mesh and in any case we never encountered problems related to excessive latency, a sign that the infrastructure is working properly . We will see how the global release on September 10th will be handled, because it is clear that with the various Xbox Game Pass subscriptions the servers will literally be stormed by millions of people. The cross-play of the game extends to all areas: this means not only that it is possible to start the campaign on the console and continue it on the PC thanks to the loading of the saves on the cloud, but also that it is possible to play online without distinction of platform, entrusting to matchmaking the division between users who hold a controller and those who instead use a mouse and keyboard, who clearly have an advantage in terms of precision and speed of pointing. This distinction proves to be fundamental in terms of match balancing, and in fact we have not found any anomalies that were not simply due to the quality of the connection, always visible to each user from the recap screen. That said, Gears 5's multiplayer, just like the campaign, is a rich mix of traditional and new modes. By selecting the Versus item from the main menu it is possible to access the brand new Arcade Mode, an alternative version of the Team Deathmatch in which the points of the kills count and each character can pursue growth within the game, using the credits earned by unlocking weapons different. A few examples: Kait can access the Boltok pistol, incendiary grenades and Torque bow, Keegan can get the Buzzkill, Mulcher or RL-4 Salvo, Mac can call up shock grenades, a Lancer GL or a Boomshot, and so on Street. Have you heard any new names? The ten selectable characters include not only the heroes of the campaign (the aforementioned Kait, JD, Del, Fahz and Marcus Fenix), but also two Spartan soldiers from Halo (EMILE-A239 and KAT-B320) and the three protagonists of the new Escape mode, namely Jeremiah Keegan, Lahni Kaliso and Leslie ~Mac~ MacAllister. These are joined by Sarah Connor and the Terminator T-800 (on the front of the Swarm) from the film Terminator: Dark Fate for the Ultimate Edition. What is Escape Mode all about? It is a challenge against time to be faced in cooperative for three participants, in which you find yourself in the middle of a beehive and you have to escape before a poisonous chemical agent spreads completely, making your way through the Locusts using the few weapons and ammunition available along the way. The Escape mode currently boasts three maps, but many more will come thanks to the Map Builder, the new object editor that allows you to create settings from scratch and place the enemies and resources you want inside them, then sharing everything with the community . The really interesting thing is that the same feature will be extended to Horde and Versus modes in the coming months: we will see some good ones, literally. But let's go back to Versus, which beyond the aforementioned Arcade mode offers a list of decidedly well-tested options: Arms Race, in which the teams' weapons are changed every three kills; Dodgeball, an exciting challenge made up of continuous reversals in the face, since each elimination brings one of our companions back to life; Escalation, the territorial mode with the rings to conquer and defend during the match; Execution, where the only way to kill enemies is to perform a finisher; Guardian, revisiting an old mode in which you have to eliminate the leader of the opposing team in order to take out his teammates; King of the Hill, another very well-known territorial mode, in which you have to conquer and control a ring that moves around the map; and finally Team Deathmatch and War Zone, which absolutely need no introduction. The twelve locations currently available offer a great variety of scenarios and situations, with some new features (the possibility of descending from a high wall, for example) and a truly successful design, which often takes the fight outdoors (see Claimed ), in the charm of an urban glimpse (District) or in an area crossed by a fast and deadly train (Madhouse). Finally we have the Horde, which with its fifty waves still represents a cooperative experience of great depth, ideal to play with friends for the necessary team organization. The maps are the same as Versus, the characters are eight (plus possibly Sarah Connor) and each have unique characteristics: Kait is a Scout and her Ultimate ability is Camouflage, therefore she can approach enemies without being seen; Del is an engineer and can therefore access advanced defense and attack constructions, with an Ultimate that calls a team of support robots; JD belongs to the Attack class and his Ultimate drops fire from the sky with targeted bombing. Then we have Marcus Fenix, a Tank: his Ultimate allows him to automatically shoot enemies at the head; Fahz is also an Attack class and his Ultimate is X-Rays, with which to identify opponents even through walls; the two Spartans EMILE-A239 and KAT-B320 are Attack and Engineer respectively, and their Ultimates consist of an energy shield and a hologram; and finally we have the Jack drone, a Support unit that flies over the battlefield in a completely new role, with great strategic value: his Ultimate allows him to momentarily control an enemy. The difficulty levels available for the Horde range from Beginner to Master and imply a progressive increase in the health and power of the enemies, which are really many and really bad. The first waves are naturally a bit boring, but the action quickly becomes frenetic and the challenge gradually becomes more consistent, taking on the contours of something truly inconceivable in the final stages. The technical realization on PC Gears 5 is a visually stunning game when running it on PC at 4K in HDR and with all the settings maxed out: seeing it in motion first on Xbox One S and then on Windows 10 is a very striking experience for the profound difference which is perceived not only in terms of frame rate, which is exactly double compared to the basic console from Microsoft (and if you want you can go up to 120 fps), but also and above all for the amount of details and the quality of the effects that it is possible to appreciate. We are also talking about a decidedly scalable title, which due to the setting of thethe resolution adopts a very interesting solution: the output is left identical to that of the screen, but the real value can be decreased (which is then upscaled) without having to submit to the constraints of the official resolutions, so as to be able to squeeze the most out of one's configuration and obtain the best possible compromise between definition and performance. In this regard, even on PC there is a function that activates the dynamic resolution and that works very well: by setting the value of the reference frames, the game will automatically modify the pixel count to keep the fluidity constant in any situation, even the busier and busier. You can understand what actually happens by changing the settings and launching the benchmark from time to time: on our configuration, with an outdated Intel Core i5 6600K, an NVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti and all the settings on Ultra (including the texture pack optional), Gears 5 runs at an average of 42 frames per second at 2160p, 73 frames per second at 1440p and 98 fps at 1080p. This means that by activating the dynamic resolution to keep the 60 fps stable, it moves, depending on the case, between 2160p and 1800p - an excellent result, considering the extraordinary quality of the graphics. As also highlighted in the technical analysis of Digital Foundry, the guys from The Coalition have in fact pushed the Unreal Engine 4 towards new heights, substantially improving the polygonal models of the characters and the scenarios, implementing very sophisticated effects (see the ray-traced-style shadows) and an unprecedented degree of interaction with the settings. The end result is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful titles to see of this generation.", "date": "2019-09-07", "grade": "9.2"}
