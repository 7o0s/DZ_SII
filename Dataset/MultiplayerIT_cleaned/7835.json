{"name": "Scappo dalla citt", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/118689-vector-scappo-dalla-citta.html", "text": "Created by the Russian developers of Nekki, authors of numerous browser games over the years, Vector is undoubtedly one of those titles that at first glance feel like they have ~already seen~: the images depicting the silhouette of a guy running and jumping from a building to another In fact, they can only bring to mind a modern classic like Canabalt, an authentic forerunner of a genre now well known to the mobile public such as that of endless runners. If we go beyond mere appearances, however, Vector proves to be able to show off qualities and personalities capable of immediately removing the unpleasant clone label from him: let's go, therefore, to see what it is. Parkour my love Set in a dystopian future where men are forced to work like automatons in tiny cubicles, Vector puts the user in the shoes of one of these anonymous employees, who decides to rebel against the system and flees his office chased by the guards. It will therefore be the player's task to accompany the protagonist in his parkour-style run at breakneck speed, using an extremely simple and intuitive control system: the character runs autonomously, but you have to swipe your finger up, down or right on the screen respectively to jump , slip or snap. The timing in these basic movements is essential to ensure that your escape is as smooth and fast as possible, avoiding the various obstacles without stumbling and thus losing precious seconds. The game is developed through three distinct settings, each divided into over 30 levels: this element is already enough to make the Nekki title stand out from the increasingly crowded segment of endless runners, given that each stage has a very specific beginning, end and objectives. As expected, the main goal translates into getting to the end of the round scenario without getting caught by the guard on your heels, but very few games are enough to understand that in Vector you can't get away so easily. At the end of the level, in fact, you receive a rating from one to three stars based on the coins collected and the number of special stunts performed, represented by symbols on the screen and which can be activated by swiping your finger upwards at the exact moment in which the character walks over it. The stars are essential to make the advanced levels available, while the coins are used to unlock the evolutions mentioned above, triggering a sort of pleasant vicious circle that pushes the user to retrace his steps to aim for the maximum evaluation in those schemes in the which previously did not have all the moves available. The only possible shortcut in this sense is to rely on in-app purchases, which allow you to increase your hoard of coins by spending real money: however, the stars are not for sale, and scrape together the necessary number to have access to all levels that make up the package is a significant challenge that exponentially increases the longevity of Vector (really remarkable for the negligible price at which it is offered), with the risk, however, of dragging a bit of frustration along with it. The difficulty curve of the Nekki title is in fact rather steep, with stages that immediately become complex and require numerous attempts and considerable reflexes to be completed, an aspect that will certainly appeal to the most savvy users but which could send rampage those who prefer more relaxed gameplay. On the other hand, it is unlikely that Vector could arouse conflicting opinions as regards its visual aspect, really refined and fascinating, with vivid backdrops on which the completely black silhouettes of the protagonist and his pursuer move, both featuring very varied and distinctly fluid and realistic. In addition to being an appreciable stylistic choice, then, the fact that the objects in the foreground are not colored helps the user understand at a glance which obstacles are actually to be avoided and which elements are simply part of the scenario. It looks like the usual endless runner, but it's an original and tough platformer", "date": "2013-05-17", "grade": "8.4"}
