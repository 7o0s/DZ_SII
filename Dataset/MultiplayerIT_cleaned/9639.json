Who in the arcade, who in the tourist villages, everyone will have seen at least once that big cabinet with tacky colored lightguns, more often than not seized by some player who has had the patience, and the large enough coin purse, such as to memorize the position of each enemy. For those who have lived under a rock, or are so young that they have never seen an arcade in their life, Namco Bandai has well thought of filling this gap by proposing a collection of some portings on PlayStation 3, revised to make the most of the quality of the Move. From the Time Crisis: Razing Storm home screen you can in fact access the arcade version of Time Crisis 4, the porting of Deadstorm Pirates and the more recent Razing Storm. However, and this is also a big news for coin-up veterans, the original Razing Storm on rails has been joined by a brand new mode, which allows the player to move freely in the scenario as in the most classic FPS. But let's not rush, and let's proceed in order. Playstation 3 trophies The unlockable trophies in Time Crisis: Razing Storm are about forty. Although many simply require you to progress through the levels or eliminate a certain number of enemies, it is interesting how they have been distributed across the various titles in the collection, prompting the player to spend more time on each of them. Controls in crisis By starting Time Crisis 4 it is possible to replay the old rail shooter exactly as it is in its arcade version. The years he carries on his back are not felt that much on the graphic quality, while the feeling, even playing with the Move, has remained roughly identical. As long as you don't run out of ammo, the player can switch from one weapon to another at any time, using the shotgun rather than the machine gun: in certain cases one is more useful than the other, which should push not to waste bullets and save them for more critical situations. It should, shall we say, because the amount of lives available to the player is practically unlimited. Of course, the score is reset to zero each time, but there is no longer that anxiety that a bullet could cost the last token of the day, and so we find ourselves shooting peacefully right and left without too much fear. Once again, the mechanics are based on the continuous passage between cover and firefight: by taking cover it is in fact possible not only to avoid enemy fire, but also to reload the weapon. Unfortunately, however, using the X button on the Move is not very intuitive and not satisfying, especially when compared to the platform of the original hall version. The same problems listed above also afflict the arcade mode of Time Crisis: Razing Storm which, despite being technically better and with a considerable amount of destructible objects in the various scenarios, pad in hand can give very little satisfaction. Let me be clear, the Move does its duty very well and it is possible to target a distant enemy precisely and immediately, but the automatic fire and the infinite number of attempts available completely cancel out the challenge rate. Deadstorm Pirates, despite being another shooter on tracks, differs instead from the various Time Crisis both in terms of setting and game mechanics: no more terrorists and gigantic robots, but haunted galleons, ghost skeletons and dark mines. The player is no longer asked to repair or reload the weapon, which makes the game even simpler and more immediate, but in this case the Move is used in a much more original way. Sometimes it will be necessary to drive a boat, sometimes to direct cannons, while a clash with a Kraken inside a gigantic whirlpool reaches peaks of epicness rarely touched by any Time Crisis. After all, despite the total lack of bite, the three rail shooters manage to entertain themselves from time to time and let themselves be played, even if for a scarce couple of hours. However, the newcomer takes care of completely ruining the party: Razing Storm's FPS mode is in fact the worst business card that Move could ever wish for. The player has the ability to move with the analog stick and fire aiming directly at the screen, a setting that Wii users have now thoroughly digested. And yet, the impression is that Namco Bandai hasn't bothered to observe the steps forward that, from the questionable Red Steel to the sublime Metroid Prime 3, have been made on the Nintendo console. The control system in Time Crisis: Razing Storm is in fact very bad, and it is of little use to change the sensitivity of the Move in the options. To move the camera you have tobring the crosshair to the edge of the screen, which makes it even slower and less intuitive to aim at opponents; any action, from reloading or changing a weapon to throwing a grenade, is entrusted to keys to be reached with the thumb, while to cover yourself in certain points you have to quickly move the controller upwards. And it doesn't always work. Everything seems out of place or sketchy, both in the control system and in the care of the settings, anonymous and all too similar to each other. It closes in style, so to speak, the bad AI of the enemies: sometimes they stare at you with a stupid look for a few seconds, probably fascinated by your good looks, others run screaming and with arms wide open, impatient to receive a bullet straight in the forehead. Except for a few very rare exceptions there are no moments over the top but, at least, the presence of a checkpoint every two steps saves you the trouble of repeating the same point twice. The online mode puts a patch, at least in part, on the stupidity of the opponents, although the game options are scarce and decidedly traditional.", "date": "2010-11-18", "grade": "5.8"}
