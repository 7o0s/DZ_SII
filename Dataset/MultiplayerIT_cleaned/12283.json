In Pinball FX three tables are digitally recreated in all their polygonal splendor: the realization is excellent and the detail is very high, so as to make them very likely to their hypothetical real counterparts. The music that accompanies us is in a very rhythmic techno-pop style and only has the function of recreating a more or less lively background to the game frame. The effects are convincing, especially that of the ball, its collisions and collisions, all very realistic and well sampled. The side buttons that are usually found on the right and left of the table are the only two buttons that are used to play, once the ball has started. On Xbox 360 the throwing of the ball is simulated by simply pressing the A button, while the analog triggers have the function of activating the pinball levers. To get the most points it is necessary to try to insert the spheres in inaccessible points of the table, by making them go up the ramps or by ringing a series of combos. Very often it is unclear which combinations lead to obtaining more substantial points and bonuses, as it is difficult to read the writings above the playing surface, due to the slightly too distant views and the frenzy of the action when they are more close together. The consequence is that we have to learn for ourselves what gives points and what doesn't. The first games are therefore of study, trials and frustrations, because it is not quick and easy to achieve decent results. With a bit of luck and stubbornness, however, it doesn't take long before you understand the mechanics of the table in question and start playing for real. At this at the sea I was very strong! The physics of the ball, which is very important, is well reproduced, even if it seems to be slightly too fast and schizophrenic in some situations. However, the sensitivity of the two levers of the pinball machine is far too marked, and does not benefit from the analogical pressure of the two triggers, making it impossible to do some tricks used by veterans such as the ~passage~ between one lever and another, or the soft strokes of support and precision. There are only three schemes for now, of which only one is truly inspired: it is hoped that in the near future something downloadable on the marketplace will be added to fill this gap. Like any good Xbox Live game! Self-respecting arcade, this Pinball FX also includes a valid online mode between multiple players, and with the help of the webcam! Up to 4 people can participate in a fight, each of which will be filmed and projected in transparency at the top of the screen, so that during the game it will be possible to see all the friends we are challenging at that precise moment. Everyone has control of his table, while at the top there is a colored bar (with the same shade as the camera box) which indicates the status of the score and how much is left to reach the set goal: obviously, the first one who fills the table indicator, he won! Goals 360 The 200 points of Pinball FX are very difficult to complete in their entirety. Many of these will be unlocked completely randomly, as they are linked to particular game combinations that are difficult to perform, while other objectives will be achieved by breaking score records or with online victories in ranked matches. After the first three or four unlocked almost immediately, there will be a bit of sweat. Comment Pinball FX will delight all those nostalgic who for one reason or another haven't tried this fabulous Bar game for years and years. By purchasing it on Xbox Live! Arcade we take home three complete tables and infinite tokens: a greater number would certainly not have hurt. Too bad for the too bizarre levers and the action often a bit confused. The greatest difficulty of Pinball is being able to understand how to score points, what are the best combos and why certain actions have certain reactions: to master your table with dignity you will need considerable experience. Pros: Excellent reproduction of the tables Multiplayer in 4 and camera We miss the 80s Cons: Few pinball machines Poorly calibrated sticks Often confused During the long summer holidays of our adolescence, in the now distant and mythical 80s, pinball was considered almost a national sport, usually played in the beach bar, barefoot and full of sand, and reigned unchallenged as King of the arcades of the era. The arcades of those times wereor well stocked with these magical tables and still represented one of the major meeting places for many kids, imbued as they were with passion, challenges, bizarre characters and an infinite swarm of tokens; everyone shared a passion for pinball, raise your hand who has never remained glued to those cabinets of metal spheres, colored lights and amusement park sounds at least once. Like a wonderful time machine, Xbox Live! Arcade offers us the opportunity to play it again, alone or with other friends, giving us (so to speak) 800 Microsoft Points infinite credits and a great desire to bring out the old paninaro in us, thanks to Pinball FX!", "date": "2007-05-14", "grade": null}
