{"name": "The Nations: il ritorno dei Coloni extraterrestri", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-nations-il-ritorno-dei-coloni-extraterrestri.html", "text": "Monsters, insects and scantily clad Amazons The three races featured in The Nations are decidedly original, or at least unusual. We are talking about the Pimmons, revolting blue creatures evidently overweight, which boast a simply horrifying little face, with large black eyes recessed into the skull and pronounced toothed jaws. Then we have the Sajikis, a colony of large, clumsy bipedal insects (my favourites), and the elite dynasty of glamorous Amazons, famous for their habit of staying in their bikinis from morning till night. Playing the campaigns it is not possible not to identify the many small details that differentiate the three races: for example the Sajikis society is dominated by male individuals, the only ones who can be educated in schools, and who will rebel if they remain too long without home or without food. On the contrary, among the Amazons the situation is reversed and it is precisely the scantily dressed warrior-women who take care of the hardest jobs (building houses for example), while the very muscular men are reduced to effeminate parodies of themselves, engaged in their fuchsia bathing suits collect fruit with lots of baskets! These are above all aesthetic differences, but it is precisely this search for details that embellishes the title. For example, every time a couple of inhabitants get married, they will give birth to a beautiful baby who will begin to wander around the village, growing over time. Once he reaches the right age, we will be able to teach him a trade, and whether it is a vain blond girl, a hideous blue gouge or a colorful hopping cockroach, we will be able to see him trotting towards the nearest school with a backpack on his shoulder! Except to see him come home at the stroke of 17.45, when night will fall and each of our subjects will go to sleep. As I said therefore, the attention to detail is almost maniacal, thanks to the excellent graphics, able to even offer a very useful zoom function, while keeping the quality of the graphics intact, indeed enhancing the minute details. Gods of a handful of little monsters More than a simple ruler, we will effectively impersonate the divinity of these little creatures, and once we have built a temple and educated priests, we will even be able to make them perform miracles, assuming we have accumulated enough faith-points. The unit management system is really excellent, and recalls that of Dungeon Keeper: you cannot order a single character to perform a certain action, while it is possible to give directives and priorities (the artificial intelligence will take care of the rest). For example, if you want to build a house, you will have to click on the appropriate icon and decide the final position of the building. One of the dedicated units will arrive as soon as possible and construction will begin. If there is not enough wood or stone to build the house, the same unit will wait for another unit, used for the collection of resources, to procure sufficient raw material, perhaps going exploring to look for it. Within this process the player can intervene through special indicators, intensifying the collection of this or that material according to the needs of the moment. Combat is also almost automated, so our main concern will be to have the most strategically useful buildings built, and to make sure that there are enough homes for our subjects, so that they can marry and in turn generate new subjects to educate such as workers, soldiers, priests etc. If for some reason one or more of them should be annoyed or disappointed (because they don't have a home, a place to work or they are hungry) we will notice it thanks to an eloquent icon placed on their head, or by consulting their personal profile. Should their disappointment in us last too long, they won't hesitate to pack up and leave us in the lurch, abandoning the village with their family. In the most desperate cases they could even turn into terrorists, with the consequences you can imagine. Despite the important aesthetic differences, the three races are quite similar in terms of gameplay: each unit has its own equivalent in the other factions, although of course there are races more inclined to scientific research, rather than military life, than others. However, the approach to the game remains the same, but this does not necessarily represent a defect, at least because it makes the games very balanced, especially in multiplayer. Perhaps a little more variety in the matches would have been desirable, but dhours will have to pass before the game gets boring. The verdict Ultimately, The Nations is an intelligent mix of strategic and managerial elements, which with a few nods to its illustrious predecessors, manages to take home a positive vote. Of course, if you are looking for something new you will not be satisfied with such a proven gameplay, but if you are less exasperated players and are just looking for a good, rewarding and fun product, don't miss taking a look at The Nations: you may have found the ideal title to pass the time in the hot summer city, since to play it you will only have to get your brain cells moving. Who notoriously do not sweat. We are ugly, bad and we will conquer the world! We all know The Settlers, the excellent (and endless) series of strategic-management games, featuring the short and chubby little men of Blue Byte. Well, the JoWooD Studios in Vienna enjoyed some success with the sale of Alien Nation, a game clearly inspired by the little Settlers, proposing the winning formula based on highly detailed 2D graphics, lots of game options, buildings to build and parameters to control . All accompanied by three races, as bizarre as they are different from each other. Well we are now faced with the sequel to Alien Nation, entitled, with a surprising leap of creativity, The Nations.", "date": "2001-08-22", "grade": null}
