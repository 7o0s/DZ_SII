{"name": "Sniper Elite", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/recensione-sniper-elite.html", "text": "The world in a viewfinder The sniper, in the history of the video game, has always played an important role, riding the scenes of first person shooters indomitable and finding himself the protagonist of coin ops and spy titles of all kinds; Sniper Elite tries to take this genre a step further by presenting itself as a classic third-person action game but able to place a strong emphasis on the use of the sniper rifle. To understand what I mean, just turn on the console, which you can do in the next few days, and load the first single player map to find yourself catapulted into the Second World War in the direction of Berlin. In a few moments of the game it immediately becomes clear that advancing with guns blazing is not a wise choice and that the only weapon capable of saving us is our ability to hit distant objectives in the shortest possible time. By placing this priority, Rebellion has created a title that, while maintaining the concept of a solitary hero, manages to give a greater note of realism to the game actions. in the role of an American soldier, disguised as a German, engaged in crossing a territory controlled by Soviet troops The world in a viewfinder To complete the picture we find light weapons imprecise on the distance, profusion of ravines that open onto the streets of cities devastated by war, patrolling tanks and enemies able to identify and eliminate us with a certain ease. We are therefore forced to crawl through the mud to win our solitary war, so solitary that we put ourselves in the shoes of an American soldier, disguised as a German, busy crossing a territory controlled by Soviet troops. The hard life of the sniper The missions, although oriented towards the search for secret information, are varied and articulated and, despite the ~sniper~ nature of the game, they do not prevent us from placing explosives, recovering prisoners, covering our occasional companions or freeing buildings with grenades. However, advancing along the 28 missions that make up the game and especially when the first opposing snipers appear, the importance of using your rifle carefully, powerful binoculars and finding advantageous positions within each map gradually grows. The ~sniper~ component grows in such a way as to require a patient and meticulous approach with the knowledge that forgetting even a single enemy can coincide with our departure. Furthermore, it is not uncommon that in certain cases it is good to kill an opponent when his companions are distracted or to remove his body in order not to alert enemy forces capable of annihilating us without too many problems. Sometimes, and this is one of the most appreciable goodies of the game, it will even be necessary to injure an enemy, perhaps in the leg, to force his companions to come out in an attempt to save him. To the aforementioned difficulties must be added the problems familiar to every self-respecting sniper, namely the difficulty of movement and the precision in hitting moving targets, because not all of our targets will remain motionless in the patient waiting for a quick end. To make our movements in hot areas or during a fight more exciting, the Rebellion has thought of giving weight to our beloved character by slowing him down, consequently, in the case of sudden differences in height or climbs. In this way our weight becomes an element which, if neglected, is able to slow us down enough to make us identify or hit by enemies. Similarly to the protagonist, the bullets of Sniper Elite also have a weight that determines a descending parabola that is all the more marked according to the distance to be covered. In the easiest mode, all we have to do is remember to aim just above the head having to hit a very distant target, while increasing the difficulty will also increase the need for compensation and the force of the wind will also intervene to make everything more complicated. Changing the difficulty of the game also affects other elements such as the size of the explosions, the speed of our actions and, of course, the reactivity of the enemies. All these elements can be modified to create a customized level of difficulty: stupid enemies and realistic physics, for example, are elements capable of very well replicating the atmospheres that reign in many war films. Sniper Elite, in addition to supporting online and offline multiplayer on both consoles, gives us the cooperative mode, unfortunately only offline, but capable of increasing the depth of the game by literally doubling our tactical options. Not just technique Sniper Elite is not one of those titles that make people scream atmiracle. Indeed, looking at it carefully, it shows the side to several criticisms, above all due to textures and models of far from exceptional workmanship. Yet the Rebellion guys, by mixing graphic effects and carefully dosing the colors, have recreated an atmosphere capable of involving the player. The wet ground presents reflections in real time, and the dynamic lighting is visible at very high distances, also allowing us to identify a target thanks to the flashes produced by his weapon on the surrounding world. The cities are full of ruined buildings, bulkheads, posts and alleys and there is no shortage of goodies such as the raindrops that appear on the viewfinder lens but only looking up, a slight blur during the zoom and the ever-present camera that follows the projectile in the case of a particularly accurate shot. A marked flaw is found when examining maps that have roads blocked by invisible obstacles. In these cases, unfortunately, the atmosphere and the feeling of being able to outflank and surprise the enemies lose some of their strength. able to convincingly replicate the set of noises that our imagination attributes to those terrible but fascinating days of the last century Not just technique The title is completely in Italian and has a credible dubbing, populated by now familiar voices in the field of video games, and makes use of excellent sound, certainly capable of convincingly replicating the set of noises that our imagination attributes to those terrible but fascinating days of the last century. Comment Sniper Elite is a good title, it has various merits and it is one of the few wide-ranging games dedicated to the figure of the sniper. Unfortunately, due to a competition of choices and technological flaws, looking for some targets often turns into a matter of patience rather than a glance and this element, although characteristic of the sniper, weighs down the game quite a bit. Furthermore, maps ~truncated~ by invisible obstacles represent more than simple ingenuity. On the other hand, the charm and the atmosphere manage to balance the defects very well, the 28 missions represent a considerable challenge and guarantee, together with the cooperative, a more than sufficient longevity. As icing on the cake there is the possibility of increasing the physics of the bullets to make it almost authentic, an element that cannot go unnoticed by fans of the genre to whom we recommend, if not the purchase, at least a test drive as soon as possible .Pros: long-lasting wide-ranging tactical freedom the atmosphere immerses us in the figure of the sniper Cons: imperfect models and grainy textures sometimes it requires too much patience the invisible walls definitely clash Alone, with the butt of a large rifle planted in the shoulder, the arm aching and the back soaked and aching, we observe a distant point motionless, waiting for an unsuspecting enemy to turn into a notch in the wood of our only friend. The profession, if we can call it that, of the sniper is one of the most admired and envied military figures, capable of giving death from a distance like a god but vulnerable and alone like no other soldier. Slipping from the solemnity of war to the colorful world of video games we are faced with the first title capable of representing, in the round, the mythical figure of the sniper or, if nothing else, we find the interpretation that the boys of the Rebellion give us.", "date": "2005-10-07", "grade": null}
