{"name": "Grancrest War: Quartet Conflict", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/grancrest-war-quartet-conflict-la-recensione.html", "text": "We have already said, on the occasion of Dragon Ball Legends, how Bandai Namco has begun to take the mobile sector a little more seriously as a platform with interesting playful potential and not just as a mere promotional megaphone for multimedia series and we reiterate the same thing even in front of Grancrest War: Quartet Conflict, because undoubtedly there is behind a certain work by the publisher. The series particularly lends itself to being transferred to the mechanics that are becoming canonical for Japanese RPGs on smartphones, given the amount of characters that populate the Grancrest lore and which seem structured precisely to fit into the ~gacha~ dynamic, which obviously does not not even in this case. In truth, the series in question has rather solid origins, having started as a line of stories by Ry Mizuno, author of the historic Record of Lodoss War and then transferred to manga and anime through the work of Miy and A-1 Pictures with excellent hits. Therefore, there is no doubt about the starting material, which presents the usual interesting mix of elements in a classic western fantasy style filtered through the typical Japanese aesthetics and taste, although compared to Lodoss here we are perhaps in a more ~commercial~ sphere, but times have also definitely changed. The problem, if anything, was trying to fit the complex history of families, wars, alliances and betrayals into a schematic and progressive game like this Grancrest War: Quartet Conflict and on this aspect the basic narrative elements are actually a bit sacrificed, but at least the interesting world of reference remains, the colorful cast of characters and the excellent character design based on the work of Hiroshi Yak on the anime, an important element considering the importance covered by the research and collection of characters in the structure of the game. Obviously, it is a game dedicated above all to those who know the Grancrest senki saga, beyond the obviously superior attraction exerted on those who are already fascinated by this world also because having a certain knowledge of the history and relationships between the characters, beyond the confusing narrative present here, it's quite important. A knight's fate The story broadly follows that of the anime, even if it is inevitably more compressed and confused in this mobile reduction due to a fragmented and fragmentary narrative rhythm that does not really do it justice. It briefly tells the story of young Theo, intent on bringing peace to a world constantly on the brink of war and in which prestige is measured through the collection of emblems (the Crests), endowed with magical powers and in able to raise the social rank for those who possess them. From the fortuitous encounter between the boy and a young, talented but rebellious sorceress called Siluca, who is fascinated by Theo's fortitude and decides to support him, begins a long and complex story of war, redemption and dreams of peace. On the smartphone screen this is told above all through numerous dialogues with static scenes and some rare anime-style animation, however very well done, setting various focal moments of the story between the quests into which this RPG is schematically divided. These are structured in the now canonical way for mobile JRPGs: between the narrative phases and those dedicated to managing the characters we find ourselves facing levels in which control is assumed (or not, in the event that one decides to delegate everything to the CPU using the option to automate the clashes) of the party of characters in what is in all respects a fairly classic hack and slash. In this sense Grancrest War: Quartet Conflict tends to differentiate itself from the numerous RPGs of this type, because in the battle phase it also offers a hint of free exploration of the scenarios, complete with crossroads and treasures to discover even if everything remains at a very elementary, closely resembling the structure of Tales of the Rays. Action combat is based on the use of combos and special abilities that can be chained between the various characters, making them enter the field alternately in a rhythmic manner and thus obtaining combined effects that enrich a battle system otherwise quite close to the button masher. facing armies of enemies up to the inevitable bosses. Speaking of Tales of the Rays, the problem is that Grancrest also derives its worst aspects from the latter, given that the grinding makes itself felt quite early and triggers the usual free-to-play traps that also leverage the collection of characters through the usual ~summons~. In short, the classic shopping rush ofin-game currency that can have deleterious effects if not experienced with the right sense of measure. For the rest, there is a rather deep management of the party with all the standard trappings of the genre and even something more: triangle of skills (the classic balance of power in paper-rock-scissors style), evolution of each single fighter, skill tree applied to the Crests and a coordination system between the fighters of the party which determines different cross-influences depending on the chosen group, modifying the group's statistics.", "date": "2018-11-09", "grade": "7.8"}
