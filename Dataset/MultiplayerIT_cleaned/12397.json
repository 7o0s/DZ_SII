{"name": "Bejeweled", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/bejeweled.html", "text": "Developed by Pop Cap Games on behalf of EA Mobile, Bejeweled is really the simplest and most essential that exists within the portable gaming landscape. Even describing the game mechanics is an easy task: the user has the task of moving the gems on the screen in order to create horizontal or vertical rows of at least three equal units, in order to make them disappear and earn points. Whenever this happens, the overlying stones fall into the spaces left free, allowing the most attentive players to create chains and multiply the score. That's all. There are two variants through which to tackle the puzzle, corresponding to the only two play modes, Normal Game and Time Challenge. The first simply allows you to go on as long as it is possible to create groups of gems, while the second adds a little spice by inserting a time indicator that fills up as you score: the aim is to bring it to a climax thus passing to the next internship . The presence of only two modes and the low level of challenge are the main weaknesses of Bejeweled, which probably would have benefited from a two-player option or even just a higher difficulty threshold. A lack that in any case does not affect the well-tested playful structure of the Pop Cap work, as usual extremely enjoyable and above all capable of thrilling practically every kind of user. Simple in substance, Bejeweled is also simple in form, first of all with regard to an absolutely essential graphic, which combines the different colored gems with a single lunar background: even here, a minimum of more variety would not have hurt. Finally, the sound is discreet, with a pleasant little music in the menus, effects at the height and a - at times disturbing - male voice that underlines some passages in the game action. PRO Simple and captivating Suitable for everyone AGAINST Only two game modes", "date": "2007-03-29", "grade": "S.V."}
