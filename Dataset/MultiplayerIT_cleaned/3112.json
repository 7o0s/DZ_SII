{"name": "Mato Anomalies", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mato-anomalies-recensione.html", "text": "It's hard to come up with something new and immediately recognizable. Peremptory statement, but one that readers will find agreeable; above all, particularly suitable for the gaming world. While the now widely known teams can afford to insist on established brands, independent (or simply smaller) developers spend enormous efforts to succeed in emerging. We owe them the original paths, the disruptive ideas, the obvious risks associated with taking new paths... yet sometimes they fall into the trap, trying to emulate the products of better known companies, without the same results. This is also the case of Mato Anomalies, there is little to do. The developers of Arrowiz, whose title was recently released by Prime Matter on all available platforms, have evidently drawn from a variety of ~effective~ sources. A quick glance at any image or trailer of the game is enough to realize it: in Mato Anomalies there is a bit of Persona 5, of Shin Megami Tensei, of Cyberpunk 2077, even of Professor Layton; as well as many different genres juxtaposed in a mix that is now effective, now decidedly less so: the visual novel, the turn-based RPG, the detective, the board game. Variety itself isn't a problem; the level of depth of this variety, the way it is offered to the player, are if anything the problems. Without anticipating too much else let's move on to the heart of the Mato Anomalies review. Plot: retrofuturistic crimes and mysteries A glimpse of the city of Mato Anomalies The title of Arrowiz is set in Mato, a place inspired by a generic retro-futuristic oriental city: one therefore senses that we are, in fact, projected far beyond the current era. Despite this, human evolution has maintained various links with a type of technology and civilization in general that we would already define as obsolete today. In short, Mato's is a very particular ~future~, dystopian and it must be said, also fascinating. To enrich the whole there are connections to other dimensions - the demons of the Baleful Tide inhabit an alternative world, outside of time and space, connected to that of men through the so-called fault lines - and to themes such as spiritualism and mysticism. Suffice it to say that one of the supporting actors is a sort of exorcist ninja specialized in eliminating the Baleful Tide. All these aspects could seem positive to you, as positive in fact the main narrative appears from the beginning. The real protagonist is Doe, a private detective with whom the player is immediately led to sympathize, because he is determined, good-natured, friendly, witty, often naive, in short, perfectly human. Doe finds himself entangled in conspiracies and intrigues far greater than his possibilities: organized crime is now uncontrollable, and a few, very wealthy businessmen govern the city of Mato, while the entire population - made up mostly of the working class - goes hungry. Nevertheless Doe will not back down and, together with the aforementioned exorcist Gram, a sort of female Robin Hood (Butterfly) and others will try to face the bosses of the underworld, who among other things are connected to the demons of the other dimension. Now, beyond the narrative outcomes of the plot, there are basically two problems: the construction of the game world is quite confusing, despite the efforts and the evident passion lavished by the developers. There are too many names to remember, connections to maintain, characteristics of the society in question to keep in mind while analyzing places, events and situations; among other things, not everything is necessary, but Mato is never clear from the outset on how much is necessary and how much is not. Furthermore, the pace management is questionable. The progression is linked to a series of cutscenes, films, interludes from a real visual novel (all too verbose) and sequences in which the style of American comics is embraced (among other things, passing from 2D to 3D) . All of this, taken together, could even work - even if the style varies dramatically from moment to moment. Only that the individual parts are not well balanced with respect to the context, and therefore we find ourselves with endless secondary dialogues to be read for several minutes, or with very short films that seemed really interesting. Gameplay: Between this world and the next Doe and Gram, supporting roles in Mato Anomalies Even the gameplay of Mato Anomalies is affected by the total heterogeneity of which we have spoken. Ideally, the progression is marked by two different moments, characterized by equally different styles of play. There is the world of humans, in which Doe operates; and that of demons, the otherto dimension, of which the expert is instead Gram. Doe explores this world, Gram the other. So far everything is clear. The areas of Mato, small and from the laughable exploration, are connected to each other thanks to the general map: it is sufficient to select an area to be immediately teleported (enduring each time the loading of the same). All main and side missions and dialogue possibilities are indicated by the menu - you can't go wrong. Doe moves from one area to another, talks to everyone, collects clues, sometimes interrogates suspects through mental confrontation, a real card-based mini-game, potentially very rich in opportunities, on balance boring and graphically anonymous - forget the games of Gwent of The Witcher 3. When you pass into the world of Bale Tide, things change radically. Here Doe disappears, because he is not a warrior; the rest of the party takes over, led by Gram. The setting is that of any low-cost RPG with turn-based combat: ridiculously short and guided dungeons, repetitive monsters with an anonymous design, a predictable and not very varied system of moves (you attack or defend yourself with a handful of moves, at most one cares, and so on ad infinitum). By leveling up it is possible to enhance the characters through new pieces of equipment, weapons, specific skills and final moves; but even in this Mato Anomalies maintains a rigorous basicity, among other things perpetually guided, constantly suggesting to the player what to do and how to do it. Usually you advance with great tranquility - just remember to use Butterfly's healing power - apart from the boss fights in the second part of the adventure. Here a little grinding is appropriate, because suddenly the difficulty skyrockets. Mato Anomalies oscillates continuously between this world and that of the Bale Tide, which inhabits the so-called Havens Apart from the setting, Mato Anomalies therefore does not shine in any specific mechanics; on the contrary, the set of several mechanics, far from offering the variety desired by the developers, makes everything a cauldron of low-cost special effects. It's true that everything, taken individually, works; but it works at truly trivial levels, without complexity, offering the minimum wage of every single mechanic or idea already seen at much more interesting levels in similar productions. If we add to all this a technical sector that is difficult to justify on new generation consoles ", "date": "2023-03-17", "grade": "6.5"}
