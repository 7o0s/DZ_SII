It was characterized by political intrigue and military conflicts that lasted for almost two hundred years and, as is often the case in these cases, the Sengoku Era has also been a source of inspiration for countless artists. The great protagonists of this historical era, such as Hideyoshi Toyotomi and Nobunaga Oda, have taken on a literally mythological aura over time, and it is really difficult to count all the genres of works inspired by them. In the videogame field, Koei's Sengoku Musou series is probably the most famous representation of that ancient Japan: this third official appointment with the brand is a Wii exclusive and the attention paid to the franchise by Nintendo itself, the game's distributor in Europe , seems to allude to a product with an edge over the usual. Will it be true? Like slaughtering an army before dinner Samurai Warriors 3 strikes for the considerable depth of play hidden by a gameplay that is only chaotic and repetitive at first glance. Those who have already played the prequels for Sony and Microsoft consoles will immediately recognize the classic formula of the series: the player controls one of the many ~historical~ heroes of the Sengoku era, within large battlefields in which he will have to face entire armies to the death. The legendary status of these characters is underlined by their superhuman abilities, which allow them to stand up to multiple opponents simultaneously, wiping them out with a wide range of chainable normal and special attacks that increase as the game progresses. The action therefore becomes extremely spectacular in a very short time and the most powerful shots are characterized by complex pyrotechnic effects, especially in the case of the devastating Musou Attacks. In reality, the goal of each chapter is not simply to wipe out enemy platoons within a certain time limit: in addition to solving the main mission, you can also jump on the back of your steed to reach troops in difficulty or defeat an enemy officer or captain in order to conquer a stronghold. Each optional objective will increase the final loot, in terms of experience points and bonus items, such as the gems needed, between one mission and another, to upgrade the blacksmith's equipment, obtaining special skills of various kinds. This is in summary the mechanics of Samurai Warriors 3, which is repeated a bit in all game modes, with some variations that make each of them a unique experience after all. In Story Mode we will be able to follow the epic of each hero, unlocking others in the process for a total of around forty characters, each characterized by different weaknesses and abilities; the Historical Mode instead allows you to create an alter ego completely from scratch to face a series of unpublished missions; Free Mode allows you to replay each completed chapter in Story Mode; finally there is another game option, Murasame Castle, inspired by an old NES classic: the concept is always the same but this time the player will have to explore some rooms to rescue the tanuki prisoners in the castle. All modes can also be enjoyed by a second player via split-screen, except Murasame Castle which can be played in company via Wi-Fi Connection. An epic game, more or less The goodness of Samurai Warriors 3 is also confirmed by the control system: the game supports the traditional Wiimote and Nunchuck combo, the Classic Controller Pro and the Game Cube controller. In this case we tried the first two configurations and the Classic Controller Pro seems much more enjoyable and immediate to master. Learning to play Samurai Warriors 3 is extremely simple and the difficulty level proposed by default is never frustrating and punitive, a whole different story instead as regards the advanced difficulties, which are truly deadly. From this point of view, the main problem is paradoxically constituted by the map: although it is possible to keep a map constantly on the screen that illustrates our position, the similarity between the various locations is such that it is not difficult to get lost in an attempt to reach the next goal. This does not mean that technically Samurai Warriors 3 is a weak product: the Omega Force game is indeed truly remarkable, to contrast the all in all dull settings and the decidedly repetitive enemies we think of the exquisitely detailed and animated polygonal models, which reproduce the features of the heroes of the Sengoku era in a truly distinctive and captivating style. The soundtrack doesn't disappoint either, mixing songs fromthe typically Japanese flavor to other more modern and electronic ones. There is also a ton of digitized speech to accompany the long dialogues between the various characters in the interactive and non-interactive sequences: we are sure that many players will appreciate the possibility of replacing the English speech with the original Japanese one. With the subtitles in Italian to act as a support, Samurai Warriors 3 definitely acquires an even more pleasant flavor.", "date": "2010-06-11", "grade": "8.3"}
