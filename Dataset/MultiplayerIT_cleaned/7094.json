Immediately capable of attracting attention, it has gradually evolved and is finally ready to land on Steam as a commercial product. But the Gone North Games title has very little commercial, at least in relation to the most popular trends in the modern videogame field, starting from the narrative formula that sees a father, the protagonist, tell his daughter about his search for her uncle, a mysterious inventor and adventurer. It all starts with the discovery of a sci-fi suit hanging in a closet belonging to the missing Uncle Fred. The peculiar dress seems to have been made especially for the protagonist who, in the grip of curiosity, wears it and embarks headlong on an adventurous journey. From here on A Story About My Uncle is all about jumping huge distances with the help of the propulsive thrust of the suit which is boosted, during the early stages of the game, by a magnetic grappling hook with three charges and by a jetpack with decidedly autonomy reduced. As you may have already guessed, the challenge of A Story About My Uncle is all about finding the right path between improbable holds, orbiting rocks and bottomless precipices. A Story About My Uncle turns the search for a lost uncle into an adventure full of mystery and magic Dying is part of the game The gameplay of A Story About My Uncle revolves around mechanics that we have already seen in various three-dimensional platformers but the difference, in this case, is linked to the enormous spaces of the Gone North Games title which enhance the extraordinary movement capabilities of the protagonist. The great leaps, this is obvious, require a fair amount of precision and the way forward is not always clear thanks to an excellent design work that evolves from level to level. But it is precisely in the most complex situations that a sudden intuition or a miraculous evolution give us the greatest satisfaction and make it clear how well the formula of the title, supported by reactive controls and precise movements, works very well. Of course, it often happens to find yourself hanging in the air with your grappling hook unloaded and no idea which direction to take. And in these cases things often end with a dramatic flight into the void. But failure can prove useful for understanding the distances that separate us from the next platform and sometimes a violent death allows us to see a handhold that is visible only once we have taken the leap. Dying, in essence, is part of the game and the numerous checkpoints avoid potential frustration while keeping the experience streamlined and enjoyable despite some passages being decidedly complex. But it is also the desire to explore that keeps the desire to overcome the most complex puzzles high in a title that tickles our curiosity by continuously feeding its narrative component. In his travels Fred, the uncle whose traces we follow, has met mysterious creatures, discovered mysteries and also left some clues to help us find the right path. All elements that we find on our way and which, between clues and dialogues, represent a good portion of the experience. Part of the dialogues is optional and can be avoided simply by going straight but if the fairytale dimension intrigues you, the advice is to waste a few minutes trying to get in tune with the game world. In all this, the indie nature of a product remains evident from which one cannot expect the finishing touches of a triple A title. The soundtrack is undoubtedly suggestive but is limited in terms of variety and is accompanied by sound effects ranging from the delicious to the disappointing . Furthermore, we must admit that the splendid initial setting, the uncle's house, is the most well-kept while the rest does not reach the same aesthetic quality. Yet, despite the often anonymous textures and the not exceptional polygonal mass, the levels are characterized by vivid colors and suggestive lights that make everything pleasant to look at. When the depths of the earth open up to the starry sky, the emotion is strong and this means that whoever has taken care of the artistic sector has done their job. Furthermore, the post processing is not bad, the excellent narrative voice supports the narration very well and there is no shortage of small aesthetic gimmicks to further embellish the experience.", "date": "2014-05-27", "grade": "8.0"}
