The main reference model is Street Fighter III: The Third Strike with its extremely refined gameplay and, in many respects, still unmatched today. Yatagarasu Attack on Cataclysm fits perfectly into this vein, due to some decidedly radical design choices. However, before starting to talk about the actual game, it is right to retrace its history a bit, given that it has been in development since 2008 and has had a lot of troubles. It was then that some ex-SNKs (Fatal Fury and The King of Fighters series among many others) released the first prototype of the game, which allowed to use only two fighters. Although it was very far from being completed, the response from the public was very good and the development has therefore continued, albeit slowly. Very slowly. Unfortunately it was not the main activity of the team members, who carried it forward in their spare time, with the obvious difficulties due to such a complex genre to shape. The definitive turning point was the fundraising campaign on IndieGoGo, which was necessary to complete the work within this century. In reality, the times have further dilated and there have been postponements in the publication even in the last year (it was supposed to come out in 2014). By now there is little to complain about because it has finally arrived, thanks also to the contribution of Nyu Media, a small publisher specializing in the import of Japanese indie titles. In short, for those who have closely followed the project for all these years, there must be a great deal of curiosity to see it at work. It took Yatagarasu Attack on Cataclysm eight years to hit the market. Let's find out how it came 1925 Yatagarasu Attack on Cataclysm features eleven perfectly balanced fighters. If you want it also tells a kind of story, which speaks of a brutal coup d'tat carried out by a group of Japanese nationalists on December 25, 1925. The ~Yatagarasu~ program would be nothing more than the reaction of the old government to the brutality of the revolutionaries, i.e. the attempt to have all the usurping leaders killed by a secret society called ~Igasei~. Incredibly for a fighting game, during the game the story has interesting implications, which are told in the interlude sequences between one fight and another of the arcade modes (there are two, moreover, with the same name). Even if we imagine that you are more interested in knowing some details on the actual gameplay, it is right to underline the care taken in an aspect considered quite secondary in major productions. Just think of the bad plot plots that are used to justify the presence of certain characters in the Street Fighter series, to understand the perspective of this situation. Nothing essential, but not as secondary as most believe. Let's say it's a good way to resonate with characters who are initially complete strangers and to make sense of the single player mode. The Alternatives There are several alternatives to Yatagarasu Attack on Cataclysm, as it is part of a genre with regular releases, even if not beaters. If you want to stay technical, we advise you to try Skullgirls by Lab Zero Games, a really rich title with a complete and very varied roster. Another title to consider is Battle Fantasia -Revised Edition- by Arc Systems Works, a fantasy fighting game in which the Japanese developer has tried several things. Of course there are also the classics. On Steam you can buy Street Fighter IV, several King of Fighters, various Guilty Gear and even the latest BlazBlue. In short, if you like the genre you just have to choose. Pale caresses The first impact with the arena is disarming. The brutal truth is that by now we are used to a certain technical level and finding ourselves observing characters made of pixels as big as huts has a certain effect. The backgrounds are rendered at a higher resolution, but overall Yatagarasu Attack on Cataclysm looks like a 90s 2D fighting game, even though it runs at a very low native resolution. Let's say that the first approach is not the best, also disadvantaged by a certain basic roughness of the side elements, such as the really ugly menus and the multiplayer, which required us to do some healthy, old port forwarding for work. Fortunately, then you start playing and you understand that the cure is to be found in everything else, that is, in the clashes. Yatagarasu Attack on Cataclysm is everything a true fan of the genre could wish for.The game dynamics seem apparently the same as always, but that's not quite the case. The combat system uses six buttons: two for punches, two for kicks and two for parries (up and down). Parries are mainly used to stop attacks without taking damage, including special ones. In reality, as purists are well aware, it is a mechanic which, if well implemented, ends up enormously changing the conduct of matches, especially those between advanced and professional players. It is the classic mechanic that playing alone you can also ignore, but which becomes essential to master in order to obtain good results in competitive fields. In fact, Yatagarasu seems to have been designed specifically for tournaments, with its gameplay studied in every detail to avoid imbalances. For example, of the eleven selectable characters there is none built entirely around throwing fireballs and the like, as is the case in other titles (see Street Fighter IV). This is no small annotation, given that it is really difficult to create a balanced roster that favors a more thoughtful approach to matches. Sure, there aren't the deluge of heroes and anti-heroes that commercial fighting games have accustomed us to, but it must be said that the eleven characters included are really all very different from each other and there aren't the classic convenience repetitions built around some models basis. Even the development team has chosen to limit the number of special attacks of some, where adding others would certainly have led to imbalances. A courageous choice that pays off in the long run, but which will probably make less dedicated players lose their way. Too bad for some connection problems. We did some research before making this point, to find out if maybe it was just our fault for the excessive lag of many online matches. Unfortunately it seems that the problem affects several players. Hopefully it will be fixed with some patch.", "date": "2015-07-10", "grade": "7.8"}
