The beautiful menus in which we will move show sequences taken from George Lucas' trilogy, and it is as if the developers wanted to give us an immediate idea of what we will soon be facing, or rather total immersion in a game that comes incredibly close to the film. All this accompanied by atmospheric music obviously taken from the trilogy, but I intend to tell you about the sound aspect later in a special paragraph. However, the initial impact is of the highest level and I personally don't remember another game with such beautiful menus. Star Wars Rogue Leader: Rogue Squadron II, as well as its predecessor for N64, is essentially a 3D shooter that sees us take on the role now of the legendary Luke Skywalker, now of Wedge Antilles, constantly aboard powerful vehicles such as the beautiful X- Wing, A-Wing, Y-Wing or the new jewel B-Wing to tackle 11 missions in which we can be the protagonists of the famous scenes that take place in the Star Wars universe. The actions develop between dogfights against the ubiquitous Tie Fighters, the shooting down of targets such as space ships, or land-based precision attacks. But considering Rogue Squadron II a simple 3D shooter where the only aim is to shoot everything that comes in front of us is wrong. In fact, each level is characterized by a series of very varied missions that keep the level of challenge constantly high. The game begins with the famous scene of the Death Star Attack, and then continues with episodes of Hoth, in the skies of Bespin and still splendid battles on the moon of Endor. In each mission we will have objectives to destroy which, if desired, are proposed to us by calling up the Pointing Computer, or a sort of HUD display that highlights everything that can be knocked down. We become a Rogue Leader To signal the presence of enemies and targets there is also a radar at our disposal, which however is very often difficult to understand, given that it is not easy to understand the height and real distance of the enemies, thus making it unusable most of the time . In each mission, we will take on the role of Rogue Leader, i.e. we will be in charge of a squadron constantly at our disposal and to which we will be able to assign 3 different tasks: attack the annoying Tie Fighters to do some cleaning in the airspace, attack enemy positions earthlings who try to shoot us down with laser beams, or simply remain alongside us to increase our firepower. The choice is therefore yours, since you will be constantly called to decide the most appropriate tactic. This aspect will later prove to be fundamental for the completion of each mission, given the high level of difficulty that does not allow us to move forward using only our strength. At the end of each mission, a screen will appear in which all our work is summarized as: time taken, enemies killed, lives lost, shooting accuracy and percentage of targeting used. In fact, the use of the Pointing Computer will affect the final evaluation; the more we use it, the lower it will be. What's the point of all this? To obtain a score useful for conquering one of the 3 medals available at the end of each level. Bronze is easily obtainable with a little training, silver instead requires a very strong application, while gold is an almost impossible feat, so forget about collecting all the golds in your bulletin board! The medals, apart from the matter of personal pride, have the function of unlocking some secrets such as splendid additional missions (in no way inferior to the 11 already present), films and documentaries worthy of the best DVDs and additional means such as Darth Vader's advanced Tie Fighter , thus ensuring high longevity and the level of challenge. However, it must be said that, medals aside, the difficulty in completing some missions is really excessive and for the less experienced, Rogue Squadron II can often generate a lot of frustration. Check To govern the powerful means at our disposal we will have to use the GameCube controller at 100%. In fact, each key is assigned a specific command. The left analog stick obviously has the function of directing our spaceship, the control is quite precise but a little too abrupt in the change of direction. The left C-stick is for ru insteadotate the game camera and it allows us to keep everything constantly under control. The central button A is assigned the command of the main weapon, while the B button the secondary one. The X key is used to change the view (external and internal), the Y key instead activates the already mentioned Pointing Computer, useful for us to find the objectives but which, as we have already said, you have to use little if you want to hope to get a medal. By holding down the Z key we can rotate our vehicle by 360  and instead the classic accelerator and brake commands are assigned to the R and L back keys. Last I left the bad directional cross with which, based on the given direction, we can assign the various tasks to our adventure companions. Unfortunately it is the only button on the controller that I just can't get used to, not only due to the very small size for which it very often lacks precision, but also due to the decidedly uncomfortable position that is particularly noticeable in Rogue Leader. Graphics Insert the Star Wars Rogue Leader: Rogue Squadron II mini-dvd into your Game Cube and after a few moments you will have the first pleasant surprise: the 60-50 Hz selector demonstrating the perfect conversion from the original NTSC format. All that comes after is an amazing graphic orgy that Factor 5 have packed for the Nintendo console. It is difficult to believe that this is a game already available at launch, but at the same time it is easy to understand what the real capabilities of this console are. Star Wars Rogue Leader: Rogue Squadron II, graphically is without a doubt the best game available for the GameCube and if you want to clearly understand how much power this little console is capable of generating, all you have to do is look at it with your own eyes and try to keep firm your jaw, which in many cases will tend to fall inexorably on the floor. Everything that appears on your screen is made with incredible care and the level of photorealism achieved is so high as to make us believe in many cases that we are dealing with the original film. Both the settings and the aircraft models are so identical to those seen in the Star Wars trilogy that the most avid fans of the famous saga will hardly be able to contain the emotion. The number of polygons moved on the screen is impressive and cannot be quantified. Each vehicle is reproduced with painstaking care and where in a normal game simple flat textures are used to cover the models, in Rogue Leader everything takes shape thanks to the third dimension. It is even possible to admire the pilots in 3D inside the dashboard of an X-Wing. Not to mention the wonderful textures scattered almost everywhere. Texture mapping, bump mapping, particle effects, light effects, refractions, dynamic shadows and so on and so forth; everything is there, every technical gem is present in Rogue Leader, the developers did not want to give up anything at all, indeed perhaps they had to give up something. In fact, to bring such graphic beauty to video it was inevitably necessary to turn a blind eye to the frame rate, which in some particular situations (I repeat, only some particular situations) tends to hiccup a bit, going from 60 to 30 frames per second. Let it be clear that this only happens for a few moments, especially in tight turns and when the number of polygons becomes truly uncontainable. Apart from this small mole, which in any case never affects the visual amazement that is exposed before our eyes, no other defects are noticed, but only further advantages that I will spare you to make room for other topics. Sound If the graphics sector of Star Wars Rogue Leader: Rogue Squadron II is the new yardstick for next-generation games, even the sound one is no different. Playing with the Factor 5 title is a pleasure that awakens multiple senses and here, sight and hearing go hand in hand. Names of the caliber of Chris Hulsbeck and John Williams are the best guarantee for an Oscar-winning soundtrack and special effects. The immersion in the Star Wars universe is therefore total, the music and all the sounds produced by the vehicles and the weapons are taken from the film and if all this were not enough, many spoken sequences have also been taken from the film and reproduced on the tiny DVD for GameCube, so don't be surprised when you hear the voice of Darth Vader or Obi WanKenobi. Worth noting is the collaboration of the voice actor of Wedge Antilles who for the occasion lent his voice to create completely unpublished dialogues. But that's not all, because Star Wars Rogue Leader: Rogue Squadron II fully supports the new Dolby Surround Pro Logic 2 technology for even greater involvement, which unfortunately I have not been able to test, but rest assured that even without it, the quality always remains very high. Longevity The longevity of Star Wars Rogue Leader: Rogue Squadron II depends a lot on the degree of skill of the player. The 11 missions available initially are not very many and once familiarized with the control system they can also be completed in a short time. Nonetheless, some of these are frighteningly difficult and require a considerable level of application, as well as being repeated many times before finishing them. This aspect can often lead to frustration, as it is not always fun to repeat the same mission even 15 times, perhaps always dying in the same point and perhaps always in the final part of the level. However, the medals objective will keep longevity high, necessary to unlock 4 other secret missions, new vehicles and various bonuses and which will lead you to replay it numerous times. Conclusions Star Wars Rogue Leader: Rogue Squadron II is a perfectly made title that will make all fans of the Star Wars trilogy happy and which for them is absolutely to be considered as a must-buy. For all the others, on the other hand, it is a 3D shooter that frankly does not bring any particular innovation to this genre of games from a gameplay point of view, while remaining one of the best of its kind, while from a technical point of view there is no it is still nothing comparable. Those approaching the world of Star Wars for the first time could also find it boring in the long run and even the high challenge rate given by the achievement of medals could be useless leading to abandon it soon. However, it is one of the best titles of its kind and the best proof of the GameCube's technical capabilities. Sorry only for those small drops in frame rates that perhaps could have disappeared completely by giving up too many virtuosity or perhaps delaying the release for a few months. The fact remains that no new generation console could boast a game of such technical quality in the launch line-up. Conclusions Pros: Graphically monstrous Sound of the highest level Total immersion in the Star Wars universe Great control system Good longevity Cons: Slight drops in frame rate Difficult, sometimes frustrating Not very original Cinema comes to consoles! The Star Wars trilogy, the immense cinematographic masterpiece by George Lucas, deserved a game worthy of it from the point of view of spectacularity and above all one that revived the best moments of the first three episodes of what until today is consecrated as the best sci-fi saga. To achieve all this, the union of three fundamental components was necessary: LucasArts, each game inspired by the Star Wars saga carries with it (for an obvious copyright issue) the indelible mark of the famous manufacturer; Factor 5, the developers of the already excellent Rogue Squadron for Nintendo 64, and finally a powerful console on which to indulge oneself to create a graphic masterpiece almost equal to the cinematic version, the GameCube. Indeed, Star Wars Rogue Leader: Rogue Squadron II is as close to a film as you can imagine and what makes it indispensable for fans of the trilogy is precisely the ability to make us relive the most exciting and unforgettable moments of the film in a grand way. Undoubtedly it is one of the titles of the Nintendo console that has sold the most and is talked about the most, but it is equally true that the reason for this huge success is above all due to an exceptional graphic sector that is difficult to resist. Most likely, if Rogue Leader had had less detailed graphics, it would not have been as successful. But we will have time to talk more about this aspect in another paragraph.", "date": "2002-07-01", "grade": null}
