{"name": "The Last Clockwinder: la recensione del miglior puzzle per PS VR2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-last-clockwinder-recensione.html", "text": "Pronounced by the architect Peter Behrens and then became the strong point of his protg Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, ~less is more~ is the paradigm of modern design. Clean lines, shapes applied to function, minimalism as intent and result. A concept that clearly goes beyond the boundaries of architecture and that can be applied to any form of design, even videogames. This is the case of The Last Clockwinder, a small pearl developed by Pontoco and which in 2022 was elected as the best title on the Meta Quest store. Seeing the porting of this splendid puzzle adventure to PlayStation VR2 can only make us happy, because we are talking about a title that maximizes the potential of virtual reality, and which for just under 25 you cannot miss. We explain why in our review of The Last Clockwinder for PS VR2. Incipit and narrative The Clock Tower houses plants from all over the galaxy The Last Clockwinder is a first-person puzzle adventure where the player takes on the role of Jules, a scientist who returns to her childhood home to avert a catastrophe. The Clock Tower is a gigantic alien tree, in which all the seeds of plants scattered throughout the universe are kept, a bit like our world seed bank in the Svalbard Islands. The Tower is constantly guarded by a human guardian and a multitude of robotic gardeners. Inexplicably, one day the Tower begins to collapse and the guardian, Edea, a woman who raised and educated the protagonist and her adventure companion Levi, disappeared. During the adventure, the player will move in the countless rooms of the Tower... or rather: the room is always and only one but its floor is connected to a system of platforms. In the right corner of the main room there is a console with a globe, from which it is possible to call up the various ~rooms~ of the Tower at will. This is one of many ideas that demonstrate The Last Clockwinder's minimalism, as well as the choice to tell a touching story with indirect storytelling devices. For the purposes of the playful experience, the narrative part is not strictly necessary because we are still talking about a puzzle-based game, in which the fulcrum of the action is the solution of the puzzles. However, in the various rooms of the Tower it is possible to find old recordings of Edea, made during Jules' stay in the Tower in his childhood years. Only the voices of the two women will always tell the story, together with the various communications that the protagonist has with her partner Levi, who monitors her from a spaceship in orbit. No NPCs, cutscenes, or vast maps to navigate. The Last Clockwinder confines the action within an intimate and confined but never suffocating space, in which the player is free to move and explore to complete the tasks of each room. Game mechanics The Tower's robot gardeners will be of great help The pace at which the adventure advances in The Last Clockwinder is calibrated and precise, almost emulating the way clocks mark time. From this point of view, the notions that the player will have to learn are very few. You can only change rooms if you get hold of the relative key, small tokens abandoned here and there in the various rooms, and you will need to consume energy to operate the device. The Tower can extract it from the plants kept inside, which is why the rooms are essentially divided into two types: those for collection and those for assembly. In the collection rooms, the player will have to plant the seeds in the pots, collect the fruits and convey them in a pneumatic device. Obviously doing this extremely mechanical work alone requires a lot of time and effort, and here comes the queen mechanic on which The Last Clockwinder is based, namely the cloning of the movements. The Guardian's Gloves allow you to create as many robot gardeners as you like Initially, Jules will collect a pair of special gloves: pressing the buttons on the left controller will start a recording that will track the player's movements over a few seconds. Once the time has expired, a mechanical gardener will automatically be created, which will endlessly emulate the movement just mimed. Puzzle solving therefore falls more into the problem solving spectrum, where the goal is to create a robotic assembly line out of a sentient human action. The same will have to be done in the assembly rooms, where it will always be necessary to plant the seeds in the pots and collect the fruits, but theinstructions on the blackboards in the individual rooms. In fact, the different fruits can be assembled into structures that replicate the shape of the molecules, using sticks. These can never be grabbed directly by the player, but you can only stick them into a fruit while holding it in your hand. Once the structure has been assembled, it will be placed in a press which will return gems, which can be spent to buy other seeds. Levi always contacts Jules through the intercom of the Tower The more the adventure progresses, the more the variety of fruits available will increase: we will start from a hybrid between an apple and a tomato, gradually discovering many other bizarre plants. Being alien species, each fruit or vegetable will behave differently: pumpkins for example will float and giant blueberries cannot be held in the hand for too long, otherwise they will sublime into gas. Each plant therefore introduces different variations and unknowns and it will be up to the player to understand how to manipulate them and with what criteria to create the most efficient assembly line. In fact, it goes without saying that each room has a series of records to beat, where the ultimate goal is obviously to achieve the greatest production quota with the least number of gardeners. The funny thing is that once put to work, the gardeners will continue to work even if the room they are operating in is not the active one. In fact, the action of the robots also continues in the background and allows you to accumulate a large number of fruits and seeds. Part of the beauty of The Last Clockwinder is seeing the productivity of the Tower skyrocket, even though the player is dedicating himself to other activities. This is also very important in the final stages, where the amount of fruit required to feed the platforms, and therefore call new rooms from the control system, becomes particularly expensive. Each plant will need to be handled differently We wish we could tell you that we have so much more to tell you about The Last Clockwinder but in reality Pontoco's title ends here, and at the same time it never ends. A single idea at the service of a gameplay that gets richer as the adventure progresses, requiring brilliant and effective solutions from the player. And if you are a perfectionist, you will realize that even the most ingenious solution always has room for improvement, which at best could lead you to replace some robots with one with more fluid and faster movements, and at worst will instigate you to delete all your gardeners, who can be removed from their position at any time, to start all over again. PS VR2 game modes and controls The ~Frog~ is one of the Tower's many bizarre contraptions Although at first glance The Last Clockwinder seems like a very basic game in its appearance, actually by playing it you realize how technically successful the title is. Beyond the graphic impact, which on PS VR2 obviously gains in brilliance and resolution but which it must be said is also extremely pleasant on Mid Quest 2, the tracking of hands and movements works particularly well. Every now and then it may happen to see our robotic gardeners perform twists that are not exactly fluid to look at, but the precision with which the player's hand movements are recorded is remarkable and, we must add, it could not be otherwise given the type of gameplay. Very often positioning yourself one step further to the right or left of a vase can make the difference, just as the trajectory of a throw can be decisive. We haven't said it, taking it for granted, but every fruit and vegetable in both the picking and blending rooms can be touched, passed around or thrown by the gardeners. And that's why precision and freedom of movement are crucial to creating the perfect assembly line. The title can be enjoyed on PS VR2 both seated and standing, without however requiring the whole room mode, since it is assumed that the player only moves his hands and arms to impart movements to the gardeners, always remaining stationary in place. We found it almost impossible to play the title in its final stages while seated, because to solve some rooms we felt the need to have full mobility of trunk and limbs. The movement can be both free, therefore using the analog stick of the right PlayStation VR2 Sense, or with teleportation. From this point of view we would have liked to see the same solution adopted by the recent Maskmaker, where the two movement systems can be used simultaneously and assigned to the two analog sticks of the controllers, in order to manage macro movements with teleportation andsmall positional adjustments with free movement. A small tweak can make all the difference Another technical aspect not to be underestimated is the quantity of elements on the screen. There are times when the rooms will be particularly crowded, with more than a dozen gardeners picking, tossing and grabbing fruit and structures. Part of the complexity of the game is also not to hinder the action of the other gardeners, taking advantage of every possible creative solution possible. A truly classy detail is the correlation between action and soundtrack: when you enter a room for the first time, it is silent and there is no accompaniment. When the first gardener is repeated, a soft musical carpet begins to be heard in the background, and the more gardeners are put to work the more instruments are added to the symphony.", "date": "2023-03-05", "grade": "9.0"}
