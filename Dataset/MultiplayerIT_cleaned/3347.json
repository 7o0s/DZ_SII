It is now clear that the Japanese anime and manga series have found the best (or easiest) expression in the mobile RPG in terms of videogame adaptations applied to this type of device and it must be said that, if nothing else, Japanese developers are trying to at least add from time to time some new feature to the now granite canon according to which these games are sculpted. In short, the industrial mold is always the same, but we can see some attempts to personalize the gaming experience by varying some aspect of the gameplay, more or less marginal but still proof of an attempt to give a certain identity to these productions. Sword Art Online: Alicization Rising Steel tries to offer something different in the ~exploration~ phases of the levels, even if the path is always extremely predefined and the possibilities for digression are very minimal, as well as some particular characteristics applied to the combat system in so as to trace somewhat the typical spirit of the long series to which the game refers. It's not enough to make this title stand out clearly in the midst of the huge mass of practically identical games, but it represents a good support to give some substance to the experience, which for the rest is supported almost exclusively by the interest generated by the world of Sword Art Online and with a decidedly more developed narrative substratum here than in many other similar productions. In any case, between the high-profile characterisation, given by relying on a production known as that of ASCII Media Works and some interesting ideas in the construction of the quests and combat system, there is something that allows this game to remain at least impressed, as well as most likely attracting all fans of Sword Art Online. Note, however, that the whole game is spoken in Japanese with subtitles and texts translated into various languages including English but not Italian. Narrative Mobile RPG The element that tends to characterize Sword Art Online: Alicization Rising Steel more than other mobile RPGs with gacha elements is certainly the continuous and pervasive narrative, which manages to compact the experience in a game with a structure that is otherwise a bit too schematic like that typical of this genre. Also in this case it is a question of carrying out quests placed in sequence which are essentially series of clashes to be completed, usually with a boss at the end, collecting the loot and advancing the experience of the party fighters. However, everything is placed within a constant narrative, which takes up the narrative arc of Alicization but also digresses into other areas of Sword Art Online, doing a good job of introducing even those who are new to the series to the story. This excellent narrative substrate is probably the game's greatest strength, together with the enormous amount of drawings and animations taken directly from the anime series. The combat system is all based on the use of special techniques and Incarnate Skills, particularly powerful and decisive moves that can be performed by loading a bar for each character, while trying to prevent the enemy from being able to perform them as well. This triggers a certain strategic approach in the use of skills that increase one's bar or decrease that of the opponent, even with the need to modify the attack order of the characters in the party in order to ring the sequence of moves ideal for this scope. The Incarnates can also be performed in a coordinated manner between the various members of the group with different and particularly spectacular effects, also considering the animations taken from those typical of the series. In short, there are some good ideas in the combat system, but the fact of being able to switch to autoplay anyway tends to eliminate this positive aspect, also because the quantity and repetitiveness of the standard fights makes the use of the automatic game practically mandatory. For the rest, beyond a bizarre setting in the exploratory phases, in which we move the character in a 2D crossroads structure, the mechanism is the standard one of this type of game, moreover with a drop rate of the characters that also seems dangerously low in the gacha phase (the ~scout~ of the fighters), pushing quite clearly towards the micro-transactions in order to get some chance of receiving characters from four stars up, i.e. the much more effective and powerful ones. This is perhaps the most problematic element of Sword Art Online: Alicization Rising Steel, which otherwise does not present particular problems even in the consumption of energy necessary to carry out the quests or in receiving in-game currency, given the abundance of loot.", "date": "2019-12-02", "grade": "6.8"}
