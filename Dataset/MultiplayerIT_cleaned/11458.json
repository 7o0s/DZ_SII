{"name": "Ping Pong Champion", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ping-pong-champion.html", "text": "It was back in 1972 when Atari released the first video game in history in coin-op format: Pong. Based on extremely simple graphics, the game had us controlling a ~racket~ with the aim of repelling the ~ball~ and making it land in the opponent's half. A basic concept, enriched by the possibility of directing shots according to the movement of the racket. Over the years, the video game market has gone from Pong to arcade games, from home computers to consoles, from pixels to polygons, and so on. In short, we could say that everything was born with ping pong, and that the simulations dedicated to this sport are not as numerous as one might expect. In the mobile field, in particular, there isn't a huge choice within the genre, and the Chinese developers of Fugumobile have every intention of remedying this. From the outset, Ping Pong Champion presents itself as a product with a simple structure: the only game mode available sees us select a nation from among the eight available, and then participate in the final stages of a knockout tournament. To win we will have to defeat a series of opponents in sequence, using a first person view and handling the racket in a three-dimensional context. Being able to hit the ball doesn't turn out to be an easy task, and in fact the first few games serve to become familiar with the various ~measures~ we are dealing with. Once we understand the mechanism, we will be able to concentrate on how to hit: moving the racket forward, therefore aiming for the long shot, or hitting ~edged~, to displace the opponent. We will have to manage the racket using only the joystick, moving it sideways or in depth, while some keys will allow us to determine the type of shot we intend to perform. In practice, this turns out to be rather difficult and cumbersome, unless you have a practical and sensitive input system. We are well aware that the vast majority of mobile phones cannot boast these characteristics, therefore starting with Ping Pong Champion soon proves to be difficult, cumbersome and frustrating ... The technical realization, as one might expect from such a product, is essential. The first person view allows us to see the ping pong table in perspective, and the path of the ball appears surprisingly clear and visible. To understand its position, however, it is advisable to rely on its shadow, and then position the racket accordingly. The players are not present, there are only the two rackets that move in mid-air and change angle according to the area in which they are. There's a good use of colors and good definition, but the backdrops leave a lot to be desired: no animated elements, little detail. As far as the sound is concerned, we have some poor quality MIDI music, which adds nothing to the action and is therefore largely deactivated. Finally, the control system was thought out really badly. The racket is controlled completely by the joystick, without any ~help~ in its correct positioning. This often translates into a minimum precision, which perhaps could have been remedied by eliminating the movement in depth and finding different solutions to detect collisions.
