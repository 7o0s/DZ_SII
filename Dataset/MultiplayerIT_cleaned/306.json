However, the British publisher held all the rights to the series and absolutely did not want to deprive one of the most successful brands in its history by entrusting the heavy legacy to the semi-unknown programmers of Beautiful Game Studios who, after two not exactly exciting editions, finally this he year seem to have taken the right path to maintain the prestige of a more than ten-year-old series. User Friendly As soon as we have received the welcome from the management, Scudetto 2007 puts us at ease with an interface that is even more friendly and versatile than past editions, capable of saving us a good number of clicks thanks to the possibility of always calling up a menu with various items and sub-options. But all Eidos production is user friendly, starting with the explanations for each button and icon that appear automatically simply by holding the mouse pointer still for a few seconds. This becomes even more evident during the transfer market when, and we take the liberty of adding ~finally~, the other team will advise us on an adequate amount to offer in order to try and buy the champion of our desires. Afterwards it will always be up to us to try to bring the prized piece under our banners at the most convenient price during the negotiation, but still having a reference price will be much more convenient. Communicate, communicate, communicate A new peculiar aspect of the Scudetto will concern the relationship between the coach and the players. At each start of the game, during the interval and at the end of the match, we will be able to choose from a series of phrases to address to the team as well as other specifics that we can say privately to our men individually if we wish: frankly, it is difficult to understand how much the choice of the right sentence affects the smooth running of a meeting but undoubtedly simulating in some way the famous ~locker room~ is an appreciable touch of class. Human resource management will also have much more relevance when renewing contracts: it will no longer be just an economic issue but also a matter of promises to keep with the player. So if you propose to a strong young Brazilian to be the first striker and then relegate him to fifth striker, don't be surprised if you can't convince him to stay in your team (any reference to real events is purely coincidental...). Also inevitable is the presence of the media which will have a greater link with the events in which our team will have been the protagonist. somehow simulating the famous ~locker room~ is an appreciable touch of class ProZone Another exclusive feature of which the programmers of Beautiful Game Studios are very proud concerns the implementation within Championship Manager of the football analysis tool called Pro Zone and which seems to be used by some well-known trainers from across the Channel such as Alex Ferguson of Manchester United and Arsene Wenger, trainer of Arsenal (with that name who else could have coached???). Pro Zone gives us the opportunity to re-analyze a match played from various perspectives such as the passing areas or where the greatest concentrations of fouls and many, many other parameters took place. Probably not all Scudetto players will use this extra but undoubtedly the hardcore gamers of football management will find it a real nirvana of their irrepressible desire for parameters and statistics to take into consideration to better optimize the team. Lights at the San Siro To try to move away from the works of Sports Interactive, Beautiful Game Studios already last year had begun the work of ~beautification~ of the graphic representation of the matches. In this new edition, it can only reproduce the use of a 3D graphics engine that is more pleasing to the eye than in Championship Manager 2006. Let it be clear, we are also a long way from the graphic quality of a Football Manager Championship 2007 for example, given that the players are still heavily stylized but already having the possibility of being able to choose the view with which to observe the game is undoubtedly an interesting aspect. The insertion of a configurable filter should also be commendedfile for the main actions to be displayed and also a ~fast forward~ button that can be activated and deactivated at any time. However, the 3D engine does not involve major changes in the hardware requirements which remain decidedly ~popular~ given that it will be sufficient to have a PC equipped with a 1 GHz processor, 256 MB of ram, 16 MB of video memory and 400 MB of free space on hard disk to play with Scudetto without any problem. having the possibility of being able to choose the view with which to observe the game is undoubtedly an interesting aspect Conclusions After two editions in which he had to metabolize a heavy legacy, Beautiful Game Studios finally manages to give a precise imprint to Scudetto - Championship Manager instead of attempting a bankruptcy run-up to the unrivaled simulation complexity of Sports Interactive. In this way the production of Eidos turns out to be a complete but truly user-friendly managerial, able to never leave the player lost and make him happy with interesting features such as the possibility of immediately training even a national team, managing in an unprecedented way locker room and have fun with the thousands of statistics that can be obtained from the Pro Zone professional tool. Finally, the future of the Scudetto is mapped out and the three-dimensional proto-engine with which matches are managed can only evolve from year to year. It will no longer be the point of reference for ~hardcore~ managers but finally Championship Manager has recovered from the inferiority syndrome with Football Manager and begins to spread its wings towards new perspectives. Pros Dynamic interface, user friendly and as pleasant as ever Simple but intriguing dressing room management Use of a three-dimensional match management engine... Cons ...but the graphics are still ~prehistoric~ Sports Interactive is at another level for simulation complexity Difficult to regain the trust of users Yes the referee blows his whistle, it's a penalty ~Boskovian~ quote to point out how any football manager, as far as variations on the theme may be proposed, is focused on the management and good performance of a team and clearly Scudetto 2007 could not be an exception. From the moment of choosing one's team, however, we immediately feel a pleasant novelty: the possibility of immediately coaching, in addition to a club team, also a national team with the peculiar characteristics that are typical of a recruiter. In terms of the database, updated at the end of August, the title distributed in Italy by Leader stands out for a very high number of championships available (as always, we will be able to select as many as we want with a direct proportion to the loading times which, in any case, in this new edition are significantly improved): as far as our country is concerned, it goes up to and including the C-2 series.", "date": "2006-10-31", "grade": null}
