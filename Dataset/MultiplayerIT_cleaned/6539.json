{"name": "Groove Stellari", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/145853-planet-quest-groove-stellari.html", "text": "Although it is often used as a convenient container for any game in which the music is not just a simple accompaniment, the rhythm game genre is actually like a two-sided moon. On one side (the one that now seems more and more like the 'dark side') there is a line made of plastic peripherals, colored buttons, tambourines, guitar adapters and everything needed to simulate real instruments and make the player feel a real jam session of musicians. Developed by the London team OutOfTheBit, Planet Quest is instead part of the other side. That of Patapon, PaRappa the Rapper, Space Channel 5 and Rhythm Paradise. Among these, perhaps it is precisely in Kazuyoshi Osawa's musical paradise that the most evident similarities are found: a simple experience that enters the head and stimulates an irrepressible and physical desire to keep time with one's foot. Like when you hum in the shower or drum your fingers on the steering wheel of your car while listening to the radio. Colorful and bubbly, Planet Quest is an absolutely perfect music game in its simplicity Disk-Space Openly inspired by the Katamari series, Planet Quest inherits the nonsense inclination from Keita Takahashi's madness, with a funny, colorful premise that doesn't take itself at all seriously. Wacky costumed characters dance to the rhythm of music around a planet, and the player, controlling a small UFO, must capture them with a beam as they pass under the ship. The mechanics to keep in mind can be counted on an alien's hand with three fingers: one, with a touch on the screen the beam is fired; two, you lose a little heart if you miss or hit a flower; three, health is restored to each character hit. The aim is therefore to go as much as possible in time with the music, trying to chain perfect touches to increase the multiplier and take the score to the stars. Considering that the UFO remains motionless, some might think that just tapping the screen following the rhythm is too little for an interesting gameplay, but once you start playing you quickly realize that Planet Quest is perfect the way it is. ~Scratching~ the planet as if it were a DJ console or adding some other input would have only engulfed an essential and effective formula. After all, the rest is done by the music. Martian music! In a rhythm game like Planet Quest, even the best of designs collapse miserably if it's not accompanied by a selection of music to match. Fortunately, the team's composer, Simon Haines, has done an outstanding job on the audio front. Each of the eight planets is characterized by a unique musical theme, ranging between very different genres but which are packaged so as not to seem like a jumble of incoherent songs. From the fun and cheerful reggae level to the sudden changes of rhythm of the drum & bass planet, passing through the mesmerizing and deceptive heavy metal piece, every player will find his favorite two or three planets, but each song is memorable and extremely dynamic. As the score increases and the levels progress, the music gets faster, the metronome goes crazy and it becomes increasingly difficult to keep up with it, until the inevitability of game over reveals the position reached in the world rankings. However, one of the most surprising aspects of Planet Quest is the fact that, although there are ~only~ eight songs, they always seem fresh with each new game. The developers of OutOfTheBit have in fact set up a music tracking system called SongBird, which creates remixes on the fly and synchronizes everything with the graphic effects and sequences of the characters. This means that each piece maintains its main riff, but each time it is proposed in a slightly different way. In this way, songs that are recognizable enough to allow the user to improve and chain increasingly longer combos are faced, but which are never too much the same as to risk becoming bored. At this point someone could make the mistake of thinking that, with a good soundtrack and mechanics that work, the aesthetics of a rhythm game take a back seat. And yet, Planet Quest wouldn't be the little pearl that has arrived on the App Store without the lively presentation curated by Alessandro Motisi and Arnaud De Bock. The music by Haines and the dynamism of the SongBird system go hand in hand with the excellent vector graphics designed thanks to Stork, the proprietary engine that the team uses to create sprites and backdrops directly on the iPad. Each level is made unique as much by the music as by the colors of the scenery or the appearance of the planets. One cannot help but feel sympathy for the smileyand reggae world, while some levels change color every time you hit (or miss) a target. Between psychedelic flashes and continuous zoom-in and zoom-out, each challenge is pulsating and lively, forcing you to sharpen your eyes when the camera moves away, or to be ready when it gets too close. Overall it's a thrilling experience, fast and never really predictable, with the player trying to keep pace as if his toe were directly connected to the foot that stamps on the ground.", "date": "2015-02-26", "grade": "9.0"}
