After trying the initial stages of it, we finally received the complete code of the game which we stripped in the hope of confirming the good first impressions. The genre of three-dimensional platformers doesn't enjoy much fame nowadays, especially on PCs where big names like Mario, Jak and Dexter or Banjo Kazooie are missing, just to name a few at random. Also for this reason The Last Tinker: City of Colors is definitely welcome in a videogame landscape often considered a bit flat and above all gray. The title Mimimi freely takes inspiration from some big names in the genre, in some cases even quoting them, proposing a colorful mix of successful and fun elements. Thanks to a delightful introductory video we discover how in the world of colors green, red and blue are no longer able to coexist, divided by fears and misunderstandings. The evil monochrome takes advantage of it, intent on transforming everything into a sad black and white. The narrator introduces us to Koru, our protagonist, a kind monkey who lives in his small town, still safe from the invasion of monochrome. He doesn't know it but he is the last of the Tinkers, destined to restore balance to Tinkerworld. The plot is colorful and fun, full of adorable if a little childish ~cuddly~ characters. In general, the title seems aimed at an audience of very young people, but not that little fun for the older ones. Although it is an independent production, the total localization of the textual part in Italian is also pleasing. The creatures of Tinkerworld have no voice and as in the Nintendo classics, they express themselves in verses translated into comics to read. Discover this amazing and colorful platform adventure! Blend of genres The gameplay, as far as it starts from the basic rules of the genre, draws heavily from other videogame types. Koru moves freely in the three-dimensional world, but in the first platforming section we notice the absence of the dedicated jump button. Our hero moves like the protagonists of Assassin's Creed, given that by holding down the right trigger (or the space bar if you choose to play with the mouse and keyboard) Koru will start shooting and when he encounters obstacles he will perform leaps and stunts in total autonomy assorted, like a new Altair. Despite this drift, the title manages to offer interesting platform sections, shuffling the cards on the table with respect to Ubisoft's adventures, forcing the player to study the paths and move with the right timing, on pain of numerous falls that make you lose part of your life. Once this is finished, you will be forced to restart from the last checkpoint. The result is a sort of partially automatic parkour that doesn't make us feel out of control, for a result that works very well. But The Last Tinker has so much more to give. Koru is in fact able to assert himself in the fray, with punches and kung-fu blows. In fact, with a violence that is still toned down, the game offers real hand-to-hand combat, designed along the lines of Rocksteady's Batman. With simple combos we will be able to get the better of our opponents, who will often attack us in even large groups. We will be able to take advantage of using the dodge but it will be when we get the powers of the colors that the system will acquire a certain thickness. The three primary colors, in search of help, will give us their powers, and with them the ability to face increasingly aggressive monochromatic creatures. For example, hitting them with green-enhanced punches will make them run away, while red will cause more trivial damage and blue will make them fall asleep, thus leaving us time to launch a lethal attack from behind. The enemy creatures are of various types and if the first ones encountered as per tradition will not worry Koru too much, we will soon come into contact with particular bad guys, who will require specific approaches, on pain of defeat. It's time to use your brain The Last Tinker is not only made up of platforms and fights, but offers a whole series of increasingly complex environmental puzzles with a decidedly successful design. Taking advantage of the colors and the nice Biggs, the levels will often require the use of gray matter in order to be completed. Biggs is a mushroom, our big and somewhat dumb friend who will faithfully follow Koru's orders. We will thus be able to use it in different ways, for example to press a button and open a passage for us, or ride it to break through some obstacles. Furthermore, this cute mushroom is also capable of changing shape and becoming small and eexplosive, thus introducing a further ingredient used in puzzles. These are well thought out, sufficiently complex especially as you advance in the adventure, when the possibilities granted, unlocked a little at a time, will be used all together in sometimes really large and demanding levels. A certain threshold of difficulty is never exceeded, however offering an adequate challenge, sufficient to make the player feel intelligent and satisfied every time he finds the solution. The initial fear was that the gameplay could suffer from a certain repetitiveness, but Mimimi was able to package the playful offer of The Last Tinker, revealing the different features of the game a little at a time, thus enriching the experience, capable of renewing itself enough to entice the user to move forward, to solve the last puzzle using the newly obtained power, to fight a new monster to see what the evil monochrome will throw at him next. There's no shortage of boss fights, and there's even lightning-fast escapes over ropes suspended in full Sonic style! Unity in Technicolor! Developed thanks to the Unity engine, increasingly popular in the independent field, The Last Tinker boasts a really well done aesthetic sector. A colorful style makes the world through which we will lead Koru seem really made of paper, color and glue. Textures and polygonal models have been carefully studied to create the sensation of looking at walls painted with crayons or houses cut out with scissors. Although the player will find himself exploring worlds of all colors, a greater variety in the creation of the environments, a little too similar to each other, unfortunately, would not have hurt. Another note we take the liberty of making to the animations, not always at the level of an otherwise excellent graphic sector. Unity is a light and scalable engine and although The Last Tinker allows itself to lose a few frames even on very performing configurations, it always remains well above 30 frames per second. If visually we are faced with a truly remarkable title, it is in the music that it manages to express all its personality. In fact, the composer has created very personal scores, which blend perfectly with the atmosphere of the game, with even arrangements able to change based on what is happening on the screen, for example by adding pressing percussion in case you are surprised by monochromatic enemies during our quiet exploration. The control system supports the pad, recommended although The Last Tinker also lets you play perfectly with the mouse and keyboard, also adopting whimsical solutions in the mapping of the commands. We close by mentioning longevity, certainly not excellent given that the end will be reached in a handful of hours, but we are talking about a title sold on Steam for around 20, a figure more than adequate for the level of entertainment and the quality of the product.", "date": "2014-05-09", "grade": "8.0"}
