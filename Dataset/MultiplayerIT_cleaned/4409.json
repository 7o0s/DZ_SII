However, it is a serious mistake not to give Bayonetta the attention it deserves: Kamiya's work (the second chapter is by Hashimoto, even if the good Hideki supervised the work) is a direct evolution of the Devil May Cry mechanics, remains an extraordinary action, and is one with its continuation on a narrative level, to the point that the two chapters are perhaps even more enjoyable if played one after the other. Not only that, Kamiya's touch is also seen in terms of gameplay, since his work is less chaotic and caciarona than that of Hashimoto, albeit inferior overall. The arrival of the complete package on Switch therefore makes us rejoice a lot, with only a few minor doubts to obscure our happiness, including the actual quality of the port of both chapters. The original title then, as we have already written, boasts a PC version with all the trimmings to support it, which we recovered before analyzing the one dedicated to Nintendo's innovative hybrid console. So will this new version really be the definitive one of the game? No angels allowed We'll answer right away, without going around it unnecessarily: no. The reason is to be found in the graphic settings of the PC version, for obvious reasons absent here, and in the lack of a customizable configuration of the keys on Switch - a legacy of the WiiU version that we do not understand (also because the position of the targeting key has been changed in Bayonetta 2 precisely because of its inconvenience, and we expected at least an alternative option in the controls). However, on Switch Bayonetta is still a respectable title, and indeed it is incredibly fluid, at an absolutely granite 60 fps in both the docked and portable versions. To be clear, Bayonetta 2 on tablet does not always keep up with these rhythms and has perceptible drops even by a player with an untrained eye; the first Bayonetta, on the other hand, never seemed to sob, even in the most agitated situations. In short, here too the work done focused 100% on fluidity, with little consideration dedicated to the rest of the technical sector, and apparently very few changes to the appearance of the WiiU version. The end result is a straightforward port that's not particularly busy, but at least flawless and free of issues, bringing the original experience back to Switch without a hitch. And this is still a fabulous experience, since the first Bayonetta - albeit weaker on a narrative level than its sequel - is still a stupendous title, endowed with an incredible finesse, and closely linked to the design philosophy of its creator (a perfectionist who in almost every title of his aims at replayability and at creating systems that are very difficult to master in full). Obtaining pure platinum medals in any situation is really difficult during the campaign, and requires perfect memorization of enemy patterns, combined with cyborg reflexes. However, the game is rarely unfair in its assessments and errors are always caused by the player, whereas in Bayonetta 2 it can sometimes seem that it is the general chaos that unleashes them, rather than the skills of the player. In short, it is a more concentrated title than its sequel, less dispersive and bombastic, but also more suitable for perfectionists, which represents an extraordinary evolutionary step for the entire genre. Seeing it on Switch in this version can only make us happy. Ah, clearly even here there are still the extra costumes inspired by Nintendo titles (which also boast some unique mechanical features), and the internal achievement system called ~tears of Umbra~, given that the Kyoto house has not yet determined to create a global one. Finally, no extra content, in line with the development team's plans, clearly eager to bring the original without too many novelties and risks. The cost of the game (lower than that of its sequel) is therefore quite adequate, while remaining high for a product dating back to 2010.", "date": "2018-02-14", "grade": "8.4"}
