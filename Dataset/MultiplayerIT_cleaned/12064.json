{"name": "The Sims: Pet Stories - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-sims-pet-stories-recensione.html", "text": "Puppies what a passion The game modes in The Sims: Pet Stories, in addition to the classic and exhaustive tutorial, include two stories entitled: ~N1 of the exhibition~ and ~Masquerade~. There is also a free mode that allows you to take control of one of the many families of Sims in the neighborhood or to create one from scratch. All in all, the two stories available prove to be pleasant to play, even if between personal tasks and chores to do, one gets the impression that time is never enough to do everything we would like. In addition to avoiding starvation or sleep, we will also have to keep the house tidy and at the same time look after our pets, who, especially at the beginning, will be very good at creating endless problems. If that's not enough, there will also be Sims' wishes to be fulfilled within a certain time frame that encompasses the entire story. To help us there will be an extremely efficient interface that allows for example to let the Sim rest with the simple pressure of a button and without even clicking on the bed or sofa. This is certainly a valid and welcome introduction, but which perhaps makes the game a little too simple. In fact, those who have tried The Sims 2 or one of its expansions may find this episode limited and in some ways not worth the purchase, also considering the price at which it is sold (35 ). On the other hand, those who have never approached the series will find the simplified game scheme and the amusing situations in which the protagonists will go hunting pleasant. Within everyone's reach Technically The Sims: Pet Stories offers the same game engine as The Sims 2, without obvious improvements on the graphics front. While this allows the title to run on any PC purchased from 2004 onwards, a few more details capable of exploiting the computing power of modern computers would have been welcome. The game, like the others belonging to this series, is completely independent from The Sims 2 and therefore does not require any other product of the series to work. In addition to this, the title does not integrate with others that may already be present on the hard disk and does not allow you to use its contents, nor to create new ones. System requirements Minimum Requirements: Processor: Pentium IV 1.8 GHz or AMD equivalent RAM: 256 MB Video Card: GeForce 3 with 32 MB Ram Disk Space: 2.7 GB Recommended Requirements: Processor: Pentium IV 2.8 GHz or AMD equivalent RAM: 512 MB Video Card: Geforce or Radeon with 128 MB of memory Test Configuration: Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo 1.66 GHz processor RAM: 2 GB DDR2 Video Card: Geforce 7300 with 256 MB of memory Comment The Sims: Pet Stories offers a tested and pleasant game scheme, but at the same time made a little too simple by the need to approach mainly those who are new to The Sims. The stories featured in the two episodes are quite entertaining and leave some choices in the player's hands without major upheavals regarding the ending. The graphics are the same already seen in 2004, with all the strengths and weaknesses that this entails. Pros Pleasant stories to play Very practical interface There are cats and dogs Cons Outdated graphics Gameplay too simplified Price a bit high compared to the contents The Sims series since its first appearance, dating back to 2000, has evolved a lot over the years, thanks to an exceptional second chapter, the many expansions and above all the contents created by millions of fans all over the world. While waiting for the third episode already announced by Electronic Arts and Maxis, there are several complete and mini-format expansions, in addition to the separate Stories trilogy. These three games introduced a storyline into the life of the Sims for the first time, which unfolds through a long series of small tasks to perform. The Sims: Pet Stories is the second of three episodes (the third, Island Stories is scheduled for early 2008) and focuses on pets.", "date": "2007-08-10", "grade": null}
