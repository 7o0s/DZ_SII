{"name": "My Hero Academia: The Strongest Hero", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/my-hero-academia-the-strongest-hero-recensione.html", "text": "The review of My Hero Academia: The Strongest Hero takes us back to the scenario created by Kohei Horikoshi for the My Hero Academia manga: a world where 80% of people are born with special powers, the so-called Quirks, which differ according to of the subject. Some decide to exploit these abilities for good and become part of the Hero category, while others dedicate themselves to crime by becoming Villains. The oldest of the oppositions is therefore represented in a schematic and pre-established way, in MHA. Among the aspiring heroes we find the protagonist of the story, Izuki Midoriya: a big fan of the legendary All Might, who would like to become just like him and manages to get admitted to the prestigious school for superheroes, Yuuei high school. The game tells us about these events in the animated introduction, and then involves us with a series of increasingly complex missions. Structure My Hero Academia: The Strongest Hero will see us running around looking for weird dudes to get new missions. Izuki is therefore the first character that we will be able to control in My Hero Academia: The Strongest Hero, but of course not the only one: the structure of the game refers to the gacha tradition and provides us with a roster made up of thirteen heroes, which we will have to unlock as we complete the missions. Having completed a short tutorial, we will be able to select the appropriate item from the menu to reach the next objective, manually or completely automatically, and therefore limit ourselves to reading the dialogues or actually leave for an assignment that it always consists in confronting criminals, defeating them and bringing them to justice. My Hero Academia: The Strongest Hero tends to automate several aspects of the gameplay, such as the exploration of the scenarios. The lack of a localization in Italian and an interface at first very confusing, close to that of Asian MMOs, unfortunately quickly extinguish any desire to follow the plot, which boasts only vague references to Horikoshi's work, focusing rather on always giving us meal something to do but with a strong basis of repetitiveness. The single player missions and the cooperative sections are the ones with the greatest potential, whereas the automated competitive clashes leave a little the time they find. The modes are activated gradually, leveling up, but after a few hours even the freemium mechanisms begin to make their weight felt, trying to push us towards microtransactions in a quite evident way. Gameplay My Hero Academia: The Strongest Hero boasts truly spectacular fights. It's a great pity, because on the gameplay front My Hero Academia: The Strongest Hero can count on a solid and spectacular combat system, with some problems related to camera management (in the options it is possible to adjust it, however) but a good yield of impacts and a truly spectacular set of maneuvers at our disposal. The first characters are unlocked rather quickly, so we find ourselves able to manage a fairly heterogeneous group, with heroes specialized in close-quarters or distance battles, each endowed with which are very well represented on the screen. It's a pity that the buttons are a bit too small, in particular the fundamental one dedicated to dodging: performing it perfectly creates a bullet time in which we can inflict a lot of damage on the opponent on duty. My Hero Academia: The Strongest Hero provides each character with various special moves. Going around enemies, hooking them and unloading our entire repertoire of moves on them is undoubtedly fun and one turns a blind eye to the lack of sophisticated artificial intelligence precisely because of the abundance of available maneuvers, each regulated by a cooldown, and for the upgrading system to be managed between one shipment and another. All these aspects can be automated using the appropriate button: a requirement that frankly we still do not understand, but which evidently is convenient for some users to continue the experience even when maybe they have other things to do; without playing, drawing satisfaction only from the progress made net of the available resources and the objects or characters obtained in the meantime. Technical realization If the structure and gameplay are typical of many mobile MMORPGs, with the inevitable automatisms, the repetitiveness of missions that are always the same and the gacha elements, it certainly cannot be said that the developers have not supported this system with an adequate technical implementation. The graphics of My Hero Academia: The Strongest Hero is indeed excellent, impreziosite by a well-implemented cel shading that captures the atmosphere of the animated series in the best possible way. In short, characters and scenarios look great, the settings allow you to improve the general quality (but with everything maxed out and 60 fps the game struggles even on an iPhone 12 Pro) and, in general, the world of MHA is recreated in a very convincing way. It is therefore a pity here too that the developers have not in the least considered the idea of making navigation between locations interesting, given that it too ends up being automated.", "date": "2021-05-25", "grade": "7.0"}
