{"name": "Ape Escape 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ape-escape-2_b.html", "text": "The gadget corner The player starts from the Professor and Natsumi's base, where he can choose whether to enter levels (completing one grants access to the next), save the game, use a coin-operated Bonus machine, the Trainer, mini-games or the relax area~. It is a must to describe this section of Ape Escape 2 in detail, because on balance it constitutes much more than an extra to the normal game levels. Each stage contains numerous gold coins, which you can use to operate the Bonus machine we just talked about. It is one of those contraptions in which you insert a coin (ten, in this case) and turn a knob to release a plastic ball with a ~gift~ inside. This is exactly how it works, but in the ball you will find, from time to time, many different things: ~photographs~ of the enemies, preparatory artwork, amusing comics of the protagonists, ~monkey fairy tales~, general knowledge notes, mini-games, biscuits (which represent your energy) and many other things. The Trainer is a simulator that allows you to understand the functioning of the gadgets you are equipped with (and which will increase from level to level), while in the ~relax area~ you can enjoy all the extras you have won through the Bonus machine (films, music, etc.). Finally, the mini-games can also be unlocked via the Bonus machine, and represent a nice variant of the ~normal~ game. The first of them follows the mechanics of Parappa The Rapper, and does it quite well. Levels and control system Gamers who haven't had the opportunity to try the first Ape Escape will find themselves a bit taken aback by the original control system with which the game is equipped. It is only a passing sensation, however, which fades with a little practice. Hikaru's movement is delegated to the left analog stick, while the right analog stick allows you to use the currently activated item. It is possible to have four objects ~available~ at the same time, to be assigned to the respective keys (X, Circle, Square and Triangle), but the assignment can be changed simply by pressing Select and choosing other objects. You start with just a stick and the monkey-catching net, to which dozens of other tools are soon added: the monkey radar (which lets you know where to go in the various levels, as well as giving you valuable information about the little animals that you must capture), the slingshot, the ~bananarang~, the radio-controlled car, etc. etc. The shoulder keys are used to jump (R1 and R2, interchangeably), center the virtual camera (L1), or activate a first person view (L2). Let's say that you will use L1 very often, and you will not fail to throw curses when you have to face fast battles, due to the particular management of the camera. Let's go in order, though. At the beginning of each level you will be told how many monkeys you need to catch to complete it. As soon as you have succeeded, you will be automatically transported to your base, but you can return to already ~finished~ levels to capture the remaining monkeys and therefore complete them 100%. Often, however, to do this you will have to wait for particular objects to be given to you. For example, in the first level you will see an atypical version of the ~Statue of Liberty~, with a monkey working on it, and you can only capture it by dropping it with your slingshot (which you don't have in the first levels, though). This system maximizes the replayability of the stages, while also adding a certain depth to the game. Technical judgement The execution of Ape Escape 2 is excellent, and in practice there are no technical aspects of the game open to criticism. The animation of the characters is very well done, as are the drawings and the realization of the levels. The monkeys are very nice, and in some cases it really reaches an unimaginable level of dementia. If in other games localization in Italian can be considered an accessory element, albeit a welcome introduction, in Ape Escape 2 dubbing is an integral part of the game: even the effects, in addition to the countless speeches, are in Italian and well recited. All texts, even the comic balloons, are translated into Italian. Even the demented song of one of the Five Monstrous Monkeys (a parody of a Japanese idol) is sung in Italian! In short, hats off to the curators of the local edition of the game, who have really shown that they are professionals, capable of creating a high-level product. To qualitysome sound effects contrast with catchy music which I would define only as functional for the game, given that it does not shine for a particular compositional quality. Concluding... Ape Escape 2 is a game to have, no question about it. The excellent technical realization, combined with the high quality localization and the excellent game structure, make it a product that everyone will like, without distinction. If we really want to find fault with this title, it is the management of the virtual camera, which is a bit of a potential thorn in the side of any three-dimensional game. In this case, the camera does not follow the character and must be centered frequently. If this does not cause any problems during explorations, the situation changes when you have to face a fight with a fast opponent, and in that case you will find yourself in difficulty. It is, however, a secondary element, compared to the overall quality of the game. Highly recommended. Pros: Well-crafted graphics Cartoony feeling Excellent game structure Countless extras to conquer Cons: ~Awkward~ management of the view Too funny! Hikaru, Natsumi and the cute Pipotchi (a baby monkey) are enjoying a period of peace after the events of the first Ape Escape. By mistake, however, a huge supply of shorts intended for monkeys is shipped together with numerous monkey helmets, and the evil Specter takes possession of them. At this point the past repeats itself: thanks to his control over hundreds of monkeys, Specter tries to put the world in turmoil! At the commands of Hikaru, you will have to go to the twenty levels that make up the game and capture a certain number of monkeys, also confronting the fearsome Five Monstrous Monkeys. The game places a huge emphasis on replayability of the stages, because to pass them you just need to catch a certain number of monkeys, but to complete them 100% you will have to find all these crazy little animals!", "date": "2003-03-12", "grade": null}
