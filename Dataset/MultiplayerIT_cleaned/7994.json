In the case of Die Hard here, we are faced with a tie-in that relies on the mechanics of the most popular genre of the moment - that of the endless runners - and which gives way to another sign of the times, namely the in-app purchases. Let's see if it is a formula that works or if it is necessary to resort to the most classic of ~it was better when it was worse~... A tank top and go Despite belonging to a hyper-abused genre of recent times, Die Hard does not rest too much on the stylistic features of the category, putting at least fun and even moderately original gameplay on the plate. The protagonist is Jack McLane, who must be led by the user through scenarios fraught with enemies and obstacles, pursuing the typical goal of endless runners, which is to get as far as possible. As in a thousand other similar titles, along the way there are coins and power-ups to be collected, which can serve to make the race easier: the differences with respect to the mass lie in the markedly shooter setting given to the whole, and a first testimony in this sense comes from a slightly more complex command scheme. A swipe to the right or to the left allows Jack to change the lane of his gait, while the same gesture made up or down allows respectively to jump or to reload the weapon in use. Performing taps on the screen, on the other hand, represents the way to shoot the enemies in front of you, with score bonuses that reward faster or more precise shots; finally, the accumulation of kills fills an indicator that signals Jack's special ability, a variant on the classic bullet time theme useful for eliminating multiple targets without too much effort. Despite not having very great ambitions, therefore, Die Hard knows how to prove to be a pleasant pastime, managing to combine the winning characteristics that are intrinsic to the genre to which it belongs with a successful shooting range nuance, all benefiting from a more than decent graphic realization. To give a more convincing sense of progression to a title that would otherwise have very little, the developers then abounded in the contents relating to the upgrades that can be unlocked in a special section accessible from the main menu: in addition to buying new outfits for Jack, the user can spend the coins earned in the various game sessions to increase the protagonist's statistics, the effectiveness of his weapons and even to activate a maximum of three multipliers to be assigned to as many slots, almost in RPG style. As happens all too often in these cases, however, soon the interference of in-app purchases becomes so insistent as to diminish the interest in anyone who is not willing to put their hands on their wallets in order to continue. Die Hard has two different types of currency, Rubles and Bucks: the former are collected during normal gameplay, while the latter can be obtained (obviously in a very reduced form) only by advancing in level. Too bad that the latter are needed to access all the more sensitive contents of the package, such as unlocking checkpoints to avoid starting from the beginning every time and even continuing the game after being killed by enemies. A detail that should not be underestimated, given that the game becomes quite challenging in the advanced stages, putting the user in front of the substantial obligation to buy some Bucks or alternatively to undergo a very unrewarding grinding to accumulate the necessary currency to continue. They are the cunning ones that can literally seal the fate of a mobile product, and in the case of Die Hard they are in fact the ones that dramatically clip its wings. Not that the title is free from other defects, of course: beyond the inevitable repetitiveness of the action, the controls do not satisfy 100% in terms of reactivity and precision, the enemies are little more than dummies, the music is mediocre and the dubbing is a genuinely embarrassing thing. All elements on which it would have been easy to overlook, if only Die Hard hadn't finally revealed itself as the most classic of money-eating applications.", "date": "2013-02-19", "grade": "6.0"}
