{"name": "Spiritfarer", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/spiritfarer-recensione.html", "text": "Spiritfarer begins with the protagonist, Stella, who is introduced to her new job by a Charon nearing retirement: she will have to ferry the spirits of the dead beyond the door to the afterlife, but not before having resolved the conflicts that torment them. To do this, you'll need to use a modular ship, which includes an aft cockpit and a buildable area on the deck. From this simple premise comes what, as we will see in the Spiritfarer review, is a surreal and fascinating adventure, which will see us travel by sea guiding the nice girl or her cat Daffodil (you can also play in cooperative), search for new spirits to take on board the ship, all linked by a thin thread that gets stronger as we discover their stories. Thunder Lotus Games, the team to which we owe Jotun and Sundered, has succeeded in creating a hybrid of genres that mixes platform, adventure and management in a very delicate way, in which each element is at the service of the melancholy tones that permeate the entire gameplay and which become more and more intense. In fact, it is immediately perceived that behind Stella there is a great unsaid, which is gradually introduced by some key sequences. Naturally, it is better to avoid any further anticipation and stop here, limiting ourselves to saying that this long experience of more than twenty hours is worth living, even if only to discover the main story. Gameplay The Spiritfarer's main activity is sea travel. The game world is a large ocean full of islets, which can be reached after selecting them as a destination on Stella's nautical chart. Note that it is not always necessary to travel the entire distance that separates us from a destination, but it is possible to take advantage of a transport service (a kind of fast journey, but with stops) to get closer and shorten the journey. Depending on the missions of the main plot or the need for raw materials, which are essential to build the buildings we will discuss later, Stella must visit practically all the islands. Some must also be explored several times, returning to them after having unlocked some powers that give access to previously unreachable areas (a not bad metroidvania touch). What is found on the islands? Trees to cut, rocks to dig, but also spirits to talk to (some are inhabited), hidden treasures, shops to buy seeds and other goods, altars that give Stella additional skills such as double jump, the ability to float, that of sliding along the ropes and more. Furthermore, some are linked to special events and represent places dear to restless spirits, while others offer self-contained mini-stories. In general there is a great variety of situations and exploration is never heavy. One hardly feels lost, as there is always something to do, even if it's just fishing while sitting in the bow of the ship, and the objectives are usually very clear. The developers have also managed the gameplay in such a way as to open up the game world gradually through a series of useful tricks to not weigh down the action. For example, some areas can only be visited after making the ship an icebreaker, but to do so you have to follow the story of one of the islanders to the end. Everything is gradual and there are always new things to discover, be it recipes to cook to satisfy the appetite of the spirits or new characters to talk to. How do you travel? As we mentioned, one of Stella's tasks will be to build buildings directly on the deck of the ship, using the materials available (or looking for them in case someone is missing). Each building has its own specific function, while falling within the general mission of giving the spirits what they are looking for in order to reconcile them with themselves and accompany them towards the great leap. In reality, their contextualization is a sibylline way of justifying one of the natures of the game, management, with a touch of stylistic originality guaranteed by the strange architectures that are created building after building: a kind of colorful and imposing patchwork made of stilt houses and long wooden stairs, which is all the more impressive for its location (the deck of a wooden ship), where a sheep pen can be erected one step from the sky and a field of fruit trees can be attached to the deck of the ship, with a brick factory above it. In addition to the buildings related to some economic activity (cooking, cultivating and production of semi-finished products), there are also special ones that serve as homes for spirits, of which they reveal the deepest nature through some comfortst and their supplementary furniture. Not all buildings can be built immediately: some are linked to the improvement of the ship, possible in a shipyard managed by an anthropomorphic shark who practices loan shark prices, or are unlocked when a new spirit becomes a passenger. Activity Most of Spiritfarer's gameplay is formed precisely by the activities to be carried out in the buildings, such as cooking, growing herbs, fruit and vegetables, building bricks, weaving, shearing, cutting logs and so on. Even some special resources are related to this strange environment, or at least see it as a theater of action. For example, to put lightning in a bottle you have to set course with the ship towards a storm and collect the lightning bolts that hit buildings with glass bottles; or in order to take a particular filament it will be necessary to help giant insects to get their children back by participating in a kind of catch on the ship. It should be noted that each activity is linked to a different mini-game: for example, to create bricks you must learn to modulate the forge using two bellows, so as to have the right heat required by the material used, while avoiding overheating it; or to cut logs you have to follow the edge of the cut with the saw, on pain of accumulating a lot of sawdust. In general they are all very easy and fast, but together they form a good variety that keeps you busy while traveling from place to place. From the point of view of graphics Spiritfarer offers a good 2D with lots of hand-drawn elements and cartoon animations at times surprising. The Thunder Lotus guys had already shown that they have great skills in this sense with Jotun and Sundered, but it is with their third work that they have reached definitive maturity, sublimely mixing the elements of animated films with those of games, without sacrificing their stylistic touch in the process. If we want to find fault with Spiritfarer, perhaps we can talk about the repetitiveness of certain activities, such as watering, which in the long run are a little tiring. Some will find it problematic to know that the progression system slightly slows down the narrative side and that sometimes you find yourself forced to spend time looking for materials when you just want to take one more step towards the conclusion of the story. After all, Stella's activity is closely linked to what happens to the characters and if the story turns out to be effective as a whole it is also because the game takes its time without rushing too much towards the end. On the other hand, the drop in quality of the writing of the last spirits is more marked. Not that they don't offer their reasons of interest, but it is clear that they are more unglued from the main story than the first ones, so much so that one suspects that they have been added in the running to lengthen the game.", "date": "2020-08-23", "grade": "9.0"}
