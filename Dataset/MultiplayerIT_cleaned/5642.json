Not even the time to archive this remaster on the flagship of the Kyoto house, that we are back in the kingdom of Hyrule, this time on Nintendo 3DS. Certainly it is a completely different situation, which has practically only the setting and characters in common with the main saga. Hyrule Warriors Legends is in fact the portable adaptation of that musou made by Omega Force which came out on Wii U a year and a half ago, reaping some success while presenting all the intrinsic limits of a genre that has evolved very little over time . Between technical compromises and new content, what will be the fate of this pocket version? Hyrule Warriors Legends is packed with content, but the technical limitations of the 3DS are too much of an obstacle Help from the Cocc Hyrule Warriors Legends was born with the aim of reproducing the experience lived on Wii U in the most faithful way possible, and for this reason Koei Tecmo wanted to keep the game mechanics of the original practically intact. An at least ambitious project, since the title released at the end of 2014 found a fundamental element in the technical component to convey and enhance its qualities; the hundreds of enemies on the screen, to be faced almost always alone, in fact gave an epic scale to the clashes capable of partially compensating for the modest depth of the gameplay itself. More generally, however, the Japanese label has decided to send a very clear signal to Nintendo 3DS users, reassuring them about the fears of being faced with a reduced or castrated version: Hyrule Warriors Legends, on the contrary, condenses in its small cartridge not only all the original content of the Wii U version, not only all the DLC released post-launch, but also adds a good amount from scratch especially for the occasion. In fact, only the Boss Pack and the two-player local multiplayer mode were sacrificed, which already put the most performing home console hardware on the rope by imposing a drop in frame rate and resolution. A very rich package, to which are added exclusive contents that find the most interesting aspect in the campaign of five brand new missions starring Linkle, a Cocc breeder who is however convinced that she is the female reincarnation of the Hero of Time . A character with a not particularly relevant thickness, but fun to use thanks to the crossbows supplied, his speed and the support of the Cocc as allies instead of soldiers. The plot also in this case remains very weak (despite the presence of Skull Kid), but this is certainly not the predominant aspect in such a title. As if that weren't enough, after the conclusion of the missions present in the original on Wii U, 4 more inspired by The Wind Waker were included, thus bringing the total to 32 levels compared to 23 on the home console. Also created specifically for the occasion is the My Fairy mode, which basically translates into a sort of fairy management system: these can be made to grow and customized by modifying skills, characteristics and even clothing, and then be brought into battle to enjoy of benefits and bonuses of various kinds. The 3D effect The 3D of Hyrule Warriors Legends is not particularly incisive, which in the often flat and rather desolate game settings does not find great support to enrich the experience, thus limiting itself to adding a little sense of depth. All this, however, at the expense of the frame rate: nothing dramatic is clear, but it is quite evident that the graphics engine struggles more with the slider activated than when it is off. Too much effort Also with regard to the gameplay there have been some adjustments and novelties: mind you, nothing transcendental or capable of alleviating the inevitable repetitiveness that has always been synonymous with the musou genre, but in any case these are changes that are well integrated into the original mechanics of the Wii U version. The most effective is undoubtedly the ability to instantly switch to control one of the allies present on the battlefield by simply touching the relative icon on the touch screen. Alternatively, the same companions can be directed to specific points on the map, which becomes useful for providing support to garrisons in difficulty or for joining forces against more difficult enemies and bosses. A further favored situation in the face of the bonuses that are guaranteed by theto the close presence of one or more companions, which can translate for example in the recharging of the magic bar or in the faster exposure of the opponent's weak point. In addition to all this, new items can also be found in Hyrule Warriors Legends, such as the Ocarina which allows you to instantly teleport near one of the owl statues placed on the battlefield. These are changes that make the gameplay more dynamic overall, thickening it more around the element of combat which thus becomes even more predominant than it already was on Wii U. Behind Hyrule Warriors we therefore perceive the desire to package a product that was not a simple port, but which in some way was adapted around the capabilities of the Nintendo portable. However, where Omega Force had to take several steps backwards is in the technical component: that the Nintendo 3DS is much less powerful than the Wii U is self-evident, and the compromises that had to be accepted in the transition from the living room to the portable are evident to say the least. If already on the flagship of the Kyoto house we had the opportunity to criticize the poverty of the settings, here the problem appears amplified by the reduction of polygons and the collapse in the quality of the textures, as well as by the loss of a whole series of effects and by the depletion of the lighting system. But it is also the most distinctive element of the musou, i.e. the confrontation with an absurdly high number of enemies, that has suffered a considerable backlash: although we often find ourselves fighting against a few dozen monsters, the army that instead opposed the protagonist on Wii U is a distant memory. There is also no shortage of pop-up phenomena, i.e. the appearance of opponents a few meters away, a clear sign of an excessive effort required of the laptop's hardware. All this on New Nintendo 3DS, while on the ~normal~ Nintendo 3DS the situation is even worse and degraded by a lower frame rate. The low resolution of the screen then makes the image muddy and confusing, especially in situations with multiple characters displayed. The result is a game world that is at times demeaning in its aesthetic unpleasantness, with references to the world of Zelda becoming even more nuanced. Above all, the protagonists are saved, who enjoy a level of detail and superior modeling, but we are still quite far from the best the Nintendo system has been able to show during its career.", "date": "2016-03-21", "grade": "6.5"}
