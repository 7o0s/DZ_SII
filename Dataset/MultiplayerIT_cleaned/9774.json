Indeed, inspired by the homonymous series for the small screen, Batman: The Brave and The Bold aims mainly at a young audience, the same one who probably still follows the cartoon adventures of the bat man. Let's see if it's yet another casual game without art or part or if there's some substance beyond appearances... Beautiful at night Developed by WayForward, Batman: The Brave and The Bold is configured as a real videogame homage to the television series from which it takes its cue, and in fact the adventure is made up of four distinct chapters that resemble in all respects an episode of the show: each of them therefore offers a self-contained story in its own right, with one or more famous figures as antagonists who must be stopped by the bat man and his shift partner. Faithfully to the cartoon, Batman is therefore helped in his exploits by some historical friends - one for each episode - who are controlled by the CPU in the case of single game or who can be controlled by a second user with a convenient drop-in system. It starts with the inevitable Robin, co-protagonist of the first ~episode~ in which the dynamic duo has to deal with the theft of a stone with mysterious powers from the Gotham museum, and continues with Blue Beetle, Hawkman and Guy Gardner (the fourth Green Lantern). The title does a good job of exploiting the presence of these supporting actors in the round, who launch themselves into even rather brilliant jokes during the various cutscenes and who above all cheer up the regular game action with constant comments and exchanges of views with Batman which contribute to really give the idea of being faced with an episode of the animated series. A task carried out in communion with the technical realization of the title, also in this case strongly inspired by the source material and capable of an absolutely satisfactory final result. From a graphic point of view, we are faced with a purely two-dimensional cosmetics (with only a few 3D elements peeping out from time to time) characterized by backdrops and characters drawn with the same traits as the cartoon: an aspect that stands out particularly in the sprites of Batman and associates, not very large but extremely well cared for especially as regards the animations, fluid and varied. The scenarios, on the other hand, sway between ups and downs, with some somewhat bare and cheesy areas that suddenly leave room for sudden qualitative peaks guaranteed by some truly winning visual solutions, often linked to scripted events present in the various levels. The presence of animated films introducing and concluding the stages is also very welcome, once again to testify to the closeness of the video game to the television product. Finally, the sound accompaniment is excellent, with immediately recognizable music and a highly professional Italian dubbing, strong of all the original voices responsible for the work on the animated series. Bat-innkeeper Speaking of it in strictly playful terms, Batman: The Brave and The Bold is a two-dimensional action game that is quite old-school in terms of mechanics but absolutely not in terms of difficulty, so affordable that any user with a minimum of experience will certainly be able to complete it without ever losing a single life. It is evidently a product intended for a very wide range of audiences, but which nevertheless still manages to guarantee a fair fun factor, challenge rate aside. The gameplay is simple to describe: it is a question of guiding Batman and his companion through the various stages that make up the 4 chapters of the adventure, dedicating himself to some occasional platform activities but mainly hitting the enemies who meet on his way with blows. This is made possible by a combat system that draws heavily on the tradition of the old scrolling beat'em ups, providing the user with a handful of well-matched moves and sufficient to guarantee a minimum of variety in the clashes. We therefore find basic attacks, - which can be performed by pressing the A key and combining it with a direction of the analog stick to obtain variants - powerful punches to be activated by shaking the Remote, super shots available after filling a special indicator, dodges and jumps: there is also space a sort of smart-bomb, since it is allowed to call in one of Batman's friends (such as Green Arrow or Aquaman) to help wipe out in one ssingle solution all enemies from the screen. An important part is obviously covered by gadgets, different for each character and which can be purchased and upgraded in a special section by spending the tokens collected between one fight and another: in fact, they also represent the only -weak- stimulus of replay value, considering how many stages offer sections that can only be reached through the use of a specific object. Taken in small doses, Batman: The Brave and The Bold is an action game with little pretensions but capable of being quite fun: in the long run (so to speak, given the brevity of the adventure) however, anyone with a minimum of experience video game behind it will be difficult to digest the non-existent level of difficulty and the extreme repetitiveness of the situations. In short, the classic title that can be pleasant to play for an hour with a younger brother or a cousin ...", "date": "2010-09-29", "grade": "7.0"}
