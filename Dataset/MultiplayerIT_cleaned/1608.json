{"name": "First Look di Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/first-look-di-star-wars-galaxies-an-empire-divided.html", "text": "The introduction Star Wars Galaxies is an mmorpg: a massively online role-playing game that takes place on a persistent setting, i.e. a role-playing game that takes place on a world that is always alive, always present on the network and with thousands of players sharing with us the passion for multiplayer. This new type of product saw its light with Ultima Online, a glorious role-playing game produced by Origin which is currently still perhaps the most loved title because its strong points are the flexibility and richness of the gameplay. After Ultima Online, which was undoubtedly also a great commercial success, developers and publishers have sensed the business and the commercial potential of a product like mmorpgs. In fact, in recent years the number of mmorpgs in development has literally increased a hundredfold! To date it is really difficult to know the exact number, almost every month projects are announced and at the same time others are abandoned. But what makes the world of mmorpg so attractive? The introduction From a commercial point of view, a successful mmorpg is undoubtedly an excellent source of income because in addition to the cost of the game, the user is required to pay a monthly fee to play online. Furthermore, an mmorpg is practically immune to piracy at present. In fact, once you have bought your own copy of the game, we have to connect with our account to the servers and we can do it only thanks to the codes that are inside the package. Downloading an mmorpg from the net does not allow you to play it, because you cannot connect to the game servers. At the same time, however, it is fair to underline that the monthly subscription that a user pays is not just a sinister commercial operation. In fact, mmorpgs are games that continue to produce costs even after launch, because the development team continues to work on the game with patches, updates, modifications, corrections, etc., etc. from its basic version). The servers are also always active and these also produce costs that must be paid. Ultimately, while continuing to produce costs, a successful online role-playing game, with thousands of connected players, guarantees an excellent source of income and that is why there are currently at least 200 titles of this very particular genre in development and in beta testing. It must also be said that there is a nation, Korea, which in terms of ~consumers of mmorpg~ does not surpass anyone. Just think that some titles, programmed expressly for that type of market, exceed 6 million registered players. To give you an idea, Everquest is considered a success with 400,000 registered users worldwide. But an excellent commercial operation is never successful if the game is not bought. What makes a massively multiplayer online RPG attractive? Giving an answer to this question is difficult but trying to summarize, these products really allow you to experience the sensation of the potential of multiplayer, to be able to play with dozens of friends at the same time, to be able to pursue a goal together, to help each other in combat, to live together an experience. In an mmorpg we will hardly be the hero of the world as in a single player, perhaps we will not experience a fantastic story as protagonists, but we will take our steps in a persistent world, we will meet hundreds of players, we will compete with others, we will quarrel with some, in short, in definitively we will really live in an RPG. Star Wars Galaxies is probably the most anticipated mmorpg ever, at least as far as the western world is concerned. Will Verant have succeeded in recreating the atmosphere of Star Wars? To recreate that Galaxy that made us all dream? Let's try to find out with this article, however, making a necessary premise. An mmorpg in beta testing is absolutely non-judgable. As I said before, an online RPG after a year of life is decidedly different from its basic version; this concept, if applied to a beta, is even more amplified because the beta is continuously corrected and modified. The task of this article is therefore not to judge and evaluate but rather to explain and illustrate the strengths and weaknesses found up to now and on the basis of these make a prediction on what Star Wars Galaxies could become. The creation of our alter ego This phase is absolutely amazing! We know well how important the creation of the character from a physical point of view is in a crpg, but never how important it becomes in an mmorpg, in which this phase is incredibly detailed, in order not to run the risk of seeing one's own character equal to a other among the thousands of characters, players and non-players, present in a persistent world. The creation of our alter ego The character creation in Star Wars Galaxies elevates this concept described above into something extraordinary. It is very satisfying to create our alter ego from a physical point of view; think that there is an option to decide whether or not to have freckles to our character! Nothing is left to chance: depth of the eye socket, size of the nose, mouth, jaw, cheekbones, eyebrows, etc. etc., everything is modifiable to our choice, thanks to the scroll bars that allow us to change these parameters. Obviously this wealth of detail is not limited to the face and hair but also extends to the build, height and weight. Really hard to do better. After having fun with the physical creation of the character, we are called to choose the races. At present you can choose between eight races whose number will undoubtedly increase with future expansions. Humans  The predominant race in Star Wars Galaxies. They have no important core characteristics and therefore do not excel in any particular skill. Their strength lies in the variety of behavior and character. They do not have a main planet that identifies them and can be found easily on almost any hospitable planet in the Galaxy. Rodian - A race markedly prone to violence and combat. Looked upon with suspicion, Rodians are typically ruthless and skilled bounty hunters. They live on the planet Rodia in violent and bloodthirsty clans. The Rodian creatures that live scattered throughout the Galaxy have achieved a better balance and seem to be less violent than those who live on the ~mother~ planet. Wookiee - The very famous Wookiee, this breed made famous by the character of Chewbacca, makes honor, courage and loyalty the main traits. Equipped with extraordinary physical strength, they are fearsome opponents in hand-to-hand combat. Bothan - The Bothan are not a race with great physical strength but are known for their cunning and above all for the ease with which they gather information. They are generally very efficient spies and excel in acumen and intelligence. Mon Calamari - Breed known for its intelligence and culture. Definitely skilled in the scientific field, they are very peaceful and stubborn at the same time, also famous for their ability to build weapons and spaceships that are very efficient in battle. Trandoshan - A fearsome race, the Trandoshan make strength and hand-to-hand combat their strengths. They have very tough skin, ability to withstand the most lethal blows, clawed hands capable of injuring anyone. They are formidable but frowned upon warriors, as they are disinclined to friendship and loyalty. Twi'leks - Hardened by the harsh conditions of their home planet, the Twi'leks are a generally peaceful race with innate skills for preservation and survival; they are also known for their intelligence and cunning. Zabrak - The Zabrak are a race famed for exploration, adept at combat, survival instincts, and willpower; they are as skilled as humans in any profession but are distinguished from the former by a greater ability in the exploratory field. The creation of our alter ego As you can see the races are quite varied from each other and different for main attributes which are six: strength, constitution, speed, stamina, focus and willpower. Obviously a Moon Calamari will not have great physical strength and constitution but certainly a high focus, etc, etc. This really allows us to make the most of the core characteristics of a breed in association with a profession. If we want to become a spy, the Bothans are undoubtedly the race with the greatest aptitude for this profession. However nothing prevents us from undertaking it with a different breed even if the path will be more difficult. In addition to these six attributes there are three main containers: health, action and mind with values that change during the game. If we get hit, our health decreases or if we run the action varies. These containers are associated with attribute values. A high stamina allows us to have a high action container, a high constitution offers us the advantage of having high health that regenerates with speed etc, etc. The game interface The interface is shown to us with very linear and clean graphics and decidedly not cumbersome and guarantees us a wide view of the game. The character can move with the arrow keys or with the simple use of the right mouse button thanks to the pointer placed in the center of thescreen. The view can be changed from first to third person, with the use of the mouse; thanks to the scroll, in fact, we can enter in first or third person as we please. At the top of the screen there is a convenient quick bar, very useful during the game phases with action, when the speed of healing and changing weapons can decide the outcome of a fight. By default they are assigned in the quick bar of the character's movements that can be recalled from the keyboard. The use of these functions is important because they allow us to sit or lie down on the ground at any time, even during combat. The game interface The interaction with the outside world is cured and quite extensive, even if we are not faced with let's say total interaction. An object can be taken and placed in the inventory or examined but it cannot in most cases be moved. Both the interaction with the objects and with the NPCs takes place through a radial menu that can be activated once the central cursor has been positioned on the object and pressing the left button. In this case, a new menu will open with all the actions that we can perform, for example with an npc we can converse or examine it, we can analyze or take an object. At any time we can press the Alt key and change our cursor to an arrow. This is used to be able to interact with the last bar at the bottom left, which is also quite important, which collects many functions: from the map, to the progress of the skills, to the inventory, to the mail section, etc., etc. (during the game you can send emails to your friends who, despite being on another planet, will be able to answer you at any time!). The game interface The SWG map is of two types: a map that shows us the geographical conformation of the planet we are visiting and one, more interactive, which can be called up during the game, which shows us what surrounds us in a city. In practice, the first map has a wider scope, showing us the distances between cities, etc., while the second is limited to the area around our character. This last map is very useful but, at the same time, a little confusing, for example when we are in cities. Connected to the map we have the fundamental nav point function; selecting a target from the generic map and assigning a nav point to a location, we will have another arrow cursor on the screen which, following it, will guide us to the location we want to reach. Obviously all the functions listed above can be customized using the keyboard. By default, the Ctrl plus key combination invokes all of these functions. Ultimately, the interface seems to me to be essential and efficient, perhaps with rather small characters which on not very large monitors can cause problems; on a fifteen inch the chat window is in my opinion too small, in consideration of the fact that at present the game resolution is not modifiable but fixed at 1024x768. The developers probably thought that no one will play SWG with a small monitor. The galaxy far far away After a few hours of play, you realize that Star Wars Galaxies is undoubtedly devoted to exploration. The galaxy, at launch of the game, provides access to 10 worlds all superbly crafted in every way. Six planets can be reached immediately after character creation, while the others can only be accessed by interstellar travel. The worlds that make up the galaxy, which in my opinion will undoubtedly be enlarged with the next expansions, are: Correlia  It is a world that has never appeared in the movies but is definitely important, as it is the homeland of Han Solo but above all the place where the Rebel Alliance. Its capital, Coronet, is perhaps the largest city in the game and is made up of vast skyscrapers. Dathomir - Here is a first planet that is inaccessible at the start of the game (and luckily I would say!). Dathomir  It is a very dangerous planet, where force-sensitive witches ride hungry rancors! These witches are certainly not very hospitable. If we combine this with the geographical conformation, made up of sharp rocks and forests, we realize why this planet cannot be accessed immediately, far too inhospitable for non-expert characters. Endor - The very famous planet of Endor, also unreachable except through expensive interstellar travel, is strongly characterized by forests and lakes. There are no urban settlements for humans, and the only creatures that dwell there are the cute Ewoks. Lok - Home of the famous pirate Nym, a decidedly sympathizer of the Rebellion, Lok is also not a very accessible and welcoming planet. The peric", "date": "2003-06-27", "grade": null}
