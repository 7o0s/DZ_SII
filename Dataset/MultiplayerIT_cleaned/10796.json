{"name": "WWE Legends of Wrestlemania - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wwe-legends-of-wrestlemania-recensione.html", "text": "Anyone who has long passed the age of twenty-five and in high school, during recess, spent the time throwing himself off the desk, or maybe doing a nice suplex to the unfortunate person on duty, will surely appreciate, complete with copious nostalgic tears, WWE Legends of WrestleMania, a real wrestling encyclopedia, which allows us to impersonate all those old glories that raged on Italia 1 in the 80s and 90s. Raw 2009 with different actors, Yuke's guys have chosen a decidedly less technical and all in all more arcade approach, based exclusively on the front keys of the pad, together with a new grappling system, which exploits the classic quick time event system. Golden years The historical aspect of the title is well cared for: each wrestler has his own entrances and personal theme, while the arenas that hosted the fifteen editions of WrestleMania reproduced here (1985-1999) have been perfectly recreated. In addition to the movies, real archive pieces that introduce the most important matches, to complete a philologically perfect job, the developers also used the same television fonts used at the time. The roster of wrestlers is particularly complete, there are almost all the old glories, now retired due to age limits, which made us tremble more than twenty years ago. Alongside the famous Hulk Hogan, The Million Dollar Man Ted Dibiase, Ultimate Warrior, Andre the Giant, Jake the Snake Roberts and Bigboss Man, there are also all the others, including, Honky Tonk Man, Kamala, Iron Sheik and Sgt Slaughter. There are also wrestlers who have come down to the present day such as The Rock, Undertaker and Shawn Michaels. The total is 38 wrestlers, to which are added four managers, for example Mr Fuji and Jimmy Hart, who can intervene directly in some types of matches. As if 38 wrestlers weren't enough, it is also possible to import the wrestlers present in WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009, including those created from scratch. Naturally, the new recruits lose their peculiar controls (but not their graphic aspect), adopting in all respects those of Legends of Wrestlemania. Insert Coin The control method is as simple as it is effective, light years away from the simulation depth of Smackdown VS Raw. Basically you use the front keys of the pad for grabs, attacks, actions (such as picking up objects, getting in and out of the ring or throwing yourself from the corner) and parrying. In short, an evolution of the old control method present in the famous arcade classic WWF Superstars by Technos from 1989. A choice dictated by the desire to make the title attractive even to those players who are not real wrestling aficionados nor expert players. A purely casual choice, which could alienate the aforementioned expert or hardcore players, but which has the advantage of giving the game immediacy and fun right away, obviously to the detriment of a certain depth. To make this direction even more evident is the inclusion of quick time events following a successful hold. In short, it is enough simply to push one of the front buttons in time to trigger a particularly long and complicated figure, but at the same time the opponent who is undergoing it can also try to beat him on time, thus breaking the grip, giving the la to a possible countermove. Concluding quick time event chains also raises the power bar below the energy bar. Once you have reached the maximum, it is possible to create your own super move, more spectacular and decidedly more harmful than all the others. Similarly to grappling, quick time events are back in play here too. Almost everything works perfectly, but it is clear that this distortion of the controls simplifies the clashes too much, which are radically divided into two parts, that of normal shots, which despite being many (there are 25 pages of tutorials about them) are not particularly exciting particularly gratifying the player, and the quick time events, which reduce to a simple timed push of a couple of keys to execute long moves that would deserve a greater ~physical~ participation of the player. In practice, playing alone in some situations, the screen is fixed for a few seconds waiting for the key to press to appear. To then maybe later give us button mashing to come out of a pin or to keep the grip on an opponent. March 31, 1985 The game modes are different, the main one, called Tour of WrestleMania allows us, depending on the type of game chosen, to relive, to rewrite and redefine the most famous clashes of the various editions of WrestleMania. Relive puts us in the shoes of the winner, rewrite in that of the loser, while redefine allows us to choose which wrestler to use and the various types of game. Each of these modes is based on internal mini objectives that allow us once we have achieved all of them to unlock extras such as cinematics and additional costumes that the game is full of. Obviously it is enough to win the match to access the next match, and this is all in all quite easy, but true longevity is given by trying to make the necessary objective moves and tricks (such as tricks, final move, countermove and many others) to the coveted gold medal. Luckily this series of internal objectives to the individual matches compensates for the shortcomings of the overly simplified control method, which pushes us not to be too technical since the fulcrum of the game are the tricks/quick time events. This time, however, having to perform a certain move for the maximum score, one is forced to adopt a more reasoned approach, even if imposed, and which perhaps forces us to repeat an already won match several times. A way for this that is perhaps a little too coercive towards the player but which greatly extends the life of the game, given that one feels the lack of more encounters to face, as the level of difficulty is not very high, despite the many possibilities of modification of the same. Presumably new matches will become available later, as this ~scenario~ mode seems to be made for adding new content. Kill your idols Alongside these historical clashes we find the Legend Killer game mode, where with a wrestler created ad hoc through the powerful and flexible editor available, we must defeat in succession, with a minimum recovery of energy between one clash and another (consequently holds that quickly stretch the opponent are to be preferred), the true legends in different ~championships~ each consisting of ten matches. You start with a very low evaluation of your statistics, but at each meeting, if you have achieved objectives here too, you acquire experience points which in fact facilitate the clashes to come. Unfortunately we have to denounce the fact that it is not possible to save in the middle of a tournament, something that doesn't bother too much in the first tournaments, given that you can complete them in half an hour, but towards the end, when the wrestlers become decidedly too many, the need to save becomes fundamental. Going back to the powerful editor, in addition to the physical appearance of the wrestlers, it is also possible to create or modify existing tag teams, create a move set and choreographed entrances into the ring of the wrestlers, more or less the same offer present in SmackDown vs. . raw. The offer of game modes concludes with the many types of matches present by choosing exhibition, completely untied from the historical context, ranging from the classic Royal Rumble to the Tag Team, passing through the various Submission, Ladder, Battle Royal, Handicap, Steel Cage, Hell in a Cell and Triple Threat. From this point of view, the offer is very varied, the victory conditions vary greatly, without prejudice to the control method, which in the blink of an eye can alienate as well as win the sympathy of the players. In terms of online multiplayer features, Yuke has simply carried over many of the game types present in the exhibition mode, with ranked and non-ranked matches; on the other hand, championships and articulated tournaments are completely absent. Lights of the scene Technically speaking, the work done by the developers is generally of good quality, the wrestlers are well modeled and animated and virtually indistinguishable from their real counterparts, but this is now the minimum wage. The things that leave us perplexed are a certain heaviness of the movements, above all in the lateral movements and the common characteristic of all wrestlers of being, however well made, a little too bright and shining, and if my memory supports me, too massive and muscular compared to what they really were, with the result that for the most part, thanks to the textures, lights and modeling work, Hulk Hogan for example looks like the high hairline version of Ivan Drago. In short, venial sins that disappear in the face of the excellent historical work of the developers to recreate the atmosphere that was breathed at the time in the arenas that hosted the events, complete with an audience with t-shirts and signs dedicated to their heroes. Unfortunately, however, the research work is sometimes frustrated by a real realization of the bystanderspoor, with the polygons becoming poorly animated two-dimensional soles. Comment WWE Legends of Wrestlemania is a title that thanks to the nostalgia factor could be appreciated by ~no longer very young~ players and by those looking for an easy and immediate title, deviating greatly from the refinements proposed by Smackdown Vs Raw. The control method based on holds and quick time events, however highly spectacular and easy to assimilate, turns out to be a little too simplified and in fact neuters any type of technical approach towards clashes in the bud. Despite all the game is very funny and historically accurate, the many videos are the perfect appetizer to re-propose the most famous clashes of the time which unfortunately are not very many, but hopefully more will arrive soon to download. Ultimately a title that you love or hate, decidedly arcade and casual, more suitable for beginners than for experienced players. A dive into the past, a healthy blow of nostalgia, but which risks not leaving its mark on the genre, where the simulation and depth of Smackdown Vs Raw reign supreme.Pro Historically accurate with period footage and music Many game modes Quick and easy control method... Against ... maybe a little too much, at the expense of depth Historic meetings may have been more A few minor graphical peccadilloes PlayStation 3 - Trophies The game offers 20 trophies, all related to victories in the various game modes, and to a certain type of successful attack. The most challenging trophy to obtain is earned by completing the entire Legend Killer mode, which is particularly challenging given the impossibility of saving between matches.", "date": "2009-03-25", "grade": null}
