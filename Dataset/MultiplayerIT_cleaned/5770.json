A project that started a bit in bulk, which first saw the release of Resident Evil 4 HD on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, then the same edition on PC and finally, exactly one year ago, the return of the original chapter. The Resident Evil 0 remaster, however, is in some ways more interesting than the others. In fact, we are talking about a title created by Capcom exclusively for GameCube and subsequently converted to Wii, but which had never made its debut on platforms other than Nintendo... until today. Well, what was it like to try again with the disturbing adventure of Rebecca Chambers and Billy Coen, set before the events of Resident Evil? If you've never played Resident Evil 0, here's a great chance to make up for it I start from scratch The idea behind Resident Evil 0 was to create an episode halfway between the past and the future of the series, as evidenced by the adoption of ~hybrid~ solutions compared to the innovations of the previous Code: Veronica, which had first played the map of the polygonal scenarios instead of the pre-rendered ones. In this case, therefore, we have static backdrops and the inevitable (but brief, on PC) loading when the doors are opened, but more flexible inventory management thanks to the possibility of abandoning objects everywhere, rather than necessarily having to use the ~magic chests~ . The most important novelty, however, concerns the introduction of cooperative gameplay in which the two protagonists, Rebecca and Billy, can be alternated at will, often forced to follow different paths and exchange objects to solve environmental puzzles which sometimes also require the use of their peculiar abilities: the ability to mix herbs and chemicals in the case of the rookie of the S.T.A.R.S. group, the strength to move the crates and greater combat effectiveness in the case of the ~bad boy~ ex Navi SEAL. Meeting on a mysteriously stopped train near Raccoon City, Rebecca and Billy find themselves having to face zombies and gruesome creatures, apparently controlled by a man who has something to do with Umbrella. They therefore decide to work together in order to survive, during an adventure that will see them gradually trusting each other more and more, in a desperate fight against what seems like a real nightmare. A different approach Resident Evil 0 presents itself as a different episode from the usual, in which it is possible to switch from one character to another by simply pressing a button and order your partner to follow us or stay where he is, as well as have an offensive or passive attitude against enemies. Mechanisms whose usefulness is already emphasized in the first scenario, that of the train, which after a few minutes will resume its run and we will have the task of stopping. Then we will find ourselves exploring a location very similar to that of the original chapter, a huge villa used by Umbrella for agent training, to finally move on to different (and certainly less fascinating) scenarios during the final part of the adventure . As highlighted in the review of the GameCube version, several years ago, the choice of using giant insects, monkeys or even frogs as special enemies inevitably takes the tension off a product that has always made horror one of its strengths, but the situation is partially rebalanced by some at least interesting boss fights, in which it is often necessary to move quickly as well as shoot. In this sense, the new control system, which can be selected at the start of the game (together with the widescreen or the original 4:3 video format), allows you to move much more easily thanks to the reference to the view rather than to the character , moreover, using progressive pressure on the analog stick to walk or run. Nostalgics don't fear, however: if they want they can resort to the original setting, in the ~tank~ style. There are also various different layouts for the keys, but the default one seemed outdated to us compared to the D scheme, which allows you to use the triggers to aim and open fire rather than deputing this action to the central buttons, in a way that, in our opinion, is not very immediate. The changes made make the challenge less pressing in some ways, since you can move better and faster, but at the same time the ~screen relative~ controls clash with the traditional management of the shots, and sometimes lead to having to apply instant correctionsto make our character keep moving in the desired direction. Still speaking of difficulty, unfortunately no balance has been made in terms of the arrangement of objects and resources, which means that there is a huge gap between the easy level and the normal one: in the first case you will find ammunition, weapons, medicines and tapes to save in industrial quantities, in the second case you will have to face the whole part of the train with the knife to save shots in view of the subsequent clashes, much more demanding, which otherwise you will find yourself facing without weapons and with little health, with the only possibility to start all over again. As mentioned, typewriter ribbons are also in Resident Evil 0 the only way to save the game. It is an ancient system when compared with modern checkpoints and automatisms, as well as often ruthless: incurring the game over a few steps from a save game, perhaps after completing several puzzles, will make you cry out in despair. Resident Evil Origins Collection Available in stores starting January 22, Resident Evil Origins Collection will bring together the remasters of Resident Evil and Resident Evil 0 in a single package for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. We will dedicate a new article to the collection, so as to better illustrate the contents and the value. Quality of the remaster Beyond the changes made to the gameplay, all optional, what catches the eye in Resident Evil 0 HD Remaster is obviously the graphic remastering work, which brought the game's resolution to 1080p and sixty frames per second on PC ( thirty on consoles), with extra adjustments to determine the quality of anti-aliasing, shadows and textures. We are talking about a product that was already very valid from the start, thanks to the extraordinary work carried out by Capcom at the time of the original release, and which therefore lent itself easily to a resampling of the textures and an improvement of the polygonal models, although some simplifications in the joints (visible in particularly with Billy, as he's wearing a tank top) are still pretty noticeable. However, it is the scenarios that have received the greatest benefits, thanks to the application of much sharper and more defined textures, even more vivid than those of 2003, and to a decidedly improved lighting system, capable of giving a different aspect to many glimpses . Also interesting is the movement of the view, sometimes vertically and sometimes horizontally, which gives a minimum of dynamism to originally completely static backgrounds. Unfortunately the computer graphics cutscenes have simply been scaled down, which creates an annoying gap between the in-game graphics and those of the movies, which feel the damn weight of the years and, with a little effort, could have been replaced with new ones real-time scenes. Finally, the extra content consists of a series of costumes linked to pre-orders and two modes that are unlocked once the campaign is completed: Leech Hunter, which was also present in the original edition of Resident Evil 0, and the unpublished Wesker Mode. The latter will see us control the evil Albert Wesker in Billy's place (although the cutscenes and dialogues have remained altered), alongside a Rebecca with disturbing haunted eyes. Wesker has a couple of extra maneuvers that allow him to have a substantial advantage: a sort of optical beam and a very fast sprint.", "date": "2016-01-18", "grade": "7.5"}
