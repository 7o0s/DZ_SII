There was a time in which even years passed between one Monster Hunter and another, a time in which we looked anxiously and enviously at the gameplay that arrived from the Rising Sun, when we had to wait for the location and someone, not being able to wait any longer , if he played it in Japanese. Today we can afford the luxury of not wasting time explaining what Monster Hunter is, given that its popularity, which has skyrocketed above all thanks to Monster Hunter World, is now consolidated. We have to admit that the trend worries us a bit, especially for those who start over so soon, but if you skipped the previous iteration for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC, well, good for you: as you will find out by reading the review of Monster Hunter Rise is about to become your new favorite game. Nintendo Switch format If, on the other hand, you have played Monster Hunter World an adequate number of hours, the transition to this Monster Hunter for Nintendo Switch could give you mixed feelings. Of course, Monster Hunter Rise is not Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate: the latter was a conversion from Nintendo 3DS, and even in terms of gameplay, the two Capcom titles share relatively little. There is no doubt that a careful look will notice all the inadequacies of a more limited hardware: the polygon count is significantly lower than what we saw in the World, especially with regard to the maps, and the colors appear less vivid, the textures less defined. The general glance, however, is extraordinary, and Monster Hunter Rise represents a kind of miracle. The Capcom developers have compromised, but have found the squaring of the circle, compensating for the critical issues with a sublime artistic direction that masks any narrowness and lightning-fast loading speed. Monster Hunter Rise: The Bishaten. Yes, Monster Hunter Rise isn't as graphically complex as World, but it runs at thirty solid frames in any situation, whether you're playing alone or with three friends. The demo had already suggested it, but the final code confirms it: Rise doesn't miss a beat even when you find yourself fighting in four, with their respective companions Felyne or Canyne, against two or more monsters. There are visual effects everywhere and the game doesn't slow down anyway; on the contrary, it seems absurd to complain about the excessive confusion that is created and which makes the action less readable: the paradox, in short, is that the graphics engine manages all this good things without batting an eye. The credit goes above all to the highly scalable RE Engine, but the men who codified everything are wizards. We have played Monster Hunter Rise for a long time, both on TV and in portability: in the first case, the 756p image may appear slightly dirtier but is still quite defined thanks also to a more than discreet antialiasing filter; in portability the resolution drops to 540p but, also thanks to the small size of the display, the Capcom title maintains enviable clarity and stability. The game world Monster Hunter Rise: the Rakna-Kadaki. The maps of Monster Hunter Rise are a little smaller than those of Monster Hunter World, but after having explored them far and wide we can say that we have certainly appreciated them more: in fact, they have their own personality that elevates them above those of World , which were realistic, plausible, yes, but also quite stereotyped. Rise plays on the same clichs, but the artists of Capcom have characterized each single map with precious details that give an extra edge to the atmosphere, thanks also to a very inspired soundtrack, often sung. Above the waterfalls and misty mountains of the Sacred Ruins rise small shrines and uninhabited buildings, while the pyramidal structures overlooking the Flooded Forest hold secrets that only the most skilled hunters can discover. The abandoned wrecks in the lakes of the Frozen Isles and the weathered walls in the Sandy Plains are dying to tell us a story we can't hear, and the volcano above the Lava Caves well, that's a volcano, that's all, but the its labyrinthine bowels are a triumph of level design. Monster Hunter Rise: the hunters against the Magnamalo. Exploring is a joy: the maps are full of secrets, shortcuts, points of interest and elevations that rise vertically, revealing an unsuspected depth and complexity when you look beyond the minimap and start to make your senses with the possibilities that offer the 'Wire bug and the renewed freedom of movement. The combination of movements, I controlli and geometry is expressed in a harmony that is rarely seen. Exploration becomes an integral part of the gameplay, whether traversing the map on foot or riding the Canyne. The wire Maxinsects placed in strategic points guarantee faster movement from one area of the map to another, but you can always move in three-dimensional space by combining the wire shot with the wall run, automatic jumps and mid-air stall at will . The Capcom title offers a myriad of mechanics that cross naturally and are mastered in a matter of minutes. Monster Hunter Rise: the Magnamalo is the monster on the cover of the game. Once the maps have been assimilated, Monster Hunter Rise takes on all-new strategic contours even for the most experienced hunters. The watchword would seem to be freedom: not only to move, but also to face the enemy. You can load it head down and take the whole arsenal with you (traps, barrel bombs and so on) or, in this case, make the necessary detours and scour the map in search of endemic fauna. The latter has been massively redesigned and now includes a huge amount of pets that grant temporary and permanent bonuses, or that can be caged and released later to exploit their special properties at the expense of the enemy. The mini-map on the screen immediately shows the position of these little creatures, but also of the large monsters that roam the area, courtesy of our Owl who follows us from above: it may seem a simplification to know immediately where it's this or that monster, but it's a mechanism designed to give the player the luxury of strategy. Monster Hunter Rise: the Somnacanth. Ultimately, he will choose whether to shoot straight and attack the target immediately, or to go first for another monster, jump on his back and start the fight like this. From this point of view, Monster Hunter Rise offers a variety of approaches never seen before in the series. Capcom would seem to have thought of everything: it would have been easy to manipulate the new dynamics to trivialize the fights, so the various parameters that row against the player take over, starting with the recharge times of the Wire Insects - which therefore limit his ability to move freely during the clashes - to move on to the monsters' new abilities, based on an average more acute artificial intelligence: the beasts are more aggressive, they chase us above and below when possible, and even attack us from a distance if they really can't reach us . The monsters Monster Hunter Rise: the Almudron. Monster Hunter Rise has about forty monsters that face each other in low and high rank missions. As is often the case with initial releases, the Capcom title does not include Master Rank; moreover, the story that acts as a leitmotif is much more skimpy than that seen in Monster Hunter World: every now and then the inhabitants of the village of Kamura will show up in the short cinematics that give meaning to the progression, but which on balance add little and nothing to the narrative. It is ironic, considering how well characterized the inhabitants of Kamura are, mostly from an aesthetic point of view, but the entire village, area by area, smells of feudal Japan, mixing all those details that we have come to know and love in manga and anime. The village is simply splendid, very easy to navigate thanks to the rapid movements and the intelligent positioning of the various services. Moreover, it is possible to personalize it: if for some reason you are tired of hearing Hinoa sing, you can always choose another background music in your accommodation. Monster Hunter Rise: the Tigrex. Coming to the monsters, the bestiary includes old and new faces, including some iconic monsters such as the Zinogre, the Rathalos or the Nargacuga. Some come directly from Monster Hunter World, such as the Tobi-Kadachi or the Anjanath, and others go back to the older generation Monster Hunters: this is the case of the Mizutsune or the Volvidon. The variety of skeletons is enormous and also counts the leviathans, largely absent in World for technical reasons: this obviously affects the diversity of the clashes and game dynamics, since each new level of difficulty, distinguished by the canonical stars, skilfully mixes different types of creatures. The great protagonists are obviously the totally unpublished monsters, and we can only applaud Capcom with a long standing ovation: they are probably among the most ingenious, eccentric and fun monsters that we have ever faced in many years of hunting. Magnamalo should need no introduction :pyou probably faced it in the demo and beat it up. Monster Hunter Rise: the Mizutsune. Don't worry: in the final code the cover monster is much more docile, but still remains a tough nut to crack that will give you a hard time. We also adored monsters like the Goss Harag, who took us by surprise with his unthinkable agility and a huge variety of attacks centered around his ability to transform his paws into icy blades, and the Bishaten, who can inflict various negative conditions based on to the fruit that he collects and that moves with chaotic erraticness. We could praise each new monster - and we will probably do so in a dedicated special - but we are really satisfied: the staff of Yasunori Ichinose and Ryozo Tsujimoto have truly outdone themselves both in terms of combat and in terms of art, starting with the old and new music that masterfully accompany the action. The new monsters are just beautiful, as are the armor and weapons you craft after dismembering them, and you'll be happy to know that most of the weapons have their own aesthetics that leave behind the recycling of models and textures seen in the first version of Monster Hunter World. Weapons and fights Monster Hunter Rise: the Barioth. A papyrus could be written on the combat system of Monster Hunter Rise. We trust that you know the basics or have downloaded the demo to try it first hand, so it's worth skipping the pleasantries and explaining what's new right away. Most of the weapons have inherited the movesets from Monster Hunter World: at a basic level, the differences are minimal, but the introduction of the Wire Insect profoundly changes some skills, as well as the dynamics and timing of the clashes. Silkweaver attacks are just the tip of the iceberg, as well as the easiest to explain: each weapon starts with two abilities that consume one or two charges of Threadbug, which then regenerate more or less quickly based on the move that consumed them . For example, the Threadbug recharges very quickly after a Philo-Dash or a Philo-Drop - a technique that you will definitely need to master - but much slower after using a move like Serene Longsword Stance. You don't only have to learn the recharge times, but also decide in the space of a breath how and when to consume a charge of Thread Bug. Monster Hunter Rise: the Royal Ludroth. Better to stay on the ground and take advantage of the temporary invulnerability, or get up in the air with a Philofall? And in what direction? Will you land right away to gulp down a Mega Potion or will you use another Philo-Shot in mid-air to put as much space between you and the monster as possible? The speed with which you will find yourself making these decisions in the middle of a fight gives the new combat system more action connotations than in the past. Within a few hours you'll find yourself darting over monsters, dropping barrel bombs in flight, and moving like a new Spider-Man in search of the best angle to deliver your most powerful blow. The Wire Insect is not a feature that makes battles more dynamic and frenetic, but also more engaging and spectacular. For franchise veterans, who may have always loved the phlegmatic heaviness of the classic combat system, all this speed could make their noses turn up. However, Monster Hunter Rise succeeds in the very difficult task of remaining faithful to the series, without distorting it. Monster Hunter Rise: the Tetranadon. Mistakes still cost dearly. You will probably pass the low-rank missions quickly, especially if you know the monsters or are familiar with the series and its dynamics, but the high-rank monsters will unceremoniously break you, annihilating you with a well-placed shot as soon as you miss a Filoscatto or risk one attack too many with inadequate resistances. This is where the Wyvern Mount fits in. Initially it seemed to us only a more rigid and cumbersome variant of the Claw Grapple introduced in Monster Hunter World, but then we got carried away and, while always recognizing a certain heaviness, especially in execution, we began to better see the opportunities it offers also on the tactical profile. The targets of the hunts are usually very resistant to this mechanic, but the other monsters are instead easier to subjugate with the silkweaver attacks or the Burattiragno: at that point, riding a monster means scoring free hits on the unfortunate target of the hunt.
