{"name": "Spartan: Total Warrior", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/spartan-total-warrior.html", "text": "History and mythology are Violence Spartan: Total Warrior is a technological and aesthetic hymn to ~classic~ mass violence, the one made up of dozens and dozens of combatants on the war field, of massive and chaotic carnage in which blind fury and reasoned technique must go hand in hand. The technological basis for making these clashes possible is a multi-acclaimed graphics engine, capable of moving something like one hundred and seventy fighters on the screen at the same time, always keeping the action fluid without giving up detail and respectable texture cleaning. The fighters, of course, are quite blocky, and often move with very little realism, but overall the graphics engine stages the chaos in a more than excellent way. The aesthetic spirit of the game, for its part, is peculiar. The technology connotes, moves, gives images and sounds to environments saturated with characters, giving life to carnage in which the player moves brandishing swords, sinking blades and sweeping away and possibly mutilating even half a dozen enemies at a time. The player impersonates The Spartan: a sort of excellent champion, a Platonic idea of the fighter made material and alive, commanded by the spirit of Ares, god of war, to repel the Roman attack on Sparta and destroy the Empire. History and mythology are Violence Allied with Castor and Pollux, living incarnation of the war superiority of the Spartans over the ~Roman dogs~, The Spartan takes the player into a game structure almost entirely hack and slash, within which there are sparse action missions and some variation on the theme. Thus, the clashes against the Romans will alternate with sections in which it will be necessary to activate barrels of explosives to sneak into the imperial camps, freeing prisoners and killing the guards while preventing them from sounding the alarm gong or slaughtering the helpless Spartans who have just been freed. There is no shortage of moments in which it is possible to have access to offensive tools such as self-moving mechanized crossbows, on which the player mounts to wipe out hordes of enemies with a few well-aimed shots. Other times, the player will have to be absent from the mass fight to control certain hot areas: protect a gate that separates the attackers from the city, help Leonidas against his attackers, activate the mechanism that precipitates boiling oil on the enemies at the gates, shoot catapults against the mechanical colossus with which the Romans want to tear down the walls of Sparta. All in a framework in which a Medusa trapped in a device that channels her petrifying power against the Spartans coexists with the Hydra, hordes of undead armed with katanas, explosives and various other figurative elements. All of this is very pleasant, but if it weren't for a rather ridiculous dubbing and an all too ground zero plot, with the Nazi Romans ante litteram and a very obvious progression, Spartan would be even more fun. For the mix of styles and the playful style it recalls God of War, with which, however, Spartan fails to share the elegance in the clashes, sacrificed in favor of a much greater quantity of enemies to kill, nor the aesthetic coherence. Starter set for massive carnage Carnage always remains the focus of the game. Spartan really throws the player into the fray of historically based combat between some one hundred and fifty combatants. In some situations, such as the moment in which the two armies face each other on the free field by running against each other and then violently impacting the clash, they bring the player to considerable levels of videogame enjoyment. In the role of the Spartan, however, the player remains privileged: he observes the one-on-one clashes of his fellow soldiers sufficiently, because he can afford to hit much more than one enemy at a time, move much faster and inflict a higher level of damage to the common Spartans. Only Castor and Pollux, gigantic fighting companions, can approach its power. The player has access to a vast series of shots at his disposal, which include parries and counterattacks, defensive somersaults and dodges, lunges of various kinds, and a series of super shots accessible according to the amount of energy present in a special bar, dramatized with sages in slow motion and capable of knocking down very tough enemies in a single blow or deadly crashing into entire groups of enemies by making them fly to pieces to the right and left. Nor is the Spartan satisfied with a simple sword: during the game it is possible to acquire numerous other weapons, including bow and arrows and power upgrades such as those offered by the Swords of Athena which will be recovered from the hands ofRomans, guilty of having previously stolen them from Athens. The plot, punctuated by verbal hymns to Ares' violence, with his guttural and threatening voice, will explain the super-human nature of our hero in bits and pieces. Slicing away hordes and hordes of Roman enemies is the main mission, the core of the experience, a matter of resistance: however, it is not a matter of simple button mashing. The strategic and technical component will prove to be crucial in orienting oneself in the midst of three-dimensional brawls. Already a few hours into the game, Spartan: Total Warrior requires the player to be able to aim and attack different enemies in different ways, pushing this one with the shield and piercing the one with the sword, knocking down the archers from a distance and opening the guards the tough centurions, praying to the few temples to recover their energy once they have earned the time to do so without being attacked from behind, alternating between fighting together with their companions and specific missions. The plot, punctuated by Ares' verbal hymns to violence, with his guttural and menacing voice, will explain the super-human nature of our hero in bits and pieces. Slicing away hordes and hordes of Roman enemies is the main mission, the core of the experience, a matter of resistance The technical and strategic issue is what distinguishes Spartan: Total Warrior from a total button-smasher game, but it also turns out to be its limit. In a sense, Spartan would like to have a lot of control complexity to apply on the mass of enemies, but in reality the control is too complex. The hit combinations often affect too many keys at once, and have a bad economy of controller resources: they are smeared on the back keys, oriented without a precise order, they confuse the player instead of making the controller disappear from his hands to think about how to get out alive from the clashes. The control proves to be incomplete in this sense, limiting the potential for control and elegance that the game could have offered and sacrificing the strategic component in favor of a frustration effect in the more demanding levels. Some sections, moreover, accompanying the fight but not only, turn out to be made in a fairly superficial way, betraying a certain inexperience in dealing with the genre. The sporadic moments of exploration are linear and superfluous, built only to give substance to the beautiful narrative progression. And some end-of-level boss fights are very poorly done, leaving the player at the mercy of excessive enemy forces or offering no real change in play style. In this sense, Spartan fails to make a clear leap in quality, while remaining an excellent experience. Spartan: Total Warrior is a frenetic, violent, technically excellent hack and slash, made with a mixture of historical-mythological inspirations and war-fantasy influences that will appeal to many players fed up with the usual visual universes with watertight compartments and to all those who God of War had opened up an appetite for playful Greekness without fully satiating them. However, the latter will regret the fact that Spartan remains in a sort of middle ground between total carnage and technical and elegant combat. Spartan has a disorienting and not perfectly distributed hit set on the controller, which damages the playful potential of the massive fights it manages to stage. Then there are the uninspired sections of the kit, and bosses whose challenge mechanics turn out to be not exciting. But those who know how to overlook these gaps will find a challenging and fairly long-lived game, imbued with an amusing mythological vein and at times genuinely exhilarating. Pros: Excellent technical realization Dozens and dozens of characters on screen Solemn but fun aesthetic Carnage often exhilarating Cons: Complicated controls Some sections don't really shine Lack of incisive narrative level It was better not to dub him than to do it like this Cross-platform Spartan: Total Warriors is available for PS2, Xbox and GameCube. The versions prove to be practically identical, save for a few fewer uploads for the GameCube version and a slightly higher level of detail and fluidity in the version that runs on Xbox. <strong>Spartan: Total Warrior</strong> One would think that Spartan: Total Warrior is a creature born from the rib of Rome: Total War, the strategic masterpiece of Creative Assembly. Instead, Spartan is not a simple spin-off of the Total War series, perhaps simplified for the console market: it belongs to a completely different videogame style, that of hack'n slash. And if the distance between the strategic war game and the carnage in real time is enormous, not even the apparently common aesthetic theme unites to the bottomor headlines, and it doesn't deceive for long. Spartan is in fact more a pastiche of styles, very playful and comic, than an accurate historical reconstruction in Total War style. If Total War is the closest there is to the real playable story, Spartan is rather the free wandering of the imagination in the historical and mythological situations best suited to frame massive and bloody fights. All within a playful vein in which Spartan, while very enjoyable, fails to excel. In his DNA there are portions of code that do not excel, and if you want to be serious like the Spartans, you might think of throwing him off the cliff.", "date": "2005-11-04", "grade": null}
