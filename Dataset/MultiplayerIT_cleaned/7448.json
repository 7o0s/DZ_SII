The gameplay consists in fact in the stimulation of the walls of a flower (mostly in interacting with the buds that run along the walls), which redden at the touch of the fingers, in the case of the tablet version, or of two cursors moved by the analog sticks of the joypad, in the case of the other versions (on PC and Mac it is also possible to play with mouse and keyboard, but it makes much less). The more the flower fills with color, the more the score rises and the more the pace of scrolling through the endless tunnels that make up the levels increases. The soundtrack changes accordingly, adjusting to the increased excitement. Said this way and looking at the images, the effect we are about to describe to you might seem incredible, but there is no doubt that the gameplay of Luxuria Superbia is somewhat disturbing, much more than any game in which sex has been represented so far. But more on that later. By trying and having several people try the Tale of Tales game, we recorded a certain discomfort, especially in some players who understood its nature without us explaining anything to them (in reality, rather explicit writings appear on the screen in the requests and in the images which they evoke). It was not easy to interpret the reactions, but we will come back to it in the next paragraph. For the rest there isn't much else to tell in terms of mechanics, except that the purpose of each level is to color the walls, but not to fill them all so as not to end the level before time (premature ejaculation). In short, you need to know how to stimulate the flower without exaggerating. Caress him giving him pleasure, without reaching orgasm before the time. Only in this way will it be possible to accumulate points and fill the garden with colours. Yes, but at this point it arises spontaneously to ask what is actually giving pleasure and why, despite the graphic abstractness, the action represented is so clear. Tale of Tales are back with a new controversial and disturbing conceptual work Who are Tale of Tales? Behind Tale of Tales there is a couple of artists, also a couple in life, who have chosen video games as an expressive medium for their art. Auriea Harvey and Michal Samyn, these are their names, have always tried to experiment with the videogame medium, with courageous products, often difficult to understand, which to most have appeared as cryptic. Among their works, The Endless Forest, The Path and the recent Bientt l't stand out. Also noteworthy is their production of critical texts on the videogame medium, disseminated above all via the internet, among which the Realtime Art Manifesto stands out (https://tale-of-tales.com/tales/RAM.html), a real artistic manifesto dedicated to video games (and not only). Electronic pleasure Playing it on PC it is more difficult to realize this, because a certain distance is still maintained between what happens on the screen and the control device. It is by trying Luxuria Superbia on a tablet that what we can define as the key to understanding the whole project emerges. Touching the screen, indeed, stroking the screen, you begin to feel more and more discomfort. Why never? At the beginning we think that, after all, given the theme, discomfort is a normal feeling, but it's not like that. Seen from the outside, Luxuria Superbia shows colorful tunnels with seemingly meaningless little objects, something that has more to do with 70s psychedelia than sex. In fact, it doesn't take long to realize you're masturbating with braces. This is how Tale of Tales decided to stage the relationship between Western man and new technologies, in a continuous lightly touching them, caressing them, touching them with the fingers, pressing them with more or less force and, in substance, give them the pleasure to function and the energy to do so. Then, after the relationship, clean them up and put them away in a corner, until the next embrace. It is the representation of the man-machine who gives pleasure to another machine while simultaneously experiencing an inexplicable and yearning aesthetic enjoyment, correlative to the nature of the act, but at the same time distant and alienating. It is not for nothing that one of the most common feelings when faced with Luxuria Superbia is rejection, especially after one has begun to understand the profound psychic mechanisms that it tries to stimulate or, better, after it has begun to stimulate them, leaving one disarmed and almost annoyed in front of to their unexpected surfacing in the ludic experience, the latter increasingly nuanced and in the background with respect to the underlying vision that regulates the process of putting into play in this case.", "date": "2013-11-28", "grade": "8.0"}
