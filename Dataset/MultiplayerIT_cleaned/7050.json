Hand in hand with the real counterpart, even MMA-based video games have been able to gather more and more support and new followers, in this case thanks to the skilful work of THQ and Yuke's, the pairing behind the successful series of games entitled UFC Undisputed which in recent years he has been able to re-propose all the realism and atmosphere of these disciplines in a playful key. After the closure of THQ in 2013, the rights of the UFC and the development of the games dedicated to it passed into the hands of Electronic Arts, which decided to focus on the new Sony and Microsoft consoles to create a title which, hopefully, will somehow continue the work of those who preceded it. In this sense, let's immediately say that with EA Sports UFC the Canadian company has tried not to distort the spirit of simulation which has been the strong point of Yuke's work, but at the same time making some compromises with certain mechanics, in order to try to expand the offer to all types of players, from veterans of the genre to newbies. Whether or not she succeeded in this project of hers we will find out together in the next few lines. UFC 2014 brings all the atmosphere and technique of mixed martial arts fighting to consoles Steel athletes However, let's proceed in order and let's first find out which modes are present in the game. The options available in this sense are the classic ones for the genre, even if to a lesser extent than what the THQ games offered: there are exhibitions, training challenges, the tutorial and the online mode, with Fighternet which along the lines of what the Canadian company offers in FIFA and in its other titles, it provides a series of services, information and statistics on everything related in this case to the world of mixed martial arts and the product. The network game itself, on the other hand, boasts a good matchmaking, and during our fights we found a good general fluidity and the almost total absence of lag, which certainly goes in favor of a production that really seems to enhance and push towards this mode. And this because although there is a Career mode, which as the title itself suggests allows you to impersonate any athlete to lead him between targeted training and fights to the death towards a bright future in the world of MMA, it is not particularly interesting because of a certain basic ease and a monotonous and not very varied progression, to the point of making it short and a little boring. In any case, for this area of play the fighter can be chosen at will from all those available on the roster, about a hundred men and women divided into classes based on weight, each of which is faithfully reconstructed in appearance and way of fighting. However, some legends such as Matt Hughes, Tito Ortiz or Ken Shamrock are unfortunately missing. Alternatively, it is still possible to create one from scratch with the appropriate editor, which although limited in certain aspects (for example, it is not possible to create a female wrestler or assign a name other than among the predefined ones that are proposed in the game), allows the himself to work on various physical and technical parameters for customization. For the rest, the fulcrum of the game clearly remains the combat and here, taking up the stylistic features of the various UFC Undisputed, Electronic Arts has also pressed its hand on their complexity, consequently setting up a deep and simulative gameplay. And this despite having implemented a command scheme created in such a way as to try to meet even the newbies of the genre. In this sense, however, it is right to highlight how ~simplification~ has not rhymed in principle with ~ease~, so the matches always evolve in a credible way and it is not possible to win or simply try your hand at a melee by pressing at random the buttons of the pad. Often the matches are resolved quickly with a powerful kick in the face, other times they can last longer thanks to the tactical skills of the contenders. In short, mastering the characteristics of a wrestler in the best possible way, which requires a not exactly soft learning phase, just as studying the opponent and planning one's moves and countermoves are essential elements to get to the bottom of a match, especially when one decides to play on a higher difficulty level than usual. Each key of the pad is entrusted with a different limb with which to strike, which varies in type and intdensity based on the use of the arrow keys. For example, advancing and striking allows you to deliver very powerful punches or kicks by exploiting the inertia of the body, while the analog stick makes the athlete perform more spectacular blows which obviously depend on the style of fight. However, everything must take place with a careful eye on the physical resistance of the fighter, otherwise a rapid and excessive consumption of stamina which could make him exposed and vulnerable in the event of an opponent's counterattack. On the defensive front, the right trigger is used to parry, perhaps in combination with the appropriate buttons to determine the height of the move, while with the left analog stick one wriggles out of the holds by moving the opponent away and getting back on his feet in the case of a fight Earth. The back buttons are instead assigned the holds with which to land the opponent. Unlike what happens in boxing, in mixed martial arts it is allowed to engage the clinch with the opponent, closing in an embrace of blood and sweat which, if well exploited, can lead to inflicting considerable damage. In these situations one can in fact try to take the position and hit a contender with a series of knees and elbows which in some cases can even lead to the KO. At least in reality: unfortunately in EA Sports UFC these phases of the fight do not always prove to be equally useful, given that despite certain well-aimed blows even in the face, it is difficult to be able to close a match when you find yourself hooked to the opponent. And that's even after they're knocked out. Playstation 4 trophies EA Sports UFC offers the public thirty-three trophies divided into ten bronze, nineteen silver, three gold and one platinum. To obtain them, you must meet the requirements of the game both playing online and offline, such as defeating an opponent within sixty seconds of the gong, completing Career Mode with at least a win rate of 85% or greater, or completing all challenges. A show like on TV With the right transition it is possible to bring one's ~enemy~ to the ground and gain an advantageous position, but ground fighting, one of the key elements for this kind of sport, despite providing a wide variety of submissions and joint locks with which to induce the contender to tap out using more or less complex combinations of back buttons and analog sticks, rarely leads to completely closing the match with a kneebar or a heel hook, especially against human opponents. In this sense, the game seems to reward those who defend themselves more than those who attack, and perhaps also for that speech we made earlier on trying to make life a little easier for new users, EA has made it easier to free yourself and get back on his feet, and thus avoid what happened instead with Yuke's games, where when a player met a better one he practically never managed to come out of his grips. From a purely aesthetic point of view, EA Sports UFC is a feast for the eyes. Thanks to the excellent use that the EA developers have made of the Ignite engine, the game is able to return to the user a high detail from many points of view, and anyone who sits in front of a screen cannot fail to experience the sensation of be watching an actual match on television rather than playing a video game. The PlayStation 4 version of the game, despite some drop in frame rate at the beginning of the matches, amazed us for details and graphic cleanliness, as well as for an obsessive attention to the models and physical details of the athletes, including tattoos, wriggling muscles under the skin, scars and anything else that characterizes them in this sense. Details that make the graphics spectacular and the fighters more realistic. Not to mention the faces that deform as a result of contacts or facial animations, capable of making their expressions change according to the progress of the match: suffering, disappointment, tiredness, joy and pain, every moment of the clash, every state of The mood resulting from a blow given or received is underlined precisely by the looks, by the contraction of the facial muscles, by the blood that flows away. On the other hand, we weren't too convinced by the physical animations of the athletes, which sometimes still seem a little stiff, and the management of the physics of the impacts: sometimes direct hits don't really go directly to the mark, but the opponent still seems to suffer it full. For the rest, the work of the audio technicians is good, with a series of interesting ringside samples that help the gamer to identify himself, and are therefore generally able to re-propose the whole typical atmosphere in a playful way. fighting arena of this sport.", "date": "2014-06-24", "grade": "7.5"}
