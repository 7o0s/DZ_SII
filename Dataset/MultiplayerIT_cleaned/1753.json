{"name": "Civilization 3 - Play The World", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/civilization-3-play-the-world.html", "text": "How to replace PTW In order to definitively solve the problem related to the compatibility of Civilization 3 PTW with the Italian version of Civilization 3, Infogrames has decided to replace, for anyone who has purchased an English copy of Civilization 3 and an Italian one of PTW, the PTW expansion pack working with a new, perfectly compatible PTW expansion pack. Anyone who has the non-functioning version of Civ 3 PTW must send it immediately to the following address: Infogrames Italia CA: Ufficio Marketing Viale Italia 82 20020 Lainate (Milan) The address to which to send the correct copy of Civ must be clearly indicated in the envelope 3 PTWs. The latter will be delivered to the address indicated starting from February 14, the date of availability at the Infogrames warehouses of the new Civ 3 PTW master The first details are not exactly insignificant Let's start immediately with some technical details: Play The World (from now on PTW) is an expansion of Civ3, therefore, without the original game it will not be possible to install it, let alone play it. The back of the DVD box of the Italian version of PTW ensures full compatibility with both the original game in English and with the Italian one. False: PTW Italian only works with Civilization 3 in Italian, despite what the game box promises. The new packs distributed to the sellers show the correction, with the right indications, with a nice yellow sticker placed right on the cover of the game but it is said that some ~buggy~ version has not remained on the market: the fact of not finding the yellow sticker , in fact, does not necessarily mean that the box in your hands is compatible with the English versions. An almost positive note, however, is the fact that just a few days ago Infogrames announced that in a few days the version compatible with all versions of Civ3 will be on sale and that by contacting Infogrames itself it will be possible to replace the old PRW with the new one. Once PTW has been installed, it is highly advisable to immediately download patch 1.14f or higher (always the Italian version) to be able to play in the best possible way in network matches even if, as we will see, network performance will never prove to be optimal. After that you'll be ready to conquer the world of the Internet and beyond. But what does PTW offer again? The most substantial additions certainly reside in the new (in a number of 8) civilizations added, in the implementation of new game modes (including the multiplayer one) and, almost a heresy to say, in the management of a new mode that does not include plus turns in favor of a contemporary and real-time game development. Then there is much more like the slightly expanded game interface in favor of some more interaction elements, new (albeit few) improvements that can be applied to your cities, new units and a new game editor with which it will be possible , as well as creating your own scenarios, customize some game features (such as terrain boxes or units). Something new Of course, the more experienced of you may have already had the opportunity to play CivNet (famous freeware clone of Civilization) therefore, even if thanks to an apocryphal title, you will know that for some time it was possible to clash against civilizations led by other human players. However, the official consecration given by PTW could represent, for fans, the only real reason for the purchase of this expansion. Both the HotSeat mode (several players taking turns on the same computer) and the one playable via Lan (and via the Internet) and the exquisitely snobbish one of PlayByEmail are supported. As many of you have already imagined, the introduction of Multiplayer has also made it necessary to create new ways of winning. If, in fact, in the solitude of one's living room the possibility of being able to play games of several hours of play (even if spread over several sessions already playing) is always well seen, however, with a view to clashing, perhaps during the lunch break, one the need to introduce faster but no less profound game modes has been made clear. We therefore have regicide, where the last civilization that gets eliminated a particular unit with obviously limited attack/defense characteristics and called, precisely, King (Lincoln for the Americans, Caesar for the Romans and so on) wins. Mass regicide: variant of regicide where, however, as expected, there are more than one King. Then there is the ~Capture the Princess~ mode which is nothing more than the usual CTF (Capture The Flag) mode known by all fraggerss of the world and which consists in having to capture the opponent's flag (princess) to bring it to one's controlled territories. Although there is a need for an understandable initial run-in, the new victory rules ensure a new variety of game and give Civ3, even in its single player mode, new lifeblood. Also with this in mind, the new ~semi-real~ time modes have been introduced: the one without shifts and the one with simultaneous movement which, thanks to a particular (although perhaps not spot on) reinterpretation of the shift concept, manage to compress the times dead, typical of this type of game, and to make multiplayer games faster  and more enjoyable. Multiplayer, mon amour Internet games are handled by the now ubiquitous GameSpy service and, surprisingly enough, require fairly fast lines. This means that with a simple 56 Kb modem it could be a real nightmare to be able to find a game server with an at least acceptable ping (in our tests we were hardly able to find pings lower than 500 milliseconds). Although PTW is not an action game, it is also undeniable that the delay in responding to our commands can, at times, not only annoy but also decide between victory between victory and defeat. Furthermore, since a slow link in the chain slows down even players without lag problems, many players will refuse to play against opponents with slow connections. It is important to note the fact that, in any case, the best performances will only be obtained by playing in Lan and this considering that we are not dealing with a latest generation FPS makes us smile a little. If the world of the Internet and multiplayer in general doesn't really fascinate you, then PTW offers you the opportunity to play on a certain number of predefined scenarios (mostly, however, already found by surfing the big net) and to be able to impersonate the Celts rather than the Spaniards or the Scandinavians. Obviously each of the new civilizations will have a new exclusive unit on its side: the Sipahi for the Ottomans, the Berserkers for the Scandinavians, the Ansar warrior for the Arabs and so on. Even the automation of units is now more customizable and manageable. In the case of workers, for example, we will be able to decide which improvements to allow them to implement/destroy or not. Furthermore, just above the Control Box, the cyclic display of all our cities and troops will now be faster and easier. The game, however, despite all the new buttons and shortcuts, useful for making life easier, still remains the same: with the same game engine, the same strengths and, basically, the same flaws. Do we rule the world? After experiencing the sensation of Multiplayer you will hardly be able to think of going back to playing Civilization in single player mode. The very concept of diplomacy takes on new and unexpected implications, furthermore being beaten by an opponent not because he cheated but because he used a better tactic gives unimaginable satisfaction. In short, if you have a lot of time available and a good connection then PTW is really recommended. But if you don't play multiplayer PTW is it worth all the money spent? The answer, of course, is by no means simple. Much will depend on how much Civilization III is still able to entertain you today: in fact, if you still play it assiduously it is possible that the addition of new features can further expand the fun. Of course the price of the expansion isn't exactly low, so think about it more than once. If, on the other hand, you have been bored with the classic Civ3 gameplay for some time, the few, even if substantial, improvements will hardly make you want to play again even if, it must be admitted, the new game modes will at least offer a new way of understanding the legendary Civ. Pro It's Civ, more and more Civ Multiplayer gives new life to the old Civilization 3 Game editor even richer and more powerful Cons Inefficient netcode Many of the additions could be added for free If you play only in singleplay the expense is not fully justified Let's play the world Like it or not it is useless not to want to admit it, Civilization 3 represents for millions of fans the non plus ultra of strategic games. Above all for all the faithful followers of the now legendary Sid Meier who however were - perhaps wrongly - disappointed by the controversial Alpha Centauri. However, many others, especially after the advent of come Europa Universalis, have begun to want to look for something more in what, for many, was simply called ~Turn-based strategy~. Civilization 3, on the other hand, just as it was already hinted at from the first advertising launch, was ~simply~: More and more Civ. The most ardent fans had seen this way of conceiving the third chapter of the saga as a real act of strength by the development team led by Jeff Morris capable of demonstrating how true classics do not need certain innovations. Act of force or not, in the end, Sid Meier (or whoever) seems to want to retrace his steps by offering us this revised and corrected version of Civilization III: Play The World.", "date": "2003-02-15", "grade": null}
