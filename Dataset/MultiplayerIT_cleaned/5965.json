Now let's find out if there is also a good game beyond appearances... Touch and run Starting from the application logo, The Walking Dead: No Man's Land suggests an absolute protagonist role for Daryl Dixon, one of the most loved characters of the TV series: in reality he limits himself to acting as a guide during the very first tutorial phases, and exhausted this task literally disappears from the scene never to return. Fortunately, the feeling of having been taken for a while is soon replaced by that of being faced with a strategist who may not be very original but competent in every aspect, who does not just rest on the laurels of a high-sounding name. The user must lead a handful of people in their fight for survival, dividing himself between the management of the base camp and the command of the individual units during the various missions. In the first case, the game behaves like practically any other belonging to the base building category: through a bird's eye view you have to build the various structures, upgrade them and exploit them to improve the characteristics and equipment of the characters, all while remembering periodically to collect the resources that are produced. The free to play nature of The Walking Dead: No Man's Land emerges forcefully in this area, with the costs of carrying out the various operations and related waiting times that are gradually becoming higher and forcing the user to a heavy ~grind~ or to reach out to your wallet by purchasing packs of the ever-present in-game currency. Nothing worse than what has already been seen in similar titles, however, with the possibility offered here too of earning valuable rewards by watching promotional films, often related to the television series itself. The Walking Dead: No Man's Land does not invent anything new but it is a valid free to play strategy A sprinkling of X-Com These are not the only references to the adventures of Rick Grimes and associates: the story behind the game (albeit very simple and decidedly placed in the background) travels on a parallel track, touching themes and places that will undoubtedly tickle the interest of the fans and which we do not mention here in order not to run into potential spoilers for all those who were not up to date with the episodes. During the missions, then, The Walking Dead: No Man's Land proves to be a sort of rose water XCOM that is anything but despicable: the management of the movements of the characters is completely similar to the tried and tested formula of the Firaxis title (albeit with some inaccuracies from the point of view of the interface and the control system) but the range of actions that can be performed is much more limited and above all closely linked with the class to which the various units belong, with shooters for example who can hit multiple targets lined up, scouts who are lethal in close combat with their knives, and thugs who deal less damage but can leave opponents stunned. Evidently aware that they cannot count on a very great structural depth, the developers of Next Games have focused heavily on an unpredictability factor which actually works quite well: every certain number of rounds the battlefield is invaded by new zombies, and there is no shortage of surprise appearances of walkers that can pop out from under a car or from a dumpster, forcing the user to quickly change strategy. All in a context in which the main objective of most of the missions is not to eliminate all enemies, but to collect certain objects or supplies and reach the designated escape zone with as few losses as possible: a pleasant change of perspective compared to to the average of mobile strategists, which somehow acts as a counterbalance to the very minimal originality of the product. Finally, it doesn't hurt that from a technical point of view The Walking Dead: No Man's Land defends itself quite well: the graphics are functional and defined and the sound more than decent, while only a few unfortunate stylistic and an initial load of the application not exactly lightning.", "date": "2015-10-17", "grade": "7.7"}
