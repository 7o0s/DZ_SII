{"name": "Occhio per occhio", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/91760-eye-divine-cybermancy-occhio-per-occhio.html", "text": "There are games that captivate you from the first moment, thanks to a narrative device or a particularly engaging situation. Let's think, for example, of the first sequences of Uncharted 2, with Drake waking up, injured, inside a railway carriage that is about to fall into the void. Naughty Dog's excellent title has certainly ~raised the bar~ as regards the artistic direction of video games, but there are numerous games capable of capturing attention right from the start. Here, unfortunately, Streum On Studio failed with the ambitious E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy, which in many ways is in antithesis with respect to the correct way of ~directing~ a videogame. Once a new game has started, he asks us to select a series of genes to give life to our character, who, depending on the choices made, will be able to boast a greater propensity for combat rather than an extraordinary ability with hacking procedures. No suggestions are provided in support of the operation, after which we find ourselves in a sort of ~stasis~ until we reach a luminous door, beyond which a cave awaits us. It is in this dark place that the ~tutorial~ relating to the control system takes place, as well as the first fight against an enemy creature, without however any presentation that explains who we are, what we are doing, why we are there. This whole phase is extremely slow and cumbersome. Arrived in front of an elevator, we press the button to start it but inadvertently descend from the platform, only to discover that there is no way to recall it and that therefore we have to start the game over if we don't want to use the very long staircase next to it. Sharp learning curve What appears clear from the first minutes is that the intention of the developers was to create a hardcore product, which requires a few hours just to be understood only to prove to be quite simple and linear in the structure of the missions. The guys at Streum On Studio have not bothered to introduce the executable actions as happens in any video game for several years now, in a progression made purely of gameplay, but have included video tutorials that should explain what to do in certain situations . A solution with an inevitably amateurish and very annoying flavor, which moreover finds little acceptance even in the current independent scene. The plot of E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy revolves around a secret society of which our character is a part, a society that has to face a series of external threats but at the same time a dangerous internal erosion triggered by two opposing factions. Dialogues with NPCs are numerous and relatively long-winded, but can provide a more detailed picture of the situation. The game does nothing to encourage us in this sense, however, and even a hasty approach to the experience can only leave a bitter aftertaste. The possibility of interacting with the dialogues, in Mass Effect style, opens the way to a series of alternative possibilities that make the carrying out of the missions quite dynamic, thanks also to the addition of secondary objectives. The RPG elements of the game are represented by the leveling of the character and the consequent access to weapons and powers initially blocked, but also the management of these aspects did not seem convincing to us. In fact, it is enough to approach one of the various armories to discover that it is possible to immediately use almost all the rifles, and that the only limit for the transport of equipment and ammunition is constituted by the scope of the inventory. The latter works a bit like that of the Resident Evil series, with a certain number of blocks that must be filled with weapons and objects of different ~dimensions~. Then the problem of the lack of progression returns, as you immediately find yourself armed to the teeth, without the need to conquer anything, ready to open fire against some enemy. Find and destroy The shooter dynamics of E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy appear well implemented: the weapons return a good sensation of impact and the choice to make the wounding of the basic enemies ~realistic~ (which therefore go down even with just a couple of well-aimed shots) works well in the context of missions. What doesn't work is the interface, absolutely bad and poorly organized. Putting aside the lack of support for the Xbox 360 controller (we tried to make it work, but the right stick remained unused), the layout of the commands proves cumbersome and awkward even for the keyboard and mouse configuration. Thankfully, looking into the options you can customizere the controls so you can use a hotkey to perform a certain action, but that's but confirmation of how poorly thought out the interface is. At a certain point in the plot, you start going around to access different types of missions, which usually involve completing multiple objectives, such as eliminating a target, hacking a device, and finally achieving a specific extraction point. However, the sensation is that of being in a sort of mission editor, see also the infinite respawn of enemies and their poor AI, which simply leads them to come forward, perhaps counting on their numbers, rather than perhaps lurking to give life to one firefight proper. As for the hacking procedures, you have to perform them through a fairly simple minigame but spoiled by some far from negligible limitations, which refer to the first part of the review, when we talked about character creation. If you don't stay on a balanced model, for example, and create a very strong warrior but with poor intellectual skills, then these minigames can become a little nightmare and in the more advanced stages we can hope to complete them successfully only if we buy upgrades special. Technical realization E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy uses the Source as graphics engine, a solution that is undoubtedly prestigious but by now very limited, which unfortunately Streum on Studio has not been able to exploit with the same effectiveness as Valve. The game moves rather fluidly even on medium-low configurations, such as the test one, but it is much heavier than products like Left 4 Dead 2, despite not fielding (even remotely) the same numbers. If, with the same resolution and maximum effects, the popular shooter with zombies runs at sixty frames per second with few uncertainties, E.Y.E does not reach forty. The cities in which we wander to complete the missions are excessively bare and poor, they look like multiplayer maps that have no narrative vocation. There's a bit of a Blade Runner vibe here and there, with glowing billboards standing out in the greenish mist, but overall it's all too empty and dull. The situation gets worse in locations where we have to move from one side to another, perhaps to talk to some NPCs, with huge spaces to cover that don't contribute in any way to making things more fun, on the contrary! Some design ideas are still valid, for example the appearance of our character and his ~colleagues~, a sort of modern samurai armed with a sword (with which they can even deflect bullets!) and rifles, but equipped with an animation just sufficient. Finally, the sound sector is too ethereal to add anything to the experience, and it's a shame because at least in this sense a little more effort could have been made.", "date": "2011-08-10", "grade": "5.5"}
