{"name": "EverQuest II: Rise of Kunark - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/everquest-ii-rise-of-kunark-recensione.html", "text": "Three years have passed since the launch of EverQuest 2, the sequel to one of the most important online role-playing games (or MMORPGs) ever, aimed at those looking for a more realistic and rigorous approach to this genre of videogame. Over the years there have been three official expansions (Desert of Flames, Kingdom of Sky and Echoes of Faywerd) and as many mission-packs (The Bloodline Chronicles, The Splitpaw Saga and The Fallen Dynasty), which have expanded the experience beyond belief gameplay, adding fascinating new environments and adventures. Rise of Kunark represents the fourth expansion for EverQuest 2 and once again Sony Online does not disappoint the players' expectations. The usual innovations are not few and in addition to the increase of the maximum level from 70 to 80 and the Achievement Point limit from 100 to 140, there is the inclusion of a new player race, the Sarnack, for a total now of 19 usable creatures. Welcome to Kunark Once the installation is complete and the latest updates have been downloaded (make yourself comfortable because it won't be a short matter), the time will come to create our avatar by selecting its race, physical appearance, class and alignment. Thanks to the power of the editor, creating unique characters is quite simple and you almost never run the risk of running into annoying copies of yourself. The game will start in the new city of Timerous Deep in Kunark, populated by the Sarnak, a race of reptilian men rather similar to dragons. The island mainly has cliffs, but continuing you will pleasantly realize how flora and fauna change from one area to another. The first missions lead the player to investigate the excavations that the colorful Haoaeran are carrying out in the surrounding areas, as it is believed they are about to unearth dangerous artifacts long forgotten. The learning curve is perfectly calibrated and the missions that are assigned are never too easy or too difficult. The variety of situations does not appear exceptional and in most cases we find ourselves having to defeat a certain number of creatures in an area of the map and then report. However, there is no shortage of particular quests, where for example we will be called to fish or track down missing characters who carry important information related to the plot. The excellent interface allows you to keep everything under control in just a few clicks and to customize the necessary information through the appropriate menus. Legends of Norrath One of the juiciest novelties of this expansion is made up of Legends of Norrath, an online card game accessible without leaving the game. To play just click the right mouse button on another user and press the appropriate item to challenge him; or from the menu icon at the bottom left to enter the main screen directly. After an exhaustive and highly recommended tutorial, you will have to choose one of the four standard decks (Fighter, Mage, Priest and Scout), each made up of 50 cards divided into various categories. It will obviously be possible to create one or more personalized decks, taking into account the limitations imposed by the game rules. Once this is done, it is possible to enter any of the rooms according to your level and embark on random challenges or personalized games. The actual game involves the annihilation of the opponent, while trying to get to the bottom of some quests that can bring considerable advantages during the game. As in the best Card Games, there are obviously cards that allow you to perform special attacks and other particularly powerful ones (some of which can be purchased at the shop). Of course, the basis of a victory is an accurate preparation of the deck and a solid knowledge of the cards available. Legend of Norrath is quite complex, but represents an interesting added value to Rise of Kunark. A bargain Graphics more beautiful than ever When EverQuest 2 arrived on the market three years ago, the graphics engine left everyone speechless for the incredible detail present, especially setting it to the highest levels. At the time, a message was displayed informing the user that not even the flagship configurations were capable of guaranteeing excellent fluidity at maximum detail. Although one still wonders what monsters of power the developers had, now the average configurations are much higher than then and the graphics system of the game is still in good shape, allowing most users to push the title to higher resolutions. On the test configuration, EverQuest 2 ran very well in the high details, but to get to the ultra details it is necessaryor a PC with at least 2GB of Ram and a fairly recent video card. In addition to the beautiful graphics, the game offers various standard and combat music, which will certainly make longer sessions enjoyable. PC - System Requirements Minimum Requirements Processor: Pentium III 1 GHz or AMD equivalent RAM: 512 MB Video Card: GeForce 3 with 64 MB Ram Disk Space: 10 GB 56k connection Recommended Requirements Processor: Pentium IV 2 GHz or AMD equivalent RAM: 1 GB Video Card: GeForce FX 5900 XT with 128 MB of memory Disk Space: 10 GB DSL Connection Test Configuration Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo 1.66 GHz RAM: 2 GB DDR2 Video Card: Geforce 7300 with 256 MB of memory Comment Rise of Kunark further extends the gaming experience in EverQuest 2, thanks to a solid story and proven gameplay, ensuring a long-lasting and at the same time deep gaming experience. Then the presence of all the expansions released up to now, represents a significant deal even for those who have snubbed the series up to now. Do not underestimate the still current graphics and the presence of the online card game Legends of Norrath. Pros Still great graphics Incredibly long-lived Great variety of environments and creatures Cons Completely in English Some missions a bit repetitive", "date": "2007-12-14", "grade": null}
