{"name": "Stellaris: Console Edition", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/stellaris-console-edition-recensione-ps4.html", "text": "Paradox has long been synonymous with quality strategy games on PC. A fame earned in the field thanks to the production of titles of the caliber of Universalis, Crusader Kings or Hearts of Iron, just to name a few, that is, games characterized by complex, deep and quite engaging stories and mechanics. A reputation confirmed just under two years ago by Stellaris, a production with which the developer temporarily abandoned the historical simulation, taking up a large part of the mechanics to adapt them in the distant future. The experiment worked, the reception was overall positive and therefore the game was chosen to act as a forerunner to the genre on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, facing a conversion process which, as we will see shortly, turned out to be all in all positive, able to guarantee a good experience for console players despite some sacrifices. The two editions Stellaris: Console Edition will be available in two versions: one ~smooth~, i.e. without additional content, which is the one used for this review; the other called Deluxe which will instead contain the Plantoid Species packages, Leviathans History and the Utopia expansion. An immense universe to be discovered In Stellaris: Console Edition the player finds himself having to manage a civilization, whatever it is, at the dawn of the colonization of space and with a society collapsing due to lack of resources for sustenance. At the beginning he is therefore called to select his race among the ten available, or to shape it from scratch through the dozens and dozens of parameters of the rich editor included. Then, after choosing whether to play alone or in multiplayer, to develop it and lead it on an adventure between the spatial depths; which, as per Paradox tradition, has almost nothing written and is entirely determined by the player's actions, by the relationships he maintains with other races (and which they maintain among themselves) and by the thousands of unpredictable possibilities that each new game brings with him. In fact, the universe and the plot of Stellaris slowly open up before the player, shaped by his decisions and his way of operating. Habitable planets, resources and alien peoples gradually reveal themselves, while minor and major events follow one another, marking a story with multiple facets and variables, yet with attention to every detail, capable of capturing the player's imagination for hundreds of hours if they it lets you get involved to the end, even thanks to the splendid soundtrack composed by Andreas Waldetoft, which acts as a succulent side dish to the work. There are in fact many options through which to develop one's own civilization, thanks to a well-layered and deep gameplay where obviously the strategic element is essential to manage the resources of one's faction in the best way, discover new technologies and use brute force or diplomacy to govern effectively and depending on whether you want to maintain good relations with the outside world or not. From this point of view, the Paradox title offers an excellent set of options for the policies to be adopted inside the borders of one's own Empire and outside, thanks to which the user can do a little bit of everything: if, for example, he chooses a diplomatic system, it can make economic or military agreements, exchange goods and technologies, develop new trade routes by opening its spaceports to the allies, while allowing them to cross its territories (and permission to pass through theirs), and so on. A particularly complex system, like every other aspect of the game, but also exciting for this reason, especially progressing in the more advanced scenarios, when the forces in the field are more and the relationships between the factions reach high levels of complexity, increasing the factors of stalemate or crisis. Space without borders Each event can be managed in real time or by pausing the action, but it is a pity that, given the amount of text present for the description of objects, dialogues and moments, and the very complexity of the genre, there is no localization in Italian. An element, this, which would have benefited those who do not know the available languages. Just as it would certainly have been good for the eye, in this case, to have an option that would allow pop-ups to come to the fore: the writings are very crisp and clear, but enlarging them would make it easier to read the various screens for those who play from one certain distance, as console owners usually do. Stellaris is a game that requires you to read many descriptions before making any decision, whether it is related to ~simple~ technological or military development projects, at the same timeexploitation of resources or key events for the evolution of one's population, and it takes a certain effort to do it a couple of meters from the TV. In any case, those who did not yet know the Paradox productions will have understood at this point that Stellaris: Console Edition is a game that requires a lot of dedication and passion in order to be discovered and enjoyed to the fullest, regardless of whether you are passionate about 4x strategic games or newbies who they want to approach the genre. This is why we could continue to tell about Stellaris for hours, and still not be able to describe it in every detail. And after all, this is not our goal (if you wish, you can further explore other aspects of the gameplay by reading the review of the PC version): in this article we rather aim to give you a clear idea of the game, and above all to describe its strengths and weaknesses of a technically valid and even intelligent port from the point of view of the controls. Adapt intelligently Even if the large number of calculations and simulations to be performed, especially when the match is in an advanced stage, have suggested to the developer to reduce the size of the space and eliminate a game speed, the maximum one, the title does not differ much. ideally, from the PC counterpart in its 1.7-1.8 update version, the basis on which the port was made. In fact, these are factors that do not affect the experience, given that they are ~limited~ only to adapting it. Similarly, for the interface, Paradox has tried to optimize screens and controls to try to make tasks easier for users: the map is then navigated using the analog sticks, which respectively control the cursor and the camera, leaving the player free to change the sensitivity so that you can find your preferred setting. With the lower backbones you adjust the zoom distance, while with the upper buttons, i.e. on PlayStation 4 triangle, square, X and circle, the speed of time and pause, a couple of simple shortcuts, the selection and confirmation of an action and, finally, the cancellation of the same. The menus, intelligently positioned at the edges of the screen, so as not to be invasive, can instead be accessed comfortably by using the keys on the directional cross, through which you can quickly recall all the possible choices concerning resource management (above), alerts in time royal (bottom), control of every aspect of the Empire (left), and monitoring colonized planets and naval fleet (right). To navigate within them use the R1 and L1 buttons, to pause the game the Select key. Everything happens fluidly and quite quickly, and those used to using the pad almost immediately find themselves at ease, confirming that the direction taken to transport an interface and controls designed for mouse and keyboard on the controller was the right one. Of course, in the long run you may feel the lack of shortcuts and quick choices, especially in recurring operations, as well as the precision and speed of execution guaranteed by the mouse and keyboard, but we believe that it could hardly have been done better. For the rest, going to close by taking a quick look at the technological side, we have nothing particular to report for this edition, except that graphically Stellaris: Console Edition is similar to the computer counterpart and therefore visually it is pleasant, but not impressive . On the other hand, the aesthetic aspect has never been among the strengths of the game.", "date": "2019-02-22", "grade": "8.0"}
