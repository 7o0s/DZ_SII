Although the game does not shine in its scenographic and narrative originality, it catapults the player into a highly engaging environment, in which the plot of the game does not matter, but above all the action and fun. No time is wasted chatting at Soldner and it gets straight to the point. The character entrusted to us, a soldier, in this case a mercenary, finds himself in a military camp equipped for immediate dispatch to one of the nerve centers of the battle. The player is called immediately to choose the mission to carry out, unique references, the place where the mission will take place, the ultimate goal and the departure date. Once the necessary calculations have been made and the destination selected with the same ease with which it is taken from the ATM near the house, the player is spawned in the military base closest to the place in question. Here we find the same reference points as the starting base camp. Inside the fenced perimeter of the base it will be possible to find, in addition to the briefing computer, several barracks marked with somewhat explanatory symbols. Through these stations you can quickly access a menu through which you can select the equipment to be used during the mission. The number of weapons and vehicles available is staggering. Depending on the missions the player will have to select the most effective and useful weapons. In fact, the maximum load is rather limited, so you must be very careful not to bring superfluous weapons onto the battlefield. Every time you leave for a new mission you must always rely on the same supply of weapons and means. If the soldier is killed during an action, the weapons and vehicles, if still intact, remain on the ground in the same position. Simulating an evolutionary political background is one of Soldner's strengths The game revolves entirely around the idea of short hit and run campaigns, in which you are called to take command of a team of mercenaries on a mission. Given the characteristics, the game lends itself perfectly to being played in multiplayer, a mode that adds much more depth to the gaming experience. Soldner was born with the idea that multiplayer is one of its strengths. The servers support games of 32 players up to a maximum of 128. Furthermore, great space is left to the imagination of the players also in the choice of combat uniforms (we go from a paramilitary style, to civilian clothes, up to sophisticated uniforms with an attractive look, moderately futuristic). The multiplayer game has three modes. ~Extract~ sees players engaged in recovery missions (such as rescuing a hostage from the enemy), ~Destroy~ proposes a target for each team to destroy, while ~Conquest~ sees players engaged in a sort of race for the conquest of a map area. The game in Single Player mode, on the other hand, offers a game structure with missions, capable of evolving according to the choices made by the player and the outcome of the battles. In fact, the geo-political structure of the world in which one is immersed changes based on the events piloted by the player, who becomes the architect of his own fate and at the same time a potential victim of his own conduct in the game. The simulation of an evolutionary political background is one of Soldner's strengths, which does not claim to offer a rich and compelling plot but can certainly impress the player for its longevity due precisely to this dynamism and changeability. A scary arsenal! And you haven't seen the garage yet... Over fifty types of firearms and more than thirty vehicles flank the action on the battlefield. The weapons respond just like the original models, the behavior of the piece is reported in a very accurate and faithful way, complete with recoil and loss of precision following a burst. But the best tactics revolve around the prudent use of means of transport, real aces up the sleeve of the good strategist. In fact, every single vehicle has certain characteristics that make it unique and best applicable in certain situations. Cars, for example, have different driving characteristics, there is one that better resists shocks (very dangerous because they can lead to a fatal explosion of the vehicle), and there is one that better resists bumpy terrain, avoiding lethal oversteers. As if that weren't enough, heavy and light tracked vehicles are also available for more massive actions, without forgetting the fundamental air support. It is even possible to parachute from the velivjust in flight A scary arsenal! And you haven't seen the garage yet... In fact, it will be possible to fly combat or transport helicopters (a far from simple feat) to reach the goal in a flash, even parachuting from the aircraft in flight (sensational!). Instead, aircraft will come in handy for targeted bombing and high explosive action. The vehicle control interfaces appear rather sparse but functional. Obviously the control has been simplified so as not to distract the player's attention too much from the objective of the game, which certainly is not to learn the secrets of flying techniques and driving heavy vehicles. Soldener requires the player to be extremely careful with these resources, given the limited number of weapons and vehicles available in the initial stages of the game. This is underlined by the fact that the prize for a successfully completed mission is just a piece to add to one's reserve (be it a vehicle, a medkit or a weapon). The inevitable De Tecnica The graphic apparatus does not disappoint the eyes of the most savvy, even if we are far from the masterpieces of recent times. The hardware demands aren't particularly intractable, but the notation on the game's official site that the game offers the best performance with the new 64-bit processors is perhaps not just an obvious publicity stunt. The character models are well done, as are the movements they make. The external setting almost never appears bare and is quite varied, even the trees and grass are well done. The buildings, on the other hand, despite being entirely open to visitors, often turn out to be too bare, but their goal is certainly not to offer a showcase of modern furniture but rather to provide a respectable position for the sniper trigger. The environment is totally modifiable, trees and buildings can be destroyed, completely or partially, as they can also catch fire and, depending on the nature, explode with exciting results not only from a graphic point of view. Music and sound effects, on the other hand, appear disarming and repetitive: much more could certainly have been done on this front. Playability, provided you can use a machine that avoids frequent frame rate drops, is respectable and acquires greater depth in the multiplayer version, highlighting the tactical and strategic aspect which is the peculiarity of this genre of FPS tactical. Comment Soldner: Secret Wars seems to be the right shooter for all those who prefer fast and lightning-fast action to reflexive and stationary. Equipped with a decent graphic apparatus and an enormous availability of weapons and means, it shouldn't disappoint those who are already accustomed to shooting digital bullets. Those approaching the genre for the first time should consider that there are certainly more accessible and direct titles available around. A game for war addicts, virtual of course. Pros: Numerous weapons and vehicles available Fast actions, hit and run In multiplayer up to 128 players on special servers Cons: Sound KO Vehicles not always controllable The interiors of the buildings are often unreally bare Not even war will ever be the same again. In 2010, war is no longer for everyone. There are costs, costs of all kinds that prevent the common development of events. It's not like you wake up in the morning and bomb this or that city. And then there are many, too many interests by now in every nation of the world for the superpowers, and we can no longer afford bad impressions. This is how the war decided to hide from the eyes of the majority and to become secret. A war as ruthless as it is hidden and subtle. Far from prying eyes, in the nerve centers of the globe, men and vehicles still clash for supremacy and control of strategic positions and wealth. And the soldiers, almost no longer exist, in their place hundreds, perhaps thousands of mercenaries, war professionals and artists of destruction. There is no sophisticated plan or well-calculated strategy that takes into account a slapstick assault, conducted by those who have found a job, and a well-paid one. This tells Soldner: Secret Wars, and we are called to dive headlong into this scenario.", "date": "2004-07-19", "grade": null}
