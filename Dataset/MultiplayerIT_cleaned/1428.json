{"name": "Empires: l'Alba del Mondo Moderno", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/empires-lalba-del-mondo-moderno.html", "text": "The history of peoples The characterization of the population has been carried out in an excellent way, paying close attention to the historical realities of each faction. Each available upgrade, each building and unit is linked to the game by introductory captions which carry out the task of historically contextualizing each function. The Franks, for example, having historically been great farmers and builders of buildings, are not subject to expenses related to cultivation for the production of food, nor subject to the duty to build houses (the classic farms of any self-respecting RTS) to support the production of units. The search for new weapons and their enhancement, uniquely linked to the advancement of the era, can then give the player particular bonus powers that can be managed with aces up their sleeve to be pulled out at the most appropriate moment. These capabilities, usually sought after within universities, identifiable as real ~secret weapons~ once prepared will be identified on the interface by the respective icons that will distinguish the various functions. A secret weapon such as the ~deforestation~ of the Franks, for example, will be able to eliminate in a very short time, in an open point of the map to our liking, an extensive area of forest, to thus allow the passage of troops in inaccessible places. A very varied series of deadly weapons to study and keep with care will very often be the trump card to conclude bloody and apparently hopeless battles. Classic and spotless The gameplay, as already mentioned, faithful to the classic standard provides for the usual structure. The different game modes offer different approaches to the title. Multiplayer matches or on random maps will allow a vertical climb along the timeline, thus leading the player to live the experience of following his own civilization in a slow technological evolution to defeat the enemy. The campaigns, on the other hand, offer a more limited vision in the range of action, but, on the other hand, more compelling due to the story linked to the various missions, the presence of heroes and special units not available in skyrmish games and for the possibility of experiencing real historical reconstructions (moreover very well done). The three campaigns touch on three different periods and above all three different peoples and plots. The first revolves around the events related to the young Richard the Lionheart grappling with betrayals of his father's crown, intrigues and bloody battles for power, the second offers an oriental scenario featuring the battles linked to Korean history and the conflict with the Chinese neighbors, while the third proposes the military enterprises of the allies, in conflict with the Nazi troops in Africa and Europe during the Second World War. The possibility of playing in multiplayer, now a consolidated tradition of every self-respecting RTS, is supported by the ubiquitous GameSpy and offers numerous game modes that vary from the usual skyrmish game, or the classic clash on a set map. The possibility of playing by connecting directly to the IP of the friend who acts as a server also gives the possibility of circumventing the Gamespy control, with the advantage of being able to directly control the connection (as, moreover, it already happened years ago, when there were no control for multiplayer game). The game also contains an editor for creating totally customized maps, scenarios and campaigns; it is not a very intuitive tool, but after a few attempts you can easily make your first creations and test them directly from the program. Technicalities A technical comment, a brief analysis of the level of achievement, cannot be missing. The graphic design with which Empires presents itself to the public is respectable, with a very high level of detail, which allows extreme zooms to admire the excellent workmanship of the unit and building models and panoramic views that are very useful in open-field battles . The ability to control all kinds of units, whether land, sea, amphibious or air, makes the game scenario even more spectacular, with heterogeneous, but no less harmonious elements that fill the game view with a truly engaging effect. Although the game has a limit on the production of units, regulated with the classic maximum population ceiling, the game can support a practically infinite number of units arranged on the battlefield, which guarantees truly spectacular scenarios. Imagine the effect of seeing hundreds of units on the field fighting in a fight to the death, a pleasure for every true lover of strategyfieldy. The player's commander skills will be tested even more by having a large number of formations for their troops. Once the groups to be assigned to the quick selection keys have been formed, it will be possible to organize your units in different arrangements, in order to make the attack or defense of the objective more effective. The well-developed artificial intelligence will make the task of controlling very large areas, otherwise impossible to govern, easier, together with the possibility of assigning to each single unit the line of behavior to follow in case of visual contact with the enemy. Final comment Overall Empires: Dawn of the Modern World covers every aspect that the typical RTS player looks for in a title of the genre: good graphics, very detailed and with attention to detail, a fully configurable game camera, a large number of units and available buildings, four civilizations, increasing to eight total, a considered time span of more than a thousand years, and air, sea, and land units. The campaigns combined with the numerous single-player and multiplayer game modes give the game a certain longevity. We therefore feel obliged to direct all those who have loved games of this genre to purchase this title. They will hardly be disappointed. Pros: Detailed and well cared for graphics Well characterized and specialized populations Good number of game modes Cons: Perhaps not too original The close-ups, while spectacular, are very useless Soundtrack a bit monotonous As often happens for such a beloved genre as that of strategic games with a historical background, it sometimes happens that we find ourselves faced with concepts that have already been visited, but somehow re-proposed to the public to provide their own vision of the product. This is the choice that the Activision developers have made by proposing the title in question to the market. The attempt is certainly not that of providing a revolution in the field of real-time strategists, also because, as we know, there are very few innovations in these times, but that of providing one's contribution to the people of strategists from all over the globe with a game that is as choral for the large historical-geographical range proposed as well as well cared for for the good level of realization. If in your life you have ever touched monumental titles such as Age Of Empires, Empire Earth or the most recent Rise of the Nations, it is therefore normal that you have stumbled upon Empires on your way. On the other hand, the starting point is always the same, that is the often successful union of the classic RTS setting with a good number of civilizations to use, and as many upgrades to obtain. Those who have a memory, and not too long, and a minimum of experience in the field will remember well the evolutionary steps that timidly brought games like Age of Empires, purely linked to a thin epochal mirror, to take much wider periods into consideration. The leap was made by Empire Earth, which, while exceeding from time to time in slightly too imaginative poetic licenses, proposed a truly wide playable time frame. At the time, the game allowed you to start the game with civilizations having a technological development equal to that of cavemen, and then go back along the spirals of the ages, through research and inventions passing through the various metal ages up to the modern and beyond up to the elusive and all too science fiction era ~nano technology~. Empires: Dawn of the Modern World proposes a similar but different vision. The time span seems shorter, but civilizations are much more differentiated and linked to historical events that actually occurred. Starting point the Middle Ages, point of arrival the Second World War. The four civilizations initially proposed, namely the English, the Franks, the Koreans and the Chinese will be the protagonists of the scene up to the gates of the First World War, a breaking point with the ancient world and a starting engine for a rapid entry into the Modern World. At this point, just as happened in the real history of our world, the old civilizations will lose their initial identity to transform themselves into modern peoples, born of alliances, geopolitical evolutions and great revolutions. French and no longer Franks, like the Germans, Russians and Americans, will thus enter the field. The player will be asked, based on his preferences which faction to switch to, given that each ancient civilization has the possibility of switching to one of the two modern civilizations most linked to it (for example the Franks will be able to choose to switch from theand of the modern French or that of the Germans).", "date": "2003-12-30", "grade": null}
