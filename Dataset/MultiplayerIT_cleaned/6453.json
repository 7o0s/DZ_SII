In operations of this type, usually, the main objective is to reach all those consumers who had not had the opportunity to play a certain title in its original incarnation, but we also try to make some improvements capable of arousing the interest of that circle of more passionate fans willing to retrace their steps. Borderlands: the Handsome Collection instead prefers to adopt a clearer approach, focusing everything on an exceptional playful offer for newcomers and leaving only a few crumbs for long-time crypt hunters  Pandora again That Borderlands is a successful franchise is shown by the figures, which speak of around 12 million copies sold by the second chapter since its release in 2012 to date, with two million units placed in the last year alone: a constant and continues also thanks to the Gearbox support plan, which has planned a whole series of DLCs capable of significantly extending the life of a title that is already extremely long-lived and rich in content. A similar argument can also be made for the more recent Borderlands: the Pre-Sequel, perhaps less disruptive in terms of takings but still also characterized by a significant amount of downloadable expansions released on a regular basis following its debut on the market. In light of all this, no great words are needed to express how inviting the offer of Borderlands: the Handsome Collection can be for those who have never approached the series yet, but it is enough to make a trivial list: here, therefore, is that in the package found space Borderlands 2, Borderlands: the Pre-Sequel and every single DLC released for both titles, from extra campaigns to new playable characters up to skins and modifiers of all kinds. We are talking about twenty expansions in all that make up a mammoth amount of gameplay in which it is possible to literally get lost for hundreds of hours, always provided that you live the experience through that co-operative mode which is the true essence of the game. However, we invite you to go and read our reviews of Borderlands 2 and Borderlands: the Pre-Sequel if you want to have specific information on the value of individual products, while now we will analyze in detail what's new in this collection at beyond the mere accumulation of content. For those who have never set foot on Pandora, Borderlands: the Handsome Collection is a great deal Playstation 4 trophies Also on the trophies front, Borderlands: the Handsome Collection does not distort things, simply proposing what already exists in the two individual chapters released for the past generation of consoles: we are therefore talking about a total of 70 trophies for Borderlands 2 and related expansions and 64 units for Borderlands: the Pre-Sequel and its DLC. The same goes for the game itself: for new users it is mind-boggling material, for veterans a heated soup. A little new, a little old Let's start with what is the minimum wage for a proper remastered, or rather the graphic update: in this context, Borderlands: the Handsome Collection is not surprising, limiting itself to proposing on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 what have always been its appearances on PC, with 1080p resolution, 60 frames per second, slightly more defined textures and a wider visual horizon. The only real novelty lies in the support for the double split-screen which therefore allows a maximum of four users to play locally on the same screen: a feature which, however, to tell the truth, will only be useful to that small percentage of the gifted audience of a very large television and three friends with as many pads, all coming to terms with a halved frame rate and with decidedly awkward menu navigation. Borderlands: the Handsome Collection therefore presents itself to newbies at the best of the possibilities offered by its now somewhat elderly graphics engine, while for longtime fans the technical improvements really appear too marginal to justify a possible purchase on their own. Different speech for those who want to continue the adventure started on last generation hardware on a new console, given that Borderlands: the Handsome Collection allows the migration of an existing character with all itsand stats and related equipment, albeit with some limitations that are worth noting. In fact, it is possible to carry out the operation only with systems of the same family (therefore from Xbox 360 to Xbox One or from PlayStation 3 or PlayStation Vita to PlayStation 4, but without crossings) and to do so it is necessary to still have the old console of a copy of the game, connect to the network and download the patch that enables the transfer. An undoubtedly cumbersome process, which however rewards users who will carry it out with 75 golden keys, a good pile of Tokens Hard and extra elements for the character to be exploited in Borderlands: the Handsome Collection. Based on what has just been reported, it is even more evident how the 2K collection is intended almost exclusively for that audience who - for the most disparate reasons - had never even touched the Borderlands experience: for all those who belong to this category and are intrigued by the very particular combination of first-person shooter and RPG dynamics that is typical of the series, the advice is absolutely to consider buying Borderlands: the Handsome Collection and perhaps to convince a friend to do the same to fully enjoy of the fantastic online co-operative mode of the Gearbox title. For longtime fans, however, all that remains is to wait with hope for Borderlands 3 ...", "date": "2015-03-27", "grade": "7.8"}
