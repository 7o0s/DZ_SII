{"name": "AKIBA'S TRIP: Hellbound & Debriefed", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/akibas-trip-hellbound-debriefed-recensione.html", "text": "If today you can read the review of AKIBA'S TRIP: Hellbound & Debriefed it is due to some curious circumstances. Fans of the series (you should find some around), and with them probably the developers themselves, will answer you that this remaster comes following the success of AKIBA'S TRIP: Undead & Undressed, a game that sold something like half a million copies. Now, regardless of the interweaving of the names which makes it practically impossible for most to orientate themselves within the franchise, also because they have been changed several times in the transition from the eastern to the western edition, AKIBA'S TRIP: Undead & Undressed is not a title recent. It arrived on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita in 2014, then on PlayStation 4 in 2015 (this here, elsewhere even earlier). AKIBA'S TRIP: Hellbound & Debriefed is even earlier, it practically coincides with the beginning of the saga. The remaster of this true fossil of the PlayStation Portable era has not been planned following the millions of units sold, but is simply an attempt to celebrate 10 years of the franchise (2011-2021). Reading the review from this point of view, you will wonder if, all in all, the operation made sense and above all if it could not have been done better. Plot: Vampires and secret agencies AKIBA'S TRIP: Hellbound & Debriefed, hitting everything and everyone is fun (for a while) The core storyline of AKIBA'S TRIP: Hellbound & Debriefed revolves around creatures of darkness known as Shadow Souls. Kageyashi, in original language: something like ~dwellers of shadows~, ~creatures of darkness~. These are vampires who need the blood of ordinary humans to survive and maintain their powers (they are more agile, strong and generally dangerous than other living beings). For the rest, no one with the naked eye would be able to distinguish a Shadow Soul from any other Japanese girl around the Akihabara district. Of course, things are bound to change. The protagonist of the adventure, played by the player, is the young Akihiro Tanaka (but you can change his gender, name and every detail immediately before starting the game), who is quickly brought to death by one of the city's vampires, Yuu Abeno. Luckily, the sister of the Shadow Soul in question was also nearby, Rui Fumitsuki, who - moved to pity by Akihiro's fate - decides to give her part of her blood, thus transforming the protagonist in turn into one of the supernatural beings that infest Akihabara. From here on, the story is in the hands of the player. Akihiro is recruited by NIRO, Akihabara's secret agency which tries to stop the advance of the creatures of darkness in every way and which has patented a perfect fighting system to send them definitively to the other world. The protagonist gets to know many other secondary characters, some more stereotyped and banal than others, but all somehow ~justified~ by the narrative needs. The interesting aspect of the story mode of AKIBA'S TRIP: Hellbound & Debriefed, today as it was ten years ago, lies in the possibility of influencing the outcome of the story. There are indeed different endings, depending on whether you choose to stay on the side of NIRO, to switch from that of the Shadow Souls, or finally to opt for the third way of coexistence. Don't expect incredible twists, unexpected revelations or particularly original outcomes: but it is good that a little autonomy and choice is left to the player himself. Gameplay: See how I undress you AKIBA'S TRIP: Hellbound & Debriefed requires first beating up enemies, then undressing them. Because yes. That the gameplay of AKIBA'S TRIP: Hellbound & Debriefed was particular you should have guessed it already from our recent test. The Acquire title remains an action-tinged RPG, but you would hardly find anything else even vaguely similar to the undressing mechanics elsewhere. If the game's enemies are vampires, in fact, the only way to get them out of the way once and for all is to have them incinerated in the sunlight... a fate that could also happen to the protagonist himself, who would inevitably run into the game over. Removing your opponent's clothes in a video game, as a combat mechanic, is part of that very particular eroticism that the land of the Rising Sun has practically always fed on. But the drift is never vulgar, because those points of the human body you're probably thinking about are always hidden from view by underwear (a necessary contradiction, because otherwise the publication of the game would have been blocked altogether). The mechanics of undressing are illustratedtreated to the player in the first hours of the game by a real professional of the sacred technique; in fact, it all comes down to pressing three basic commands repeatedly, which weaken the opponent. Suitably beaten, the command will then appear on the screen that will be performed to eliminate a certain portion of clothing from the enemy. Once the upper, central and lower parts have been eliminated, the opponent will be defeated: at this point, if he is a human being he will run away; if it's a Shadow Soul, it will disintegrate. We expected an enhancement of some kind, a refinement of the possibilities in the course of the main adventure, but all in all this will have to be enough for you in the fights. Playstation 4 trophies Getting the Platinum Trophy of AKIBA'S TRIP: Hellbound & Debriefed won't be a walk, because you will have to complete the title by obtaining all the endings, completing all the secondary challenges (even those of the various factions) and finally playing on the highest difficulty level . Of course, for fans of the franchise it will be a joke. Arm yourself with holy patience and maybe bring some garlic against vampires. Exploration and customization: an aged title If the plot of AKIBA'S TRIP: Hellbound & Debriefed does not arouse your interest and the gameplay will bore you after a while, you could still bet everything on other interesting aspects of the production, which have remained (like all the others) substantially unchanged since 2011. Exploration, for example: because there really was a certain effort in rebuilding the Akihabara district, as well as some places and the surroundings of Tokyo. All of these areas slowly become accessible from the main map, chapter by chapter, and can be reached via simple on-screen navigation. However, inside each area, walking around is then strongly limited by the presence of invisible walls and the inaccessibility of the internal rooms. In fact, it is not possible to really explore the inside of the many buildings or houses: even the shops that sell pieces of equipment are reduced to simple menus. AKIBA'S TRIP: Hellbound & Debriefed, technically speaking, that's enough... and nothing more Speaking of shops, this is where alter ego customization comes in. Cosplayer accessories, new weapons, consumables to be used as needed, everything can be purchased or obtained by completing side missions. The pieces of equipment can be improved by respecting certain conditions, and in general after the first five or six hours of the game it is advisable to go and bother the enemies only if they are in adequate resistance conditions. It is clear that the repetitive factor is inevitable, and it will overbearingly remind us of all the limits of a product which, although unprecedented in our country, is still designed for platforms of two generations ago. More than a remaster, which, moreover, does not even excel in the solidity of the frame rate, nor in the visual quality of the individual game elements, there would have been a need for a remake. This if the intent had been to seriously celebrate a ten-year franchise: with AKIBA'S TRIP: Hellbound & Debriefed in your hands, it is legitimate to have some doubts.", "date": "2021-07-20", "grade": "6.2"}
