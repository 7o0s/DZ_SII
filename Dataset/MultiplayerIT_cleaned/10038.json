Forget spin-offs (Street Fighter EX), parallel series (Alpha/Zero) or cross over (VS Capcom, Tatsunoko). Finally the original, the classic, the real stainless and inimitable classic of the classic fighting games is back with the steroid version of the ~perfect~ sequel: Super Street Fighter 4 is on the shelves! Just like the second chapter, this time too it's time to perfect and expand what already seemed to be a game that was difficult to improve and untouchable in its deep balances. To the battle cry: ~Bigger, Better, Stronger!~, Capcom has taken up his latest effort, has updated, revised, corrected and enhanced it to create the ~perfect chapter~ that no one until a few years ago would never have dreamed. It is precisely by looking for a return in grand style, in the wake of what was Street Fighter 2 and following in its footsteps, that the Osaka-based company is reproducing today this new Super Street Fighter 4. A modern classic founded on the solid foundations that made it famous the series around the world for nearly two decades, and built with today's audience in mind, expertly blending that inimitable magic in gameplay with the modernity of recent technologies available. Street Fighter on steroids The characterization of Super Street Fighter 4 takes up a cartoon style but is made entirely in 3D instead of the classic two-dimensional sprites. Fans who, having not tried Street Fighter 4, still had doubts about the ~timing~ of the moves or the physics of the contacts offset by the triangles can once again sleep peacefully: the major work done by Capcom was precisely to make their perfect game and smooth as oil from this point of view, just like the previous two-dimensional Street Fighter, in which the precision and timing in the execution of the moves bordered on mania. As any good SF player knows, each hit, combo or Super is entered into a scale of ~priorities~ of the CPU that decides how and when to let them enter or not enter the keystroke sequence during a fight. Well, Super Street Fighter 4 is a further step forward compared to the previous version, resulting more refined and even better balanced, while counting on the new characters included and a respectable global roster. Capcom's strength lies right there: knowing how to create a game that is so varied, large and thick but also balanced and perfectly functional in all its complex (but simple to master) game mechanics. The Super chapter adds ten more fighters, for a total of 35 fighters, all selectable immediately. Many old acquaintances and welcome returns are added to the already large roster of SFIV: the feline Ibuki, the boxer Dudley, Makoto and the protagonists of Final Fight Cody and Guy. From Super Street Fighter 2 also returns the Indian T-Hawk and his grips, the dancing Deejay with his footwork, the long levers of Adon. The new entries Hakan, a Turkish wrestler, and the beautiful Juri, a Korean Tae-Kwon-Do fighter, are well placed in the colorful and lively context that characterizes the SSFIV fauna, which now has 10 more characters. Being a stand-alone chapter (and not an expansion) the game doesn't work online with the previous chapter, and not only for the new characters introduced but also for a more balanced and revised gameplay that is different and incompatible with the mother episode, as well as due to the inclusion of new moves and Supers. Xbox 360 goals Even Super Street Fighter 4 is no exception and puts the classic 1000 unlockable points on the plate to be unlocked through 50 objectives divided between the offline modes for about 20%, the execution of a certain number of combos, Super or Ultra for a another 20% and the remainder regarding one's online career. It is not at all easy to unlock most of the achievements and a lot of patience and dedication is required. More fighters, but the balance is safe Not only do the most mistreated historical characters such as Guile and Dhalsim return once again, but a great job of differentiating the clone characters following the Shotokan (rotary kick, hadoken and shoryuken) has also been done: Ryu, Ken, Akuma and Sakura are today more diverse than ever. As for the raw gameplay, for newcomers to the series it is necessary to talk about the Focus System already seen in SFIV, and even more effective and simple to perform than the old Street Fighter III Parry Defenses, perhaps more dedicated to those who are inclined more to attack than those who defend better. Focus Attack allows the player to absorb the opponent's hit with a counter cpunch performed by simultaneously pressing the medium kick and punch buttons. The longer the pressure is, the greater the counterattack, which moreover can in turn be interrupted to generate special moves such as combos or Ultra Combos. Surely someone may still prefer the good old Parry, but equally certainly the Focus system works very well, and is within the (manual) reach of a greater number of people. The aforementioned Ultra Combos are a new, spectacular and satisfying way of ringing a series of punches, kicks and moves in series. The camera changes its two-dimensional position and enters the background polygons, rotating around the wrestlers and showing the combo in all its spectacular destructiveness. Each wrestler has a different number of Ultra Combos available, but this does not affect the general balance of the game because they are essentially only choreographed moves with the same attack potential. Blanka owns three, while Gen even reaches 4, two for each of his styles. But regardless of the known characteristics of SFIV (there is still the Super bar which, once filled, allows the execution of EX and combos), in the Super version new Ultras have been created with even more spectacular animations and choreography such as the gigantic Sonic Guile's Hurricane. the frantic and highly competitive game action (especially online) requires a good arcade stick in order not to damage the fingertips, bones and joints of the hands, and perhaps this is the biggest physical limitation of this game. Each character has an unpublished costume, for a total of three different characterizations to which will be added the paid ones readily available according to a well-paced weekly programming starting from May 11th. Even more perfect Still present the beloved historical stage bonuses such as the destruction of the barrels or the car, but above all the online lobby system that allows you to watch, organize and start meetings at any time. The new Team Battle groups and manages groups of players and squads based on their experience points, allowing for 4v4, 2v2 or 1v1 multiplayer matches, all while chatting lightheartedly as we watch each other's games. The Replay channel allows you to study opponent techniques, moves and combos by being able to record and watch each user's games, an option already appreciated in the recent Arc System BlazBlue. Your matches are automatically saved and we can access them at any time to study them and understand the causes of a possible defeat, just like it was a real competitive sport (and actually, in a certain sense, it is). The ~Endless~ mode, on the other hand, is nothing more than a sort of lobby made up of eight people who compete in rotation, in a sort of group in which the loser leaves and the person in queue takes over. The new Online Tournament option, on the other hand, is a knockout competition just like the good old Dragon Ball ~Tenkaichi~ tournament, or the final stages of a soccer competition, if you will. The net code appears even more streamlined and performing, fortunately borrowed (apparently) from Super Street Fighter II HD Remix rather than from the Live Arcade's Street Fighter 2. Super Street Fighter 4 refines the online challenge system by making a simple but substantial change to the player score. In Street Fighter 4 each of us was inclined to use the character with which we best juggled, discouraging the experimentation and choice of other fighters. In this chapter, however, there is a double system for assigning growth points. Player Points represent the general ability of the player, and are given by the system regardless of who we select; the Battle Points, on the other hand, are associated with the single character chosen. For example, if we are used to using Ryu, we can have a very high Player/Battle Point, but changing to Rufus (with whom we could perhaps lose some matches) lowers the overall Player Point but does not affect the Battle Point level achieved with Ryu , decisive in the choice of the online opponent. In addition to the new Endless Battle and Team Battle, SSFIV also offers the player excellent Training, but the classic Survival and Time Attack have been eliminated from this version. Unfortunately, at the time of its release in stores, the lack of the good Championship Mode present in the previous SFIV is also noted. Not a big loss, considering the numerous additions, but Capcom has already reassured that they want to include it later as a free download (hopefully). It is clear that the bulk of the work done by Capcom concerns purely the online sector and its methods. AlsoThe balance is obviously perfect so as not to favor anyone in multiplayer, but the other side of the coin is that those who do not have a connection, or are not interested in fighting against unknown Japanese or American Yankees, find themselves with an Arcade mode storyline practically at historic lows. Not a big loss for everyone else, of course. No surprises on the purely technical front: Super Street Fighter 4 is once again a feast for the eyes with its beautiful toon shading that incorporates the 2D style of the old chapters. The greater number of animations and their superb quality, combos, Supers and new characters make it even more complete and captivating, just like its background music, a modern reinterpretation of the 90s style that made it famous Street Fighter 2. Ultimately, this last Super chapter represents the sum of Capcom's experience in this regard, becoming in fact a modern classic that all true gamers and lovers of fighting games should own and play.", "date": "2010-04-30", "grade": "9.3"}
