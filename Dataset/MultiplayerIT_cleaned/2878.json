{"name": "Port Royale 4", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/port-royale-4-recensione.html", "text": "Port Royale 4 is the new chapter of a series of commercial simulators that were very popular in the last decade, brought back to life by a Kalypso Media in the clear search for valuable intellectual properties to complement its other titles, Tropico above all. Having to write a review therefore brought us back to a few years ago, when digital was not yet predominant and in Italy video games were still bought on newsstands, as well as in specialized shops. After the very complete tutorial, which must really be congratulated for its clarity, the first thing to do is choose which of the four campaigns, linked to four different nations (Spain, United Kingdom, France and Holland), to face. In any case we will find ourselves in the Americas where we will have to conduct our business. Each campaign is characterized by slightly different secondary objectives and a greater or lesser difficulty depending on the positioning of our city and the available resources. Once the first hurdle has been overcome, we can choose the protagonist, i.e. who will govern the commercial empire that we are preparing to build. Each governor has different characteristics, with bonuses and penalties in certain fields. These are really small things about the overall economy of the game, but for certain playstyles they can be important. For example, a player who wants to be a pirate avoids the governor who penalizes acts of piracy. Once in the game we quickly become familiar with the interface, remembering what is explained in the tutorial (let's mention it several times since it has proved to be really useful), then we take our first steps by observing the commercial fleets at our disposal and choosing how to spend the amount which we have been allotted in goods to be transported to the various cities. trading simulation The commercial simulation is certainly the most important side of Port Royale 4, as well as the deepest one. Built around the law of supply and demand, it's super important to master if you want to get anywhere and don't want to waste money unnecessarily, risking bankruptcy (the game is pretty ruthless in that sense). Basically you have to buy goods where there are plenty of them, therefore at a lower price, to resell them where there is more demand. Demand is clearly represented within each city by red bars next to each good's icon, which turn green when satisfied. As a rule, it is the cities that offer better selling prices on the goods they produce directly, while those they have in smaller quantities pay better. The bigger a city is, the stronger the demand for missing goods will be. Note that the size of cities also affects the type of demands that are made: for example, a small, poor city will not need luxuries and will ask for more raw materials, while a large city will pay handsomely for superfluous goods. Most of the gameplay of Port Royale is focused on managing exchanges in order to accumulate money and influence, so as to be able to expand one's possessions, both in territorial and naval terms, by purchasing new fleets and hiring military ships, essential for defending oneself by pirates and rival nations. Naturally, we won't have to do everything alone: Port Royale 4 offers a simple and effective trade route creation system, which allows us to leave the management of some routes to the CPU, telling it from time to time what to buy where, and where to sell what. In this way it is possible to guarantee a constant flow of money, while dedicating oneself to carrying out other activities, such as going treasure hunting (it is necessary to collect pieces of the map and identify the point where the treasure is located) or to engage in the aforementioned piracy , i.e. to attack and plunder the ships of rival nations. Over time we will accumulate a lot of fame points, which we can spend on hiring more captains (essential for military ships), on increasing the well-being of our population, on attracting more workers or on obtaining licenses related to certain types of production (each city can produce up to seven types of goods). Fame points are inextricably linked to our relationship with the viceroy, i.e. the governor of our nation's cities, who can make good or bad weather in sea trade. Generally, to obtain his favors, it is enough to do what he asks, that is, to carry out a series of specific tasks to please him, such as bringing certain goods to the cities that request them, or expanding our fleet, or even increasing the population in our city. Fame can not only be earned, but also lost,for example with acts of piracy or making the population unhappy. Other game mechanics Generally speaking, the commercial part is the best aspect of Port Royale 4, the one that has the most to offer in terms of dynamics to master and development over time. Unfortunately it is what is around him that is only sketchy, when not completely superfluous. Gaming Minds has gone to great lengths to integrate a number of systems that add some variety to the gameplay, but without fully succeeding. Not that a commercial simulator has to be as dynamic as an action game, but the problem here is that nothing seems to carry enough weight to propel the game to the pinnacle of the genre. Let's take naval battles: they take place in turns between up to eight ships on strips of sea divided into hexagonal chessboards. Unfortunately after a handful of fights you realize that they are really shallow, with the CPU always behaving in the same way and the victory that can be achieved using very similar tactics. Just make good use of the skills of the captains, which in terms of use recall those of action RPGs, including rapid reloads of the cannons, enhanced shots, protective mists and so on, and it doesn't take long to get the better of anyone ( except in situations of total disequilibrium). Honestly, after the first hours of the game we opted for the quick resolution of the fights where possible, i.e. when the penalties weren't too high. Another sore point, or perhaps it would be better to say flat, concerns the development of cities. To make them grow you need to build buildings, importing the right raw materials when necessary. Buildings influence each other, for example it is counterproductive to build a productive building near houses, while the latter will benefit from being close to clubs or churches. Generally speaking, it can be said that everything works well, but without giving great stimuli, i.e. without ever really delving into the implications that the management of urbanization can entail. Praise goes instead to the technical side, really excellent for being a strategic one: the islands are well done, the boats too, the sea is realistic enough and the map is beautiful and detailed, despite being thought of as part of the interface (the zoom levels change the speed of time in the game). The result is some really beautiful landscapes, which sometimes it's nice to look at regardless of what you're doing. Of course, most of the time everything is observed from above, but the fact remains that we are on very good levels (lately we have noticed a greater use of resources on the aesthetic aspects even in titles such as strategic or managerial ed).", "date": "2020-09-26", "grade": "7.0"}
