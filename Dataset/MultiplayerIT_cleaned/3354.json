{"name": "Shenmue 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/shenmue-3-recensione.html", "text": "The Shenmue 3 review takes us on a journey through time with two different stops. The first is in 1987, the period in which the events of the game take place, which picks up the story exactly where we left off at the end of the second episode. Ryo Hazuki, a young martial arts expert in search of the killer who killed his father, departs from Yokosuka and lands in China, where he runs into the sweet Shenhua Ling, saving her life. The two discover that they are related in some way and share a similar fate, as the girl's father has mysteriously disappeared. In both cases, all the clues lead to the village of Bailu, the first of the three scenarios that we will be able to explore during a campaign that develops day by day, hour by hour, marking the protagonist's activities and his desire to be useful, while in the background we find ourselves curiously observing a slice of simple life, made up of colorful although generally stereotyped NPCs. The second stop is in 2001, the year in which Shenmue 2 was released, a chapter taken by the developers as an absolute reference for the mechanics that regulate the gameplay of this dream sequel, initially financed with a successful collection on Kickstarter and subsequently landed at Deep Silver so that the production could aspire to a certain quality level. We can say right away that this last goal, however difficult, has been achieved: the settings of Shenmue III are wonderful for details, richness and colors, and we soon come to terms with the peculiar visual style of the characters, deliberately cartoonish, sometimes retro. The animations are dated, the frame rate (unlocked, at least on PS4 Pro) suffers from many small uncertainties and in the same way the direction obsessively proposes framing changes that soon become cloying, referring to a largely outdated tradition in the field of videogame storytelling. However, in principle the technical sector works and at times even impresses, which can only surprise those who expected much more modest results. Gameplay: strengths and weaknesses The investigation gameplay of the series is carried over with virtually no changes in Shenmue III. We will have to live the adventure day by day, getting up in the morning to basically go around asking questions to the inhabitants of the place where we are. This aspect is inevitably a bit dated, also because the system does not take stock of the dialogues already had, leading us to repeat the same interactions more often than not until someone can provide us with the information we need for the next step. whether it's a place to reach or another NPC to talk to. level of Kung Fu by challenging a series of warrior monks. The combat system has been modified in some aspects, especially the more advanced ones, however the references to Virtua Fighter are still clear and there is certainly an important strategic substrate to determine the outcome of the most uncertain clashes; but also assistances that make life easier, namely the possibility of assigning triggers to execute combos that would otherwise require pressing several keystrokes. All these activities are regulated by a resistance indicator which simultaneously acts as a bar of health and empties as we keep moving: to restore it it is necessary to eat and sleep, as it should be, but this only adds a further complication compared to the pace of the game. The limitations of Shenmue 3 lie in the very nature of the game, in its being such a controversial work. In fact, where it is usually natural to expect significant innovations from any sequel, which can sanction the evolution of the franchise over time, in this specific case things work the other way around: woe to change something, that everything remains absolutely like eighteen years ago. Which clearly opens up to two different schools of thought: on the one hand the nostalgic player who feels at home, finding himself virtually twenty years younger, marveling at ideas and solutions that at that time seemed revolutionary and in fact have substantially influenced the genre of open world; on the other, the more detached user, who just as legitimately imagined trying his hand at a more modern and refined experience, in a word improved compared to the first two episodes.As mentioned, the steps forward that Yu Suzuki's work has made are mostly those on a technical level and artistic vision, which thanks to new technologies is able to express itself in a more conscious and mature way. The free management of the view and a clear improvement in the mobility of the protagonist make the exploration more dynamic, although the control system and the interface reflect a largely outdated philosophy, which must however come to terms with the realistic obligation of eat and rest (going to bed by nine o'clock, when it's dark outside), under penalty of emptying the aforementioned indicator of Ryo's physical resistance. However, when it comes to gameplay and structure, those aspects that in Shenmue and Shenmue II were perceived as a sweet price to pay to carry on an adventure that didn't fail to prevaricate, taking its time in an attempt to mimic the routines of daily life, inevitably turn into dead moments and pushed grinding, both elements difficult to digest in 2019. One example among many: during the last stages of Ryo's stay in Bailu, the boy must convince an old martial arts master to teach him a special maneuver. Well, the price of training is a bottle of very expensive fifty-year-old liquor, which we can only afford by chopping wood at least forty times for a shop owner or by gambling. In the latter case, the operation involves, in order, the purchase of tickets for the improvised casino, a visit to a guesser who will tell us which color to bet on each time (in the sense that we will have to go and return to each bet, moreover without the certainty that it will actually go through), the eventual collection of the tickets, their exchange at a shop located in another area for the purchase of objects and finally the exchange of the same at a counter of the pawns who will finally provide us with the cash. Depending on the case and luck, we talk about numerous journeys back and forth that will finally allow us to buy the coveted liqueur. After handing it over to the master, however, we will have to submit to his whims and carry on training for short sessions, returning home from time to time. It is this exaggerated, artificial dilation of time that stands as the biggest weak point of the Shenmue 3 experience, because it represents the excessive stubbornness of those who want to retreat into the past and retrace it even in its criticalities. In fact, there were various alternatives useful for enriching the game structure, stories that could be told instead of secondary missions that are limited to simple fetch quests, or maybe a greater number of fights (in the first half of the campaign there are very, very few) to enhance a combat system that is also it unchanged but still able to have its say thanks to the tactical approach and a non-trivial degree of challenge. In the end, not much happens and it makes a little angry, especially considering that Suzuki did not want to take advantage of the precious opportunity given to him to give his fans the conclusion of a story they thought they'd never see finished and which at this point could remain unfinished. Playstation 4 trophies There are 64 Trophies that can be unlocked in Shenmue 3. Some achievements are obtained by completing actions that must be done in one way or another within the campaign, but most are linked to exploration and side activities of the game, very numerous indeed. Graphics, sound and emotions As mentioned above, Shenmue 3 succeeds in the arduous undertaking of offering an interesting technical sector, certainly made up of ups and downs but damned suggestive in the composition of the landscapes and in their ability to excite during the various moments of the day, whether it is a sunny morning or a sunset, a rainy afternoon or an evening lit by street lamps or signs. We are sorry that the inevitable budget constraints have prevented the project from taking the next step, for example by changing people's behavior when it rains or inserting at least some variation in the greeting that Shenhua gives us every time we leave the house in the morning. To fill these shortcomings we find only the taste, experience and artistic talent of Suzuki and his collaborators, who are not wrong even on the musical accompaniment front and deliver us a suggestive soundtrack, perfectly suited to every moment of the experience. Too bad for the English dubbing, also clinging to the old episodes, which seems typical of the games of twenty years ago: mostly monotonous, badly acted but certainly ccharacteristic. The Japanese alternative is probably better but perhaps less tied to your memories. In both cases, the subtitles in Italian help to understand what the various characters are saying.", "date": "2019-11-22", "grade": "7.5"}
