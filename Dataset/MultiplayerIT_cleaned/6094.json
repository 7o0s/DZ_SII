Perhaps in Japan it was perfectly normal for girls to beat each other, undressing between one punch and another while living adventures halfway between the supernatural and the demented, but the western public - especially the one less accustomed to the clichs of Japanese animation - it split in two even before the game reached our shelves, undecided about its real identity: a photonic filth or a good fighting game disguised as a toy for erotomaniacs? It was a surprise to discover that, under the vaguely hentai patina, a more than decent title was actually hidden, plagued by some problems but definitely fun. The good success of Senran Kagura: Burst convinced Marvelous Entertainment to also publish the second episode in Europe just a year after the Japanese release, and now that we have played it we are ready to tell you if the developer Tamsoft has capitalized on the criticisms and enlarged um, improved the concept. Senran Kagura 2 is more flirty than ever, but behind all those curves hides a good fighting game Lots of breasts, lots of glory Blonde Katsuragi adores her schoolmates' 34C breasts and never misses an opportunity to get her hands on them. Yomi swoons whenever she mentions beans. Homura wants to overcome his rival Asuka at all costs, for which he has mixed feelings. Perhaps, in another life, they would have been friendsif not more. Haruka is a bit sadistic, Mirai dresses like a goth-loli to hide her insecurity, Yagyu is the voice of reason but has an immoderate affection for the nave Hibari. The heroines of Senran Kagura, shinobi belonging to the two rival academies Hanzo and Hebijo, are the triumph of the Japanese stereotype, and therefore irresistible. If you don't know English, don't worry: you can still enjoy the game - the illustrations and non-interactive sequences speak for themselves, after all - but you won't be able to grasp the nuances of a plot which, between endless dialogues and very long ~wall of text~ from the visual novel, however, has something interesting to say. The campaign is divided into five chapters, in turn made up of various missions, and each of them works almost like the season of a television series, describing a fairly long and complex narrative arc in which the girls of the Hebijo, initially branded as traitors, they are forced to go into hiding and look for a way to redeem their ninja honor. Their stories are intertwined with those of the shinobi of the Hanzo school, obviously, and with the invasion of the demonic yoma: each mission is preceded and followed by a series of dialogues and illustrations that contextualize it, but it must be admitted that the variety is rather disappointing. In most cases we will have to face our own teammates for training or our rivals in challenges that end with tarallucci and wine, perhaps after having fought and defeated dozens of enemies who play the wonderful role of cannon fodder, prolonging a the duration of the various internships was a little too long. The most interesting missions, in which we will have to face the gigantic bosses, are not many, and the recycling of settings, enemies and attack patterns doesn't help. Furthermore, the campaign almost always forces you to control a certain character to complete the various missions, and depending on how the plot develops, we could find ourselves using some of them of a much lower level than the enemies. In that case you have to be really good, or resort to healthy ~grinding~: luckily, the many secondary missions that Tamsoft has lovingly packaged for us take over. A nice firm package The main menu of Senran Kagura 2: Deep Crimson has two forms, namely a normal list on the touch screen or the secret base of our shinobi on the upper screen. In the second case, it is possible to control a heroine and interact with the others, perhaps chat a bit to find out more about them, or access the dressing room physically, instead of simply pressing a button. In this sense, Senran Kagura 2 does not miss anything compared to the prequel, unlocking a ton of costumes and accessories with which to customize the girls with each mission, from traditional cat ears to a thousand types of glasses, through swimsuits, uniforms school bags, bunny outfits, wigs of all kinds and so on. The player can even dress up his favorite heroine, change her pose and expression, then examine her carefully thanks to augmented reality and take a nice souvenir photo. In this way, the content for the naughtiest is served, and nothing tolinks to the rest of the contents. In addition to the campaign missions, in fact, it is possible to select the Special Missions and the Yoma's Nest. The former are missions that impose particular rules, given that in some, for example, you have to hit enemies only in mid-air or with special attacks, and in others you have to deflect any ranged attack or break any crate in the round arena. Once completed, the Special Missions reward the player with Shinobi Stones: each protagonist can equip up to three of them at the same time, taking advantage of various bonuses to attack, defense, special shots and so on. The Yoma's Nest, on the other hand, is a kind of ~survival mode~ in which it is possible to progress in a chain of pyramid missions until you are defeated. Obviously the missions get more and more difficult as you move towards the base, but they also reward you with dozens of costumes and weapons that only alter the shinobi's appearance cosmetically, but still push the ~completists~ to play and replay each stage , also because each of them guarantees the experience points necessary to level up and, consequently, to unlock new combos, a greater number of special attacks and other bonuses. In short, the ideal is to alternate the missions of the campaign with the optional ones: unfortunately the variety is what it is, as in fact often happens in scrolling fighting games, but the stimuli are not lacking and practically every mission can also be tackled in cooperative with another player, via the Internet or locally, since there is a big news The 3D effect In the prequel, Tamsoft purposely turned off the 3D effect during certain missions or cinematics to prevent it from negatively impacting an already choppy frame rate. In Deep Crimson, however, the stereoscopic effect can be activated at any time because the frame rate is almost always granite. In addition, the 3D has been implemented very well: it gives depth to the action and highlights the most ... interesting parts of our heroines. An exciting dimension In reality, the novelties compared to the previous Senran Kagura: Burst are above all two. The first concerns the level design, which abandons horizontal scrolling to embrace the magic of depth: this means that, if before you could only attack to the right or left, now you can hit in any direction, even diagonally, and many stages don't they are simpler arenas, but can or should be explored. Tamsoft's new solution certainly makes the clashes more spectacular, giving them ample scope, but brings with it some frustrating problems. The enemy hooking system is still very approximate, and the spectacularity of the animations linked to the combos and special attacks beautifully ignores the collisions with the targets: there are special techniques that hurt the enemies with the very first blows and then continue their run, leaving them behind us and making us waste precious resources as we attack the void. It's not a gigantic flaw, after all, but in the long run it becomes frustrating as it makes us dangerously vulnerable during the most complicated missions and transforms the gameplay into a frenzied button mashing. The other novelty is instead the ~tag team~, which allows us to tackle the missions by controlling two characters: in reality, we directly control only one, ordering the other to hit our own target by holding down the A key, but that's enough press the same key to change heroine on the fly and ring together decidedly spectacular combos that also include extremely destructive combined special techniques, real smart-bombs preceded by a short non-interactive sequence. In this sense, Tamsoft has managed to integrate the ~cutscenes~ into the fights in a much more fluid way, shortening them so that you don't lose your rhythm every time you perform them. Having abandoned the cumbersome system of Yin and Yang, Deep Crimson's fights are simply based on two types of resources: an indicator that fills up with each combo - and the more effective and long it is, the better - and the parchment rolls that accumulate every once the indicator fills up. The girls begin the mission in civilian clothes, and it is not possible to use their special techniques until you transform into a shinobi, wearing the costume with the L key: this technique consumes a roll of parchment and fully recharges your vital energy, so you have to decide whether to use it at the beginning of the mission, immediately taking advantage of the special techniques and upgrades, or wait for a moment of crisis. Once transformed into shinobi, our heroines can make use of three special techniques that consume various scrolls - and which strip the loro opponents, for good measure... - and of the Frantic mode, which temporarily consumes vital energy but allows you to use the aforementioned special attacks indefinitely. In short, Senran Kagura 2 turns out to be a fairly deep fighting game just like its predecessor, but unfortunately the control system still deserves some tweaking: in addition to the collision problem already mentioned, the shot associated with the R key is almost useless for the same reason, and instead of projecting us towards enemies, especially those in mid-air, it tends to shoot us towards the point where they were a few moments before, causing the combos to fail. It's nothing that a little practice won't fix, mind you, but it's annoying nonetheless.", "date": "2015-08-27", "grade": "8.0"}
