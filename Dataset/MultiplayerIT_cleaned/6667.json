{"name": "Subway Surfers Tag", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/subway-surfers-tag-recensione.html", "text": "The Subway Surfers Tag review takes us back to the colorful and fun atmospheres of the famous endless runner with a third-person view developed by Kiloo and SYBO, capable of totaling something like three billion downloads in the last ten years and still supported by over 150 million monthly active users. For the debut on the Apple Arcade platform, however, the developers did not come up with the idea of repeating the same formula, but rather took the protagonists of Subway Surfers and catapulted them into an unprecedented scenario, in this case four different arenas where indulge in tags, grinds and stunts while being chased by hordes of robots and the ever-present guard. Gameplay: very different from an endless runner Subway Surfers Tag, a grind as we get pelted As written at the beginning, Subway Surfers Tag is not an endless runner, but a curious mix between a skate park and an arena shooter. The controls are therefore of the traditional type, with a virtual stick that can be repositioned on the left side of the screen and an attack button on the right side, with automatic hooking, which once loaded to the maximum allows you to launch a powerful special blow. Using the commands touch or a Bluetooth controller we will have to compete with four different arenas, gradually larger and more complex, unlockable by totaling a certain amount of points. Within each of them, our goal will be just that: ring combos, perform stunts by climbing railings and slides, eliminate the robots chasing us by shooting paint with the can, recover batteries so that the hoverboard continues to function and aim for the highscore. We will be able to spend the coins earned from time to time in order to buy permanent improvements for the entire roster of characters, which includes the various Jake, Tricky, Fresh and Yutani, all available immediately and freely selectable, but distinguished only by their appearance and from the special. However, it is precisely the upgrades that mark the progression, since by unlocking them you can survive longer in the arena and score more points. That said, unfortunately after a few hours the limits of the experience come to the surface: the feeling is that Subway Surfers Tag was also a project born with the usual free-to-play model in mind and adapted in the running to Apple Arcade, an operation which, however, revealed the structural limits of a game designed to let us access all the scenarios only after a certain amount of time and grinding. Technical realization Subway Surfers Tag, a special power in one of the scenarios Stylistically, the new adventure of Jake and his graffiti friends takes up what was seen in the original Subway Surfers, thus proposing cartoonish and very colorful graphics which however are not at all enhanced by the minute dimensions of the characters and objects of the scenario, functional to the gameplay. there are adjustments, the game runs at its best by adapting to the device in use, in our case keeping the 60 fps fixed and without overheating problems, which is no small thing these days. Finally, the music is nice, but without acute details.", "date": "2022-07-25", "grade": "7.0"}
