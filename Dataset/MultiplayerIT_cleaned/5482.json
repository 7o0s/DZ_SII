{"name": "Postal Redux", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/168869-postal-redux-follia-in-alta-definizione.html", "text": "When it was released in 1997, Postal became a small phenomenon due to its ultra-violent content, a phenomenon confirmed with the sequel, which made more than one person turn up their noses, but which brought in a lot of money (it is still widely played on Steam today). Unfortunately, the third installment of the series, released in 2011, was a discrete fiasco, both with critics and with the public, due to the numerous bugs and mediocre gameplay. Many do not even know that it exists and can be purchased on Steam. After years of silence, Running With Scissors returns with the remastered edition of the first episode, characterized by completely redesigned graphics, to adapt to the most popular resolutions today and to take advantage of some effects of modern graphics cards, and other improvements aimed at justify the price, in all honesty not very high. For those wondering, Postal doesn't tell anything: it's just the story of a crazed guy who starts massacring the living first in his neighborhood, then throughout the city. ~Going Postal~ in American slang means going out of your mind in a violent and uncontrollable way. The expression was born following a massacre in a post office in Edmond, Oklahoma. It was August 20, 1986 and the postman Patrick Sherrill mercilessly killed fourteen colleagues, wounding six others, before committing suicide by shooting himself in the head. If the non-plot reminds you of the recent and equally brutal Hatred, know that the Destructive Creations title is in fact a shameless clone of Running With Scissors, but less successful, despite being more technologically advanced. Postal returns in the Redux edition, which fixes some of the problems of the original, but not all Redux what? Basically Postal Redux is a twin-stick shooter (and this is already the first big news, if you remember the controls of the original, really uncomfortable) in which you have to wander through the seventeen levels that compose it, hunting for civilians and forces of the order. In each level you have to exterminate a certain number of human beings before you can continue. Finding the prey is not difficult, given that the environments are not very large and it is enough to beat them all inch by inch to succeed. Sure, there are some secret areas, but they too are easily spotted with a little bit of exploration. In general, the game features an isometric shot that tries to give the illusion of 3D, despite being essentially 2D. However, some levels are framed from a bird's eye view, but do not have specific mechanics compared to the others. The good Postal Dude has several weapons to carry out his work of mass extermination. When he leaves the house he has only a machine gun with him, but immediately at the beginning of the first level he comes into possession of a shotgun, then of a particularly powerful revolver. Going forward, his arsenal is enriched with trinkets such as a grenade launcher, a rocket launcher, Molotov cocktails, mines and so on. All owned weapons are visible in the interface bar at the bottom of the screen, where we also find the remaining health and armor. The bar at the top lists the remaining population and level completion percentage. In addition to those mentioned, Postal Redux offers other interesting new features, such as the brand new Rampage mode, in which you have to kill as many enemies as possible to raise your score. Once you have selected the map and entered the game, you must try to be quick in your executions, missing as few shots as possible. At the end we are rewarded with a judgment expressed in letters, determined by our ability. Another improvement is the increase in the number of executions: before, when you wanted to kill a wounded and already downed enemy, the Postal Dude always used the same weapon. In the Redux version each weapon has its own animation. Finally, an ending has been added, which is unlocked by not killing innocents (hey, are there any innocents in this world? We're not kidding). Framing problems? Unfortunately Postal Redux has several gameplay issues. The most annoying concerns the artificial intelligence of the enemies and their reactivity, which makes some situations unnaturally difficult. In what sense? Let's try to explain ourselves: the opponents of our nice neighborhood psychopath generally stand still waiting for him, that is, they start looking for him when they find him at a certain distance, and shoot him when he enters their field of vision. The problem is that they can be activated when they are not yet visible on the screen, often managing to take away a lot of energy before we can react. In short, it's not nice to see a missile coming at you from off-screen without being able to do anything about itwoodworm. The defect manifests itself in particular with the enemies placed at the top and bottom with respect to the shot, while it does not exist in the other directions. The result is that, especially the advanced levels, they become a pain to explore for the first time, i.e. when the location of the enemies is not yet known. Some will argue that it was the same in the original, but, being faced with a remake, this is not an acceptable justification. Another very annoying defect, which manifests itself in the levels framed from a bird's eye view, is the poor legibility of some situations. Again we have to give you some explanation. In Postal, the silhouette of enemies remains visible when they end up behind some object in the world. This is a measure made necessary by the two-dimensional nature of the game world. If there were no silhouettes, some enemies positioned behind buildings would actually be invisible, even if the character had them in front of us. Unfortunately, in bird's-eye view levels, the silhouettes are not always as clear as they should be and often end up being confused with some object. This is a minor problem compared to that of enemies that activate out of frame, but it is still annoying and can cause inopportune and avoidable health losses (or definitive deaths).", "date": "2016-05-28", "grade": "7.5"}
