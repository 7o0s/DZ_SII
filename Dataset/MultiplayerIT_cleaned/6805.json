A situation that we find in The Silent Age, the ~point and click~ adventure published by House on Fire in December 2012, downloadable for free, and which is now completed by the second and last part. Episode Two must be purchased via in-app purchase at the price of 4.49 euros, unless you made any donation when the first episode came out or you took advantage of the 50% discount reserved for pre-orders. Not that 4.49 euros are a lot for this product, let's make it clear right away: while never leaving the traditional canons of the adventure genre, The Silent Age can count on a great atmosphere, assisted by a perfectly themed sound sector and a original and very pleasant graphic style, which makes clean and cartoonish design its strengths, as well as on a plot that draws liberally from a filmic and literary imaginary made up of pandemics destined to extinguish the human race. A bit like what happened in the film ~The Army of the Twelve Monkeys~, from which the House on Fire guys certainly drew inspiration for their work. But let's proceed in order. Set in the 70s, the first episode of The Silent Age introduced the figure of Joe, a janitor who works in an important company and whose life is suddenly turned upside down when he finds himself in front of a man wounded by a bullet. Before dying, the old scientist gives him a device that turns out to be a time machine, capable of catapulting Joe into a future where cities are deserted and buildings abandoned due to the spread of a terrible virus that has decimated the population. His job now is to prevent that future from materialising, but to do so he will have to find out what he's really dealing with. The Silent Age Episode Two is among the most interesting titles released on the App Store and Google Play recently Change your life with one click The mechanisms that regulate the gameplay of The Silent Age Episode Two are the same as in the first episode, so we find ourselves playing with the new chapters of the adventure already knowing their contours, facets and basic philosophy. A factor that proves to be of great help and greatly speeds up the resolution of the puzzles, which are always based on interaction with the scenario, often through the use of objects found within the locations and which perhaps must be combined with each other them to get something different. Then there is the device for time travel: just touch the relative icon, located at the bottom left of the screen, for the setting to suddenly change its appearance, perhaps presenting obstacles where there were none before or vice versa. It is a device that the game developers have used very well to add depth to the experience, effectively doubling the explorable surface and creating puzzles that revolve around the passage of time. What happens, for example, if I make drops of water fall on a metal surface for years? That this surface will oxidize, becoming weaker and prone to give way under a given pressure. The gameplay of The Silent Age is fairly linear, even more so once you understand the mechanics that regulate it, but certainly not trivial. This is why moving from one part of the scenario to the other, using an immediate and precise touch interface, proves to be fun and exciting, with no downtime, also due to a structure with watertight compartments that avoids an excessive (and frustrating ) backtracking. Around the purely playful elements there is then everything else, and as already mentioned the quality of the production is remarkable for its style, cleanliness, fluidity, detail and, above all, atmosphere. There really is as much atmosphere in The Silent Age as you want, and playing with a pair of earphones (as suggested during the loading screen, by the way) is the best solution to enjoy it. In the end, Joe's adventure doesn't last very long, we're on the low two hours for Episode Two, but it's certainly worth trying.", "date": "2014-10-28", "grade": "8.5"}
