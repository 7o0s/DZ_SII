Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to shell out a single cent. Reviving a classic doesn't always mean going without fail, and in the case of Angry Words the operation took a certain number of months to enjoy the necessary optimization. Months in which numerous other languages (Italian, Catalan, English, French and Portuguese) have been added to the original Spanish version, with the introduction of interesting features such as text chat, wide possibilities in terms of matchmaking and the latest facets social, perhaps to show friends on Facebook or Twitter how to put together a devastating combo against the latest arrival (any reference to Pierpaoli and real people is purely coincidental). The idea behind the product developed by Etermax is extremely simple: to translate a boardgame that everyone knows, the Scarabeo, into a portable version oriented towards online multiplayer. The rules are practically the same: within a board made up of fifteen by fifteen boxes, our goal is to place the letters that are assigned to us from time to time so as to create the most complex combinations possible, with the obligation to use at least one of the letters already present on the ~table~ and the possibility of creating ~interweaving~ that can further multiply the score achieved. Each letter is worth a certain number of points, therefore a given word produces the sum of these points unless, as already mentioned, one manages to make a ~cross~ (giving life to two or more existing words in the vocabulary) or to take advantage of the special boxes. There are four of them: Double Letter, Triple Letter, Double Word and Triple Word. Their function is clear, right? They are able to multiply the points of a single letter or of an entire word, allowing us to throw ~broadsides~ that are not funny and to change the course of a game that maybe up to that moment didn't bode well. Angry Words is available both on the App Store and on Google Play: in the first case, the application is free thanks to the presence of advertising banners (not very invasive, it must be said), which, if desired, can be eliminated by purchasing the premium version for 2.39 euros through an in-app purchase system; in the second case, two distinct editions are available on the market, with or without advertising, and the second costs 1.43 euros. As already mentioned, the advertisements are not annoying and it is therefore possible to enjoy the experience completely free of charge and without any limitations. Closing this little parenthesis, let's analyze the features that make a simple game like this so fun and exciting, or rather the multiplayer experience-oriented functions. To play Angry Words you will necessarily need an opponent, and the application will provide you with a large number of possibilities to find one: you can search among your friends on Facebook, enter a username manually or start a match against a player caught at case, clearly among the ranks of the already very numerous Italian users. The first word must be composed in the center of the board, after which you can make your move in turn, change the letters (sacrificing a move) if they are really bad and try to reach a higher score than your opponent before the end of the game, which however, it can also last for days thanks to the asynchronous mechanics and the convenient notification system. Let's explain ourselves better: you won't have to stay there and play once the match has started and until its conclusion, but the system will notify you as soon as the opponent has made his move and you can respond by taking all the necessary time, at the first free moment. Action too slow? Not bad, because the game allows you to start an unlimited number of games and conduct them simultaneously.", "date": "2012-04-07", "grade": "8.5"}
