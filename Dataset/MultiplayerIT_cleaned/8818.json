More importantly, it was able to attract the attention of the trade press and earn some major indie awards. In the case of Super Crate Box, the game was born in October 2010 on PC, in freeware format, and has been played by millions of people, fascinated by the immediacy of the gameplay but at the same time by the degree of challenge of the experience, all anything but trivial. In fact, within a series of scenarios made up of some platforms, the game asks us to collect as many crates as possible. Too easy? The crates appear randomly every time we collect one, and contain different weapons: from the revolver to the shotgun, from the rocket launcher to the grenade launcher, from the double pistol to the mines, from the fearsome disc gun (whose bullets ~ricochet~ and can kill us ) to the laser rifle (powerful but slow), and so on. Really many possibilities to eliminate the enemies who, in groups of three or four at a time, descend from a ~gap~ located in the upper part of the screen and head at full speed towards its correspondent in the lower part. In the middle, however, there is us, and a minimum contact with an evil creature is enough to incur game over. We will therefore have to try to collect the crates while avoiding being touched, ~thinning~ the infinite hordes of enemies by opening fire and exploiting the platform dynamics and the ability to jump of our alter ego to operate emergency ~dodges~. Easier said than done, actually. Three scenarios are enough for me... Super Crate Box makes achievements its lifestyle: as you collect crates, new weapons are unlocked, setting records on scenarios if you get new ones and in the same way you can access two extra modes compared to the standard one (SFMT and Ambush ) respectively reaching the remarkable number of forty cases collected in normal mode and twenty in SFMT mode. As for the settings, it is somewhat surprising that for the moment there are only three: Construction Yard, the typical construction site in which the platforms are metal beams which clearly refers to the original Donkey Kong; Rocket Silo, or rather the launching station of a missile, also with a metallic flavor but rendered in blue tones; Moon Temple, an ancient and stone stage, characterized by a double ~slit~ at the bottom of the screen, as well as two ~safe zones~ on the sides where it is difficult to be reached by enemies. The game has recently been updated to version 1.1, which adds a minimum of customization of the controls, inserts new characters and at the same time celebrates the first achievements obtained by the Super Crate Box community on iPhone and iPad, registered via the Game Center service. In fact, there are already five million cases collected by players from all over the world: a milestone which will certainly be followed by many others, celebrated precisely with updates. To encourage us to continuously break our personal records, Vlambeer's title adopts a sneaky technique: at each game over, just touch the screen to immediately start a new game. This clearly translates into endless game sessions in search of that extra cash that could allow us to get a new weapon or unlock a new mode. The gameplay of Super Crate Box is terribly simple and immediate, but at the same time it requires a minimum of strategy to be able to survive the onslaught of enemies and, above all, great precision: jumping to avoid a monster at the last moment can make the difference between record and game over. For this reason, in our opinion, the decision to implement ~fixed~ and non-modular touch controls does not do justice to the product, as it is enough to move the pressure a few millimeters to not obtain the desired input. Furthermore, the collision detection appears too severe, unbalanced to the detriment of the player, even more so in a title in which a single touch results in a defeat.
