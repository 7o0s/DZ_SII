{"name": "Jenga", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/jenga.html", "text": "Also arrived in Italy in the form of an unofficial ~clone~, Jenga is a very particular game, invented in the early 70s and still re-proposed by Hasbro today in various variations. In some ways it is similar to the Mikado, in others to Domino: to play you need a steady hand and quick reflexes, and secondly you need to be smart enough to leave your opponent with an increasingly precarious tower, from which it becomes almost impossible to remove pieces. After card games, video game developers have also thought of translating this type of ~manual~ entertainment onto the screen, especially with the advent of consoles such as the Wii and Nintendo DS, which allow you to have a certain feeling with what is happening in the game thanks to their input devices. Unfortunately, the results leave much to be desired. Better to try with cell phones? Jenga has only one game mode, which is accessed via the start screen. We will have to challenge a virtual opponent through eighteen stages of increasing difficulty, acting on increasingly unstable towers and equipped with different blocks than usual: in addition to the standard ones, we will find lighter and heavier ones, with clear repercussions on their removal. Removing each block results in the gain of a certain number of points, more or less depending on the difficulty of the maneuver: removing the central pieces is easier, while extracting the lateral ones not only gives more satisfaction but also makes us earn more. The discussion also includes the lightest and heaviest blocks, which can affect the game in different ways. The goal hasn't changed: you have to act in such a way that the opponent finds himself extracting pieces from a now unstable tower, and ends up making it collapse. The game saves our position with each new stage reached, allowing us to continue the game if we lose. The developers have introduced an interesting system of objectives to be achieved, which is very reminiscent of the famous ~achievements~ of Xbox 360 games: needless to say that unlocking them represents a sort of very entertaining ~game within a game~. The control system is extremely simple and is based only on the joystick and key 5: the first allows us to move the ~hand~ on the screen, the second to select or deselect the block we want to extract. Once a piece has been ~hooked~, regardless of the direction (we can extract both ~long~ and ~wide~), we will have to pull it away using the joystick, more or less rapidly depending on the conditions of the tower. If the structure begins to wobble too much under our stress, it will be better to stop and choose another piece... Belonging to the puzzle game genre, this mobile version of Jenga doesn't focus much on technical implementation. The sound sector, in particular, is really mediocre, with only a piece of music (always the same!) to accompany the action, and some sporadic sound effects to underline the crucial moments (the collapse of the tower, for example). As for the graphics, we are certainly not dealing with a spectacular title, but it does its job well: against a ~forest~ background, the tower scrolls and rotates convincingly, and the action of the hands on the blocks is rendered Very good. The animations are far from fluid, but everything is always very ~readable~ and never confusing, which is what matters most in the end. PRO Great control system Extra goals Well done graphics AGAINST Mediocre sound Short lived Doesn't hold a candle to the ~live~ experience", "date": "2008-06-27", "grade": "S.V."}
