{"name": "The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword-hd-recensione.html", "text": "Our review of The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD, a high definition adaptation of the 2011 game for Nintendo Wii, can only start from the description of the context in which it was born. a clear demarcation between casual products, mainly linked to motion (or touch) control, and ~hardcore~ products, almost always anchored to a traditional control system. This is not the place, nor the time, to analyze how Manichean and superficial this approach was; the important thing is to understand how vigorous and present this perception was in the public and in the industry. The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword tried, in the moment of maximum diffusion of this thought, to undermine it from the inside: it tried to unite the most prestigious Nintendo saga with motion control. Not superficially, not in an instrumental way: the link between movement and sword (and objects, and weapons) was the basis of the game. What everyone expected as soon as the Wiimote was presented was reaching the end of the console's life cycle, when the reputation of motion control was already - for this type of production, at least - compromised. The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD: Link and the Master Sword. The second factor to take into consideration, to understand the genesis of this work, is the Nintendo Wii hardware. A slightly better hardware than the GameCube, a hardware, at the time of the development of Skyward Sword, considerably backward: due to power issues, due to the lack of support for high definition. Combining the ambitions that this saga must have genetically with the limitations of the platform was far from simple. Nintendo had to choose whether to focus on the vastness of the work, or on its detail: researching both would have been impossible. He opted, as other times in the past, for detail. We will soon find out, during the review of The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD, how he has aged. In the meantime, a short list of the main changes: on Nintendo Switch the title arrives in high definition, and travels - stably - at 60 fps. The control system has been updated, so that the work is playable even without motion control: in this case, the movements of the weapon are mainly entrusted to the right analog. The free camera has been introduced, and the pedantic advice of Faih, the ~spirit guide~ who lives inside Link's sword, have been filed - but not removed -. Story and setting The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD is, chronologically, the first episode of the saga. The timeline of this series is very confusing, and has long been ignored by Nintendo itself, not without reason: this is because the narrative and mystique of The Legend of Zelda have no need for logic or precision. These are, in fact, legends with blurred edges; a cyclical re-proposition, but with different contents, of the same story. Here, this episode is also different from the others in this: it stands before everyone else, and that legend tries to explain it, to rationalize it, to translate it into prose. There is a past within Skyward Sword; a past in which there were robots and, evidently, a civilized society. In that past the earth was inhabited by a Goddess, but there had never been either a Link or a Zelda: here, more than the genesis of Hyrule, we could say that Skyward Sword tells the story of the first Link, of the first Hero, and the first Zelda. As well as the creation, the fulcrum of the game, of the Supreme Sword (Faih, the analytical and pedantic guide we were talking about earlier, lives inside the blade). The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD: Link's Cloudwalker is the only red one. The Skyward Sword civilization lives in the sky, among the clouds; not surprisingly, the small town where Link and Zelda (who is not a princess, at least here) live is called Oltrenuvola. It was built on a floating island. Each of its inhabitants has a winged mount, a Solcanubi, with which he can move in the - limited - surroundings: they are animals inspired by the Balaeniceps rex, commonly called shoebill, a charismatic African bird. No one, for an untold period of time, has been interested in going below the clouds... until a sinister vortex grabs Zelda, drags her to the ground, and Link finds a way to follow. In this adventure you control only the Hero, but the two characters live a parallel story. She's the only Zelda not to be a princess (or not to become one...), but she's also one of the most strong-willed, and the one with the most personal and strongest relationship with Link: they're childhood friends, and their relationship - a sometimes even in an adolescent way, in tone and narration - it is always somewhere between friendship and love. Game design and areas The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD: One of Ol' millstrecloud. Nintendo for this game has chosen the detail at the expense of the vastness, we said. A choice so conceptual and clear as to have essentially eliminated the overworld typical of every Zelda: whether you think of the prairie of Hyrule or an ocean, in Skyward Sword there is no equivalent. The sky is small, limited and closed, with a few islands, and serves only as a connection between the world beyond the clouds, which tends to be peaceful and serene, and the land below, full of pitfalls and obstacles. In Skyward Sword there is not a moment even remotely comparable to when Link, in Ocarina of Time, leaves the Kokiri Village to enter the Hyrule Field. Or in The Wind Waker, when he leaves Primula Isle. Or in Breath of the Wild, when the Hero emerges from the cave where he has slept for a hundred years. Skyward Sword, to gain density, foregoes exploration entirely. Not only is the sky small, but the three areas below (forest, volcano and desert) are not interconnected; to pass from one to the other one must forcibly return to the sky - through statues, which are also useful for saving the game - and go to the appropriate gate. These same areas are not vast and freely explorable, but divided into circumscribed, intricate sections. In some ways it's more like a metroidvania than a The Legend of Zelda; if we can say that it was not a coherent choice with the spirit of the saga, however we cannot even consider it a defect. We can instead consider the fact that it is impossible to get lost as a defect. Unlike the best metroidvanias, in Skyward Sword you are never at the wrong time in the wrong place; it is true, new roads open up in territories already covered by acquiring powers, but they always open up at the right moment. There's always the feeling that it's not Link that fits Hyrule, but that Hyrule is made for Link. And in an adventure game that's not an exhilarating feeling. Level design and interaction The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD: Stamina bar was born in this game. In addition to the problem just mentioned, it should also be noted that Skyward Sword proceeds in an extremely linear way. At a certain point the work allows you to choose which area to face (each one must be retraced several times, but the solutions are so creative as not to make it annoying), but in general you never have to understand where to go, only how to continue. And there are no alternatives, nor creativity in execution: the way to solve a puzzle, and this game feeds on puzzles continuously, is almost always one and only one. Having clarified all this, and having understood how problematic it can be for a person who has known The Legend of Zelda with Breath of the Wild, one can only bow to the level design of Skyward Sword: the areas are designed with watchmaker mastery, layered with a rare wisdom. It is the culminating point of Eiji Aonuma's design, chiseled and precise and scarcely dedicated to action, and at the same time contains in a nutshell, thanks to Fujibayashi (we talked about him here, if you want to deepen his figure), many buds that would have blossomed , and would have extolled, Breath of the Wild. Yes, because in Skyward Sword the run and the vigor bar were introduced, the cloak for landing (although not as versatile as in the successor), the weapons that can be improved by collecting materials, the beacons to indicate the path. In its dense tangled world, filled with puzzles of various kinds, there is a lot of action, more than there has been - for years - in The Legend of Zelda. The desert area is the triumph of this game. Creative, often ingenious, perfect in the stratifications and concepts proposed: the Stones of Time, which if struck bring the surrounding area back to the flourishing and technological past (with lush grass and water, but above all robots and automatic trolleys) generate literally astonishing situations . And each of the three passes in this area is a sublimation of the game's concept. Dungeons and fights The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD: One of the bosses in the game. Wanting to take the concept to extremes, we could define Skyward Sword as an action-puzzle in three dimensions. The fights themselves are puzzles: it is true that they require some reflexes, but more than acting it is important to understand how to damage the enemy, and then perform the right movement. As Aonuma declared - just to us - in an interview of the time, in Skyward Sword even the fights are puzzles. A fundamentalist choice, consistent with the spirit of the game, less (much less) with that of the saga in general. It is difficult for an enemy to kill you: it could more easily take you a while to figure out how to hit him, to decide whether a slash is better horizontal, vertical or oblique. The monsters in this title are not very aggressive, they tendrather to defend themselves. The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD: The game has outstanding dungeons. This is true both outside dungeons and inside dungeons. Never as in this The Legend of Zelda is the transition between these two contexts poorly defined: and we are not talking about a visual level, because the entrance to the dungeons is even emphasized by a movie. We are referring to the level design: the whole game is basically a large dungeon. However, the latter - as has happened for years in The Legend of Zelda - represent the areas in which the concepts and themes of an entire area condense, intersect and complete. And Skyward Sword has some very beautiful dungeons, among the best of the entire series: they are perfect devices, and they gradually become more complicated in a harmonious way. The fourth and sixth (there are six main ones) really represent the pinnacle of a certain way of conceiving the series. Development and longevity The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD: Desert is the most beautiful and intricate area of the adventure. Skyward Sword is a game with an extremely talkative and driven incipit; being a very long adventure, one gets the sense that Nintendo has been self-indulgent. In essence: given that the work lasts forty hours, it's good that the beginning is not very sparkling. Nothing could be more wrong: after all, it is a lesson learned very well, as demonstrated by the extraordinary incipit of Breath of the Wild. As we have already written, even Faih - throughout the adventure - is too talkative, and eager to help and guide us. We used the present in the previous paragraph, and not by chance: Nintendo has fixed and smoothed out the most serious and annoying parts of the defects just listed, but despite everything Skyward Sword HD remains a game with a slow incipit, and an adventure that is all too driven and Full of tips on how to proceed. The situation has improved compared to the original, but it is still not optimal. The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD: Firon Forest. The game is closely related to the number three: triforce, three areas to visit three times, three encounters with the same boss (the Recluse). It is a long adventure, we are talking - as anticipated - of thirty/forty hours, which vary according to your ability and the subquests you decide to undertake (few but beautiful). We liked the backtracking, and we never found it heavy, on the contrary: the way in which the areas evolve each time, geographically or by events, reveals the architectural complexity of the work in all its beauty, not necessarily evident at all 'start. It is a title, more than any other The Legend of Zelda, full of cutscenes and dialogues. The record kept is often adolescent, not for this ineffective: if The Wind Waker is an adventure for children, and Breath of the Wild is suitable for everyone, Skyward Sword falls into that range where there are dangers and amorous feelings, but the former are never so horrific or real, and the latter are only hinted at. Control system The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD: the direction of the blows is essential to hit. When Skyward Sword was released, Nintendo had hopes that motion controls could become standard, for The Legend of Zelda and for the industry. If the gyroscope has also infiltrated and imposed itself in traditional gaming, it cannot be said that it went as Miyamoto hoped; this means that in 2021 Skyward Sword HD is still a particular experience, and one of the best adventures to take advantage of motion controls. As we said, the precision of the controls, and of the consequent sword strikes, has been used to make the fights themselves some little puzzles. The stronger the enemy, the more parts of the body he covers, the more the directions of useful blows are reduced: at the beginning it is enough to choose between vertical and horizontal, then there are opponents who leave only one part of the body unguarded, perhaps to be seized with an oblique slash or a lunge. The Joy-Con perfectly emulate the original controls: turning the wrist, and observing a camouflage reaction of Link, is still something valuable. As was the case with the Wiimote, the Joy-Cons also need to be recalibrated quite often: although it is annoying, unlike in the past the operation only takes a few moments. The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD: on Switch it is playable even without motion control. Skyward Sword HD is perfectly playable even in portable mode, without motion sensors, mainly replaced by the right control stick. The experience is enjoyable, but not identical to the original one. The decorative but diegetically powerful wrist movements disappear altogether; however, the decisive differences are two others. The first is that analog travel is much shorter than motion", "date": "2021-07-14", "grade": "9.0"}
