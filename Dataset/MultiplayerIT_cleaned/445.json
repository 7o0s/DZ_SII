{"name": "SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs Fireteam Bravo", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/socom-us-navy-seals-fireteam-bravo.html", "text": "Good Bravo Bis Fireteam Bravo is in all respects a reduced version of the famous products released on PS2, starting with the number of soldiers protagonists of the various missions: no longer four, but two, one of which is controlled directly by the user and the other managed by the CPU , whose behavior can be guided through different types of orders. Socom, for the uninitiated, is a realistic third-person tactical shooter, which sees our SEALs engaged in this case in 14 missions set between Chile, Morocco, Poland and other ~hot~ scenarios. All in all, the objectives that the user is called to complete during the various levels are classic: acquisition of information, suppression of enemy forces and recovery of hostages are therefore the masters, always within a stealth perspective that invites to an action as fast, silent and clean as possible. The element that most distinguishes this PSP version from its older sisters on PS2 is in any case to be found in the control system, intelligently adapted to the particular shape of the handheld. The absence of a second analog stick assigned to the free-look was therefore skilfully circumvented by Zipper through a convincing lock-on system: essentially, the lever manages the movement of the character (the free-look can be activated when stationary with a trivial pressure on the D-Pad) while the R key is used to frame enemies. The specter of an oversimplification of shooting is exorcised by the fact that each weapon has its own range, with accuracy inversely proportional to the distance from the target; again, the chances that the shots will be successful depend on the posture and movement of the protagonist, as well as on the level of attention of the enemy on duty, more vulnerable when taken aback. The system works great, as does every aspect of game control: changes in posture, strafe, weapon management, contextual actions and assignment of orders to the partner are therefore all resolved in a sufficiently comfortable and rapid interaction with the keys. No small feat for which the developers of Zipper truly deserve more than applause. All against all Thanks to the aforementioned qualities of the control system and thanks to a consolidated and decidedly fit play structure in this PSP incarnation, Fireteam Bravo flows like a pleasure in its Campaign mode, leaving some doubts only regarding a rather low standard difficulty level . As in the PS2 versions, however, the Zipper title demonstrates a further - exceptional - strength in terms of online multiplayer, which finds fertile ground in the Sony handheld thanks to the implemented Wi-Fi system. Up to a maximum of 16 players can challenge each other in dedicated arenas in the various Suppression, Extraction, Free For All, Demolition and Captive modes, i.e. the classic deathmatch with relative variants of the case (Extraction requires, for example, the recovery of hostages while Captive allows you to revive fallen comrades). Here too the functioning of the system is almost flawless, starting from the management of the lobbies, complete with message boards, rankings and sections dedicated to clans, friends and news. What matters most, however, is the fun factor of the multiplayer, of an excellent level and not at all debased by the presence of the lock-on instead of the free look. Among other things, Fireteam Bravo also supports voice chat (provided you have the indispensable headset), comfortable and extremely functional even on PSP. Truly remarkable in terms of gameplay, SOCOM certainly does not disappoint expectations with regard to the technical aspect: graphically, the title sports good cosmetics, capable of managing large and fairly detailed scenarios at 30 fps susceptible only to some drops in the most get excited. The polygonal models of the characters are also taken care of, while the animations - a little woody - and the quality of the textures are a little less exciting, all things on which it is not difficult to turn a blind eye anyway. Final note of merit for the sound: beyond the effective military soundtrack, the goodness of the effects (the different sounds of the weapons are really realistic) and that of the Italian dubbing are striking. Comment Fireteam Bravo not only proves to be a more than worthy transposition of what we saw in the three SOCOM chapters on PS2, but it proves to be one of the best shooters for PSP. This is thanks to a well-studied control system, solid gameplay and a technical realization at the height, all optimally adapted to the characteristics of the handheld. Convincing (albeit a bit easy) in single player, Fireteam Bravo still gives its bestitself in its online modes, extremely fun and well implemented. Recommended both to fans of the series and to anyone looking for an action game made as God intended. Pros Proven and convincing gameplay Intelligent control system Great multiplayer mode Cons A few bugs here and there A bit easy in single player Within the PS2 gaming scene, SOCOM is a real institution, thanks to an excellent gameplay but above all to the online component: the Zipper title was in fact one of the few (if not the only one) to be able to exploit the network service offered by Sony in a complete and satisfactory manner, capturing the attention of a very large number of users. And considering how the step from PS2 to PSP is extremely short, it certainly didn't take a genius to prophesy a future passage of the series in the portable field: an event that materialized precisely with this Fireteam Bravo.", "date": "2006-06-12", "grade": null}
