{"name": "Ultimate Spider-Man - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ultimate-spider-man-recensione.html", "text": "Where were we? This is certainly not the first game dedicated to climbing walls par excellence (in fact it is the Ultimate ahem, for this joke you can send me emails full of offenses, I accept them without a word) which, over the years, has seen titles dedicated for almost all existing game platforms (the first dates back to 1982, on Atari 2600). The qualitative apex was reached with Spider-Man 2 (we are talking about the console versions, the PC one was really bad), released last year at the same time as the film of the same name, in which the gameplay of GTA III was followed and followed by offering the possibility of running around New York saving people and looking for secrets, as well as following the story of the film (although that was the weakest part). After all, what have comic book fans dreamed of for years if not throwing cobwebs on the skyscrapers to flutter here and there in the maze of the Big Apple? Ultimate Spider-Man follows in the footsteps of its indirect predecessor, however, trying to improve on a narrative level. Venom vs. Spider-Man The game starts with a tutorial that can't be skipped but is perfectly integrated into the action. First you have to face Venom on an American football field by learning to control Peter (not yet in the costume). We can punch and kick our opponent, jumping to avoid his tentacles (when the famous spider senses are activated). If you are captured, you must press two keys in rapid and repeated sequence in order to raise a bar to free yourself. As you progress, you will learn to use the spider web by throwing it on the buildings. The way to do it is very intuitive and a couple of keys are enough to manage everything. The web itself can be used for various functions, such as swinging, gaining speed or to capture enemies by immobilizing them. Moreover, as you progress through the storyline, other rather interesting techniques will be unlocked. The salient feature of the story mode is the ability to control another character known to all fans of the comic: Venom. The differences in the gameplay between Venom and Spider-Man are notable since, while with the second you have to try to help people as much as possible, with the first you need a more violent and determined approach since his energy drops continuously and for recharging needs to literally suck people. Venom obviously can't throw cobwebs but he has long tentacles on his side, which allow him to hit enemies from a distance, and a very powerful jump that allows him to immediately reach considerable heights. Obviously both characters can climb and move along the various buildings of New York, guaranteeing a remarkable general freedom of movement. Story Mode Once you have carried out a series of generic tasks in the city (which we will discuss in the next paragraph), you will be able to access the different chapters of the story mode. Leaving aside the plot itself (which may or may not be of interest depending on the level of interest in Spider-Man, but which is basically rather trivial) it must be said that this is the best part of the game. Each chapter is introduced and concluded by films, in which the choice to follow the language of comics is evident, which more or less explain what will happen in the sequence played. The general scheme of the chapters is always the same: there is another super villain to chase around the city, during the chase events that endanger people's lives occur (events that obviously need to be remedied) and finally, we come to direct confrontation with the super enemy; the most interesting part of all since each fight will be faced in a different way. Obviously there are also variations to the general scheme such as long beating sequences (especially while driving Venom) or chase-only sequences. a certain viscosity of the control system causes some unwanted mistakes to be made Story Mode While this part of the game is very good, some flaws still emerge. In the first place, a certain viscosity of the control system which, especially during the chases, causes some unwanted mistakes to be made. Even the camera takes its toll, wobbling a little too much in the most heated situations and creating a deleterious confusion to understand what's going on. Apart from these defects, however, if Ultimate Spider-Man were composed only of the story mode, perhaps longer since it only lasts a few hours, it could be promoted with good grades. Too bad that's not the case. The free mode We were talking before about the free mode in which Spider-Man is guided around the city in search of more or less powerful generic criminals and people in danger to save. Compared to Spider-Man 2, unfortunately (always the console version), the deterioration is evident. The city is large and very detailed, but the things to do are very few and boring. Those who want to avoid the most boring tasks cannot do so since, to continue in the story mode, a certain number of tasks must have been performed. No problem for random events (robberies, people falling off buildings, criminal gangs to be dealt with with punches and kicks and more) even if, to tell the truth, they aren't many and they quickly become repetitive and boring, not providing also no reward. The real problem is the beating rides and tours; the former are frustrating, the latter are really too boring and repetitive. To activate the races you need to find tokens (indicated on the map) with a stylized man running drawn on them. Once this is done, a sequence will start in which, around the city, large spheres will appear which must be reached as quickly as possible. The problems with the racing sequences are the extremely tight time required to obtain a medal and the inadequacy of the control system which is inaccurate compared to the task at hand. Reaching the spheres quickly isn't difficult, the problem is touching them. Some races become unbearably frustrating by being incredibly difficult and having to be replayed multiple times to finish. Moreover, it is not clear why it is necessary to do them, since they are completely unrelated to the context of the game and the character. [C] What would Spider-Man be without the buildings of New York? Venom is a decidedly irascible character The columns of light indicate where you need to go to continue in the story mode [/C] As for the criminal beating tours, the problem is another. They are always activated by finding special tokens indicated on the map, and simply require that you go around beating up groups of criminals that have appeared nearby. Also in this case the problem is that, after a couple of tours (which are practically all the same) boredom becomes overwhelming and demotivating. Basically the tours and rides could be a decent extra; as active elements of the gameplay, however, they dampen the pace of the game and risk causing frustration in the player. For the rest, in the city, you can do ... nothing else except go around looking for the hundreds of hidden tokens that are used to unlock the usual extras (now inevitable in games of the genre and therefore not so much extra). cel shading? Nope, 3D Comic Inking Technology Partially distancing itself from the now classic graphic style for video games inspired by comics and cartoons, the graphic technique is not that of cel shading in all respects. In fact, Ultimate Spider-Man exploits an elusive 3D comic inking technology, a feature that comes from cel shading and enhances it through a different management of the shadows, greater color saturation and a different thickening of the outlines of the characters. The result is pleasing to the eye and the character models are truly excellent in detail. The representation of the most famous places in New York is also excellent, even if, for some buildings, slightly more suitable and less sparse textures could have been used. The general fluidity is good, but (regarding the PC version) owners of mid-level graphics cards from a couple of years ago will have to lower the details so as not to see too many shots. The music that accompanies the action is discreet and nothing more. Those who want to avoid the most boring tasks cannot do so since, to continue in the story mode, it is necessary to have completed a certain number of tasks [C] The enemy bosses are downright eccentric in appearance There are many characters from the Marvel universe that can be met in the game It will happen often having to help citizens in difficulty; [/C] Cross-platform There are no substantial differences between the PC version and the console versions of Ultimate Spider-Man, except for some obvious graphical adjustments to make the most of the greater computing potential of computers (therefore larger textures, some more effects the usual stuff, in short ). The only version that is slightly worse than the others is the PS2 version, where the drops in frame rate are evident and noticeable and can sometimes become a real agony. Probably the choice was due to the desire not to penalize this version too much from an aesthetic point of view, even if to tell the truth we would have preferred a few less details and a little more fluidity, necessary above all in races against the clock and in pursuits. As a last note, it is advisable to use a joypad also for PC users so as not to have too many gameplay complicationsy. Final comment A sufficient game that is saved thanks to the exciting story mode. The defects, unfortunately, are really many and you can't pretend they don't exist. Especially when wandering around the city (the section that should guarantee greater longevity to the whole and which, instead, becomes only a burden to get rid of as quickly as possible) the preponderant emerge causing annoyance in the player.Pros Technically good Fascinating story mode Beautiful i boss fights Cons Slimy control system Useless and boring free section Some mandatory trials are unrelated to the game context", "date": "2005-10-29", "grade": null}
