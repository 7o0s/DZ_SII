{"name": "Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night-recensione.html", "text": "However trivial and obvious, a review of Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night can only start with the statement that we are faced with that new Castlevania that Konami never wanted to give us, despite the heartfelt requests. It has been since 2008, i.e. since the publication of Order of Ecclesia on the Nintendo DS, that we have been waiting for Koji Igarashi to return to the genre that is most his own and that he has helped to canonize, that of the metroidvania, born semantically when he merged with Symphony of the Night successfully the series of Hitoshi Akamatsu with that of Samus. After seeing the first materials, many feared that they were facing a new Mighty No. 9 case, which dreamed of being the spiritual sequel to the Mega Man series but has become just the proverbial example of a Kickstarter campaign gone to individuals of easy virtue . However, Igarashi has recovered Bloodstained on all levels and transformed it into what its backers wanted  in an almost academic way, we might add. Visual style, soundtrack, map, progression, weapons, gameplay gimmicks: everything in Miriam's adventures recalls the Konami series in a heartfelt way, to the point that if we changed the title and a few elements of the plot, we would not struggle to consider them taken from a Castlevania proper. Plot At the end of the eighteenth century, in 1783 to be precise, in the midst of the Industrial Revolution, a group of demons attacks England, carrying out terrible massacres. To stop them, a guild of alchemists creates shardbinders, i.e. human beings implanted with crystals imbued with demonic power. The guild, in collaboration with the church, manages to stop the demons, but at the cost of thousands of victims. In fact, the shardbinders all die in the rite of purification of the demonic gates. Only two managed to survive: Gebel, who emerged unharmed from the rite, and Miriam, who fell asleep shortly before it began. Ten years have passed since then (note that 1792 is the year in which Akumaj Dracula X Chi no Rondo for PC Engine is set, considered as the maximum expression of the classic setting of the Konami series, as well as the transition game towards the metroidvania structure) and the demons have returned under the leadership of Gebel, now almost completely crystallized. The only one who can stop him is Miriam, because she is able to exploit the powers of the demonic crystals present in her body. To help her faithful Johannes, a redeemed ex-alchemist, the exorcist Dominique and the warrior Zangetsu, the protagonist of Bloodstained: Curse of Moon (NES-style spin-off of the series), which can also be used in Ritual of the Night. Crystals and equipment Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is a 2.5D metroidvania, a barbaric definition which however gives a good idea of a game with an essentially 2D setting, but powered by a 3D graphics engine. It starts with Miriam and Johannes on a ship, which is also the first level of the game (seen several times in demo releases or brought to fairs by Igarashi). The two are going in search of Gebel, but the demons will attack them first, sending the boat adrift. Having taken control of the protagonist, we discover that she seems to be a mixture between a Belmont and Alucard, endowed as she is with great fighting skills and as many demonic powers. Dressed as a gothic lolita, Miriam can jump, slide, back dash, use weapons, and cast magic, which comes from absorbing the crystals of demons slain in combat. At the beginning the choice is limited, but with the continuation of the adventure you get to have literally dozens of powers, including fireballs, summons, familiars and very powerful techniques capable of cleaning up entire rooms with a single blow. The crystals are of five different types, distinguishable by color, and can confer active or passive powers. To give a few examples, Miriam can throw lightning bolts, hit with a very powerful mechanical mallet, double jump and project herself in a ray of light to reach platforms that are otherwise out of reach. There are also some that allow her to transform into a demon, acquiring its abilities. Each power consumes a certain amount of demonic energy (the bar below that of life) which fortunately recharges over time, consuming potions or reaching save points. The powers available to the girl are so many that listing them all is really impossible here: moreover, trying them all is part of the fun of Bloodstained, so let's not spoil it. Considering then that they can be upgraded in the alchemical laboratory, which we will discuss later, and that they can be fused into more powerful crystals, you will understand that there is so much to discoverire and experiment to find the best configuration to use. But there's more: in addition to crystals, Miriam can find or buy (with the money left by slain demons) and equip weapons, armor parts and accessories. Accessories and armor give essentially passive effects, while weapons change the gameplay enormously, being all unique. These are divided into categories: swords, broadswords, maces, pistols, boots and others, which determine their general behavior (swords are faster, broadswords are more powerful and so on), but each of them has its own effects, which makes it more or less suitable for different playstyles. For example, at one point we found a boomerang sword which, although not very powerful, compensates with the ability to hit enemies from a distance. Wearing boots, on the other hand, makes fighting demons much more agile, but obviously you are forced to get close to strike. The whips deserve a separate note, one of the many direct references to the Castlevania series that are encountered in the game, and which celebrate the origin of everything, namely that Indiana Jones taken as a model by Akamatsu for the first episode of the series on the NES. In short, lashing out at the lanterns from which money and energy balls fall is almost a form of celebration... Crafting As we have already mentioned, demonic crystals and equipment can be improved in the alchemical laboratory, managed by Johannes in Miriam's base of operations, located almost at the beginning of the map, immediately after the ship. Here Miriam can create weapons, armor, cook, improve and fuse crystals, but also take pictures, buy and sell items in Dominique's shop, sell excess crystals, as well as take missions from the inhabitants of the destroyed village where you are. The latter are really very simple, while yielding excellent loot, since they require you to find some objects or kill a certain amount of enemies. Crafting, on the other hand, gives much more satisfaction, also because it is one of the main reasons for continuing to play after defeating the final boss. In order to upgrade everything and get the best out of it, in fact, you need to find very rare ingredients, which require you to beat the gigantic game map far and wide, killing enemies over and over again (rare items have a very low drop rate and often cannot be know who owns them...). If you have played any of Igarashi's metroidvania, reading the game description you shouldn't have struggled much to recognize some mechanics of Symphony of the Night, but also of Circle of the Moon, Harmony of Dissonance, Aria of Sorrow, Order of Ecclesia and all the others. Let's say that in Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night, the Japanese master seems to have wanted to mention his entire production, a bit for continuity, a bit to proudly reiterate what his career has been, a bit to wink at the hardcore fans. References to his other titles are also found in enemies. For example, there are flying heads that are a clear reminder of the jellyfish heads that have haunted Castlevania levels since 1986, while some large demons seem to be remodeled on those seen in Symphony of the Night. For the rest there are also the Buers, cannons that recall the bone pillars, armored giants (do you know the Great Armor?) and many other evident grafts of the old imaginary. However, there is no shortage of original creatures, such as most of the bosses, or even more mundane ones such as a giant demonic cat, a guitarist demon and many others. Speaking of bosses (since we have mentioned them) those of Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night have a varied difficulty, determined not only by their attack patterns, but also by the equipment used by Miriam. To say, the twin dragons (we mention them because they have been shown several times in the official material) put us in great difficulty, at least until we tried an alternative configuration of crystals and equipment that made life much easier. As to be expected, the final ones are stronger than the initial ones and some require some attention to be eliminated. At the Normal level, the only one unlocked right away (unless you use an old school trick), let's say you pass them all after very few attempts. It goes much worse at the next two difficulty levels, which are much more demanding. In particular the final boss, which obviously we do not describe, requires a certain dedication to be tamed. Progression and duration In terms of exploration and progression, Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is built very similarly to some of the Castlevania titles already theretati: there is only one large map, of which many areas become accessible only after having unlocked some specific powers or after having obtained certain items, such as the aforementioned double jump. Ironically, the more you explore, the more the map seems to grow. Iga and his team have achieved this effect by gradually increasing the branches: one never gets to feel lost as happens in a Hollow Knight, but in certain moments there is no lack of healthy disorientation. The time required to finish the game at the Normal level is known, because it was declared by Igarashi himself: about ten hours. This is actually a blunder, in the sense that Bloodstained is built to be explored far and wide and to be finished multiple times at different difficulty levels. Completionists, i.e. those who will search for every single secret contained in the game (there are so many, including hidden passages, breaking walls, rare objects and more), can get us many more hours of gameplay. Also considering the presence of alternative modes and the arrival of various expansions in the future, you will understand that the ten hours mentioned are only a rough indication. Some problems and various considerations If Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is a practically perfect Igavania in its general features, it still has some problems. Meanwhile it is true that there are many objects, but many are really useless and placed there just to make up the number. Furthermore, some reworkings of the graphic side are evident, with some areas more refined than others, some decidedly ugly creatures and with some collisions that are not exactly very precise. Nothing tragic or that blocks the game, but in any case it is impossible not to notice the evident qualitative differences, evidently the result of a more troubled workmanship than expected. A particularly negative note deserves the translation into Italian, really of mediocre quality. Surely it will please compatriots who do not know other languages, but having to go and re-read texts in English to fully understand them was not nice. Bow instead for the soundtrack, really excellent. If we want, it is another direct reference to the Castlevania series, given how much it takes up its sounds and general epicness. It is so beautiful that it deserves to be purchased separately (it is digital). Speaking of defects, reading on the net we have noticed complaints that some objects are very difficult to find, so much so that their search has frustrated more than someone. Let's say that this is a minor problem, indeed, a non-problem, because the game can be completed even without finding everything and because this type of research is almost a signature of Igarashi, so much so that in his most famous titles one of the favorite activities of fan is just to spend hours looking for certain items, to get special equipment. In short, it's like complaining because there is water in the sea. Kickstarter and crowdfunding in general deserve a final note: it is true that with bottom-up financing there have often been problematic cases, bordering on fraud, and that some promising projects have turned out to be bitter disappointments, but it is equally true that many great games released in recent years, including some absolute masterpieces, have been developed only thanks to this method of financing. Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is one of them. In short, we paid, we risked, we waited longer than necessary but it was definitely worth it.", "date": "2019-06-22", "grade": "8.9"}
