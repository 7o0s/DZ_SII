{"name": "My Hero One's Justice", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/my-hero-ones-justice-recensione.html", "text": "Now firmly on the podium of the historic magazine Weekly Shonen Jump, My Hero Academia (Boku no Hero Academia at home) has officially replaced Bleach and Naruto after their conclusion, joining manga such as One Piece and Hunter x Hunter. Thanks to the clean style of the author Kohei Horikoshi, My Hero Academia immediately conquered many readers both in Japan and in the rest of the world, especially after the airing of the animated series which, practically at the dawn of the fourth season, has finally arrived in Italy. With this curriculum it was inevitable that My Hero Academia would become a video game, and a fighting game to be precise: after all, it is a shonen in which the characters play each other every other week as well. And so, after an unhappy debut on Nintendo 3DS, My Hero Academia was entrusted to Byking's care to become a multiplatform arena fighter like the various Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storms, the latest titles dedicated to Saint Seiya and the upcoming Jump Force. Will he have also managed to rise above the mediocrity that usually distinguishes this kind of production? Lots of single player The first thing that catches the eye ... indeed, the ear, is the excellent soundtrack, composed of engaging songs and tracks full of rhythm that welcome us already in the large main menu. The latter offers a stack of modes that will surely satisfy the needs of those who like to play on their own. The story mode of My Hero One's Justice is obviously the most important, as it traces the history of My Hero Academia using the manga plates or the frames of the anime together with a subtitled narration completely in Italian. The campaign in question begins more or less from the confrontation with Stain and reaches a certain decisive battle in the middle of the third season, thus covering a good chunk of the story told so far on paper and on TV. For the uninitiated, My Hero Academia is set in a world where possessing super powers - called Quirks - is the norm and narrates the misadventures of a group of students enrolled in a school for superheroes. Of course, the protagonist stands out among them, Izuku ~Deku~ Midoriya, who however was born without powers and only inherited them from his idol, All Might. Unlike many shonen manga in which the story gets stuck on the protagonist and his rivals, Horikoshi's comic manages to give a generous space to practically every supporting character, featuring an eccentric and interesting cast. The My Hero One's Justice campaign therefore retraces the salient moments of the manga and anime, offering a series of crossroads - which are sometimes only cinematic, without fights - and various insights that better clarify what is said. The most interesting thing, however, is that once the first path has been completed, it is possible to play another one from the point of view of the villains and then another ~hypothetical~ one in which the encounters and clashes that could have occurred under different. Although it is not very exciting due to the monotonous narration and the few cinematics, the Story mode still unlocks various collectibles and represents a good smattering for those who are not yet familiar with My Hero Academia. Mission mode is the other relevant option in the main menu, if we leave out the usual single player offerings which are the local battle against the CPU or the training mode. In fact, in Mission mode, you learn first of all to play, satisfying the requests in each stage. The latter mark a series of paths divided by degrees of difficulty and each mission guarantees a different reward based on the player's performance, in addition to experience points that allow the characters to grow and therefore undertake the most difficult missions in a sort of role-playing mechanism. 'rose water that works negligibly. The rewards that the player unlocks by completing the story mode or missions are essentially cosmetic: accessories and costume components with which to customize the models of the characters before making them fight. The idea on paper is nice, but in practice it is also rather disappointing because most of the accessories in question belong to the cast, so it is possible to mount Iida's boots on Ochaco's trousers or put Kaminari's headphones on Yaoyorozu's head and etc. Playstation 4 trophies Unlocking the 48 bronze trophies, the eight silver trophies and the gold trophy shouldn't be very difficult because the objectives are all the same and only scale in number: for example, you have to use a certain number of attacks, then an even greater number and then an even larger number, but of course you also have to finish the fashionStory mode and Missions mode, among other things. The combat system with the Quirks Our multiplayer experience wasn't the happiest: also due to the fact that the game in the West hasn't come out yet, we found very few players online and when we fought against them we also noticed a shaky netcode and an annoying lag that still affected more negatively our opinion on the incomplete combat system. My Hero One's Justice, long story short, isn't fun. First of all it's worth explaining how it actually works, though. We are talking about an arena fighter, therefore a camera behind our character, at least until he goes crazy and starts filming the action from strange and confused angles. One key allows you to jump, another to attack repeatedly and ring the classic combos which, if you play in Normal mode instead of Manual, are automatically completed with a special closing attack. This solution simplifies the experience for newbies and therefore should be avoided if you prefer to have greater control of combos and attacks. The other two main attack keys are called Quirks and in simple terms they constitute the poor moveset of special shots supplied to each fighter. Usually the repeated or continued pressure of one of the Quirk keys, perhaps associated with a direction, alters the shape of the attack, guaranteeing some fighters a wider or more varied moveset. Two back buttons allow us to call up our ~backs~, i.e. the sidekicks selected before the fight who will catapult themselves into the arena to launch an attack and disappear immediately, perhaps allowing us to confuse the enemy or prolong a combo. Finally, a last key allows you to dart towards the opponent, while the parry, if pressed together with the attack, generally turns into a projection or an unstoppable blow. My Hero One's Justice is essentially based on a scissor, rock and paper structure which in practice doesn't work very well: the idea would be that some attacks guarantee a certain level of invulnerability or ignore any parries, therefore it is important to decide instant what type of attack to use to break through the opponent's parry or counter his blows. Logically it is the Quirks that distinguish the fighters on the roster and this inevitably creates impressive imbalances in the general balance. It is clear that we did not expect a balance worthy of the fighting games that go to EVO - it is still a fanservice-oriented title - but the effectiveness of some Quirks, especially the long-range ones, far exceeds the capabilities of the fighters that have only short-range attacks. This occurs mainly due to the nature of My Hero One's Justice: as often happens in these games, you end up running like crazy around the arena, trying to catch or escape your opponent while waiting for the right moment to throw a Plus Ultra, practically the cinematic super move that consumes the appropriate indicator and inflicts a barrage of damage. This bad habit is particularly relevant when playing against the CPU and an awkward artificial intelligence that often makes our opponents run uselessly against corners, walls and obstacles. The arenas are in fact characterized by destructible environmental elements and by the possibility of moving the fight on the walls, even if we have not understood exactly why since these circumstances have never occurred in the series. In those cases, for example, the camera gives its worst and the fights become chaotic, especially if they take place near corners or in indoor structures. However, the real problem is another and concerns the fluidity of the action and the response to the controls. Mind you, if we exclude the rather sparse representation of the iconic scenarios in which the story takes place, it is difficult to complain about the carefully detailed and animated polygonal models, or the very colorful effects that fill the screen thanks to the nice cel shading. The trouble is that, as soon as you hold the joypad, you feel a certain delay in the execution of combos and Quirks, as well as a sort of heaviness in your movements, as if you were constantly fighting against gravity. Jumps become difficult to manage and it's absurd that you can't parry in mid-air, when the combat system places such emphasis on combos and aerial attacks. You almost end up playing at random, pressing the keys in the hope of hitting the enemy with Quirks or combos while in reality you are fighting with the camera, the position in space of the wrestlers, the ineffectiveness of certain movesets instead of others.", "date": "2018-10-24", "grade": "6.0"}
