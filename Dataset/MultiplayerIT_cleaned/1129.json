{"name": "Megaman X Command Mission", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/megaman-x-command-mission.html", "text": "A new mission for X The choice of placing this adventure on the Game Cube is bizarre, when it is linked to the chronology of the X series which, so far, has seen its episodes released on the SNES (until 1997) and then always on the Sony console (from the fourth chapter to to the forthcoming eighth). And in fact, Megaman X Command Misison features narrative elements already seen in the subtle plot of Megaman X 7, which a newbie may not fully understand. Let's go in order, then: X is a Reploid, an android who ~lives~ in an apocalyptic future, devastated by a war between robots that has barely always been held in check by X and his heroic clashes with the perfidious Sigma, often conflict manager. In Megaman X Command Mission, therefore, we find characters and themes related to this universe, but transplanted into a new narrative mini-context: in fact, a new mineral substance, called Force Metal, is found on planet 2202XA8, on which a revolutionary technology is soon developed. A mine for the extraction of Force Metal is thus prepared on the island of Gigantis, but when everything seems to be going well, a group of evil Reploids take possession of the structure, take over Giga City and instigate a rebellion that could have political consequences and devastating militaries. The leader of the rebels is the mysterious Epsilon, who is immediately reported as a Maverick, a criminal Reploid. And when it comes to Mavericks, one can only think of the greatest Maverick Hunters of this era, X and Zero. Then sent on a mission to the island, X and Zero will immediately find themselves catapulted into something much bigger than a simple rebellion, between traitors, spies and double agents. In short, the one written by Capcom for the first, true RPG inspired by Rockman's X series (considered by many to be the best) is certainly not an incredibly complex plot, but it presents interesting ideas and really well-characterized characters (such as the sweet Cinnamon, the creepy Spider or the likeable Axl, already known in X 7), placing itself as a basis for the development of an excellent, new saga. From Action-game to RPG As we said at the beginning, Megaman X Command Mission attempts to blend the purely action nature of the X series with the characteristics of a classic Japanese Role Playing Game. How is all this possible? Well, in a particularly bizarre way: basically, the adventure is divided into ten chapters, and each of them is practically considered as a level of the game. Once one is finished, you move on to the other, after obviously defeating the boss on duty (introduced by the historic ~Warning!~ of the X series). As in any episode of the platform series. But it's not just a linear tour-de-force, Command Mission: after a Chapter, you have access again to all previously visited areas, helping to expand the mini-world that can be explored by X and his gang, populated by its inhabitants and shopkeepers, between labyrinthine ~dungeons~ to explore and enemies to face. Just like in a classic RPG. And the mechanics of the fights are also inspired by a classic RPG, which are resolved in random clashes between the player's party and a group of enemies as many have been seen in the various Final Fantasy, Suikoden or any other old-style JRPG. However, in Megaman X Command Mission, Capcom has created a fresh and original combat system, not a mere copying of already tested mechanics: in Command Mission, the player controls a maximum of three party members (but each of them can be replaced at flight with one of those on the bench during the fights themselves), whose turns of action alternate with those of the opponents on an intuitive grid that allows you to plan action strategies, very similar to the one already seen in XenoSaga Episode I of namco. Furthermore, each character has two ~basic~ commands, or Sub Weapons, to attack his opponents, which can also be used in sequence, after consuming some sort of fuel or Weapon Energy, and a third command which does not consumes WE and ends the turn; the player associates weapons or special abilities to the two attack commands, and it is therefore possible, in the same turn, to carry out three distinct and sequential actions on the enemy, or simply conserve fuel for the next turn, when more is added to the character pool. From Action-game to RPG Thanks to this ingenious combat system devised by Capcom, the monotony of the very frequent random fights that interrupt the exploration of the dungeons is hardly heard... It seems complicated, but in reality it is an extremely simple and well-built system, especially as regards other elements that contribute to making it extremelyvarious and interesting: the Hyper Mode and the Action Trigger are linked to the Weapon Energy of a character, and consuming a large amount of it allows him to power up for a limited number of turns by wearing new armor, selecting Hyper Mode, and using a sort of personal super attack by activating the Action Trigger. The latter, in this case, is very reminiscent of the Limit Breaks or Overdrives of Final Fantasy VII / VIII and X, especially in execution: by activating the Action Trigger of Zero, for example, we will be able to enter a specific key combination to perform deadly special moves with his Z-Saber, while Spider's Action Trigger activates a sort of slot machine whose final combination will decide the power of the attack. As a result of the introduction of these two elements, the Command Mission combat system immediately becomes more strategic than it seems, prompting the player to wonder if it is appropriate to squander WE in weak but instantaneous attacks or if maybe it is better to keep it to activate an Action Trigger or enable Hyper Mode in case of danger. On the other hand, it doesn't always happen to be able to enter Final Strike mode: this allows you to launch a total assault on the target by the entire party, inflicting an exaggerated amount of damage and destroying it completely, but only if in a single turn you can bring its energy to at least 25%. A last rather interesting element is also made up of the sub-tanks, which just like in the platform series allow you to restore the party's energy by drawing on a kind of reserve that must be recharged by finding special items scattered throughout the dungeons and which has a decisive influence in fights. Thanks to this ingenious combat system designed by Capcom, the monotony of the very frequent random fights that interrupt the exploration of the dungeons, which are divided into separate rooms by loads, tend to bore the player in the long run. Another element which, on the other hand, contributes to making Command Mission a real RPG is the possibility of customizing your party through not only the equipment, including main and secondary weapons, but also the Force Metal, which in the actual game just translates into nothing more than a series of accessories to be applied to the various characters, modifying their parameters such as defense, speed and more. Already seen? Certainly, but the introduction of a scale of values to be respected when a certain Force Metal is applied to a certain character in order not to stumble into inopportune penalties on the statistics caused by the inappropriate use of these bonuses, is an interesting novelty that rewards the strategy in favor of a balance that tends to make the game not particularly difficult but not too easy either. Technically typing It seems that cel-shading is the path chosen by Capcom to bring Megaman into the world of three dimensions: after Megaman Network Transmission and Megaman X 7, now it's up to Command Mission to show itself in the polygonal and cartoonish aspect invented years ago with Jet Set Radio and now widespread. Fortunately, although the first photos did not bode well for the cleanliness of the image, Command Mission is revealed in its final form very well done. The settings, although perhaps too aseptic in their mechanics, are well built and full of details, as are the polygonal models of the various characters and enemies, assassins or bosses. In particular the latter, as well as, obviously, the various protagonists, show splendid animations, fluid and spectacular, and each fight is embellished with special effects that transform it into a small fireworks display. Instead, the character design leaves a little perplexed: if the renewed look of X (with the new, beautiful ~photon~ scarf that extends when shooting forward) may seem just a little bizarre in additions to the classic model, for sure some characters like Massimo or Marino appear a bit tacky in the choice of colors and in the abundance of details. While we're talking about the characters, we can't deny the mediocrity of the dubbing, which somewhat demeans the characterisations of the various protagonists with inappropriate voices and below-average acting. Nothing to say instead about the sound, which gives us an excellent musical accompaniment both in the frequent battles and in the exploration or in the cutscenes. Comment Command Mission is a very successful experiment. Nothing to say, in a somewhat dark period, Capcom manages to pull a title out of the hat that will go quietly, but which is able to give Megaman fans and RPG enthusiasts thirty hours of fun. The plot is not particularly sensuousaction is counterbalanced by an excellent combat system and a linear progression at the right point, which almost gives the idea of playing an old platform episode magically transformed into an RPG. With many extras to discover (including secret bosses and unlockable bonuses), Command Mission proves to be a decidedly surprising title, proving that the Blue Bomber still has something to say in a gaming market in which, and he knows it first, the recycling of ideas threatens the fate of the most beautiful and famous series. Pros: Excellent combat system Linear, but at the right point Cons: Not particularly complex plot Mediocre dubbing These days it's increasingly difficult to speak well of Capcom, its latest and questionable choices have baffled even the most resolute supporter, and franchises like Resident Evil, crucial in the war of consoles, has always been seen with an eye, almost like tip the balance in a battle of which, by now, it is increasingly difficult to see a winner. But fans of Megaman (or Rockman, as the Capcom mascot is called in Japan) do not care about all this: the adventures of the Blue Bomber can be found practically everywhere, the sales of a console do not depend on them and whoever wants to play as Megaman has to adjust to the scattering of his series. Battle Network and Zero on Game Boy Advance, X on PlayStation 2... only the recent Network Transmission has delighted the Game Cube playroom with a discreet product halfway between RPG and platform, which should have reconciled the role-playing course undertaken from the Game Boy Advance series with the most classic and true nature of the Blue Bomber. And it is again on the Game Cube (but also on the PlayStation 2) that Capcom tries again the fusion of the Megaman ~series~, this time however placing the emphasis on the role-playing rather than the platforming aspect: Megaman X Command Mission is, of done, an RPG that plays like an action game and, at the same time, is just the exact opposite.", "date": "2004-11-23", "grade": null}
