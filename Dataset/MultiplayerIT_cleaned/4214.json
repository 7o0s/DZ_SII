It is not clear if there is already a specific definition for this type of game (a letter placed next to RPG is usually what is used to define the innumerable nuances of role-playing games) but the distinctive characteristics clearly transpire in a large amount of different titles, among which we mention - to remain in the most recent - Sdorica: Sunset, Lionheart: Dark Moon and even Disney Heroes: Battle Mode, in some respects. Might and Magic: Elemental Guardians also falls into this vein, which is also a candidate to be one of the best exponents. These are games that rely entirely on two aspects: combat and character management. In a certain sense, they could be defined as role-playing games in the minimum terms, but it would be an unfair reduction of the complex structure that characterizes above all the management element of the party, which is usually powerful and, in this specific case, also very interesting. What is missing, here as in the other exponents of this pseudo-genre, is a real story and the classic exploration phase, which are no small shortcomings if we consider the role-playing game in its classic sense but which actually take on a marginal weight within the structure designed for mobile use. There is a fairly weak pretext that puts us to grips with an infinite number of clashes within different settings, and that is enough: in this case, we find ourselves learning the basics of magic at the Akadimia, a prestigious school of arts magic that has a vague connection to the Might & Magic universe, like a kind of Hogwarts in a fantasy sauce. The aim of the game, essentially, is to form a party of fighters by collecting and improving various creatures and defeating the enemies that infest the numerous areas of the game world. Between Pokmon and Might & Magic The protagonist finds herself in command of a party made up of various creatures drawn somewhat freely from the tradition of Might & Magic. As in the other titles we've mentioned, the game action takes place exclusively on the battlefield, where our team of creatures has to face various waves of enemies in turn-based battles. The combat mechanics are quite simple when compared to classic RPGs or strategic RPGs, but it actually has a certain depth compared to many other similar mobile titles. In fact, it fully resumes the tradition of the JRPG, with the characters who can choose between various types of attack and magic at each turn (based on the amount of turns completed and the energy available) and the power relationships established on the basis of the elements of reference for each character, concatenated as in a sort of rock-paper-scissors. To tell the truth, the chances of victory are calculated above all on the basis of the level and value of the party components, so the preparation of the latter is the real focal element on which the whole balance is built, because the clash itself, although tactical in some aspects, it does not allow particularly unexpected results to be obtained, so much so that for convenience it is possible to activate automatic combat and let the CPU calculate everything. The latter is a solution that could horrify the standard player, but once you understand that the mechanics of the game are based mainly on something else, it is easy to be taken into consideration to compress the times as much as possible, reducing the combat to a simple graphic tinsel . The bulk of the action therefore takes place away from the fighting and in the management of the characters, immersed in those pleasant but rather complex menus, above all due to the amount of information concentrated on a screen that can be very small. The fighters have a layered progression in different levels, glyphs to be applied to amplify their special abilities, evolutions to be imprinted on them too, rank changes, evolutions and various transformations that make everything rather complicated but also fascinating and well thought out, making it easy to get caught up in the typical continuous advance mechanism. There is also the classic ~gacha~ dynamic which involves winning new creatures by spending crystals and thus guaranteeing a continuous supply of new surprise levers, with which to discover skills and experiment with new combinations for team building. Being a free-to-play with this structure, micro-transactions are obviously present, but both running out of energy and buying power-ups and crystals are not known.they are not absolutely pressing during the game. The possibility of engaging on different fronts between history, PvP, management of the characters and additional missions also eliminates downtime, always setting some objectives to be completed.", "date": "2018-06-07", "grade": "8.3"}
