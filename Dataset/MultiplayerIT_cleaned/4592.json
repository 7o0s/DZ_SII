Although it has often been referred to - and even advertised - as such, Super Mario Odyssey, at least strictly speaking, is not the sequel to Super Mario 64. The second concept is slightly more complicated, and almost as old as the work mentioned in the title of the game: EPD Tokyo has sinned, so to speak, of hubris. She was superb in the conception of Super Mario Odyssey, and arrogant in its execution. Because this new three-dimensional platformer, directed by Kenta Motokura and produced by Hayashida and Koizumi, doesn't just want to revive the mechanics of Super Mario 64: it takes the strong point of each predecessor and challenges it to a duel, all while trying to harmonize and merge these very different dynamics together. It is inspired by the exploration of the progenitor on Nintendo 64, it proposes the thematic missions of Super Mario Sunshine, it inherits the variety and gravitational tricks of Super Mario Galaxy, and even from the last Super Mario 3D World, theoretically so different, it takes up the rhythm and abundance of content. That wasn't enough, in terms of transformations and power-ups, he does what every Kirby fan would want from a three-dimensional iteration, also drawing inspiration - in this field - from the Rareware works of the turn of the century, in particular Conker's Bad Fur Day. In short, in Tolkien's words, ~a platformer to rule them all, a platformer to find them, a platformer to bring them all and in the darkness bind them~. Joy-Con in the wind We can only start the examination of the game from the most important aspect for any platformer, and that is the control system. From this point of view Super Mario, in over thirty years of history, has always represented a certainty, and this latest episode is no exception. Odyssey's controls are a delightful compromise between Sunshine's extremely loose and malleable controls, and Super Mario Galaxy's slightly tighter controls. In any case, for DNA they derive directly from Super Mario 64, so the triple jump is present and the button to run is absent. Long jumps, series jumps, back somersaults, 180 flips: the entire classic repertoire returns, with a slightly faster pace than usual. But, as we said before, this Odyssey does not deny any of its ancestors, and the added value of the control system is given by the recent past, by some moves inherited from 3D World. So the series rolls and the ~post-butt~ high jumps are back, but above all the sense of rhythm that that game, unlike all the other three-dimensional Marios, was able to give returns. And this return is refined and elegant in the way it integrates with the classic controls: since there is no longer a run button, and since you can't accelerate to maximum with the analog stick alone, the fastest pace is reached by rolling and long jumping. Attempting to maintain this speed, which by inertia is transiently transferred even to classic jumps, is the most satisfying thing ever done in a three-dimensional Super Mario, and in some advanced stages it is even necessary to complete certain challenges. This time Mario has constant company, an animated hat - Cappy - that can be thrown: it is useful both for novices, who can hit without having to jump, and for experienced players, since some complicated leaps are performed only with the aid of the flying headgear. The game recommends using the separate Joy-Cons, so as to be able to launch Cappy through the motion sensors: it is true, some actions in this way are simpler and more intuitive, and some (rare) moves are relegated to this setting, however we found the game in traditional mode just as enjoyable. A pleasant surprise is represented by the HD Rumble, which is finally expressed in its full potential: it is not a technology that marks a first and an after in the history of video games, but it is still a significant step forward compared to the past. In some cases you have to look for hidden elements only by following the variable intensity of the vibrations, other times the feature simply acts as a lovable outfit: when you put Mario on a vespa you will understand exactly what we are talking about. The Flying Hat The game is divided into various kingdoms, levels with various settings and structures, which however all (or almost all) share that all-encompassing yearning we were talking about initially: each one contains a territory base devoted to exploration, enriched by some purely action subsections. The fear that the latter were the only custodians of the platform DNA was legitimate, but fortunately this is not the case: even in Super Mario Odyssey, as happened very often in Super Mario 64, exploration and stunts are fused together. However, there is no equivalent of Peach's Castle, given that one moves from one kingdom to another through a hat-shaped ship, the Odyssey in fact, which needs Moons to travel; an alternative energy source to say the least, whose research has replaced the canonical three-dimensional Super Mario Stars. The diversification is not only formal, however: the Moons in this game are much more numerous than the traditional Stars, and generally hidden in a different way. They are more similar to the old blue coins from Super Mario Sunshine, so they could be hidden behind a house, or under a relief: in fact, the more complicated missions, the main ones, usually give a cluster of Power Moons, not just one. In this regard, it was surprising to see how much the game, at least in the story path, is linear: don't get us wrong, exploration and research are an integral part of the main missions, but we still wanted to make the adventure enjoyable for everyone those players who appreciate these components less. A gloved hand indicates the next objective on the map, and there is even an assisted mode that highlights the path to follow with arrows. Not only that: in your first visit to the various kingdoms, exactly as happened in the ~stories~ of Super Mario Sunshine, the latter are in different conditions than normal. Which, without going into details, could mean that you will go there at night instead of during the day, or that certain elements could be destroyed, modified or in altered positions. Once the part relating to the story is concluded, each of these levels stabilizes on a standard status that can be explored at will, and without any limitations. The transformations, which in this game replace the usual power-ups, as you know by now, are obtained by throwing Cappy on some elements/enemies: they are many, we are talking about fifty, and we tell you the quantity only because the menu immediately makes the total number explicit (a questionable choice). Nintendo has ensured that their use is limited to certain areas, but has done it intelligently, without time limits (except in rare cases), managing everything through limitations on the character and consequent structuring of the territory. Some emphasize or alter the platform soul of the game, others avoid it altogether, but all, except a dozen of the ~disposable~ types, boast a precise and unique control system: even when there is no plumber (or rather, former plumber) on screen, the feeling of playing Super Mario remains. Cappy also has another feature, because it can be controlled entirely by another player, originating an atypical multiplayer mode: it's a side section, perhaps even more so than in Super Mario Galaxy, and has little playful relevance. We imagine that Nintendo has included it to share the experience with those friends and / or family who have little experience, and in this sense it is nice that it is present. Hidden moons and where to find them Of the main missions, enlivened by the transformations and enlivened by the magnificent controls, we have to mention two other surprising elements. First of all the two-dimensional sections, of a dazzling genius, reachable by some pipes and often integrated, or even structured, on irregular surfaces: it is Super Mario Bros. applied to current technologies, and it is as beautiful to play as it is relevant on an aesthetic level, because celebrates the postmodernist vocation of Odyssey, so skilled in mixing, bringing together and highlighting different playful languages. A second element that surprised us, given that the saga has never been famous for this reason, are the bosses: they don't even represent the best part of the game this time, but they are more fun and brilliant than in the past, above all thanks to the variations granted from transformations. Odyssey is a title that, despite being devoted to exploration, completely repudiates downtime: some could say that it is a concession made to the portability of the game, and it is a statement with a probable kernel of truth, but on the other hand we must still underlining the immoderate ambition of this title, which, while different from Super Mario 3D World, while theoretically justified in having ~merely~ discursive parts, refuses to allow breaks, and limits the decorative elements to a minimum. Also for this it is possible to teleport and there are two types of coins, the canonical ones (yellow and oval), spread over every territory, and the single ones of each Kingdom, necessary to buy souvenirs and native clothes (the latter, we are sorry to disappoint you, they do not havea real playful function). The local purple coins are expertly arranged and fill all those ravines not used to hide the Moons: in fact, unlike the yellow ones, they are numbered. Without going into details that would constitute annoying advances, we limit ourselves to telling you that the post-boss section, in terms of quality and quantity, is completely comparable to the previous one. And it is also structured in an intelligent way: no longer being able to count on the plot, and above all on the events connected to it, it deepens the mechanics of exploration and research (the Moons to be found with visual clues, posters to photograph are noteworthy), as well as those of pure action, proposing really challenging sub-levels, which enhance the depth of the control system. As you may have guessed, when Super Mario Odyssey works at its best, when all its souls blend harmoniously with each other, when two-dimensional parts intertwine with three-dimensional stunts, when vertical exploration of the level leads to an area of pure crystalline platforming , well, in these situations it reaches levels never reached before by 3D platformers: it is both the alpha and the omega of the genre. Inevitably, or so we would say, there are phases in which the spell is broken, in which some sub-sections are uninspired, in which the exploratory part is too predictable and relegated to a simple connective structure, in which the many identities of this game are fragmented, and rather than harmony they communicate incoherence. Mind you, we're talking about two or three Kingdoms, a small part of the adventure, which still exists and is rather annoying. Just as some repetitive and recycled Moons are annoying. Bowser proco The story is the same: Bowser kidnaps Princess Peach, and Mario sets out to save her. This time the kidnapping is double (the kidnapping also involves Cappy's little sister), and above all aimed at marrying the princess. The narration is pleasant, in particular thanks to Mario's new hat, never intrusive and often brilliant in his jokes: considering how important he is in Odyssey, especially for the influence on the game mechanics, we will hardly see him again in the next episodes. However, we are sure that he will be remembered by fans of this saga, a bit like what happened to Midna in The Legend of Zelda. As for the character of Peach, although starting in the usual way, we inform you - for the record - that her developments are evidently influenced by progressive feminism: she makes rather surprising choices, and reveals herself, elevating herself to an oxymoron, an anti- Penelope. As we anticipated in this article, despite the mix of different styles sometimes appearing out of tune, it is undoubtedly functional: it manages to communicate a feeling of adventure and exploration of the unknown, which Super Mario has been missing for a long time. Not even the space setting of Super Mario Galaxy succeeded so well in its intent: now it is more alienating to see Mario in New York than among the constellations. From a technical point of view, EAD Tokyo once again proves to be a step ahead of the other Kyoto teams, managing to reconcile size and quality. Odyssey travels stably at 60 fps, both in portable mode (with a resolution at 720p), and when the Switch is docked (apparently at 900p, but we await confirmation). The cleaning of the image is obviously different, and playing on the TV is much more pleasant and, in general, more suitable for such a title. The animations are applause, really well done, which are a comfort after those of Super Mario 3D World, and which enhance the ~photo mode~. You can indulge yourself in capturing images using filters, rotating the frame, adding and removing logos, but the real strength of this section is represented by Super Mario, a character who has never been so ~alive~: he is authentic polygonal joy when he inflates his cheeks under water, or shivering from the cold, when he gets burned, or simply snoring with a bird on his nose. The soundtrack, written by the young Fujii (also author of the music for Splatoon) and Kubo, with the help and supervision of the usual Kondo, is beautiful and varied, thus created to underline the differences between the many Kingdoms visited by Mario. In addition to the main theme, the one sung (unique in the history of the series), there is a really amusing, funky 70s theme, another adventurous and exhilarating one, yet another that seems to come out of a Tim Burton film. These pieces, taken individually, would be quite traditional: their real strength lies in the overall eclecticism of the soundtrack.", "date": "2017-10-26", "grade": "9.4"}
