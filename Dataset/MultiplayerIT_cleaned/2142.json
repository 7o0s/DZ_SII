{"name": "UFC Tapout - Pal", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ufc-tapout-pal.html", "text": "So true it almost hurts: UFC Tapout, a title that boasts of being able to bring to the screens of everyone's living rooms and bedrooms, thanks to our trusty Xbox, the spectacularity and sometimes the brutality of mixed martial arts tournaments much appreciated overseas; known and widely appreciated above all thanks to the dozens of events, exclusively broadcast on pay-per-view, which over the years have demonstrated how and how real this sport is. We're not talking about clowns dressed in bright colors who fight each other for hours without breaking a sweat (I hate the adepts of wrestling-show), but we're talking about tough, real men, champions, athletes, simply crazy or just stubborn. This is a tough tournament, true, where blows are given to hurt, to knock out the opponent, to be the best. Incomparably strong men in a world of strong men. A game therefore where you will not see energy bubbles, fire pyramids, ultra-fast shots, combos or devastating finishing moves; you will see wrestlers bordering on photorealism, you will see men gripping the ground in painful grips, you will see skull-crusher blows, you will see blood and pain, and perhaps, I repeat, perhaps... if you are skilled and astute enough, thugs but also strategists, you can do it, you can be the stronger, you can boast of being the champion of the Ultimate Fighting Championship. What is the Ultimate Fighting Championship? The UFC (or Ultimate Fighting Championship) is a competition, very famous in the states and beyond, which brings together athletes of the MMA (Mixed Martial Arts), the combined martial arts; this competition, created in 1993 with the maximum perspective of a couple of editions, had and still has the purpose of bringing together in the same ring, or rather in the octagon, the champions of various martial arts and/or Olympic disciplines. Indeed, among the various styles represented we will be able to find karate, jiu-jitsu, boxing, sumo, jet-kune-doo, kickboxing, wrestling and street style... Thanks to the enormous and almost unexpected, surely unexpected, support that the event has achieved over the various editions what was born as a simple form of almost provincial entertainment has evolved into one of the most popular sporting events in the world. In fact today, after more than 8 years of existence and more than 35 events organized, this event has assumed enormous value and prestige. Now, having become a great media phenomenon, the Ultimate Fighting Championship lands for the second time on our consoles after the highly appreciated and excellent prequel for the Dreamcast, let's see what it will be capable of! Entering the Octagon... First of all, the game has various possibilities for choosing modes: we are talking about Arcade, UFC, Tournament, Exhibition and Create a Player. So let's start from this last (and excellently made pre-announcement) modality. First you will have to enter the usual mandatory data, and other more interesting and peculiar ones such as the characteristics, maximum 3, which will have to determine the behavior and strengths of your alter ego. Unfortunately there is no possibility to edit the face of the wrestlers, but certainly most of you will certainly find your favorite in the shortlist of 120 that we are offered. After having selected the face, the clothing and the voice, the fundamental moment comes in which you will have to select your style of struggle. You can choose between: Jiu Jitsu Kickboxing Street Fighting Muay Thai Wrestling Karate Sumo Tae Kwon Do Shoot fighting Capoeira Pro Wrestling Now that the style has been chosen, you just have to divide the skill points between the four main characteristics of the character (life, stamina. punch skill and kick skill) and your wrestler is ready to enter the octagon. So what are you going to try your hand at? You could now practice with a simple Exhibition, or take the field in Arcade mode where you will challenge the various wrestlers one at a time, thus being able to unlock new characters including some ~kind~ damsels; and what about instead of taking part in the UFC tournament, a tournament that takes place as in the classic canons of this event between 8 contenders and in which your recovery of life between one encounter and another will be minimal. If you are still not satisfied you can always take part in a normal tournament alone or in the company of 7 other friends. The choice of your destiny is only and always in your hands... It doesn't hurt... It doesn't hurt... Whatever decision you have made you are now entering the octagon and your way dfighting will change forever. In case you choose Arcade or Exhibition, the game will catapult you directly into the ring to challenge your opponent, giving you only the last quick explanations of the referee, but I strongly recommend anyone to start a tournament (normal and UFC) and quietly enjoy the characters' entrances presented excellently in the path that leads them to the ring; but it doesn't end here at all, once in the ring the official presenter of the tournament will make an appearance who will recite a mini biography of the two wrestlers with emphasis and the right excitement. Now the going gets tough, the referee asks you if you're ready, yes? then GO! At this point the best high of this emerges with arrogance, by now you will have understood excellent, game. Do you have a friend who beats you at every fighting game by frantically fiddling with the keys while you try to use a minimum of strategy? invite him to a match at UFC and you will have your revenge. It is no longer a matter of frantically striking, making half moons or endlessly repeating the same blow; now you need strategy, brains and only then muscles. Just to tell you, you can spend 5 minutes beating and hammering an opponent and perhaps at the first opportunity he will defeat you with a submission. Do you know the Tapout referred to in the title? lo and behold, you will often see wrestlers losing or winning a match this way, with a timed submission applied. Certainly not for this reason kicks and punches are to be snubbed but the most complicated part, and honestly also the most satisfying, of the game is the situation that arises when the two opponents are on the ground; the two opponents remain entangled and the blows and submissions are exchanged with feverish speed, waiting for one of the two to give up for a moment and be defeated by a surprise blow. Just to say and make you understand how many situations there can be in which you can find yourself inside the octagon, I list the various positions mentioned in the manual: Standing, Guard, Low Guard, High Guard, Low Mount, High Mount, Low Back Mount and High Back Mount. But don't think that this is just a complicated and not immediate game, obviously it may take you a moment to become familiar with the keys and positions but certainly no other game has ever given you the real sensation of beating your opponent and ~ break his face.~ (apart from perhaps its direct predecessor). Real Fighting ??? So the promises were kept? Certain! The game is great, the modes are interesting, all the major fighters of the sport are featured (although surely most of you don't know any of them) and beating up your friend has rarely been more fun. So is it a perfect game? No, unfortunately not. The biggest problem of the game is that it is too similar to its predecessor, without particular innovations or additions that are really relevant, and perhaps it is not for everyone, not as immediate as someone would expect a ~fighting game~ to be; and this is precisely what I believe is a must and very important to explain to all those who are in any way interested in buying. The game is much closer to a Knockout Kings than a Dead or Alive; precisely more sport than fighting game. Little immediacy but in the long run certainly satisfying like few others, as long as you don't get bored first. The important thing is to have a moment of patience and perseverance, rest assured that it will be amply repaid. Concluding: In summary, therefore, the game is an excellent game, well done, clean graphics, not immediate but deep playability and an excellent level of challenge in my opinion well calibrated; unfortunately, I repeat, it is probably not a game for everyone and requires a minimum of dedication. It's certainly part of a rather alternative genre. Pros: Graphics bordering on photorealism Deep playability Feeling of ~reality~ Cons: At times cumbersome Too similar to the predecessor Not very immediate Materials: UFC: Tapout Trailer Tips", "date": "2002-05-02", "grade": null}
