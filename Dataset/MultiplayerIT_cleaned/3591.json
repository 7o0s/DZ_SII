Based in Bordeaux, he has the cyberpunk adventure Void and Meddler to his credit, available on Steam since 2015. The passion of the small reality across the Alps for non-linear storytelling led to the conception and birth of Night Call, a particular investigative experience that for themes and visual style recalls the noir genre. What will unite a dangerous serial killer, an unscrupulous police officer and a taxi driver with a murky past? Find out by continuing to read our review. An improvised detective Paris, the metropolis par excellence. Crossroads for millions of lives whose experiences intertwine, sometimes only for a few fleeting moments. And who knows better than a taxi driver what it means to share brief moments with perfect strangers? Listen to their stories, exchange a few jokes between one block and another of the capital, near the Champs Elysees, the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre; or perhaps out of town, heading for Versailles or Charles de Gaulle airport. Small moments of real life, apparently of secondary importance yet potentially full of meaning. However, the protagonist of Night Call is not a taxi driver like all the others. His seems to be a story destined to end in the worst way, but it will be the person directly concerned who will have to do his best to try to get out of the way by improvising as a detective. It all begins in a hospital room, where the man spent two weeks in a coma following a brutal assault. In theory it should be considered a good fortune to have managed to escape the grip of The Judge, the formidable serial killer who is literally terrorizing the Ville Lumire with his murders, but reality will soon turn out to be less exciting than expected. Leveraging on the protagonist's murky past, agent Busset of the Parisian police urges him to carry out thorough investigations into the case and to keep her informed of all the details that he will be able to extrapolate during the long nights spent in a taxi on the illuminated streets of the metropolis. In the manner of a consummate private investigator, the player will therefore ideally have to drive the vehicle and in seven nights host as many passengers on board with the aim of extrapolating information and congruent clues on the suspects indicated in the police dossier. Confessions, reflections and deductions At the beginning of the game you can choose from various approaches to solving the proposed cases. By selecting Judge, for example, you will be dealing with victims that have some correlation and the story will be balanced to suit the player who faces the experience for the first time. Opting for The Angel of Death you will have to deal with random victims and unidentified motives, while choosing The Sandman the victims will be only apparently random but the motive will be difficult to deduce. Regardless of the approach chosen, it is still possible to tackle the game by choosing between three difficulty levels. Leaning towards Story you will have easier access to money and each action will take less time to complete, Balanced will give access to an intermediate approach, while in Hard mode the money available to the player will be drastically reduced and it will become significantly more difficult to bring complete the case successfully. Although he does not have special skills or specific training in the field of investigation, the protagonist of Night Call has a talent: being able to quickly establish a dialogue with his clients in the handful of minutes in which the latter are sitting in the back seat of his taxi: no small advantage for those who must try to make a virtue of necessity, in the hope of not irreparably jeopardizing their existence due to an unseemly agreement made behind the table with the police. During the game you are therefore faced with the map of the city, with an indicator that marks the current position of the car and a series of objectives that indicate the potential customers available nearby, the observation places that could be useful for extrapolating further information and service stations where you occasionally need to stop to refuel your vehicle. Interacting with the passengers of the taxi allows you to unlock new documents and clues for your investigation, which must then be consulted at the end of each work shift by reaching your office. Coming close to each individual it is possible to observefind the desired destination, the duration of the journey and its cost, having the freedom to decide whether to take charge of it or to go to another customer. Night Call offers an interaction really reduced to a minimum, relying essentially only on the tool of dialogues and the consequent disintegration of the information collected once you return to base. Nonetheless, it provides for the adoption of a strategic approach in managing the time available during each work shift, taking into account the money that must be accumulated and the choice of interlocutors with whom one wishes to interact. In some moments it is in fact necessary to limit oneself to loading the closest passengers on board, in such a way as to make cash and be able to make ends meet at the end of the day, while in other cases one can afford the luxury of heading towards those subjects who believes they can provide some useful details for the continuation of their investigations. Basically you have to face a sort of persistent alternation: on the one hand the search for information, clues and possible deductions useful for solving the case, on the other the need to survive, trying to keep accounts in order not to be fired prematurely by your boss. A necessity that should not be underestimated, since without a taxi it will not be possible to complete the work and the adventure will have to start all over again. Moreover, we cannot help but remark that the strategic space left to the user actually seemed very limited to us: the possible choices remain limited all in all, also by virtue of a very rigid play structure, which does not change register at any stage of the tale. To counterbalance the fixity of the interaction there is the excellent work done in the characterization of the over seventy characters with whom one interacts during the game; individuals with well-defined distinctive features, with diametrically different stories, which generally make the exchange of jokes between one race and another pleasant. Moreover, the success of the investigation will not only depend on the choice of the most suitable passengers to provide information, but also on the ability to bring each dialogue to the right track, so as to be able to extrapolate as much information as possible. At the end of each shift it is then possible to return to one's own apartment, where in front of a blackboard one has the opportunity to rearrange the latest information obtained, crossing it with those already available. Even in this case, however, there is the time variable, which often does not allow archiving all the material obtained in a single solution. In closing, it is worth noting that the texts are exclusively in French or English, which could end up discouraging some players.", "date": "2019-07-17", "grade": "6.5"}
