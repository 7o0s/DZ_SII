Welcomed to the tune of ~Bella ciao~, we returned to the traditional lobby of the game, appreciating the finishing work carried out on a technical level from there, and then launching with the parachute from the plane flying over the huge map that is the backdrop for the battle. The references to PUBG are very evident, in the end we are talking about a real clone which, however, has been able to take advantage of the popularity of the genre to renew itself and consolidate its position on the App Store and Google Play. Gameplay The winning formula of Garena Free Fire has not changed: while following what has been done by the other battle royale before him, the game offers very quick matches, which end within ten minutes and which therefore boast a much more frenetic approach than the standards. The inevitable barrier around the scenario therefore shrinks quickly, urging us to reach the safe zone in a few minutes and thus putting us in front of quite a few opponents involved in the same speed race. Touch controls and interface have been substantially optimized , with a very clear layout of the controls right from the start: it takes just a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the gameplay, also and above all thanks to a rather aggressive aim assistance, which remedies the fact of not being able to select automatic fire to move and aim with agility. This aspect of Garena Free Fire ultimately makes it very simple to win battles and get some victories, moreover, it is enough to avoid areas that are too open and therefore have a shelter available to be able to inflict damage on our enemies without suffering it in the same way, possibly resorting to a medkit to quickly recover lost life energy before the next shootout. Of course, the feedback from the shots is not the best ever seen and in this situation the various Fortnite and PUBG Mobile remain a step above. This approach, however, necessarily limits the thickness of the experience, which always remains devoted to the most stringent arcade and does not have too many problems even in fielding a very approximate management of the vehicles, still practically ancillary to all the rest. However, it suffices that this option is present, so that you can move quickly if there is a need. Structure Another aspect that has traditionally been improved over time is the structure, which in the case of Garena Free Fire can currently count on two different maps (Bermuda and Kalahari), as well as three modes: in addition to the classic battle royale, we will be able to try our hand at a fast four-on-four (Clash Squad) and with a traditional Kill Secured. In all cases the stipulations apply to both friendly and classified matches. After that there is of course the whole freemium system of the game, widely tested, which aims to monetize the aesthetic elements and the many collaborations (the last one, as already mentioned, with the television series La Casa di Carta) but without affecting our chances of winning a match. In this regard, we appreciated the speed and stability of matchmaking, as well as the presence of anti-cheat systems which should ensure strict compliance with the rules. Too bad for the obvious presence of numerous bots. Technical realization The feeling that Garena Free Fire is still tied to a chaotic and ramshackle artistic direction is still very present, just look at the loading screen with the Onimusha-style warrior who then leaves room in-game for a much more traditional aesthetic, PUBG-like . The contaminations over time have been numerous, and unfortunately even today the title does not boast its own personality. Having said that, on iPad Pro the game performs surprisingly well, it holds 60 frames per second in all situations and this does not create problems with touch controls, despite more fluid and accurate animations than the average as regards the characters. However, the scenarios are quite dull and the sound effects frankly unlistenable: a lot of work still needs to be done on this front.", "date": "2020-09-08", "grade": "7.0"}
