{"name": "Gunbird", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gunbird.html", "text": "There are several video game genres that have literally disappeared with the advent of polygonal graphics, set aside because they had given everything, and that of two-dimensional shoot and run is among them. It is a historical trend, of fundamental importance for the growth of video games, which over the years has become the bearer of a certain philosophy that is revealed in a precise gameplay and structure. Gunbird is an excellent exponent of the genre and has all the peculiar characteristics: upgradeable weapon, a myriad of enemies trying to hit us from everywhere, smart bomb and ~charge~ shot, huge end-of-level bosses... with the introduction of some novelties, in this case the presence of wizards (on board the most bizarre flying means of transport) instead of the classic spaceships, as well as a plot in which the protagonists venture out in search of some magical gems that can grant wishes. The conversion of Gunbird for mobile on the one hand surprises for the technical success, on the other it has to deal with inevitable ~cuts~ by the developers. In the original game it was possible to choose your own character from those available, while this mobile version allows us to control only Marion, a young sorceress who wishes to become the most powerful practitioner of magical arts on the planet. The stages have also been reduced, in length if not in number, but boast the same structure as the original product: hundreds of enemies shooting at us from everywhere and us having to destroy them while avoiding the blows, upgrading our main weapon and resorting, when needed, to the use of smart bombs and charged attacks. To tackle the six levels of Gunbird in the best possible way, we will be able to adjust the options to make life easier and therefore activate the autofire but also the automatic smart bomb, which is launched every time a bullet is about to hit us. As mentioned, Gunbird on mobile shows off a good technical realization, which perfectly reproduces the spirit of the game and which really moves a lot of sprites on the screen without any slowdown. Perhaps the only less successful aspect concerns the conversion of the dialogue screens, which seem ~badly scaled~ and appear grainy. For the rest, we have a sound sector made up of a small selection of very catchy MIDI songs and a control system that, for one reason or another, almost never behaves as it should. Apart from an annoying bug that in some cases ~locks~ the character to the right, basically the joystick of mobile phones (not to mention the numeric pad) is still not suitable for shoot and run, and you will end up moving only left and right by putting ( almost obligatory) the autofire in order to understand something in the chaos of shots and explosions. PRO Ideal for those who remember <strong>Gunbird</strong> Graphics up to the situation Catchy music AGAINST Cumbersome control system Short lived Much ~reduced~ compared to the original", "date": "2007-09-05", "grade": "S.V."}
