Released last November, Assassin's Creed: Rogue starts from the same assumptions of Black Flag, linking itself to the history of the Kenways and going to explore a narrative concept that the franchise had already touched on in Assassin's Creed III, i.e. putting the player in the guise of a Templar. Worse, than an Assassin who at a certain point decides to betray his own faction to go over to the side of the eternal enemy. The story is that of Shay Patrick Cormac, a member of the fraternity who operates in the eighteenth century, precisely during the course of the French and Indian war, under the aegis of Achille Davenport, Connor's future mentor. With training completed, Shay is sent to search for mysterious Forerunner artifacts, but when he comes into contact with one in Lisbon, the event unleashes a devastating earthquake that destroys the city. At this juncture we witness one of the most spectacular phases of Assassin's Creed: Rogue, with our character who has to flee towards the coast while the buildings collapse and the roads split, and at the same time the doubt arises in Shay that the actions of the brotherhood can be fallacious, even more so if they cause so many deaths. Determined to prevent a similar tragedy from happening again, the young Assassin decides to steal the manuscript in which the positions of the artifacts are reported, thus colliding with Achilles and his former companions, who chase him until he falls off a cliff and falls into a sea together with the book. Rescued by a group of Templars, the boy wakes up in New York and begins to collaborate with Governor George Monro, following a path that will lead him to join the Order. As interesting as it is, the plot of Assassin's Creed: Rogue shows its side to a whole series of critical issues, following a trend that has now afflicted the Ubisoft series since the episode set during the American war of independence. In fact, the initial idea has great potential, but Shay's conversion is not told with the necessary coherence, in fact the character keeps having doubts about his own work throughout the story, only to then unceremoniously attack those who were the his former companions. The involvement of Haytham Kenway and Adwal basically completes the narrative framework that connects Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag and Assassin's Creed III, but also in this case it is not explained why Edward's son passed through the ranks of the Templars, which suggests that Ubisoft wants to leave a door open to be able to return to the subject. Of course, the epilogue of the campaign will surprise those who have already had the opportunity to play Assassin's Creed Unity, but we expected a little more than a simple ~rescue in the corner~ for an episode based, as mentioned, on these assumptions. Between land and water From a structural point of view, as also illustrated in the review of the console version, Assassin's Creed: Rogue is practically an expansion of Black Flag, of which it takes up the mechanics, the dull gameplay phases set in the present (which closely follow just the events of Black Flag) and even the interface. Between the city of New York, the River Valley and the North Atlantic, the in-game action alternates between water and land, albeit with a predominance of the former, which will see us command the ship Morrigan and face a large number of sea battles with other vessels . In this sense, two differences can be noted compared to what was seen in the episode dedicated to Edward Kenway: firstly, the greater autonomy of the side cannon during boarding allows you to conquer enemy ships without even having to physically invade them, substantially speeding up the conquest operations and the subsequent collection of materials needed to upgrade the Morrigan (which includes flammable oil instead of explosive barrels); secondly, it will sometimes happen to be rammed and invaded by enemies, thus having to respond to a boarding attempt for the first time. Where the second element increases the variety of naval battles by a minimum, the first makes the sections in the open sea much faster, avoiding the delays that characterized the Black Flag experience after the first few hours. The complete map appears smaller, in this case, but equally full of places to discover, forts to conquer and warehouses to empty during your travels. As for the action on terra, the tailings have been completely eliminated (which in Black Flag were instead present in massive doses) and outpost conquest missions similar to those of Assassin's Creed Unity have been included, even if the design of some challenges leaves much to be desired and it almost borders on glitch territory (see the chase with Hope), thanks to the old running and climbing system and its tendency to get us stuck in anything. Speaking of old, unfortunately Assassin's Creed: Rogue adopts the pre-Unity combat mechanics and therefore appears completely unbalanced in terms of challenge, putting us in the shoes of a real Rambo, able to eliminate dozens and dozens of enemies in combos without even breaking a drop of sweat. It goes without saying that the numerous weapons available therefore become useless for the purposes of the experience, and that in the same way the enhancement of the character takes a back seat. Indeed, to be honest, we realized that it was possible to improve Shay's resistance (using hides and bones obtained from hunting) only after completing the game, incurring game over only on a couple of occasions during the ten hours that are served to complete the campaign ~straight to straight~, without wasting too much time in the side quests. Considering the aforementioned wealth of places to explore and collectibles, we can safely assume that the game requires at least twenty hours for everything to be done. A value that is by no means negligible (even more so since the multiplayer is not felt in any way), but which proves to be equally ~heavy~ if you have spent a lot of time in the Caribbean sea in Black Flag. In short, you really need to be a fan of Assassin's Creed naval battles to enthusiastically accept this new challenge. Assassin's Creed: Rogue is an interesting variation on the Black Flag theme, but feels dated on PC Old-gen The announcement of a PC version for Assassin's Creed: Rogue was in the air right from the reveal of the game and considering the conditions of the production it would have been reasonable to expect graphics equal to that of Black Flag, excellent but clearly not at the levels of Unity , which set new standards for the franchise. Trying your hand at Shay Cormac's story after completing Arno Dorian's is actually a disappointing experience, because the qualitative difference between the two games is very evident. The problem is that those who expected the PC version of Rogue to use the assets seen in Edward Kenway's adventure will be very disappointed, finding themselves faced with something that instead resembles a mere remaster, much closer to the visual quality of Assassin's Creed III than that of Black Flag, at least in the PC environment. Compared to the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 edition, some aspects are certainly better, first and foremost the rendering of the water, which boasts the splendid transparency and volume we were able to appreciate in the pirate chapter. But everything else, from the polygonal models to the shaders, from the textures (some of which are unwatchable, see the doors of the warehouses to be forced) to the lights, appears frankly dated. It is therefore no surprise that on the test configuration Assassin's Creed: Rogue runs at sixty frames per second (locked, however) at 1080p and with all effects at their maximum, using only FXAA as an antialiasing system (instead of the more advanced TXAA) and offering quite desolate landscapes in terms of non-player characters. It is enough to climb any building to notice the edges of a polygonal modeling which evidently had to deal with the hardware of the old-gen consoles and which was taken from there, precisely without the superior quality of the assets and effects seen in Black Flag, on next-generation platforms. These issues further highlight some flaws of the game, such as the lack of transition animations: Shay's run is mechanical like Adeline's in Liberation, it has no ~starting~ phase or lateral swerves, and it also appears little consistent with the speed of movement, giving the feeling that the character is on a treadmill. In short, if in terms of content Rogue can easily have its say, beyond a plot that moves between ups and downs, on the technical front PC users will only be disappointed.", "date": "2015-03-09", "grade": "7.0"}
