{"name": "Nintendo Switch Sports", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nintendo-switch-sports-recensione.html", "text": "We wish we'd written our Nintendo Switch Sports review a few years ago; it is, moreover, a game with a high commercial potential. It is ideally part of the ~Wii Series~ which, among franchises, is even third among those of Nintendo: we find it below only Super Mario and Pokmon, and largely above The Legend of Zelda. Why, then, hasn't this game come out sooner? We believe that the main reasons could be two. The first is that it doesn't go very well with the Nintendo Switch concept. Or rather, it enhances some features, both at an interactive level (motion control) and identity level (sharing of the multiplayer experience): at the same time, however, it has extremely specific controls, which make it inaccessible in portable mode. It wouldn't have been very consistent, therefore, to launch it together with the console. We repeat: Nintendo Switch Sports is not compatible with Nintendo Switch Lite, the pocket and less expensive edition of the platform, since it does not have Joy-Con. The second reason why we had to wait so long probably lies in the difficulty of ~translating~ the brand. Wii Sports was tied body and soul to Wii: in the Miis, in the philosophy of the console, in the name itself. And, in fact, the game has changed quite a bit, to belong to the same brand. Miis are supported, but the main characters are very different: more beautiful, less iconic. The same game has taken on a different title, evidently: Nintendo Switch Sports. Everything possible has been done to give continuity to the project, while adapting it to the current situation of 2022: we'll see how the public will react, for whom motion controls are no longer - for years - a novelty. Nintendo Switch Sports was directed by Yoshikazu Yamashita, who previously played this role in Wii Sports (2006), Wii Sports Resort (2009) and Nintendo Land (2012). Needless to specify how important Nintendo Switch Sports can be to understand the current commercial ~weight~ of a series that thrives on extremes, given that it has been able to sell more than eighty million copies with Wii Sports and less than half a million with another Wii Sports Club. Controls and multiplayer Nintendo Switch Sports: Motion controls are at the heart of the game The control system, as already mentioned and as you know, is totally based on motion sensors. You hold the Joy-Con detached from the console, which can be used both on the TV and in tabletop mode. The Joy-Con are extremely efficient, and their calibration is much faster than that of the old Wiimotes with Motion Plus: here it may happen that you have to place them on a regular plane (to recalibrate them, in fact), but it rarely happens. If anything, the doubts reside on the application of the controls in the individual mini-games, not on the quality of the same. All sports, with the exception of football, can be enjoyed with a single Joy-Con: a choice that clearly helps to experience the title in multiplayer. And it is not a matter of forcing, or a fallback as in other works: the essentiality of Nintendo Switch Sports goes very well with the use of a single Joy-Con. Nintendo Switch Sports: The game box As pleasant as it may be to play alone, it is clear that the soul of the title lies precisely in the multiplayer: both offline and online. It is no coincidence that the initial menu is divided into single player online, single and multiplayer offline and finally multiplayer online. In this field, Nintendo Switch Sports always proves to be a perfect title: in a few minutes you understand the mechanics, the controls and you can have fun right away, even competing with the most capable opponents. Even its appeal to non-gamers, or casual gamers, remains unchanged: we doubt that anyone will buy Nintendo Switch for this product, but everyone who has a console at home could give it a thought, so as to share the experience with those who usually does not play. Tennis, badminton and volleyball Nintendo Switch Sports: Tennis was a foregone return Let's analyze the three sports ~with the net~ (forgive us for the definition). Let's start with the most famous, tennis, which is an updated and improved re-proposition of that of Wii Sports. Also this time you can only play in doubles: obviously four of them each control a character, otherwise a user can manage both the tennis player at the net and the one at the baseline. Tennis is always fun, but it is clear that the greater possibilities of the Joy-Con (compared to the original Wiimote) have not been exploited: the direction of the shots still depends on the moment of impact, not on the type of movement. The effect that is given to the ball is more precise, but still rather vague, with the backspins that sometimes enter and sometimes not. We would have appreciated aThere is also a separate mode in which to move the protagonist, but clearly Nintendo has chosen to remain faithful to the original experience: it's always fun, but it could have been improved further. Nintendo Switch Sports: badminton, a novelty that has not completely convinced us Badminton is new, it had never appeared in Wii Sports, and we find it the least successful introduction, as well as the weakest minigame of the work. It's played with a single Joy-Con and only one-on-one, but that's not the problem: badminton is a big step down from Wii Sports Resort's table tennis, both in quality and controls. Here too the direction of the shot - if not in the smash - is very little felt, and the game is a continuous alternation between lobs and dunks, with the only variation allowed of the short ball, which in any case is not carried out with a particular movement, but pressing the backbone while generating a generic shot. The beauty of this sport lies in its speed (you hit about one ball per second) and this too is weakened. Nintendo Switch Sports: volleyball, an excellent compromise between immediacy and depth Volleyball is also making its first appearance in the series and it seems to us an excellent compromise between accessibility and depth of mechanics. There are three movements to be performed: the bagher, the lift (for these two it is mainly the timing that counts) and the smash (timing plus direction). To these are added the joke (which cannot be offensive) and the wall, the latter perfectable by moving the character slightly with the control stick. The latter is one of the gems that allow volleyball to reach a certain degree of complexity, exactly like the ~combos~ due to perfect shots: based on the timing with which you defend, lift and crush, the final shot will be more or less powerful . A perfect bagher gives the ball a colorful trail, a trail that can be increased (or vice versa) with an excellent lift and perfected by a well-executed dunk. The matches are played two against two, and one to four users can participate. Chanbara, bowling and football Nintendo Switch Sports: the chanbara, already appeared in Wii Sports Resort The chanbara is an evolution of the minigame already seen in Wii Sports Resort and which already had excellent controls at the time. Different types of swords have been included: there is the normal one, the one that allows you to charge a powerful blow and finally the two-bladed setting. Each has pros and cons and the minigame is really fun: it's all a clash between parrying (which is activated with the backbone) and offense. It is possible to hit the opponent if he is not defending himself, or - more commonly - if he is parrying in the same direction as the attack. In short: if your challenger is defending himself with the sword vertically, you will have to hit him in the same direction. If he's quick enough to get his weapon horizontal, then you'll be stunned and he'll be able to attack you. The duel ends when one of the two falls from the circular platform, and the match includes challenges to the best of three games (whoever gets to two first wins). We really appreciated it, due to its very nature it can only be played by two users; we only have some doubts about the long-term variety. Nintendo Switch Sports: Bowling, as fun as ever Bowling is a Wii Sports classic and has been further improved here: already at the time it was possible to imprint effects, which are even more precise thanks to the Joy-Con. Both positively and, fortunately, negatively (shooting a ball in a straight line is easy, but not obvious). It is possible to play from one to four users (even with a single Joy-Con) and a special, very difficult mode has also been inserted, in which the lanes are filled with obstacles. The physics of the ball and the pins are excellent and there is very little else to add: it is probably the most successful mini-game of the entire work, as a compromise between accessibility and depth. Nintendo Switch Sports: football, less realistic and immediate, but more profound than other sports Finally we come to football, another novelty of Nintendo Switch Sports. It is undoubtedly the specialty that ~detaches~ the most from the others, both because two Joy-Cons are needed to play (and only two users can challenge each other offline), and due to the lack of adherence to the original sport. Nintendo Switch Sports soccer is played with a huge ball and closely resembles Rocket League. There are both one-on-one and four-on-four matches: even in the latter, you control a single character. It is certainly the most complex and profound sport of Nintendo Switch Sports: the player moves with the left stick, runs (with relative fatigue bar) with the backbone and kicksmoving the Joy-Con. Just based on the movement of the Joy-Con you can make lobs, strong shots, lateral passes and it is absolutely not recommended to carry the ball without kicking it. It is important to understand well the functioning of the header (which is done by moving both controllers forward) and the bicycle kick, which can be performed by jumping and hitting the ball, which is fundamental in both defense and attack. It's definitely the sport that has given us the greatest satisfaction, but at the same time it has very little to do with real football, and it's less accessible than the other specialties. Nintendo Switch Sports: Strap Penalty is an accessory mode The variant with the Joy-Con inserted in the Strap, to be worn tied to the leg, seemed to us a secondary addition and nothing more: the direction in which you kick is essentially useless, you ~only~ have to carry out the gesture with the right timing, an operation that among other things, it turned out to be more complicated than expected. It is not possible to play matches in this way: it is precisely a separate mode, where you kick on the fly following crosses from the CPU, a challenge to penalties (which are not really penalties) against a single opponent. Graphics and customization Nintendo Switch Sports: Without online, character customization is limited Visually, Nintendo Switch Sports is truly remarkable. Apart from rare slowdowns (more in the preparation of the games than in the games themselves) and a little too much aliasing, the work of the Japanese developers has fully convinced us. The new characters are really valuable, a mix between Mii, Inkling (the characters of Splatoon) and the inhabitants of Animal Crossing. The uniforms, Spocco Square (the sports center that houses the game facilities), the stadiums: all simple, but stylistically well done. The music is in line with that of Wii Sports, albeit less iconic, and the dubbing is really basic. Nintendo has paid particular attention to left-handed people: knowing that many of them are encouraged by everyday life to develop a certain ambidexterity, it has given each user the possibility of memorizing a preference for sport. You will not necessarily select a single hand for each discipline, therefore: the writer, for example, is left-handed in tennis, badminton and chanbara, right-handed in volleyball, bowling and soccer. Nintendo Switch Sports: The logo of the game In terms of visual customization of the character, Nintendo has totally eliminated the concept of sex. There are forms and attributes that can be immediately associated with males and females, but there aren't many: on the one hand this setting will protect a part of the user, on the other - as a consequence - it makes the characters all too similar. The elements to customize the characters in more detail are absent in the normal game, they are unlocked through online play, by participating and - more quickly - by winning online matches. In this case too, however, they will be offered gradually, new ones will be introduced every week: once enough ~experience points~ have been collected, objects (sports, clothing, hairstyles) are unlocked from a slot, a slot which will be updated as the time. Online Nintendo Switch Sports: in bowling, online, fifteen opponents compete in an elimination race The online is not a simple addition, but an integral part of the experience. On the one hand, it has been well integrated, because it amplifies all the features of Nintendo Switch Sports, on the other, the progressive rewards method is a bit annoying, which should encourage you to play, because it clearly fills a gap in the elements available at the moment. top.As we said, in any case, online has been introduced in a very intelligent way. The Lega Pro (and relative ranking) is not yet available, which should push the most competitive players to improve their score, as well as compete against users of the same rank; however, it is clear that the network mode is mainly aimed at expanding local multiplayer. Are you playing Nintendo Switch Sports with a friend? It will be much more fun to challenge two other players (or more) online. It is not possible in all specialties, because badminton and chanbara remain one against one, and in fact they are the ones that have the least to gain from online. Nintendo Switch Sports: football, 4 against 4, is a kind of ~game within a game~ A nice detail lies in the multiple search: you can search for challengers for multiple sports at the same time, so as to slow down the breaks between one challenge and another. As much as we've tried, the disciplines that benefit the most from online are bowling and soccer. The first, just like in the pre-publication tests, proposes a challenge, with progressive elimination, against fifteen other users", "date": "2022-04-30", "grade": "7.8"}
