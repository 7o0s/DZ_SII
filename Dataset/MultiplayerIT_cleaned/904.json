{"name": "Mashed Fully Loaded", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mashed-fully-loaded.html", "text": "Let the fight begin! As already mentioned, Mashed Fully Loaded does not have the structure of the canonical car game, it is instead based on something different, in fact the goal is not only to win races by finishing first in a circuit, but also to earn points. Points are acquired every time you manage to lose your opponents, this can be done in different ways: for example by sending them off the road, using weapons to slow them down, or simply by driving as fast as possible. If you manage to create a certain distance from the enemy cars, then you will earn a point, if instead it was you who was lost by your opponents, one point will be deducted from you; the victory will go to whoever scores eight points first. The game camera has a very important role in this points structure, and for this reason it is not fixed behind our car as in the usual racing games, but it is variable according to the game situations. You start with a normal close-up rear view, and as the cars move further away from each other, the camera pans higher and higher to keep them all on screen. When a car is taken out of range of the camera, it is considered ~seeded~, the game freezes and points are awarded, after which it continues until some others are not seeded. When the camera is in bird flight mode, it does not follow the track perfectly, but is semi-fixed: for example, when making a curve, the camera does not immediately move behind the car, but remains stationary for a while and only after a few moments does it go back behind the car. The driving feeling is therefore different from the usual, it seems to be driving a remote-controlled car from the outside (as happened in Micromachines, even if here the view was really fixed), instead of a real one from inside. The physics of the cars also contributes to strengthening this feeling, steering is in fact very simple to carry out thanks to the very accentuated oversteer, and in the case of very tight U-turns you can also use the handbrake. On ice, however, things get considerably complicated, the cars skid excessively and cornering is a difficult undertaking, and only with the skilful use of the brake is it possible to stay on track. Mashed FL is not only based on score races, but there are other game modes, including the classic race to see who completes a certain number of laps first, a chase (which consists of reaching a fugitive before he completes 3 laps of the track ), and a timed race. The thing that makes this game more fun is the possibility of using weapons to slow down, and in some cases totally eliminate, the opposing cars. Even if there aren't many of them (there will be less than ten in total), the weapons add an extra touch to the usual and boring traditional race; with the use of missiles, mines, bombs, machine guns, things get much more interesting. In single or in multi? The mechanics of Mashed FL have been made very simple to allow even less experienced players to take the pad and immediately get into the spirit of the game. The controls are easy to learn and the tracks aren't too complex and long that you have to memorize them to have any chance of winning, but neither are they overly trivial that they all look the same. The playability is excellent, the frenzy makes the game action exciting especially in multi, but there are some defects related to the camera (which in certain moments does not allow you to see the track well), and others related to the difficulty of controlling the car on ice tracks, sometimes resulting frustrating. Mashed FL in single offers a varied number of challenges against the computer, some of which are unlockable as you progress through the game, which will keep you busy for some time, or at least until boredom takes over. In fact, Mashed played alone is certainly not the best of life, and could get boring even after a few games; however, if you have a couple of friends with whom you can spend time with, you will discover the true strength of this title, that is, pure fun. Too bad for the absence of online multiplayer, it would have been very welcome. Technically speaking The new Supersonic title focuses almost exclusively on playability and fun, deliberately neglecting the technical part. In fact, graphically it is nothing exceptional when compared to current standards, the overall quality of the textures is average, the graphic effects are extremely simple and not at all impactful, and the detail of the tracks is just enough. The sound sector is further lower than the gra onecool: trivial effects and absence of a soundtrack during the races. On the other hand, the possibility of using some phrases to make fun of the opponent during the race is particular and fun, such as for example ~you are slow as a suppository!~. All in all, the low technical quality does not affect a game of this type excessively, Mashed FL was not conceived to impress our senses, but exclusively to make us spend hours of pure fun with our friends, and in this it succeeds great. In conclusion, if you are looking for a crazy car racing title to enjoy with your friends for games full of laughter, Mashed Fully Loaded is for you. If you are looking for a serious racing game to play in single player, and perhaps with super graphics, you better look elsewhere. Pros Playability at high levels Tons of fun in multi Cons Poor technical realization Absence of Online Multi In single could get bored easily About a year ago a very particular game called Mashed was released for PS2 and Xbox. It was inspired by a videogame genre that spread a long time ago, or rather an arcade car racing game in which the physics and size of the cars closely resembled those of remote-controlled cars, and the view of the track was fixed from above or isometric. One of the most famous titles that are part of this genre is the legendary Micro Machines, certainly remembered by longtime gamers for the extreme fun that it was able to give even without boasting stunning graphics or dizzying sound effects. Mashed used the same and identical formula of Micro Machines, with the addition of a pinch of destructive madness: it was possible to take advantage of a varied number of weapons to annihilate the opponent and win the races... indeed it is better to call them real battles. Fully Loaded maintains the structure of its prequel, and makes some small changes to improve it: new circuits, new cars, new tournaments have been added and the playability has been significantly improved.", "date": "2005-06-24", "grade": null}
