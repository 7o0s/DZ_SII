So here comes a new version of the game on iOS and Steam (accompanied by the subtitle ~The Legend~ on the App Store to differentiate it from the original), with a narrative base to season a formula that remains invariably devoted to hardcore, characterized by a sequence of increasingly complex challenges to be faced in view of a campaign consisting of thirty levels. The protagonist of the adventure is a young treasure hunter who one day discovers the existence of ancient and mysterious ruins in the middle of an intricate jungle and decides to investigate. Incredible treasures are hidden inside the temple, but conquering them and getting out alive won't be easy at all, given the approach that the developers have chosen for this experience. Yes, there are some ~helpers~ that shouldn't be underestimated, firstly the possibility of spending a few of the gold coins collected to save one's position at a checkpoint, thus avoiding having to repeat the entire level all over again at game over, but in principle Temple of Spikes stands as a truly difficult title, in which timing and precision are fundamental. There is only one problem: the touch controls, however customizable, fail to guarantee the necessary reliability on more than one occasion, ~jamming~ at the wrong instant and thus causing many, frustrating, unjust deaths. Salvation comes from support for MFi controllers, but how many users own one? Between traps and spikes The connotation of the Temple of Spikes levels goes hand in hand with the need for a mobile experience, to be pulled out on any occasion when you have a free minute, perhaps to try once again that mission that we just can't complete. Generally the first phase is simple exploration, after which you enter one of the doors of the sanctuary and you end up first collecting gold coins, then solving real puzzles in the form of traps of various kinds. Those that appear most often, in different variations, represented the backbone of the original version of the game: pieces of floor or walls that detach and begin to move rapidly in the opposite direction, threatening to crush us or injure us with any spikes. Faced with these situations, we need to move very quickly, but at the same time be ready to identify the right brick to land on from time to time, so as not to lose one of the little hearts that represent our health bar. In the event of an error, it is possible to exploit some possibilities of rewinding time or slowing it down, the latter practice being indispensable in the presence of mobile threats, which manifest themselves in the form of lethal sharp blocks. On many occasions we are forced to take leaps of first intention, ~climb~ certain surfaces (again thanks to the pressure of the jump) and invariably rely on luck so that our actions lead to a happy ending. As mentioned, however, playing with touch controls it is really difficult for this to happen: the maniacs of great challenges could get excited in front of the experience offered by Temple of Spikes, but the wiser gamers and equally fascinated by the title of Tigrido will opt for the physical controls or they will fall back directly to the Steam version, which costs a little more (9.99 euros against the 6.99 of the iOS edition) but certainly offers a more reliable interface, less inclined to make us shout abuse at the screen with each failed attempt. The highly controversial nature of the game, which in fact chooses to characterize itself strongly through this ruthless hardcore approach, is accompanied by a very pleasant technical sector, in a retro style, which ~falsely~ recalls the productions of the 8-bit era but at the same time at the same time it draws heavily on an advanced effects and color palette.", "date": "2018-03-14", "grade": "7.0"}
