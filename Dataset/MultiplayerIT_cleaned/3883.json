It is a solution that is particularly successful for sportsmen, and which in fact has been adopted both by Electronic Arts for FIFA and by Konami for Pro Evolution Soccer. In the latter case, the renovation work also and above all concerns the technical aspect, reinvigorated through the adoption of the Unreal Engine. The powerful graphics engine developed by Epic Games also allows you to obtain defined graphics full of details in the mobile sector, net of a high frame rate, as well as including at least a part of the many assets of the console version of PES 2019. So let's talk about new animations for the players, an improved rendering for the faces of the most famous athletes, and in general a strengthened visual impact, which on the new generation terminals can be enjoyed to its full potential thanks to the adjustments included in the package, which allow set the quality to three different presets and choose between 30 and 60 frames per second. By testing the game on iPhone X, we were able to focus on the best possible performance without ever running into an uncertainty. Gameplay and structure In addition to the graphic improvements, PES 2019 Mobile boasts the introduction of new official leagues, new legendary players and a competitive multiplayer mode locally, as well as a whole series of nuances which, however, do not seem to have affected the original formula of the game, conceived as a sort of reduction of the MyClub mode but devoid of more classic content such as tournaments, the traditional season and even less the Master League. This means that those who approach this experience to play with their favorite team and its athletes will inevitably be disappointed. After selecting the team and coach, we will start with a shortlist of discreet brocchi who, however, we will be able to grow game after game, gaining experience and submitting them to targeted training sessions, to then replace them with high-level footballers unlocked in various ways: using scouts and agents, betting variable amounts at auctions and obviously using real money. In short, on the progression front, there is little to say: the maturation of the team is continuous and there are many elements that enrich the management phase of the experience, but the fact of facing random teams through an asynchronous matchmaking system transforms the first hours in a sequence of boring and dull matches, which end punctually with tennis results. In short, you have to wait a while before getting a decent challenge, but we doubt those who have already done extensive practice with the home version of Konami football can have all this patience. It's a shame, because even on the gameplay front, the solutions adopted by PES 2019 Mobile work very well, although they haven't been modified in any way in recent years. We therefore have the traditional controls, with large buttons that cover the screen a little too much, and a modern layout that instead works with gestures and is really immediate and pleasant, especially in combination with the invisible and repositionable virtual stick. Those who expected a slightly more consistent physics will be disappointed once again, like those who thought they could listen to a commentary in Italian with unedited dialogues: the duo Caressa / Marchegiani pours out the usual phrases and by now the need for a renewal on this too front became pressing. On the other hand, nothing to say about the online multiplayer, optimized and equipped with very fast matchmaking, with zero latency (but there are still quite a few people who leave the match when they lose), and about the signed soundtrack, with trendy songs that we can listen as we navigate the menus and manage the team.", "date": "2018-12-22", "grade": "7.0"}
