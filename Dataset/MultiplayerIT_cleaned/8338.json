While tended to be cheaper, versions of console games for Apple's tablet have almost always been the worst due to the absence of buttons and a touchscreen interface not taken into account in the design phase. The occasions in which the experience remains unchanged or even proves superior are very rare: titles like World of Goo, Aquaria and Osmos are the clear example of better conversions than their respective console or PC counterparts, but more often than not they are titles with an extremely simple and already ~tactile~ control system. This is why the unexpected release of Bastion on the App Store was initially greeted with such skepticism by fans of Supergiant Games' action RPG, aware of the precision required on certain occasions. However, after playing it thoroughly, we can safely say that Bastion for iPad is a welcome exception. History is nothing without controls Set in a realm known as ~the old world~, Bastion puts the player in the role of The Kid, one of the few survivors of a mysterious natural tragedy known simply as ~the Cataclysm~. The aim then is to find and rebuild the sacred shrine Bastion, uncover the mystery behind the destruction of the world and save the other survivors around the kingdom. All of this is enhanced by the wonderful voice of Logan Cunningham, an external narrator who dynamically describes everything that happens on the screen, accompanying the user and exponentially increasing the rate of involvement. After all, the narrative component and the art style were among the most praised elements of the game, and it's nice to see that on the iPad they have remained completely unchanged: the surface of each level composes as you traverse the world, while the soundtrack of Darren Korb is among the most original and inspiring ever heard in a tablet game. However, if the aesthetic and sound components have remained absolutely unchanged, the critical element is clearly represented by the controls adapted to the touchscreen interface of the iOS device. From this point of view, it must be admitted, the work of Supergiant Games has been truly remarkable: instead of adopting a simple solution based on sticks and virtual keys, the development team has proposed an alternative that is better suited to the game on tablets, thanks to which you can move The Kid by touching the arrival point directly, perform evasive somersaults with a double touch and in the same way choose the opponent on which to concentrate the attacks; to make it even easier and more intuitive, the protagonist automatically attacks opponents within range, leaving the player to concentrate on dodging incoming blows, defending himself with the shield, switching weapons or activating the special ability. This is clearly a very different approach from the one seen on PC and consoles but, thanks to the enormous fluidity and excellent response to the commands, it works just as well and prevents the player from falling into the void by mistake, which instead often happened with pad in hand. For those who prefer more control and an experience closer to the original one, it is always possible to activate the virtual stick from the options, but this time in the most excited moments all the limits that this type of setting has always brought with it emerge. Overall, the result obtained by the Californian developer has left us extremely satisfied, to the point that, although it is perhaps bold to define it as the best version on the square, it is certainly an alternative of the same level to the console counterpart, with the addition of the portability typical of a Tablet. Of course, the few adjustments listed will not be enough to satisfy those who have found the Bastion experience rather repetitive, but the large amount of upgrades, weapons, skills, side missions, bonuses and penalties allow you to customize your adventure and add a minimum of variety in what still remains one of the best productions available on the App Store.", "date": "2012-09-07", "grade": "9.0"}
