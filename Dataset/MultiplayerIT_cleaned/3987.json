{"name": "Friday the 13th: Killer Puzzle", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/friday-the-13th-killer-puzzle-recensione.html", "text": "We are approaching Halloween and the presence of good old Jason Vorhees becomes prevalent among films, video games and traditions of the period. Like a sort of distorted Santa Claus, the protagonist of Friday the 13th rages almost everywhere in the popular iconography of the feast of the dead, so it is not surprising to see him grappling with reinterpretations that are even rather daring compared to his traditional atmospheres and representations. In the case of the game subject of this review, or Friday the 13th: Killer Puzzle, Jason is used in a very clever way by the developers to package what is in all respects the sequel to another title, but equipped with a sort of total reskin which transformed it into a separate game, inspired in a completely atypical way by the famous series from which it takes its name. The progenitor we are referring to is Slayaway Camp, by the same authors Blue Wizard Digital, from which this new game draws the particular puzzle game setting, disguising everything in Friday the 13th style and entering the market conveniently close to Halloween. And yet, of all the commercial operations that may have Jason as the protagonist-symbol of this autumn period, this game represents one of the most original and successful ways to do justice to the myth, despite the fact that it ostentatiously and impertinently distorts the original spirit of the character, transforming him in a sort of caricature while maintaining a certain amount of cruelty. Indeed, in many respects the rate of violence here becomes even more impressive precisely because of the strange contrast that is created with the general cuteness of the game, although everything always happens with a basic humorous spirit. So much so that the developers have seen fit to insert the option to be able to play without the most violent drifts, thus making the title suitable for the whole family, or almost. Mother's heart The disturbing but indissoluble love relationship between mother and son, which is the basis of the original legend of Jason, is proposed here in a decidedly irreverent way, with the mother who at the beginning of each level encourages her big boy to tear apart all the unfortunate people who are found within the levels and it is also a nice expedient to introduce the various game elements. The continuous interventions of the mother initially also serve as a gradual tutorial and in this sense they represent an excellent idea, also to characterize a game which, in fact, has practically no narrative substrate, increasing the humorous and grotesque effect of the skits with a sort of constant commentary and compensating for the traditional mutism of the protagonist. All this soon becomes background noise, also considering that the huge amount of levels and the puzzle structure cannot allow a real development of a story, but it helps to build a truly particular atmosphere. In Friday the 13th: Killer Puzzle we find ourselves going through 12 settings in as many chapters, each consisting of about 13 levels, for a decidedly high total of hours of play, despite the fact that the first tests run away quite quickly. Among the scenarios you can see typical elements of the myth of Friday the 13th such as the iconic Camp Crystal Lake, the prison, the chalet immersed in the snow and then various more or less crazy digressions such as the post-apocalyptic desert, the hyper-technological future and more . The levels are unlocked by advancing progressively and the scenarios become accessible once the right amount of kills has been reached, furthermore feeding Jason's ~bloodlust~ through murders in sequence that also unlock additional bonuses such as alternative costumes and weapons, all elements exclusively aesthetic but which marginally enrich the gaming experience. A simple boy What is the central mechanic underpinning it all? It is easy to say: in essence, it is a question of killing all the characters that appear within a level. So far so ~normal~, at least as regards Jason's daily routine, the problem however is that the protagonist is a simple guy, which also manifests itself in his inability to fully control his own movements: imparting a direction to the protagonist , this moves along the corresponding stretch of land in a single movement, stopping only if it finds an obstacle in its path. This feature makes moving within the levels a bit problematic, also because it is possible to come across traps, fall into the water or be discovered by the guards, for example (all things that lead us to certain death) in addition to the difficulty of framing precisely the prey if you don't get perfectly close to it. It comes thento precisely study the trajectories to have Jason execute, perhaps exploiting the elements arranged in the scenario in order to change the position and make the protagonist reach, who otherwise would slip away up to the walls (or whatever is on the background ~scenes~) the desired points. It's a rather strange thing to explain that is best understood by watching the videos relating to the game, the fact is that a setting of this kind transforms the simple fact of having to touch the various characters on the screen into a sort of chess game, where each Jason's single movement must be weighed in time through a careful study of the position and possible trajectories. Several features combine to further complicate things: as you progress through the levels, additional dangers and adverse elements are added, such as water and fire that kill Jason instantly, traps or guards that eliminate us immediately if reached from the front. Other objects modify the study of movement, such as elements of scenery falling or transforming, or the fact that victims tend to flee if they are not surprised from behind or from the side. In short, the concept behind the puzzle is quite simple and in some ways reminiscent of chess or the game of 15, but it turns out to be increasingly complex and challenging as you progress through the game, also surprisingly stimulating, despite the enormous amount of levels present. Between horror and humor Such a type of game does not usually require a great deal of energy in terms of graphic complexity, once you have found the brilliant idea on which to base the gameplay, it is above all important to find a style that can give a peculiar character to the whole. Also from this point of view the work done by Blue Wizard is remarkable: the humor present is obviously coarse-grained, with a constant recourse to the bloody grotesque which can also be of dubious taste, but considering that we are talking about a game inspired by However, Friday the 13th is a notable digression on the fee imposed, which still manages to characterize the gaming experience well. Simple and clean graphics are the essential requirements also to always have an optimal view of the levels, which is essential to solve the puzzles in Friday the 13th: Killer Puzzle. On this front, the adoption of the isometric framing, although very pleasant to look at, can be misleading with its perspective. However, the developers have also thought about this eventuality, allowing you to switch at any time to a bird's eye shot which is certainly much less pleasant but also extremely clear to better plan the movements to be carried out without running into errors of perspective. When we fail, the game allows us to go back one move at a time or start the level again, in order to offer different possibilities to find a new solution, for those who prefer to re-plan everything from scratch or if we have managed to locate the exact point where we made a mistake that compromised the whole scheme. While the action feels repetitive in the long run, this dynamic correction system also helps keep us hooked after several failures. Finally, the inclusion of specific elements for each different setting capable not only of characterizing the different scenarios but also of influencing the mechanics of the gameplay itself, such as the aforementioned diversion elements between ice, fire, water, guards and so on, is appreciable .", "date": "2018-10-25", "grade": "7.5"}
