{"name": "Brian Basco arriva su Wii", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/73194-runaway-the-dream-of-the-turtle-brian-basco-arriva-su-wii.html", "text": "The first consoles made by Nintendo under the command of Iwata (Wii and DS) could have - and according to some should have - brought the genre of graphic adventures back into the limelight, both for the huge audience they were able to attract and, above all, for the system of control apparently similar to this type of game: both the touchscreen and the wiimote allow you to approach those commands via mouse which for years have meant that graphic adventures were developed on computers rather than on consoles, a combination so powerful that a way alternative to defining the genre has become really ~point and click~ (erroneous and inappropriate as it may be). The results, as we have already reiterated several times, have been very, very far from expectations: on DS there have been some conversions of famous games and few original projects, and these few, usually, have also been poorly ambitious... on Wii, unfortunately , it got even worse. Spanish adventures Runaway: the Dream of the Turtle for Wii is nothing more than the direct conversion of the game of the same name released on PC in 2007, following the appreciated and lauded Runaway: a Road Adventure of 2001. Both episodes were created from a talented Spanish software house, Pendulo Studios, which has seen fit to capitalize as much as possible with The Dream of the Turtle: in addition to being substantially identical to the one two years ago, the Wii version comes out in conjunction with the publication - on PC, of course - of the third installment of the series. In short, a move aimed at capturing new potential followers rather than satisfying longtime fans; on the other hand this flat, listless conversion represents, despite everything, one of the best graphic adventures - if not the best ever - available on Wii. The story of The Dream of the Turtle does not require previous knowledge, it is also appreciable by all those who have not tried the predecessor, and does everything possible to immediately involve the player through narrative techniques that are more cinematic than videogame, given that, without pressing any button, we witness the succession of the opening credits and the introductory film, until we are catapulted directly into the first area of the game. The protagonist, Brian Basco, a former first-class nerd, finds himself lost on a tropical island following a plane crash and, what's worse, he must also find out what happened to Gina, his girlfriend, who jumped with a parachute during the crash of the aircraft. The plot develops in a short time, grows bigger and, as is typical for adventure stories, takes on an ever wider scope, to the point of involving soldiers, colonels and other high-ranking personalities - a fact which, of course, it involves various setting changes here and there throughout the world. Nothing particularly original, but everything is narrated well and the fact that it is the protagonist himself who tells his (mis)adventures somehow justifies that sense of security that has always accompanied exploration in traditional graphic adventures. Scientific avatar The characters are quite well characterized, but it cannot be said that the developers have dared in this area: the use of stereotypes is continuous, and does not include any revisitation of the same. In the worst case, to ensure that the player immediately understands the personality of a secondary character, dialogues bordering on decency have been inserted, which take some sides of the character to extremes (the despotism of the American hawk, the carelessness of the beautiful bartender) and , at the same time, completely flatten the human depth that certain choices, positions or characteristics could (should?) have generated. In short, everything is sacrificed to the wildest adventure, amusement and reassurance despite being isolated, lost and then surrounded and wanted by the military, in the wake of Indiana Jones and, in general, of - almost - all television entertainment western. Instead, the interaction between player and protagonist is quite peculiar, given that Brian does not limit himself to passively accepting all the decisions that are imposed on him, but rather comments on them, criticizes them and, often, rejects them: this, in addition to allowing the development of the personality of the protagonist, transforms the ~commands~ into ~advice~, and helps, through a kind of dialogue, to find the solution to the various puzzles; on the other hand, of course, Brian's strong presence (often) prevents the player from making mistakes, trying, uniting and destroying objects, limiting, in a nutshell, his freedom of action. Brain teaser The interaction with the environment is completely entrusted to the pointer of the Wiimote, which replaces without distortionsPC version mouse. To move Brian, take an object, observe it, look at it or modify it, to scroll through the menus and in general for any other function that the game makes available, simply move the cursor and press A or B: the only procedure that results in po ' cumbersome - but it was like this on PC too - is the opening/closing of the inventory. The puzzles overall are quite creative, logical and satisfying, but there are exceptions: in some circumstances the solution is so absurd that it makes you turn up your nose, in others it simply appears artificial. What's worse, as in many old-fashioned graphic adventures (and The Dream of the Turtle is consciously old-fashioned), one gets the feeling - in some cases - of having to proceed in ~jerks~: despite having understood the final solution of a riddle you still have to go through some intermediate stages required by the game (but not by logic). Visually, the work of Pendulo Studios stands at excellent levels, both for the style used, and for the quality of the animations (with some exceptions), and for the characterization of the characters, and for the quality of the backgrounds and movies: the the only flaw is the lack of separation - in the settings - between the elements at medium distance and those very far away, a lack that excessively flattens some images.", "date": "2009-12-22", "grade": "7.3"}
