{"name": "What the Bat: la recensione del folle videogioco per PS VR", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/what-the-bat-recensione.html", "text": "What the Bat is an experience that cannot be missed in the library of all owners of a virtual reality viewer. There are so many laughs that he has given us with his absurd and irreverent puzzles that we feel like unilaterally recommending him. Its only drawback is the price, still a little too high for an experience that lasts about four hours, but as soon as this automatic smile generator goes on sale, it cannot escape it. Danish developers Triband are back after the success of What the Golf, the crazy video game that takes the basic concept of the gentleman's sport and transforms it into a whirlwind of nonsense and hilarious scenarios. What The Bat does the same thing by putting you, in virtual reality, in the shoes of a person with two baseball bats for hands. The scenarios in which you will find yourself will be his journey, from baby to adult, dotted with situations in which you will have to deal with the fact that his only way of interacting with the world are baseball bats. that made Triband's works iconic are back and in this review of What the Bat we will explain how this game, with its irony perfectly mixed with nonsense, is one of the best launch products for the PS VR2, but is also available for Meta and Steam VR. As the developers say ~Warning: this game will not make you a better baseball player~. Mountains of laughter Even brushing your teeth is a challenge in What the Bat There are products that make you think, excite and move, What the Bat makes you laugh and a lot. Rarely have we found ourselves bursting with laughter as much as with this game, because its way of combining virtual reality with the most classic puzzles is truly ingenious. Living with a pair of baseball bats instead of hands makes even the simplest of operations complicated, like brushing your teeth or eating breakfast and each of these little things turns into one of the 100 puzzles that make up the experience and that require little less than four hours to complete. Along the way you'll have to hit bananas, toothpaste tubes, carry eggs, do some graffiti, steal from an art museum and maybe even play a little baseball. Except for a couple of puzzles that are not immediately understandable, the fun of What the Bat lies in measuring one's strength to make the best use of one's baseball bats. And just when we thought that nothing else could have been done with two sticks instead of hands, the developers managed to surprise us with a new seemingly impossible mission, but which after a couple of blows, somehow, we managed to solve. Effective simplicity Breakfast is also the most important meal of the day in What the Bat, only to prepare it we will have to hit a banana In recent years we have tried various virtual reality experiences and we have verified firsthand that the level of nausea these experiences cause remains subjective (so it is always recommended to take breaks every half hour). Despite this, What the Bat didn't even make us dizzy or disturbed. This is because throughout the game you won't be able to move and the perspective remains unchanged in this way: everything you need to solve a puzzle is always at your fingertips. Playing means ~simply~ looking around and hitting things, therefore: in their graphic simplicity, the environments of What the Bat are very well built and do not give perception problems in virtual reality. This is certainly a big plus when it comes to battling nausea and headaches. What the Bat's other big plus is its puzzle-reset button. By joining the bottoms of the two baseball bats, the scenario will return to the initial settings; in this way, if an important object has fallen to the floor or is blocked, you will just have to restart the level without having to navigate between menus and various screens, something that in VR is always annoying. The game is then divided into 9 chapters, each with 10 or more puzzles to solve or things to hit until something happens. This also makes it excellent as a 10-minute filler: What the Bat is perfect to be enjoyed in small bites, giving yourself a smile on a stressful day. This is a simple but effective product, the demonstration that you don't need extreme realism or millimeter tracking of movements to have fun in virtual reality, you just need a very good game design.", "date": "2023-03-24", "grade": "8.5"}
