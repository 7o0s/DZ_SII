{"name": "Throne of Darkness - Medieval Japan Action!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/throne-of-darkness-medieval-japan-action.html", "text": "Rice balls for lunch More than the effects and the music of the game, it would have taken the music of the films of Bud Spencer and Terence Hill, seasoned with sound slaps to describe what awaits you: a global brawl! Broken furniture, samurai here and there, little skeletons flying around and you who won't understand a damn stone. Furthermore, the first impact is very discouraging, given that your men will begin to wander around in the grip of an AI rather under the fumes of alcohol, starting to die like flies, while you will struggle in the tussle to call for reinforcements and to raise the dead in the field, and then hope to get away with it. Calm. Let's go back upstairs and try to understand something. Let's talk about the interface, therefore, since it will be necessary to access the panel of formations and behaviors to save the skin. First of all it is necessary to assign to each samurai a passive aggressive or neutral stance, a ranged or melee attack and also the weapons to be used in sequence. If we put a sword in first place, a bow in second and a spell in third, it means that when the sword breaks, the guy will start shooting arrows and that when they run out, he starts with fireballs left and right. This is provided that you have also activated the formation to keep in play. The tiger, the tortoise, the dragon are just three of the various formations/dispositions of your men. A criticism must be leveled at this procedure. Why do I have to activate training to make a character behave? Not to mention that it cancels itself every time I bring in a new samurai, and if I don't notice it in time, the AI of the characters returns to zero and the massacre starts again. Furthermore, given that there are a maximum of four samurai that can be actively used, this implies that a newcomer goes to occupy a ~virtual behavioral slot~ occupied by the previous one that we have excluded, therefore *every* time it is necessary to re-set the melee/distance history, passive/aggressive and so on. You all understand how this does not help much on the much-vaunted immediacy, on the contrary, it complicates things for a long time, before you manage to speed things up with practice. So get ready for a good dose of salvo, set, go down, send up the wounded, bring in the healthy, re-set, continue. The game makes you nervous, at least until you find the blacksmith who fled his forge in a panic. Katana salami slicer Here comes the nice stuff. Unlike Diablo, to use the blacksmith's services it must first be found, and what's more, it must be replenished! In the sense that the guy won't start churning out armor, swords, bows and spears as if it were raining, but you have to bring the raw material yourself. So, roll up every object that falls from your opponents, then give it to him (you don't need to physically return to him, just a shortcut) going to increase the stock of material, and you will see that now he can manufacture, sell, repair various objects. Plus obviously the cost in money. It is therefore not easy to learn how to manage the amount of raw material and money available, because if you ask for a sword you will not consume many resources, but if you ask for a shiny full plate, you will see that the guy will run out of stock to manufacture it. Idea on the one hand original and realistic, on the other uncomfortable. He will also be able to ~socket~ various ingredients and/or gems into objects by altering their properties at will, a bit like in, you guessed it, Diablo. Then there is the priest to find, who will sell potions, identify objects, cure curses. Plus a nice function that allows you to donate objects or money on the altar of the 4 deities belonging to the elements fire, earth, water and air, in exchange for points to be assigned to skills. Nice isn't it? Getting the favor of the gods was very important at that time, entire wars were fought on these ideas I walk out of the Dojo and I'm Mojo And go. You leave the palace and the real danger of the countryside and dungeons, forests and mountains begins. The ~interface-shelter/care-setting~ matters are completed here. While now exploration and quest solving are given free rein, mostly beating the bad guy and taking the object back, but basically we always remember that we are talking about action-rpg. Scattered around the realm are the inevitable portals. Think they are even oval and blue in color, and you even have the pattern in the left half of the monitor like the one from the Blizzard game. At this point a question arises: we are still faced with dutiful and reverent quotationsbig ~D~ or are we faced with a shameless copy? Let's continue Sushi for dinner Technically speaking, and unlike our samurai, we are not dealing with a monster. I hope there is still a long way to go for Click Ents. In order to gain experience, given that for the umpteenth time D2 still gives the fodder. The game shoots conspicuously in 800x600 if we keep more than two samurai in play at the same time, and when the spells start, which don't even offer mind-blowing light effects like those of D2, the game goes into a beach holiday slideshow effect. The models of the samurai and enemies in contrast offer good animations, even if the tussle that will often arise will not give much space for admiration of the same. What is needed is a good processor from at least 500 MHz upwards, lots of RAM and a fast HD. Usual words by now, but you will understand that for an isometric 2D it seems a little exaggerated to me. Nothing to say for the concept of the objects and scenarios, as well as the look of the enemies and the setting as a whole, definitely spot on. Midnight snack... and then sleep on the Futon Without infamy and without praise this Throne of Darkness, which I don't feel like fully promoting for the reasons listed above and for the (too) obvious copying of Diablo. On the other hand, I would recommend it to those who love the formula of the Blizzard title, the menu settings, the hack n 'slash, and who want to have some fun with a decidedly atypical setting compared to the usual. Perhaps by combining a pinch of ~party-gaming~ having the use of more than one character at the same time. I also tried the online multiplayer a bit and, server permitting (given the frequent crashes, and here I am addressing those who continue to criticize Battle.net without looking around to see what the situation is...) I managed to understand , together with some American patrons, which is essentially a challenge between the clans present to skin themselves. Not a star then, but a game that comes out at a distance, also because it's long and has random-dungeons. To be faced with passion and dedication Japanese! The introductory video I couldn't help but offer you images taken from the introductory movie, really funny and cartoon oriented! Sake for breakfast Arigato. You will have to address the PC with this formula, preferably accompanied by a bow, before sitting down ready for a session at Throne of Darkness. Oh yes, because here we travel eastwards to the Far East, but not only ... we also take a leap in time to the Japanese Middle Ages, when the clans ruled the Japanese lands. The setting of this Action/RPG is in fact quite original, if we consider that the medieval fantasy we are used to is dotted with typically ~Western~ references, while here katanas, dojos and oni are the order of the day, and mythology merges with the culture of the rising sun. ToD is a game that draws heavily from the gameplay of Diablo, having been created by a ~rib~ of the Blizzard staff, reborn under the name of Click Entertainment. The action is not lacking therefore, and neither is the much-loved 2D isometric view. Are we facing a shameless clone? Let's wait to judge, given that some efforts have been made to give that extra edge to an already successful recipe. First of all, you don't control just one character from a number of different classes, but you control them all! Let me explain: you belong to a clan, and you can have 7 of the best fighters of your people, which you can control up to four at a time, switching at will in your ~roster~ of characters. There is the ~bricklayer~ as I affectionately call him who is huge and splits mountains in two, there is the silent and lethal ninja with his shurikens, there is the sword master, the charismatic leader, the archer , the berserk and of course the wizard. As you can see, the classes are there and are fully exploited, but it will be you who will choose the combinations as you like best, given that it is always possible to ~teleport~ a character to and from the initial game room. Each of them starts with different primary characteristics, which can then be modified at will as the level increases. The same goes for spells or skills (and here the typical Diablo tree structure stands out). The game begins with the siege of your palace by the demon lord's armies, and your lord in no uncertain terms orders you to go downstairs and fix things, in other words it's not enough for youRare a bucket of water from the balcony to stop the noise... but it takes all the strength and dedication you will have in your body. And here the difficulty begins.", "date": "2001-10-08", "grade": null}
