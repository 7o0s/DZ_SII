Despite being a niche brand, Fire Emblem Heroes has still attracted the attention of those who have never played a real episode of the series; slowly, Nintendo's strategy is paying off and it wouldn't surprise us if the next Fire Emblem coming out for Nintendo 3DS, Shadows of Valentia, will surpass the sales of the previous Awakening and Fates. In the meantime, however, it is important to understand that Fire Emblem Heroes is not a true Fire Emblem, but a rosewater adaptation which, in our opinion, does little justice to the strategic depth of the series. Five star fanservice Fire Emblem Heroes is basically a ~gacha~: the player spends the spheres received as a gift or by completing certain missions to play a kind of lottery in which the most famous heroes and villains of the saga are up for grabs. The plot justifies the ploy by placing us in the role of a ~summoner~ able to wield a magic gun that can open gates in parallel worlds that the evil empire of Emblian is raiding and which is opposed by the kingdom of Askr, led by the prince Alfonse and his sister Sharena. Unfortunately the story is told in a hasty and superficial way through the dialogues that precede and follow the missions: mind you, it is only a pretext to bring together or collide the heroes taken from the various Fire Emblems, but the campaign - currently made up of nine chapters and about forty missions - it is completed in a few hours and, in the absence of a real ending, defers the player to future software updates. Once the campaign is over, you can still replay the missions on higher difficulty levels to earn a few more spheres, venture into the training tower to improve the various characters and look for a more or less frustrating challenge in the arena. Fire Emblem Heroes is in fact an extremely simple strategy and when things finally start to get a little more complicated, you realize that in fact you don't only need strategy, but also and above all a lot of luck... and many spheres to spend in hopes of finding the strongest five-star heroes. Although it is possible to improve all the units, the costs are initially prohibitive and the shortage of spheres and resources suggests that Nintendo has planned a system that relies on patience ... or on compulsive shopping, since the spheres can obviously be bought with real money. Although it is a consolidated mechanism in the mobile gacha market, it is a bit bitter to also find it in a Nintendo video game that bears the name of Fire Emblem. The guys from Intelligent Systems also had to adapt the complex mechanics of the series to a format that must be usable in bits and pieces: in a certain sense they did it, but the brevity of the missions, combined with the excessive simplification of the maps and of the balance of power between the units will make those who grew up turn up their noses by resetting the games every time they lost a character in the missions of the real Fire Emblems. Fortunately, Fire Emblem Heroes is at least very pleasant both visually and acoustically: the illustrations to collect (because that's what it is) are splendid, the super deformed sprites decidedly pretty, the maps very colorful and full of details. The experience is accompanied by the most famous music of the series, albeit rearranged, and by a discreet voice acting that gives voice to the heroes every time they act in battle. Fire Emblem Heroes is a concentrate of fanservice, but it has very little strategic left Developer interview We had the opportunity to ask Kouhei Maeda and Shingo Matsushita, the directors of Nintendo and Intelligent Systems respectively who worked on the development of Fire Emblem Heroes, a few questions. How does Fire Emblem Heroes stand out from the plethora of ~gacha~ video games? for mobile systems? Maeda: Unlike the usual ~gacha~, Fire Emblem Heroes is a unique game as players can decide the type of character they want. In fact, when they summon a new unit, they can choose a color: for example, choosing red will give them a sword-wielding warrior, and so on.Matsushita: We designed this game knowing that many fans love the various Fire Emblem characters. In other words, we made surethat each character, after leveling up, can compete with others in even the most difficult missions. We've also included the ability to choose the type of character you want to summon so that the player doesn't have to rely too much on chance. Will you also be developing a social infrastructure, such as a chat window or a guild system? Matsushita: At the moment we have no plans for that. That said, I'd like to point out that we're not ruling out social mechanics. Once we understand how to integrate them effectively, we could also decide to implement them. Will we also see the characters of Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia, the new game for Nintendo 3DS due out in May? Maeda: In fact, the Fire Emblem Echoes staff and the Fire Emblem Heroes staff are one big family that has developed all of the Fire Emblems to date. Some of us are working on both projects at the same time and this means that, in the future, we may consider the expectations of our fans. Fingers crossed. For now, we hope you enjoy Fire Emblem Heroes as is! Do you have any special events planned that will cross over to other Nintendo video games like Super Mario or The Legend of Zelda? Matsushita: Not at the moment. How deep is the story in Fire Emblem Heroes? Matsushita: The story of Fire Emblem Heroes will continue as long as we actively support the game. If we also consider the ideas that we have just started working on, I would say that this is a huge game and I hope you will follow us to find out what happens in the future! The more you support us, the more compelling the story will become.Maeda: We will continue to write the story of Fire Emblem Heroes at a rate of two updates a month, and then it will continue approximately every two weeks. In addition to the war between the kingdom of Ask and the empire of Emblian we plan to add side adventures that tie into previous Fire Emblems. We hope you like them!", "date": "2017-02-09", "grade": "6.5"}
