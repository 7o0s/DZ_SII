{"name": "GT Legends - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gt-legends-recensione.html", "text": "Return to the days of thunder The Simbins are back, this time with a driving simulator that pays attention to the FIA GTC-TC championship races, i.e. the one in which the classic cars of the fabulous 60s and 70s compete whose drivers must be monsters of skill and courage to be able to dominate them! After the excellent GTR, these guys still amaze with a totally simulative title, with which they intend to pay homage to the Papyrus masterpiece: the legendary GranPrix Legends, a title that has remained unbeaten so far in the field of simulation and (above all) difficulty. Let's move straight to the major new features: an all-new engine capable of realistically switching from day to night, with the sun moving until it sets. The level of detail of the cars is also impressive, and each of the ninety cars available (it should be noted that they are much less but with all the teams for each model) is recreated with absolute fidelity. The intelligence of the opponents is excellent; these make accidental mistakes and go head-to-head for overtaking. In the event of an accident or dangerous maneuvers, they try to slow down or avoid obstacles and, depending on the level of difficulty, they behave more or less aggressively. This time it is possible to choose between five degrees of ~effort~ for an approach to the title that goes from simple to impossible. Attention has been paid to those occasional players who do not want to suffer too much frustration in the first few games, so much so that there are various driving aids if necessary. An attempt has been made to make the game usable for everyone and not just for those who live on bread and flying. After the excellent GTR these guys still amaze Gentlemen, start your engines It must be said: 16 players facing each other online with these monsters is a must-try experience! In addition to the usual variables offered in classic multiplayer, it is possible to race using bonus cars (winning them means having lived on this game) which allow you to show your skills to unsuspecting opponents (who may be light years away from the coveted prize). Praise and more praise for the management of a server, customizable in everything: from the choice of tracks (after one race you can immediately move on to another), up to the category of selectable cars. Everything is very simple and allows even the inexperienced easy management. As usual, broadband is absolutely mandatory, even better if it's as fast as possible. Also try the night races which, with the danger of damaging the headlights, are even more exciting! Finally, it is also possible to play in LAN or with direct IP. Music in car Excellence also in the audio part: as in the previous GTR, the noises of the cars come directly from the various teams involved. The result is total sound realism! There had been some doubts that classic cars had been available for ripping but what you're hearing is coming from each and every car. All sounds are in place and the difference between the Mini and the Ferrari 275 GTB is audible! If you want you can race with in-game music and, very happy news, you can listen to your favorite songs by copying the MP3s to the specific folder of the game! Purists will avoid but in high rpm races hearing some music can make Pleasure. 16 players facing each other online with these monsters is a must-try experience! Final comment GT Legends takes simulations to new heights, both in terms of physics offered, as well as total customization and level of difficulty. This time even rookies will be able to approach a world that until now was the exclusive prerogative of Hardcore players. Many cars and tracks, a myriad of competitions to face and an exceptional multiplayer guarantee hours and hours of gameplay and a gradual learning curve capable of satisfying everyone. Too bad for the damage model, the only real flaw of this title and the only aspect that has not been studied much by the SimBins. Recommended for everyone but a steering wheel and a high-end PC are a must to fully enjoy the potential offered. Pros Real simulation Graphically appealing Guaranteed longevity Cons Damage model to review Requires a powerful PC Some details less taken care of Havok?no ISI! The physics of the game are overall very realistic, thanks to the engine developed by the ISI (the programmers of the EA F1 series) and able to truly diversify the modifications to the hundreds of parameters of the cars. In the case of accidents, the matter undergoes enormous ups and downs: some rollovers are realistic and wonderful to see but damage management and some situations reach the ridiculous. The loss of parts or the marks on the bodywork are very limited and the crashes effcarried out at high speed do not give the desired effects. This also affected GTR and the SimBins underestimated it here as well. Really a pity because excellence could have been achieved and thus mark a new method of comparison for all the games to come. However, it remains clear that a Gran Turismo falsely displays the wording ~Real driving simulator~. Special effects... What to say? The photos speak for themselves, GT Legends is really nice to look at in some respects, a little less in others Let's continue with the merits: the cars are very well made, equipped with many polygons and high resolution textures (not to mention reflections!) and painstaking attention to detail. The care taken pleases everyone, especially in the various colors that distinguish the stables; unless you hate a certain model, you will be spoiled for choice! It is also possible to activate the high-resolution interiors, which are truly exceptional (only Project Ghotam 3 will be superior), and equipped with a worthily animated pilot. Most of the surrounding elements are also good, especially the people (not the usual cardboard silhouettes but well-made polygonal men). It's a different matter for the tracks: these see ups and downs, some full of detail, others make it seem like you're running in an infinite field... but it cannot be said that there is something really bad. The problem, as already mentioned, is in the damage model, which sees ridiculous deformations and loss of pieces, which float in the void or enter the track. Unfortunately, there is still a lot to do here. Note on the progressive passage of time that sees the sun move and finally set! The day gives way to the night and to the lights (try not to break them otherwise) with a naturalness never seen before. The flaws on the shadows have been corrected and overall the desire to always run at the end of the afternoon triumphs! [C] Phenomenal cockpits! No comments needed...
