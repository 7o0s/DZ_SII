{"name": "Prince of Persia: Rival Sword - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/prince-of-persia-rival-sword-recensione.html", "text": "The story I know how to... [warning, contains spoilers] While managing to bring the Prince of Persia saga back to its former glory, one of the most complex things of the whole game is still today the plot. As obvious and crystal clear it is for all those who have been lucky enough to play and finish all three chapters, there is a large group of people who have been lost in the passages of time. After fighting his first battle, the siege of the maharajah's city, the prince is deceived by the Grand Vizier and with a magical dagger breaks the hourglass of time, thus freeing the sands. Having survived the transformation into a monstrous creature, the prince reaches the top of the maharajah's palace where he uses the dagger with the hourglass again to rewind time and return to the moments before the attack on the city, defeat the Grand Vizier and stop his evil plan . Prince of Persia Warrior Spirit, takes place six years after the first chapter, and tells the story of the prince grappling with Dahaka, the incarnation of destiny, who is looking for him to kill him. To avoid ending up two meters underground, the protagonist will undertake a long journey up to the moment of birth of the sands of time, in an attempt to stop its creation and save his own skin. Here he will meet Kaileena, empress of time, whose death will trigger the creation of the sands by mistake, resulting in a further journey into the past to put a patch on the umpteenth damage to the time line. With Dahaka defeated and Princess Kaileena safe and sound, the prince finally sets course for Babylon, his kingdom. At this point Rival Sword begins, with the city of Babylon in flames and the sad fate of the prince ready to be fulfilled again under the sign of the sands of time. Principles of balancing act The aim of the game is the same as always, with gameplay built on a solid mix of stealth game, platform and scrolling fighting game, the prince will find himself walking the streets of Babylon in search of his greatest enemy, fighting hordes of servants of the Vizier and climbing the sumptuous and ruined walls of his hometown. Since its rebirth in 2003, the Prince of Persia saga has re-presented itself to gamers as a classic video game with an action structure where the protagonist's evolutions among the architectures of the settings are largely the masters, and also this re-proposition on PSP it does not lack in this aspect: the game action is fluid, as if jumping from one building to another, spinning around a pole and already sliding down a narrow passage is in fact a single well-orchestrated movement, the spectacularity of actions has always gone hand in hand with ease of control of the character within the setting. Practically only a couple of keys will be enough to be able to get the better of the prince's controls; in fact, one of the strengths of the game has always been represented by the immediacy of the controls and this new version for psp is no exception: by pressing X the prince will dive, roll and climb on the ledges offered by Babylon, with the backbone R will be able to run on walls, with L he will look around freely in search of the best path to follow, while practically all the other keys will be used in the battle phases against enemies. The fights, while remaining faithful to the basics of the series with a whole series of combos based on fast and acrobatic movements, follow the stealth influence that the programmers wanted to give to the game, giving the player both the possibility of facing his own opponent who hit him from behind without anyone noticing (that's where the idea behind Assassin's Creed came from?), slipping between the Babylonian architectures and striking lethally. This particular mode of combat will be usable if the player has enough timing: to execute the deadly combo in its perfection, it will be necessary to press the Square button in pre-established moments (indicated by a short blur effect), moments which, if missed, will interrupt the combo with the result of attracting all the enemies in the vicinity. In addition to the return of the sands of time, which can be used once again to repair one's mistakes in both the combat and the exploration of the ruins phases (there is only one way, any error in judgment can be lethal), the version makes its debut evil and obscure of the prince, a being that feeds on death that resurfaces from the protagonist's head following the recurrence of his sad fate. The Dark prince, armed with a sword very similar to Ivy's (Soul Calibur, those specieswhich transforms into a whip), is much more powerful than his nemesis, more agile and lethal, but owes his survival to the death of his opponents: the curse that hangs over his head wants him to kill to keep his energy at a level of security. Parallel to the innovations that gravitate around the prince, real racing sections have also been included in the game with the use of chariots along city routes. In addition to the main mode linked to the story of the prince of persia, Rival Sword will allow up to two players to challenge each other wirelessly on some ad hoc maps. These maps will provide players with different more or less difficult (and therefore more or less long) routes along which it will be possible to directly hinder their opponent by activating traps and pitfalls to slow them down towards the ~finish line~. Grey, brown, yellow Unfortunately, despite all the good possibilities that Price of Persia is capable of offering, the gaming experience collides with a low optimization of the software with fluctuating fluency and at the same time a good graphic structure and one of the worst texture creations (and choice of color palette) that have never been seen on psp: the settings are flat, finding the footholds is often a matter of luck and the enemies are difficult to recognize from each other. Rival Sword confirms after Revelations that porting a game like Prince of Persia to a laptop is an incredibly complex job: although many elements work perfectly even on psp hardware, there are several aspects of the game that are not up to par on home consoles. Prince of Persia proves to be a game of balance in all respects: the game action bases its solid gameplay on the prince's ability to move gracefully whatever the environment he runs through (both vertically and horizontally), and the technical sector it is the perfect fusion of a game of balance between graphics, sound and fluidity; although the lesson of the prince's balance has been learned from the psp, we are still not there on the technical front. Prince of Persia Rival Sword, while containing all (and even more) of what was seen and played in ~The Two Thrones~ on consoles just a year ago, on balance is an ~incomplete~ product due to a whole series of technical problems that strongly undermine the gaming experience. The developers have been able to take a step forward in terms of gameplay and effective accessibility to the game session but have not been able to move half a step in terms of technical quality. However, the game remains a decent gaming experience for those who have not had the good fortune to experience the prince's adventures on consoles, for all the others it remains - unfortunately - more than an option. Try again, Prince! Pros: Simple and intuitive controls Varied and not very repetitive gameplay New extras for the psp version Cons: Revisable optimization Graphically dull Short-lived The generation of kids who lived at the turn of the 80s understood a very important and basic life lesson: you don't mess with time. The three films related to the Back to the Future saga have shown us how the cosmic balances are absolutely unstable in the face of a possible change in the past. Marty McFly spent three films chasing his mistakes due to time travel, and in this element he is perfectly comparable with another great icon of those years, brought back by Ubisoft: the Prince of Persia. The Two Thrones (this is the name of the last chapter for home consoles) lands on a laptop with a different name - Rival Sword - but which once again anticipates the dualism that prevails throughout the game, a dualism enriched by a series of specially designed extras for this version. Has Ubisoft hit the mark again or is it finally time for them to turn back time and erase their mistakes? The hard answer to psp hardware.", "date": "2007-06-19", "grade": null}
