{"name": "Gladiator: Sword of Vengeance", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gladiator-sword-of-vengeance.html", "text": "Would you understand Quintus? Would I understand? In packaging this title, the US house of Turok took inspiration from Ridley Scott's masterpiece drawing liberally from what are the key points of the plot of the same. In fact, we will take on the role of the strongest and most celebrated gladiator of all time, Invictus Thrax, who, after a series of clashes with opponents of all sizes, will find himself in the presence of the ignoble and bloodthirsty emperor Arruntius, successor of his beloved Trajan. Guilty of brutal acts for even worse purposes, Arruntius will also be the conspirator of the death of Invictus. But the fate of our protagonist will not be to succumb to the oppression of the emperor. Found and protected by the will of the Gods, Invictus will become the weapon of revenge hurled against an empire that is in turmoil. As you will have well understood, the quotations proposed by Acclaim, as well as drawing on the aforementioned ~Hollywood work~, draw more than one cue from Greco-Roman mythology. In the illustrious presence of Romulus and Remus, who in the game will be the guardians of the protagonist, we will also find among the enemy ranks titans and cyclops, who will be added to the more traditional skeletons, human gladiators and spirits of various kinds. This is just the appendage of a bloody game, which leaves no room for the player's imagination, materializing in bloody fights characterized by moves that are as spectacular as they are brutal. Gladiator: Sword of Vengeance is therefore a decidedly canonical scrolling fighting game, with markedly cinematic features thanks to the rigid setting of the camera and a combat system designed to affect both the purely spectacular and the playful level. Characterized by easy-to-use controls that can be assimilated within a few game sessions, the clashes will make use of an original and effective feature; at the dawn of a fight, in fact, Invictus will automatically identify the two closest enemies by hooking them with a sort of lock on and, through the skillful use of the triggers by the player, he will switch from one to the other, lavishing himself in flashy combos. All this will not only serve as a choreographic outline, but will be of vital importance to carry on the game successfully. The multiple combos staggered between two opponents will be used to activate a wide range of bonuses that will affect the performance of our alter ego; these add-ons will be discovered along the adventure thanks to challenges, mainly timed, detached from the main game. Strength and honor Gladiator: Sword of Vengeance also offers some tiny adventure extraction gimmicks, defined solely by a few levers to pull and an exploration thread too tied to the framing choices made by the developers. In fact, Acclaim, to give as much cinematic quality as possible to its title, has opted not to leave the player with the possibility of managing the camera, which instead will dynamically and independently follow Invictus Thrax. Therefore, if on the one hand the game will enjoy first-rate shots, on the other it will run on too rigid tracks. Nothing excellent even with regard to the polygonal models, which turn out to be rather thin and characterized by poorly cared for textures, as well as animations that are not always suitable. On the other hand, the settings are fluctuating, which if in some circumstances are detailed and evocative, in others they denote a certain negligence on the part of the programmers. Often the graphics engine is also in trouble which, with a frame rate that is not exactly granite, suffers above all from the most chaotic and pregnant circumstances. On the other hand, the management of the lighting sources is of a completely different kind, a real spearhead of a somewhat subdued technical sector. On the sound side we have a well-made dubbing entirely in Italian and a set of soundtracks shamelessly inspired by the magnificent OST of the film Gladiator. Comment Gladiator: Sword of Vengeance is ultimately an attractive title, even if not excellent. Strengthened by a combat system that combines innovative elements of certain interest with cinematic spectacularity, GSoV unfortunately pays its due to Acclaim's immeasurable vehemence in wanting to amaze at all costs and with a technical realization that is not always up to par. Unfortunately, the excessive linearity could make the most demanding turn up their noses; on the other hand, the possibility of playing the role of a gladiator, with all the annexes of the case, will make the lovers of Ancient Rome happy. Pros: Spectacular fights. Dubbing in Italiancared for. Suggestive and cinematic. Cons: Linear. Technically swinging. My name is Massimo Decimo Meridio, commander of the army of the North, general of the legions Felix, loyal servant of the only true emperor Marcus Aurelius. Father of a murdered son, husband of a murdered wife, and I will have my vengeance in this life or the next...~ acclaimed film by Ridley Scott, Gladiator. This film was literally star performer in the film season three years ago, reaping acclaim from both viewers and critics, so much so that it won 5 Oscar awards. The repercussions of this event in our beloved gaming world we feel only now, with two titles set in Ancient Rome ready to warm up our winter evenings: Gladius and Gladiator. The latter is the clear intention on the part of Acclaim to revive, albeit without a license, the emotions arising from the homonymous film. An attempt appreciated above all thanks to a background that has been missing on our consoles for some time; so epic, suggestive and damned rooted in us that it doesn't even seem so distant in time. So let's find out what harvest we humble video gladiators will receive with this latest effort Acclaim: Gladiator: Sword of Vengeance.", "date": "2003-12-04", "grade": null}
