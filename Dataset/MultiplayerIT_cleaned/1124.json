{"name": "Grand Theft Auto Advance", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/grand-theft-auto-advance.html", "text": "The difference between Grand Theft Auto III / Vice City / San Andreas compared to the first two top-down chapters is not simply a transition to the third dimension, although it has to do with this: in fact, the reason for the critical success and commercial of the saga lies in the fact that starting from the third episode Rockstar has totally reformulated the gameplay of the game making the experience as a living world full of situations, with a rate of interaction with the environments, objects, characters and situations progressively broader and more articulated. It is not a question of a simple claim of ~realism~, of a complex plot or of easy exploitation of violence and its charm, given that attempts much more marked by realism, the complication of the narrative or ultra-violence have failed miserably. And this due to the fundamental difference of the design, which in the transition to 3D has freed itself from forced linearity and repetitiveness and has been able to offer a range of new, varied and engaging situations, creating a network of games within the game where the person with the controller in hand wondered only to choose where to start. GTA Advance has little of this progressive liberation, and mostly manages to clean up the big flaws of the very first titles without being able to aspire to a real leap forward that would have required courageous and expensive choices in terms of game design. That's not to say the game is bad or extremely poorly made. Control over the character and his weapons has greatly improved over the first incarnations, with the ability to stop the direction of fire and a range of weapons taken from the last episodes. The driving missions are many, and the side-missions, complete with extra packages to track down, guarantee many hours of violent racing, massacres of enemies and helpless bystanders. However, the general experience is undermined by some structural defects. Firstly, the car missions, on which most of the gameplay is based, have been unified in the time trial style, eliminating all the variations on the theme such as the running gunfights, the race to see who survives and so on. Street. Secondly, the very physics of the vehicles is strange: while being driven in very different ways in homage to their own identity, the various vehicles respond in a schizoid way to external solicitations, bouncing excessively in the event of a collision, challenging the scrolling follow them when accelerations are too abrupt or stuck in corners and on buildings (although the major annoyances of the impossibility of getting off when parking too close to a building have been eliminated compared to the first episodes). Thirdly, the concept of a large living city, full of situations to explore freely, is completely skipped: there is no entire map of the game but only a corner in the radar at the bottom, precluding healthy active exploration; and the missions never shy away from the classic patterns of elimination, time racing and delivery, while the general flow in the game allows for so little variation that it results in extreme linearity. Surely the judgment is spoiled by the merciless comparison with the major episodes, which travel on hardware capable of giving life to a more active and vivid simulated environment. But the feeling remains that more could have been done by simply investing in the design of the map rather than giving life to what is undoubtedly a big-name clearance package, simplified, made easier (pretty permissive police for a very long time in 'advancement) and reduced in scale for a small cartridge to be released at the right time. For those who doubt that the greater linearity is a precise choice for a laptop and a pick and play game model, the denial will come immediately with the absence of a save mode independent of returning to always save in the same point of the map, which which makes the game totally unsuitable for a take it, play it and shut it down approach. In fact, collecting ten extra packs to unlock a new save point takes even longer than finishing a mission. In general, the game suffers from a certain lack of care, be it in the form of small details such as the statistical data that scrolls on the screen all together without a minimum of menus or worse, poorly designed missions that do not contemplate the player's arrival on a half rather than on foot and they cut off for almost no reason. Simplification also operates  and this more predictably and partly in an understandable way this time  on an aesthetic level. The graphics, although spartan in photos, are pleasantly animated by pseudo-3D effects such as scaling, zooming and polygonal elements for the edifici, though in general the style would have benefited from some rendering or cosmetic work. The sound offers very few songs to listen to on the radio, and practically no vocal effects apart from the nice little voice of the police following the progress of the wanted man on the streets or other haggard effects. The worst treatment was received by the plot, decidedly superficial and with uninteresting and simplified dialogues, inserted in narrative frames, however well designed in the typical low-key style of the series. The limitations of the hardware make it unfair to compare with the latest games in the series, from which GTA Advance tries to imitate the feel and variety and integrate them with the mechanics and interface of the very first two-dimensional episodes. But this would have required adequate design work and a good dose of courage, time and inventiveness, without which the result is undoubtedly a title that is at times pleasant but which does not go beyond passing interest, and indeed sinks into repetitiveness. Which, at this stage of the saga, unfortunately triggers unequal comparisons and could bore you to the point of screaming ~it's a crime!~ even (and own) the best Grand Theft fans. Pros: Lots of missions and extras Improves many flaws of the first 2D GTAs Cons: Lacks a complete map Tends to repetitiveness Very questionable vehicle physics Definitely linear Grand Theft Auto arrives on GameBoy Advance with the first, ~real~ attempt to transpose the lucrative license to a portable computer after the painful conversions of the first episodes for Playstation published in 2000. And after bouncing from developer to developer like a hot potato, it peeps out on the Pocket Nintendo just in time to take advantage of the wave of renewed GTA-frenzy, generated by the last episode for PS2. Rockstar has recovered the two-dimensional interface and the game view from above, that of the episodes prior to the 3D explosion of GTA III. And he has tried to update and update the gameplay, feel and gaming experience to the way they are presented in the three-dimensional episodes of the saga. The result is discreet, but not without superficial errors, excessive simplifications and in general a great sense of impoverishment that in no way manages to convey the experience of the older brothers, but only to smooth out the biggest defects of the very first chapters.", "date": "2004-11-26", "grade": null}
