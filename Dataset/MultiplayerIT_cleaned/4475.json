It's a fact. And if you don't agree, the door is over there: close it softly when you go out. It's clear you're #teamJacob and you like Twilight, piss it off. Apart from the jokes and complicated jokes that those poor people who really have it in syrup from Twilight will have understood, the cat is one of the most intelligent, fascinating and dignified animals that exist, but above all it is also one of those most endowed with ~personality~. Anyone who writes about cats has had more than fifty and there was one that didn't have something that clearly distinguished it from the others! They are little people. Some cultures even revered them or still revere them. The Egyptians venerated Bastet, a goddess with feline features who represented the sun and protected the pharaoh, i.e. the incarnation of the god Ra. The Japanese built the Gotokuji temple in honor of a cat who, according to legend, would have led a feudal lord to safety. And still in Japan there are some islands, such as Aoshima, where there are more cats than humans. Purrfect Date is set on such an island, even if not necessarily the Japanese one, but the feline overpopulation hides a mystery... Here kitty, kitty, kitty... In Purrfect Date we play a young researcher (we will choose his features among six different portraits, three for each gender, at the beginning of the game) in charge of cataloging and looking after the cats that live on this tropical island on behalf of Professor Pawpurr, a famous scholar of the feline race. The same evening of our arrival, however, the unexpected happens and, after having recklessly entered a dangerous area of the island, we find ourselves the following morning with the ability to communicate with the island's cats. Apparently we have been contaminated by a virus that transforms humans into cats: at this point the game really begins and our most important task will be to discover the antidote to prevent the transformation. Purrfect Date is divided into six chapters and during each of them we will have to strategically manage a limited number of opportunities: five appointments with cats, three investigations and three attempts to synthesize the antidote. The game is actually a visual novel, rather than a dating simulator, and our answers in some cases can lead to the sudden closure of a chapter, preventing us from exploiting the other possibilities and putting us on the way to one of the eighteen different endings foreseen. Purrfect Date might seem like a weird title based on a bizarre idea to say the least, but in reality the little developer Bae Team proves, within a few minutes, that he knows his stuff. The game is simply very well written, even if it is completely in English and this could alienate those who are unfamiliar with the foreign language. The dialogues are sparkling, flowing and imbued with irony and double meanings, but above all they are not at all obvious. Even the notorious ~dates~ with cats are far from trivial feline-themed romances: they feared some bad taste dialogue, instead they serve more than anything else to get to know the five protagonist cats better and, in some cases, to find out more about the 'island. There is no place for zoophilia or vulgar humor, something on which the script moreover makes fun of several times. However, the real protagonist is the island which, at times, reminded us of the one in the famous television series Lost. Discussing with the inhabitants, information and secrets come to light that make up a surprisingly complicated mosaic. It is almost impossible to get to the bottom of everything in a single game: the adventure lasts about four or five hours, depending on the choices made during the chapters, but the numerous alternatives guarantee a good level of replayability, especially if you want to discover every secret and read every dialogue. In a visual novel - a story that is only partially interactive, for those unfamiliar with the genre - it is difficult to find real defects: it is a very particular genre that focuses on resonance with the player/reader. It is clear that those who hate cats, perhaps because they are allergic or perhaps because they are ugly inside, will find the concept and feline themes insignificant, even if Team Bae has not written a simple eulogy to the cat, but a decidedly more universal story. If we really have to nitpick, we must admit that the style in which the adventure is illustrated did not fully convince us and that the soundtrack, however catchy, tends to become annoyingly repetitive.", "date": "2017-12-25", "grade": "8.0"}
