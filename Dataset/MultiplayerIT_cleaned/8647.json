{"name": "La pazienza dell'angelo", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/101047-la-pazienza-dellangelo.html", "text": "If on the one hand it is clear that Nintendo struggles to propose new series and characters, relying often and willingly on the ~usual suspects~, on the other hand it is also true that Kid Icarus: Uprising can be considered almost as an unprecedented franchise given the time that has elapsed from the last official appearance of the protagonist Pit. 21 years, an eternity, to the point that in all likelihood most of those who will play the new episode have in fact never played or heard of the chapters that appeared on Nes and Game Boy. It is therefore obvious and necessary that Kid Icarus: Uprising is a game that takes this type of user into account, without however forgetting those who instead have more videogame experience on their shoulders, and perhaps have spent time signing online petitions and hoping for the return of the putto of Kyoto. If pleasing everyone was frankly impossible, no doubt Masahiro Sakurai and his Sora Ltd. team tried hard; the result is a product of the highest level, thanks to which 3DS owners can celebrate the first year of life of the Nintendo portable in the best possible way. A pair of wings part time The hero of Kid Icarus: Uprising remains the angel Pit, committed to saving humanity from the armies of the underworld led by the evil Medusa. Luckily, Palutena, the loquacious Goddess of Light, helps him in this arduous undertaking, who in addition to filling large slices of the adventure with chatter (a pity for the lack of translation of the speech into Italian which in fact prevents you from fully following the dialogues) is able in a much more useful way to allow the protagonist to fly. A short-term faculty however, since the flight phases can last a maximum of 5 minutes; a narrative solution that allows Kid Icarus: Uprising to show its two faces within the individual levels, which in fact divide into two clear phases in the air and on the ground. The first is represented by a shooter on rails largely similar to products such as Starfox, Panzer Dragoon or Rez, albeit with less complexity in the mechanics (for example there is no multiple hooking of enemies); in this case, Pit is controlled with the slide pad, with the viewfinder managed via the stylus on the touch screen and the shot linked instead to the L backbone. The second phase, and more robust from the point of view of the game time involved, is instead that of land where the game becomes a third-person action with platform elements; in this case the control system is also called upon to manage the video camera, swiping the stylus on the lower screen in the desired direction, with a complexity factor that takes a long time to gain the necessary confidence. In reality, there are numerous variations for the control to choose from using the appropriate options, but the impossibility of using a second analog even when using the Circle Pad Pro peripheral, which on the contrary is only useful for left-handed people, limits the validity of the alternative solutions. Of the two macro components of the Nintendo product, certainly the most successful and enjoyable is that of the flying sections: compact, synthetic, dense and enhanced by a fast pace and moments of great visual spectacularity, perfectly supported by the three-dimensional element offered by the laptop of the house in Kyoto. However, thinking of a Kid Icarus: Uprising entirely based on these sections inevitably leads to imagining a product destined to quickly become repetitive and unable to remain interesting in the long run; therefore, the earthed phases constitute the ideal element of balance to guarantee the solidity of the product. As previously argued however, in such moments the gameplay shines a little less, basically due to the control system that fails to prove to be complete and reactive enough to handle the greater complexity, especially as regards the management of the camera and the 'use of the shot; moreover, the level design, very linear but not criticizable for this, presents some qualitative drops on the occasion of the often frustrating platform sections or the not very incisive moments on board the vehicles. We are certainly not talking about defects capable of ruining the game, mind you, but it is equally evident how Kid Icarus: Uprising is somehow unable to express its potential to 100%. The 3D effect There is little to do, the Nintendo titles remain the best to demonstrate in the best way the goodness of the three-dimensional effect of the console. Even in Kid Icarus: Uprising the rule is confirmed, with a visual depth that offers its best in the flight sections, absolutely spectacular with the 3D stick activated. Effectiveness as often happens ismore aesthetic than practical, but that's fine... The importance of the outline But to give Sakurai's effort a decisive boost in terms of quality, the so-called ~surrounding~ elements contribute in a fundamental way, which in reality however prove to soon possess a fundamental importance in the overall picture. To be honest, the ~things to do~ outside the main mode are so many and so well structured that they appear even overwhelming at first. A cornerstone is represented by the element of weapons from which Pit can choose which one to bring into battle; numerous and divided into nine categories, each of them has precise aesthetic and qualitative characteristics which determine not only the effect of the shot, but also bonus or malus attributes to be carefully considered. If this were not enough, the possibility of merging two different weapons to create a third becomes an exceptional stimulus for the player, even in the face of the possibility of using this weapon also in multiplayer mode. Furthermore, the management of the ~currency~ of the game is absolutely fundamental, represented by the hearts that it is possible to collect during the levels by basically eliminating the enemies or selling the weapons that you do not want to keep. In the same way it is also possible to spend them to buy new offensive tools, as well as to increase the difficulty level of each mission; the more challenging the value chosen, the greater the disbursement of hearts necessary, but at the same time success will guarantee prizes and treasures of higher value. Also, some areas of the levels locked behind gates are only accessible beyond a certain difficulty setting. An opportunity that overturns the classic rules that we are used to knowing, which offers a further element of freedom and choice to the decidedly intriguing player and enhances replayability. And the management of powers is also fundamental, or attributes of various types that can be activated during the levels to increase attack, defense, recover energy and much more; the choice of which ones to take with you takes place through a special menu, in which each individual power is represented by a sort of tetris block to be fitted with the others within a square grid. An aspect that therefore limits the total number that can be used, adding a further strategic element to the game mechanics. We spoke previously of the multiplayer mode, which can be tackled both locally and online (with a really reduced lag during our tests); it is basically a single deathmatch or - better - a 3 against 3 team, where in the latter case the light and dark teams challenge each other by killing a common energy bar. Once exhausted, the last eliminated component transforms into Pit, who with his superior powers may eventually be able to turn the tide of the meeting. The result is often chaotic and in any case partly reduced by the difficulties associated with the controls, but in any case extremely appreciable especially for the aforementioned connections with the main mode as regards weapons and hearts. In reality, there would be many other things to say about Kid Icarus: Uprising, but it is also right to leave the pleasure of discovery to those who choose to approach Nintendo production. Certainly, however, we cannot keep silent about the graphic component, always robust if not even sumptuous on the occasion of the flight sections; here, thanks to the possibilities offered by the progression on tracks, the 3DS really shows its best with exciting scenarios, continuous perspective changes and spectacular camera stunts. More generally we appreciate the quality in the modeling, the high level of detail and simply the stylistic quality of the Japanese designers. Finally, a final note on the plastic stand in the package, on which to place the console and which should allow you to play the game without the infamous wrist and arm pain from gripping one hand. A somewhat coarse solution and in any case not always feasible for an evidently congenital problem.", "date": "2012-03-26", "grade": "8.8"}
