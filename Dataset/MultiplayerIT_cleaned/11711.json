Gameplay wurdweb, the beginning of a challenge If you know the Scrabble rules, you already know how wurdweb mechanics work. Within the various unlockable modes, which introduce more or less complex terms and any ~territorial~ objectives to be achieved (see for example the conquest of a specific box), the game creates puzzles that are different each time, asking us to perform a certain number of ~joints~. We will not have single letters available to compose words, but ready-made terms, which we will therefore have to intertwine in the best way in order to create space for new combinations and cover, where possible, the inevitable boxes with multipliers . And if there are difficulties, a handy help button will promptly come to our rescue. In practice, the wurdweb interface is extremely simple, and while also supporting Bluetooth controllers, it lends itself very well to touch controls, which indeed represent the best choice, especially for playing on the small screen of a smartphone. After all, just touch one of the words available to us to make it appear on the board, then drag it where we want. There are no superfluous checks: the horizontal or vertical orientation of the term changes automatically when we intertwine it with another already present, visually signaling when insertion is possible and asking us to confirm it with a further touch. That's all, but with a big lack: there is no multiplayer mode. Structure wurdweb, a billboard already crowded with words The one offered by wurdweb is therefore an exclusively solitary experience, but by confronting the procedural puzzles, the modalities and the variants available in the game, this limitation gradually takes on more acceptable connotations, being replaced by that pleasant feeling of relaxation that comes into play when you try your hand at a pastime like crosswords and the terms come out which is a pleasure. In short, despite its absolute simplicity and its inevitably derivative approach compared to the classic Scarabeo, the new title by Adriaan de Jongh hits the mark and surprisingly succeeds to offer something that much more famous productions often overlook: immediate, effective, perfect for mobility and surprisingly varied gameplay. Technical realization wurdweb includes special boxes with multipliers The wurdweb ludic system had to be clearly supported through a clear and legible interface, compatible with a large number of languages (including Italian, of course) and easy to manage. Well, this goal has been successfully achieved by the author, who has managed to make the input system really essential, even at the cost of a few stumbles here and there. The classic board with the words has also been embellished by the presence of small, cute characters with geometric shapes who go to invade the field for a walk, with no particular motivation other than to provide a touch of color while we think about which term to insert and which are the joints that will give us a better score.", "date": "2021-08-20", "grade": "7.5"}
