This decline could only be avoided by giving rise to a serious modernization of the product in question, in order to provide new purchase reasons for users. Unfortunately, at Neversoft it was evidently preferred to squeeze the most out of one's workhorse, reaching a point where one honestly has to question the real need to give light to the new fourth chapter of the series. In reality, at least on the native soil, already from the previous episode the inclusion of the online game had at least provided for a glimmer of novelty: unfortunately, the impossibility of accessing the network in Europe has nipped in the bud any multiplayer ambitions for production Activision, therefore forced to have to base its entire attractiveness towards the population of the Old Continent on the (scarce) novelties in terms of pure and simple gameplay. And it is precisely here that, unfortunately, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 begins to show the signs of the passage of time in a decidedly evident way. The decision, much heralded on the eve, to eliminate the mission system in favor of huge levels populated by characters to interact with, turned out to be much less revolutionary than hoped for. In reality, the only difference is that the objectives are provided by dialogues with the aforementioned NPCs rather than a previous briefing. Furthermore, the fact that a large part of the tasks to be performed is made up of the classics of the genre (collect the letters, score a certain number of points, perform the stunts, etc.) definitely decreases the influence that the new solution has had on the structure of the title. For heaven's sake, there are unpublished mini-missions: to name a few, it may happen that you have to stay attached to a car that has just been stolen for a handful of seconds in order to dissuade thieves, or even warn your skating companions of the arrival of a boring policeman, only to then have to eliminate, by passing over them, the advertising billboards attached to the walls. Despite this, it is clear that these solutions have very little impact on the overall economy of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4, which on the contrary tastes like deja-vu during every moment of the game. For the series: if you are a fan of the Neversoft spearhead, throw yourself a fish, but if on the contrary you have never found great stimuli in skateboarding around jumping here and there, then certainly don't expect to change your mind. The weight of the past Assuming that the lack of real novelties in terms of gameplay can be a defect with a decidedly subjective weight, the same cannot be said for the technical aspect, which objectively suffers over the years. Although the settings make their appearance, thanks more to an excellent quality of the textures than an effective increase in the poligon-counting, on the side of the animations it is impossible not to feel the need for a heavy restyling, if not an entire reprogramming from scratch. In fact, the addition of some accessory moves is contrasted by numerous others present since the first chapter of the series on 32 bits which, if at the time they made a great impression, nowadays in the year 2002 they leave little more indifferent. The same goes for the collision system, practically unchanged over the years and very rich in clear inconsistencies and defects, made even more evident by the greater complexity of the settings. Average sound, slightly subdued compared to previous episodes. Comment Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 therefore represents the exact continuation of the path inaugurated several years ago by Neversoft, without any kind of surprise or particular novelty. A decidedly run-in gameplay, perhaps too much, and a style of play that has given birth to a real genre are the key elements for a title that does not require particular explanations. Quite simply, fans of the previous episodes who still want to put themselves in the shoes of the most famous skater in the world will find in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 everything that made the series great. Similarly, the lack of real and marked innovations lead to discouraging the purchase of the rest of the users. Pros: Solid and well-tested gameplay Great longevity Fans of the previous episodes will love it Cons: Very little innovation Animations not in step with the times Too self-congratulatory Sound subdued Tony Hawk's Pro Skater has been, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the most important titles of the last 7 years: beyond the enormous sales success, especially in the United States, Neversoft's (masterpiece) has created a real own new genre, in everyone's facethose who thought it was impossible to say something different and original in the modern video game market. There are now dozens of Tony Hawk-like titles, for every platform and based on every possible extreme sport, from bmx to inline skates: but, as anyone with the slightest smattering of marketing knows, the life of any commercial product is divided into phases that start from birth, go through development and sales boom, and then head towards the inexorable and inevitable decline.", "date": "2002-11-27", "grade": null}
