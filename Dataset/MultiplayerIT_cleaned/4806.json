Flipping Legend concedes something to the somewhat redundant aesthetic of pixel art indie titles, but immediately stands out for several features that make it easily recognizable already at first sight. The use of voxels has also become a sort of canon in independent productions by now, but the particular fusion of graphic style, animations and accompanying music manage to create a truly explosive amalgam in this game by Hiding Spot and Noodlecake . The layout is that of the endless runner, with the protagonist running over perspective scenarios by jumping diagonally from box to box on a sort of chessboard until the end of the various levels, trying to avoid obstacles and knocking down enemies to refill a bar that consumes over time, but even in this case the description does little justice to the sensations given by the game when you are with your fingers on the screen. Starting from the control system to get to the deepest layers of the gameplay, including the role-playing grafts that characterize it, every single element of Flipping Legend is well calibrated and inserted into the context in a balanced way to build a picture with simple, almost Spartan outlines, but vivid and coherent. Jumping legends By touching the right or left side of the screen, the protagonist makes a diagonal jump in the corresponding direction, moving one square in the grid of which the scenario is composed. The squares can be empty or contain obstacles, enemies or bonuses, thus imposing quick and clear choices to be made in the protagonist's movement, because by touching the obstacles, energy is lost and one finds oneself forced to start over from the beginning, while the eliminating enemies is essential to recharge the energy bar which drops continuously and with great speed, thus forcing us to move quickly towards the end of the level in order not to run into game over. Precisely the speed of execution therefore becomes a peculiar characteristic of Flipping Legend, which bases its gameplay on the sense of rhythm: like a sort of new Rez, in the game you find yourself making jumps following the rhythm of the engaging musical base, a loop with variations on the theme at the change of level which is well set up to favor precisely this synergistic action between the movement of the character on the screen and the audio accompaniment. The simple but addictive bouncing action is enhanced by a progression system based on experience levels that unlock new abilities for the character according to complex skill trees, and by the accumulation of money that allows the purchase of different characters, which they also impose quite different styles of play. The free-to-play setting of Flipping Legend is very honest, allowing you to enjoy the game even for free, at most with the need to watch some advertising to open bonus boxes but it is not a mandatory element of the gameplay. If you want, you can still remove the ads and still access the chests through a single in-app purchase which essentially unlocks the game.", "date": "2017-06-24", "grade": "8.3"}
