Born and unveiled almost five years ago as the fourth installment of the series released in 1998 which had the incredible ability to structure the stealth game genre, the new Thief was the victim of a long and difficult gestation period which caused it to lose its traces generating a whole series of mythologies and legends concerning the development team and the realization of the project itself. The title was then announced again last year, this time losing the number four alongside the title and turning into a sort of remake of the original game, almost halfway between the ideal sequel and the total reboot along the lines of what has always been done by Square Enix, the publisher, with Tomb Raider and Deus Ex for the past two years. The writer has therefore considered it crucial to leave aside any reference to the original series because if on the one hand that remains untouchable and with such a value as to disintegrate any comparison with the modern product, on the other hand it would also have been unfair in light of the objective of the Thief 2014: tell the reckless and tragic adventures of Garrett, master thief whose past is unknown to us. Nothing else matters. And if you absolutely want to be a romantic in search of points of contact with the saga of the past, know that Basso will play a central role in this remake, the city in which the action takes place is the redesigned and updated version of the City of third chapter, here too Garrett loses one of his eyes (although in reality he doesn't lose it physically but if he finds it in an enhanced version) and finally Erin, the co-protagonist of this chapter, could be the same girl who tries to pickpocket the expert thief on Deadly Shadows ending. But now let's put aside the melancholy and find out more about the story and gameplay of Thief. Is all that glitters gold in Thief? In the meantime, we'll steal it, and then we'll tell you if it's for real! At what point were we? Avoiding getting caught up in too many spoilers, let's say right away that the plot behind the new Thief revolves around a mysterious magical ritual set up by the figure who holds power in the City, the Baron. Ritual that is tragically interrupted due to the presence of Garrett and a mysterious thief, his companion in adventures, Erin. The latter becomes a victim of the incident and our protagonist, after a year of absence of which he has no memory, decides to get back into business and soon finds himself embroiled in a much bigger conspiracy than him that will put him back on the last traces of the girl disappeared in an attempt to find the causes of a mysterious disease that seems to afflict the poor population of the city. So expect some rather phoned twists, a small horror and supernatural drift and an ending that didn't particularly convince us. And if, as written a little above, for a large part of the game it is possible to leave the original saga aside, there is another comparison that instead has come to mind over and over again, even starting from some small aspects of the plot: the one with Dishonored, the excellent title of Arkane Studios released in 2012. Thief is also played in first person view and the entire gameplay is completely unbalanced towards the objective of not being seen by the enemy while completing the game objectives. Enormous attention is given to the interaction with light and with the ability of the environment to cause sounds. Through the rather minimal on-screen interface, we will always have to keep our exposure to lighting under control: in the shadows we are practically invisible and any enemy cannot see us unless they come particularly close to us. It is also crucial to take into account what is on the floor: different surfaces cause more or less noise, water and broken glass force us to walk even more slowly so as not to be too noisy and we must be careful not to trip over bottles or vases , under penalty of their fall and breakage. On some occasions we will also have to be careful of crows and caged dogs: if we move too quickly in their vicinity, or stay close to them for too long, they will tend to notice us and after a few seconds to bark or croak, attracting the attention of the guards. Of course, it is also possible to run and take a sort of sprint to cover short distances, reducing the risk of being seen even when crossing illuminated areas.while jumping is relegated to the possibility of climbing, overcoming ravines and perhaps passing from one roof to another. There is great physicality in the game and some solutions, such as the ability to lean over any obstacle or wall, actually help to study the environment and keep an eye on the opponents. However, the feeling of deja vu for those who have played Dishonored is always around the corner and especially in Thief there is a big difference which in our opinion is an important limitation. The game is in fact so unbalanced towards stealth as to be rather deficient in its combat system. Our protagonist has at his disposal a small club with which to strike in melee and stun opponents if caught from behind, plus a sort of essential dodge to avoid incoming blows and that's it. All of his paraphernalia is dedicated to the various types of arrows he can shoot with the composite bow that he always carries with him with the addition of a stun bomb, as well as the ability to collect and throw bottles to distract the guards. Thus we find water arrows to put out fires, candles and torches, fire arrows to burn pools of tar, asphyxiants to stun enemies or explosives and also arrows capable of lowering ropes from specific grips in addition to the classic blunt arrow to activate switches or hitting pulleys to make ladders and objects fall. But when we want to do real damage over the distance we only have the classic arrow and the serrated one available. As a consequence of all this, once you get caught by a guard, especially in the advanced stages of the game, you feel more like trying to escape (and the result is only to activate an increasing number of soldiers) or to reload the last save. The combat itself fails to be stimulating and satisfying as it is made up of rather simple lunges alternating with dodges and even if this aspect could bring us back with memories of the past and probably also be appreciated by many readers, in our opinion it makes the experience game incomplete and from a certain point of view even limited. Especially after Dishonored has shown us that it is possible to make excellent stealth without compromise where, however, whoever wants to, is given the opportunity to go ahead with weapons drawn with an equal degree of satisfaction. Even the concentration, the special vision that Garrett can use to be faster and highlight the elements of interaction, the objects to steal and obviously the enemies and that does so much in Hitman: Absolution, can be enhanced practically only in its capacity stealth, with the exception of a single skill that allows you to stun opponents with a well-aimed shot even when in combat. The developer's choice to make concentration, as well as vital energy, non-automatically recharged is bold and intelligent: only by using the supplies and poppies will we be able to restore them during the missions. Speaking of missions Thief is set in the City: a central hub that tries to recreate a similar Victorian London on the screen with clear steampunk and sci-fi connections. Medieval-style alleys and walls alternate with gas lamps and actual electric lighting kept active by large machinery. There are also magical and ritualistic references. In short, there is a bit of everything and the result is a pleasant setting that is decidedly well characterized from an artistic point of view. This area can be freely explored being careful to avoid the patrolling guards with also the possibility of sneaking into numerous houses, provided that the design allows it of course. In this phase it is possible to reach the starting points of the missions that carry on the main plot and interact with a small number of non-player characters to have access to the sale of ammunition, objects and upgrades and also to accept real secondary activities. But there are some limitations. First of all, the central hub is not completely free roam streaming. You have to consider that the City is divided into various districts and every time you switch from one to another there is a loading and above all the status of the soldiers and the burglaries is reset (but not the loot). This means that if we have opened all the safes or drawers in a certain area, when we return we will have to open them again with the risk of finding them empty because they have already been robbed in the past and because obviously it is not possible to remember all the elements with which we interacted. Also the game map rende rather difficult wandering through the streets of the city: the mini one present at the top right is too small, while the large one which can be accessed from an internal menu (you have to press two different keys each time) is decidedly unclear because it shows only the NPCs of the district you are currently visiting and does not clearly indicate the transition points from one zone to another in the hub. And since often there isn't a normal ~door~ or a simple way to go to move between areas of the city but perhaps you have to go through a certain window or sneak into an almost invisible alley, it will not infrequently happen to lose more than a few minutes to find the correct passage to reach our destination. Among other things, the map cannot be moved manually between the various floors of a building. Returning to the actual missions, we will meet eight of them as regards the main plot and about thirty secondary ones. Among the latter we find the works given by Basso which can be carried out simply by walking around the city since it is a question of collecting loot in the interiors that can be visited during the free roaming section. Then there are the assignments offered by other citizens where we will have to reach the starting point of the mission which will be ~instantiated~ in a real separate level (like the eight chapters of the main plot). For information, we point out that the game can probably be completed in six to eight hours if you decide to go straight and forward only with the main chapters (but that would be really criminal) while wanting to complete every single mission perhaps investing some time in the collection of the collectibles, it is probably possible to exceed even twenty hours. In our case we got away with just under fifteen hours, completing twenty jobs, four commissions and collecting about half of the objects. Although Thief is an exclusively single player title, its replayability is quite high. First of all because all the main missions and commissions offer a summary screen where it is possible to see what has been left out, how the level has been tackled (depending on the aggressiveness, three different types of completion are unlocked between predator, ghost and opportunist) and what special activities have been completed (such as the possibility of not stunning anyone, avoiding being seen by someone or perhaps extinguishing most of the fires present and so on). Secondly, the game also allows you to customize the entire game by choosing not only the level of difficulty but also a whole series of modifiers that increase the value of the loot collected. We go from the impossibility of using concentration, to instant game over if the guards or animals are activated, to the lack of special arrows or food up to the absence of the shot and so on. And yet there are three different challenges, which can be faced in three dedicated levels where the player is given the objective of achieving the highest possible score by respecting certain rules and objectives in order to then be able to compare it with other players. Going back to the topic of loot for a moment, in Thief it will be possible to collect an enormous number of objects (yes, as in Dishonored) by rummaging in drawers, wardrobes, chests and so on and all this harvest is transformed into hard cash. This can be spent to buy ammunition, but also upgrades for the bow, mace, armor and special tools that give access to further wealth such as razor, pliers or wrench, or to buy special items that give access to passive bonuses such as being able to carry more food and poppies or having better discounts in shops. Even concentration points can be purchased from a specific NPC by paying in hard cash. Between substance and appearance It is essential to spend a few more words on the management of the levels and on the consequent freedom offered to the player. Also in this case, unfortunately, the comparison with Dishonored is inevitable. On the one hand, Thief offers an abundant number of approaches to the scenario allowing, just to cite one example, to enter a villa using a secret passage in the garden which gives access to the cellars of the structure, or using some suitably hidden stairs to enter from a second floor window. And then there is of course always the possibility of entering through the front door. From this point of view, the work done by the developer is certainly worthy of mention even if there are numerous situations in which the linearity in the design is much more evident. At the same time, however, there is an absence Fr", "date": "2014-02-24", "grade": "8.3"}
