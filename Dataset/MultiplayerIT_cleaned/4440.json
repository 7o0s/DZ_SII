One of those where if something can go wrong it will definitely go worse? The protagonist of Subnautica knows something about it, since he is the only survivor of the crash of the spaceship he was working on. Of course, his colleagues are all dead and are probably considered more unfortunate than him, but even finding himself alone on a planet completely covered by water, in the company of a half-destroyed rescue pod, is not exactly an ideal situation. Fortunately, the vehicle still has some functioning tools, so the only thing to do is try to exploit the resources offered by the ocean to try to survive and, perhaps, escape from the planet. It will not be easy. As the game progresses, fantastic creatures are discovered Subnautica has spent more than a few years in Early Access. Unknown Worlds announced it back in 2013, just a year after the launch of the final version of the beautiful and unfortunate Natural Selection 2, and released it in 2015. The goal was clear: to follow up on the success of the survival genre, but with a title original that proposed a new and, in many ways, innovative challenge. At the launch Subnautica achieved good success. Not on the level of Ark: Survival Evolved or Rust, but still managed to sell more than a million copies. Unlike what happened with other projects, including the two just mentioned, Subnautica has never derailed and, although many features have been added over the years, the final version appears faithful to the original vision. In short, the comments of the players were listened to, but fortunately the crowd anxiety seen elsewhere was avoided. Still waters Like any self-respecting survival, Subnautica does not take the player by the hand. Sure, he gives some rudiments, but it's up to us to find out how to get by. The first thing to do is get out of the pod and dive. We immediately realize that we have ended up on a kind of shoal: the sea area around the pod is populated by generally friendly and, above all, edible fish. There are also collectible materials that will allow us to build the original equipment, using a device placed inside the pod. To find out how to exploit minerals, flora and fauna we just have to collect it: every time we take something, in fact, the system analyzes it and adds recipes to our inventory, telling us which raw materials are needed to make them. In the initial stages you can already notice a big difference compared to many other survival games: the exploration, with the relative collection of raw materials, is exciting. The average survival usually has very long sections where you do nothing but dig or cut trees for hours and hours (sometimes it feels like you're in the office), then you build a shack that gets bigger and bigger to get you don't knows what. In Subnautica the collection of resources is much faster: you have to dive and go in search of small rocks or fish, sounding the seabed (when you have the right tool) and slipping into the many natural cavities present. There aren't many factors to take into consideration during exploration: health, hunger, thirst and oxygen reserve. It should be noted that, although they must obviously be considered, primary needs never oppress the player. As you explore, you discover wonderful places After all, there is plenty of fish and creating water and food reserves is not very complicated. Oxygen is a bit more of a problem, but that soon resolves itself as well. The focus of the entire experience is another: the vast sea that surrounds us is less chaotic than it seems. It should be noted that if desired, it is possible to completely eliminate the survival part, playing in creative mode, so as to explore freely and build without limits. The structure of the sea Subnautica has a well-defined game structure, even if masked by the waves, made up of concentric circles: the player starts from the center and, as he discovers new materials, consequently obtaining advanced tools, he can widen his range, reaching places that were previously closed to him for various reasons (enemies too strong, water too deep, radiation and more). For example, at first we had a limited air supply for diving, but we soon managed to build tanks that allow us to stay longer on the seabed. Instead, with a torch we can explore the darkest cavities, with a knife we can collect uncatchable materials with bare hands, while with an anti-radiation suit we can get close to the carcass of our old ship. Are you sure there's only sea? Piousslowly we repair the pod and build a real base, inside which we can park vehicles with which to set off to explore the most remote areas of the planet. Depth scanners allow us to discover accesses that are not visible to the naked eye, inside which we find new materials that unlock other technologies. Above all, exploring we find spectacular places, perhaps full of lava or iridescent mushrooms. There is no shortage of dangers, but they are part of the game. The use of a fixed map, therefore not procedurally generated, has allowed the developers to work on the scenography in order to alternate moments of research for materials with others in which one simply finds oneself open-mouthed admiring one of the many beauties hidden under the sea. In reality Subnautica also tells a story, which pushes towards certain places: between communications and radio messages, we will soon discover the truth about the crash of our spaceship and what is really happening on the planet. We won't tell you anything else so as not to spoil the surprise. Let's just add, for those wondering, that during the adventure there are also some fixed narrative moments that form the glue for the action. Nothing too invasive, fortunately. Deeply The beauty of Subnautica is that, after the initial disorientation that makes the mental state of someone who finds himself in an extreme condition with very few resources well, we begin to follow the thread of the gameplay that makes us grow naturally together with the game. Some discoveries are better lived than told Having solved the subsistence problems, one enjoys every discovery as if it were a great achievement, finding oneself facing previously unthinkable problems. For those wondering, in Subnautica you can also fight. Doing so isn't the core of the experience, but it's sometimes necessary, as the ocean is also populated by extremely aggressive creatures. Fortunately, when you die, you are not forced to start over from scratch (just a few resources are lost), unless you have selected the hardcore mode, but there is no doubt that some beasts must be removed if you want to explore in peace. Don't worry because weapons (a knife, torpedoes, rifles of various types and others) are considered tools like others that don't obsess the gameplay. One hardly dives to fight, therefore, but when necessary one must be ready to do so. As you may have understood by reading up to here, Subnautica is also very good from a technical point of view: the ocean is full of details, the water simulation is wonderful and there is so much variety of life forms to admire. Vehicles allow you to explore the deepest and most distant areas The style isn't particularly marked, but that doesn't matter in this context. Of particular defects it is difficult to find: someone will certainly miss some multiplayer mode, even if in our opinion it would have violated the gameplay, killing its charm. Others will complain about the fixed map, but we've already discussed this too in the course of the article: it's the only way to have such well-designed environments that make sense of exploration. In short, overall Subnautica is one of the best survival single player on the square, which takes the best of the genre by discarding what doesn't work.
