{"name": "Chi ha paura del bug cattivo?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/70811-risen-chi-ha-paura-del-bug-cattivo.html", "text": "Tested version: PC Fans of Western role-playing games will surely be familiar with the name of Piranha Bytes, Risen's development team once working on the Gothic series, certainly one of the most popular in the videogame industry within the subgenre, but equally controversial due to an increasingly impressive series of bugs that have afflicted the various chapters, repeatedly unleashing the ire of the players to the point of pushing the developers to solemnly commit themselves by promising that all this would never happen again in the future. Also from this point of view, the separation from the Gothic brand probably matured for our Piranha Bytes, passed on to other shores while the staff declared themselves ready to devote themselves to a new adventure, not surprisingly perhaps called Risen, as if to mark a resurrection and a departure from the controversies and unpleasant episodes experienced in the past. Arise from scratch To mark the change from the past, Piranha Bytes has decided to go big, completely rewriting the Risen game engine and obtaining a result that we can without a doubt define as satisfactory, given that the liver transplant bugs seen in the past they seem to be just a memory and the gaming experience finally reaches the levels that such a production deserves. Having made the due premise on what many probably feared, let's move on to see what this title actually talks about, starting as tradition dictates from the plot: we find ourselves on the beach of a mysterious island, miraculously escaped a shipwreck where in the in the role of the protagonist we traveled as illegal immigrants. After a brief initial phase in which the minimum component of the controls is explained to the right player to start moving on his own legs, we find ourselves immersed in the events of the island of Faranga, divided between the three factions that inhabit it, each of which taken in one way or another with the mysterious ruins of temples that appeared out of nowhere, from which strange creatures emerge that seriously endanger the survival of people: in this scenario we will be able to choose to join the outlaws of the swamp led by the Don, at the Order of fighters already present on the island or to the Inquisition, which arrived just to investigate what is happening. There is also the possibility of deciding, at least initially, to think about ourselves, working exclusively for our own benefit and helping everyone a bit to accumulate experience and money, to then arrive at a certain point necessarily having to make a decision by siding with someone to go forward with the story. Neverland The territory that we will find ourselves exploring had been presented several times by the developers through special videos in the past months, from which we had the opportunity to appreciate the quality of the setting studied which makes our adventure on the island a real journey between situations of all types and creatures of all species, moved by an engine that makes fluidity its main weapon. On balance, therefore, those who were afraid of having little possibility of exploration due to the confined territory were abundantly denied, not to mention the possible possibility of replaying the story by joining one faction rather than another, thus making the hours of play necessary to fully complete Risen decidedly high: the player then decides whether to dissect everything down to the smallest detail or devote himself only to the main thread of the story, however able to give a quantity of commitment capable of fully justifying the purchase. The protagonist's relationship with the inhabitants of the island actually involves not only the choice of faction with which to side, but also the system of interpersonal relationships implemented by the developers, designed to give the player practically complete freedom towards the islanders of the various areas . In the city, for example, it is possible at any time to draw a sword and attack even the most helpless civilians, obviously risking that the guards rush to their defense or that they do it alone; the same goes for the possibility of going to steal from homes. The choices that are made in this sense also have repercussions on the relationships we have with the various characters: in the event of an argument, for example in the rest of the story, the NPCs will react differently to our attempts to have a chat, sometimes completely refusing to talk to us making it necessary to use the Joke spell, with which our enemies will become friends again in no time. The video review Little onesheroes grow up From the moment we find ourselves lying on the beach without a weapon until the end of the game, in the role of the protagonist we will obviously have to face a growth linked to the type of skill to learn and the road to take in terms of class, also linked to the choice of faction we will carry out. For example, if we decide to join the Inquisition we will be initiated into the wonderful arts of magic, mastering a series of spells including levitation, to be used in some cases as a way to complete missions and solve puzzles, present within the mechanics of game of Risen in a way superior to what is expected from a normal RPG. However, those who choose to wield the sword do not despair because the spells are also available in the form of scrolls, even if obviously it is not possible to match their power. The possibility of learning new things to grow the character is offered by the masters we meet during our journey, each of whom is able to train us on personal characteristics such as strength, teach us combat to refine our techniques and finally learn some professions such as the alchemist and the blacksmith: nothing that those who are accustomed to the genre do not already know. It is also possible to be taught slightly more illegal skills such as lock picking and pickpocketing. Whether one arrives there voluntarily or with a clumsy act of theft, the phases of struggle are not simple even at the easiest level and require commitment and planning in order not to leave one's side uncovered to the opponent on duty, alternating the various phases properly without madly press the left mouse button: the game is not a hack n'slash, in short, and it shows. Bugs? No thank you! From a technical point of view, Risen looks like a real jewel, as was also understood at the beginning of this review. Piranha Bytes fully manages to forgive the mistakes of the past by offering a graphics engine in step with the times, powerful but scalable at the same time (also considering the low system requirements), able to give the player a glance in the different island scenery that goes a long way in enticing him to wander far and wide, complete with A-list lighting effects and water that makes you want to dive in, all beautifully without a load. A further intensive test carried out on a notebook with over three years of life behind it, equipped with Core Duo T2050, 1 GB of RAM and Mobility Radeon X1600, testifies to what has just been written. The sound sees a rather normal dubbing and a soundtrack that does its duty without however particularly exalting, while the subtitles in Italian are still present, sometimes a little illegible given the choice to put them in faded yellow on a black background. The control system is quite solid and does not show any deficits even in the most difficult combat phases: the only ones we have encountered are the management of the movements of the character with the inventory and map open, for which something better could have been studied since even turning left and right becomes a little difficult.", "date": "2009-09-28", "grade": "8.7"}
