{"name": "The rhythm of the night", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/103955-pixeljunk-4am-the-rhythm-of-the-night.html", "text": "Imagine you are in a renowned club: a DJ plays trance and house music, the beat closes and opens according to the filters that are applied from time to time, the beams of light cut the dark and in the middle there is the people dancing, enraptured by the sounds and the atmosphere. It's four o'clock in the morning and it almost feels like we're living in an alternate reality, which proceeds in slow motion. It is from this starting point that PixelJunk 4am moves, not a game but a multimedia experience, which the developers of Q-Games wanted to bring to the PlayStation Network with a view to a series, PixelJunk, which has never feared experimentation , despite having so far applied it to traditional videogames such as shoot'em-up. 4am therefore stands as the proverbial rib, an extension that arises from the desire to further focus on the contribution of Baiyon, the composer who has lent his art to the service of the franchise and who in this case is the real protagonist of the action. The ~catalogue~ that is made available to us is in fact made up solely of songs created by the Japanese artist, on which we can ~work~ a bit as if we were painting music, thanks to the particular approach to the controls designed exclusively for the PlayStation Move. When calibrating the controller, we are in fact asked to delimit the edges of a ~virtual canvas~ on which we will then find ourselves operating by moving the device. Without looking Without any graphical interface and relying only on the tutorials that will appear on the screen at regular intervals, based on the accumulation of experience and playing time, our objective will therefore be to manage four tracks, each assigned to one of the main buttons of the controller, as well as a different color of the ~ball~: the Square button, associated with the pink color, manages the lower part of the piece, in this case the bass drum; the X button, associated with the blue color, manages the drums, in this case the snare and the charleston; the Triangle button, associated with the green color, manages the synth; finally, the Circle button, associated with the color red, acts on a series of complementary sounds, something similar to what could be the melody of the piece. It is possible to isolate the individual tracks by holding down the relative key, so as to create small variations on the theme that create so much ~atmosphere~, as well as apply effects such as reverb and a high-pass type EQ filter, respectively by moving the Move in depth or turning it as if it were the knob of a mixer. However, the most imaginative solutions derive from the concept of ~canvas~ which we mentioned previously. The edges of this workspace are not visible, clearly, but are signaled to us by the controller via a vibration. Well, we can enrich the four tracks with extra loops by ~fishing~ them at the edge of the canvas, holding down the T trigger and releasing it when we return to the center of this virtual area. The new sounds will be added to the currently active track, either sharply or faded according to the speed with which we release the trigger. Finally, by shaking the Move in the cardinal directions we will be able to exploit further effects to enhance a portion of the piece. Potential of experience It is clear that PixelJunk 4am was born with the aim of providing everyone with the opportunity to express themselves through Baiyon's electronic music. To ~play~ with the four tracks, their sounds and the various effects there is no need to know how to play a musical instrument, much less to know the dynamics of multitrack recording, even if these concepts and the related mechanisms emerge they end up being assimilated, one way or another. Which can only be a good thing: maybe someone will decide they want to devote themselves to music production and will therefore invest some money and time to purchase any audio interface, some sound packs and a good book explaining the basics of mixing. With distribution channels such as YouTube, Facebook and iTunes, the latter on the commercial front, the possibilities of making oneself known among enthusiasts are varied and this must certainly be taken into consideration. But let's go back to the Q-Games product, because it too offers the possibility of performing in front of an audience of lovers of the electronic genre, specifically the other users who have purchased the software and who can watch our performances after we have ~advertised~ them ~, expressing their appreciation by simply shaking the Move controller (which will cause a ~noise~ to appear at the bottom of the screen notifying us that someone has ~clapped~). Once you get used to the mechanics of this originalproduction, you will find yourself ~playing~ in front of even large groups of people, who will be able to draw inspiration from our performance to include in their work. The inevitable limits Conceiving an instrument like PixelJunk 4am, i.e. a low-cost ~casual~ music software, implies having a clear understanding of what the limits of the experience may be. The first, very obvious, lies in the fact that the production signed by Baiyon is aimed solely at lovers of the electronic genre: if you don't like this type of music, you will hardly be able to appreciate the possibilities offered by the title. Secondly, the originality of the approach to editing, determined by the movements of the controller on a virtual canvas, a bit as if one were ~painting~ one's own song, implies the renunciation of a graphical interface which, above all in first moments, could have made the various operations more accessible. Furthermore, remaining anchored to an overall ~casual~ solution significantly reduces the variety of tools available, a factor that will become clear to you as soon as you have the opportunity to try your hand at any music software for PC or Mac, even something simplistic like Fruity Loops. In short, we must recognize the extraordinary value of PixelJunk 4am in terms of innovation and originality: the Q-Games product shows us a possible future scenario for gestural-based music production, allowing anyone to improvise DJ and therefore to manage and modify a series of songs, moreover with the possibility of performing in front of an audience of enthusiasts. However, some perplexities remain about the complete renunciation of a visual interface, as well as the relatively limited variety of tools available. That said, the purchase is highly recommended for anyone who likes the trance / house genre, as well as anyone who wants to experience something new with their Move.", "date": "2012-06-26", "grade": null}
