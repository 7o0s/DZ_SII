{"name": "Bass Pro Shops: The Strike - Championship Edition", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/bass-pro-shops-the-strike-championship-edition-recensione.html", "text": "Fishing games, as well as highly specialized simulations, live in a sort of limbo, a separate dimension where they find meaning by dedicating themselves to a group of enthusiasts even beyond their actual merits as real video games. Unlike other types of simulations, fishing games also count on a rather solid tradition, since for better or worse they have always existed, even if remaining tied to that marginal level of titles intended for a small niche of users, with rare exceptions. For this reason, the evaluation of a title of this type must take into account this dual perspective: the video game as such and therefore seen from the eyes of the common user and the specific simulation, which can only be appreciated by the enthusiast of the discipline in question . The difference here is that fishing is undoubtedly more widespread than other categories of hobbies and professions that can be simulated in video games, therefore the potential audience widens as the required quality standard rises, also given the presence of competitors that are not exactly numerous but however well recognizable on the market. The latter aspect is true on a general level, since on Nintendo Switch, in particular, we do not currently see alternatives to Bass Pro Shops: The Strike - Championship Edition and this is also a factor that certainly plays in its favor, regardless of the evaluation what can we give in this review. It is an evolved and expanded version of the almost homonymous Bass Pro Shops: The Strike released about ten years ago on last generation consoles and the problem is that the progress made, at least on the technical side, does not seem exactly satisfactory. We agree that the outward appearance is not everything, especially in a simulation of this type, but a minimum of additional effort almost ten years later and with a new generation of consoles in the midst of it would be legitimate. Fishing in the lakes of North America The aim of the game is obviously to fish, with the evaluation of the work based above all on the quantity of fish caught and in particular on their size. Based on these elements, from lake to lake, we increase our reputation until we gain access to the various championships that take place around the game settings: in Career mode, the main one, the lakes are unlocked progressively through the usual scheme that provides for a first phase of free fishing, in which we find ourselves exploring the environment, discovering the best points and catching a certain amount of fish in order to attract attention and be invited to tournaments, which represent the second phase and live action. The latter take place on the basis of the same principles but provide for a rather limited time limit in which to demonstrate our abilities and the presence of other competitors who, at the same time, are committed to the same intention, with the possibility of seeing the progress of the challenge. Beyond the change of setting given by the different lakes, the mechanics of the game remain substantially the same, also considering that the local multiplayer is linked exclusively to challenges separate from the standard mechanics in rather simple mini-games. As you progress through the game, you earn prizes and money that you can invest in expanding your arsenal of rods, lures, lines, reels and even boats. It is obvious that, regardless of the game mode, the core of the action is always and in any case fishing, especially in fresh water, between lakes and settings contiguous to these. The circle is therefore limited to the fish species of this fishing discipline in North America, i.e. the various types of bass (the true religion of freshwater fishing) plus the other species that coexist in the same ecosystem such as catfish, carp and similar. The genuine enthusiast will find himself quite at ease within the huge amount of customization elements included in Bass Pro Shops: The Strike - Championship Edition, with the experimentation of lines, rods, lures and combinations between them representing an important part of the gameplay itself of the game, which could terrify, we realize, the layman of fishing. A rod made of magic Although the non-fisherman may feel disoriented at first, after a few sessions the main mechanics of fishing in Bass Pro Shops: The Strike - Championship Edition are understood. First of all it is necessary to find the right place with the boat, then it is a question of launching and trying different baits also based on the species of fish that we can glimpse under the surface of the water. The dynamics of the recovery and the differencesThe behaviors of artificial lures are rather convincing, forcing different approaches and rhythms in order to be effective and attract the preys. Catching is above all a matter of timing and sensitivity in dosing recovery, drag and line so as not to risk breaking the latter and letting the fish slip away. The different behaviors of the various species are reproduced in a rather realistic way, even if the not enormous quantity of these does not help to vary the gaming experience much. Furthermore, the moment of catching is a bit too simplified, simply requiring you to retrieve with the right timing to avoid breaking the line but without introducing particular skills in directing the rod or managing the drag, with everything that is resolved in the make frequent and short touches on the reel until the fish runs out of energy. On the technical sector we have already expressed more than one doubt, considering how little has evolved from the previous version released almost ten years ago and on last generation platforms. From this point of view, although it is a game that by its very typology does not really focus on graphic spectacularization, much more could have been done. All in all, the realization of the underwater setting is better, even if it is still decidedly bare compared to the possible natural wealth that could have been seen on the screen. The retail version of Bass Pro Shops: The Strike - Championship Edition is sold with an accessory that simulates a fishing rod by placing the Joy-Con inside, which recalls certain rather sad moments of the Wii generation. It is a nice solution that probably improves the use of commands with motion sensors, we say it on trust since this review is based exclusively on the digital version without this addition. However, after a few hours of play it is advisable to simply set the traditional commands given the amount of throws and recoveries that we find ourselves carrying out in the sessions, which make the continuous repetition of the gestures quite tedious.", "date": "2018-12-20", "grade": "6.5"}
