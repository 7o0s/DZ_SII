Over the years Skylanders has been able to reinvent itself several times, growing in size, mixing the various characters, allowing you to take on the role of villains and finally introducing vehicles, but without ever affecting the nature of the game which has always remained fundamentally the same, even in mobile version. Activision has therefore decided that the time has come to offer something totally different and tries it with Skylanders Battlecast, a card game that, following the tradition of the brand, mixes real and virtual. The original game could boast beautiful figurines and very solid gameplay, will Activision be able to break through in such a particular sector as that of card games? Skylanders Battlecast combines video game characters with a mobile card game: mission accomplished? Hell, it's missing! Skylanders Battlecast is a card game in which we will be able to control three characters who will have to fight against as many opponents, choosing between a single player story mode, which will take us through 60 missions or against a real opponent, be it our friend or a chosen challenger randomly on the Net. The heart of the game is 300 cards, divided between characters, spells and objects. If desired, we can build our own deck or get one assigned by the game based on the cards in our possession. The spirit of Skylanders has always been to transport physical objects within a virtual world and even if the game is only for tablets and smartphones this philosophy does not fail, the cards can in fact be purchased or in the virtual shop, spending the currency obtained with our victories, both by collecting real cards, obtained by opening expansion packs. The latter are sold in packs of 8 or 22 cards, with prices ranging from 4.99 to 9.99 euros. Inserting a real card into our virtual deck is very simple: thanks to augmented reality, just frame the card with the device's camera to see it magically transformed into a completely three-dimensional character or game object, which we can admire from every angle. Each card is strictly linked to your account, so it will not be possible to unlock the same card for multiple decks. For those who like to ~unwrap~ their packages live, Activision has also provided a special case to show their cards on video, avoiding that someone can scan them. It should be noted that the intent of the developers is to bring players to the mobile game and not to provide a card game usable in its own right. The mechanics of the Battlecast, while very simple, are complex enough to reproduce without the app. Obviously doing it is not impossible, but don't expect an immediate game where the only thing to keep in mind is your life total. While we understand Activision's choice, we admit that we would have also liked to play with real cards and not just collect them in the four rarity levels. And in case of duplicates? Duplicates can be used to level up the card, up to 10, while the next 10 levels can only be unlocked by playing the game. Tag Teams As for the actual gameplay, it's all about balancing your trio. The Skylanders are in fact assimilated more or less into three categories: those with many life points but little damage, the middle ground and the ~damage dealers~. It will be up to us to decide whether to create a balanced team, a weak group but capable of doing a lot of damage or to focus everything on damage absorption. Each character can also count on specific skills of their element. We will have the one capable of doing healing or area damage, the one capable of stunning enemies, weakening their attacks and so on. Once the fight has begun, our Skylanders will be positioned in a triangle, two behind and one in front, which will then be the only one to attack and in most cases to suffer damage. Positions can only be changed at the start or end of the round. We will therefore be able to decide whether to attack with the first, play a card with him and then place a partner with more life points or immediately change position and then attack, but also attack with the first, play a card with the second and so on. The key to the game is to leave a Skylander in the front lines capable of dealing with the counterattack. Since the more defensive characters tend to hurt less and vice versa, it will be important to continuously alternate our heroes, to avoid that the more aggressive ones die soon or that the damage of the tanks iseasily counterbalanced by treatment. The various spells take care of messing up this strategy, which allow you to attack all opponents in an area and put the weakest in the front row, or perhaps heal a character and send him directly to the rear, or to unite the attack force of the three Skylanders and unleash a shot capable of killing most enemies on the spot, and so on. To play the cards we will need to have the necessary number of mana points, which will gradually increase by one, with some notable exceptions. The number of mana crystals does not increase automatically, but is decided randomly. Sometimes it will increase by one, maybe two, but it could also sit still for two or three turns, preventing us from playing the most powerful cards. This random component is perhaps the least appreciated by anyone trying to develop a strategy in some way, creating a balanced deck, because even the most powerful collection of cards in the world is useless if the mana remains zero. Fortunately, it doesn't happen often, but since the cards already appear randomly, having to rely on an uncertain mana source could annoy more experienced players.", "date": "2016-05-24", "grade": "8.0"}
