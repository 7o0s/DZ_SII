{"name": "FIFA 08 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fifa-08-recensione_a.html", "text": "It has been clear for a very long time that Electronic Arts-branded football has become an institution, what's new is the alignment of the release with Pro Evolution Soccer, which every year brings the two competing products to battle each other with blows copies sold, for the conquest of the palm of best football simulation. The clash will also be fought on the Nintendo DS, of course, and FIFA 08 kicks off. The most beautiful game in the world The new edition of FIFA on Nintendo DS boasts the same game modes present in the versions for other consoles, so it is possible to play a quick game, participate in tournaments of all kinds (between club or national teams: world cup, European championship , Italian cup, etc. etc.), try your hand at the manager mode and with the now famous ~scenarios~, as well as challenge an opponent via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. The starting setting asks us to immediately select a favorite team, which will characterize our personal profile together with the various settings (which include the use of a key configuration identical to that used in Pro Evolution Soccer, for those used to to the Konami series). The innovations introduced are not many, in truth: there is the coach mode which guarantees long-lasting entertainment, and the scenarios must be created from scratch (by choosing the teams that face each other as well as the starting conditions) with the possibility of putting them available to all game owners via NWFC. Speaking of online, the challenges organized in this mode work quite well and without lag problems, however limited to offering the usual options (quick match, custom, etc.). Throw-in from the bottom Curiosity is a lot when you start the first game with FIFA 08, but the feedback from the point of view of the gameplay immediately proves to be above expectations. There isn't a great tradition of football games for Nintendo DS, probably because this console hasn't yet managed to express itself at its best in this type of context, despite boasting discrete technical possibilities. The control of the players via d-pad is quite precise, as well as the direct passes and those smarcanti. High ball operations are much better with FIFA than with PES, that's for sure, but if the latter suffers from poor realism due to the presence of numerous short passes, the same can be said of the EA title when it comes to make through balls: very often the players receiving the ball have to change their running trajectory to recover it, thus distorting our offensive intentions. The teams always maintain an attack-oriented approach, so much so that they end up systematically discovering each other, leaving only the central defenders to counter the advances of the opposing centre-forwards. As far as the goalkeepers are concerned, they prove to be good but certainly not as unbeatable as those of PES: they are capable of blocking shots from the edge of the penalty area, even when they are rather angled, but they cannot do anything when the shot is from before after a quick pass. Our strikers hit the target most of the time, which is perhaps not very realistic but it certainly adds to the show. Pack your bags, let's go to Berlin! How does FIFA 08 take advantage of the unique features of the Nintendo DS? Well, firstly the game action is displayed on the top screen and player control is fully deputed to the d-pad, A, B, X and Y buttons as well as the back buttons. The touch screen shows us a large ~radar~ (much more practical than the tiny one present in PES6) to check the position of the players on the field, and also has some buttons that we can press to change the strategy on the fly in attack and defense. We will also use the touch screen in other situations, i.e. when it will be necessary to modify the formation, possibly moving the positions with the stylus, when we want to review the scoring actions but also and above all during free kicks and penalties, with a very intuitive system and accurate. From the point of view of the peculiarities of the console, therefore, FIFA 08 does its duty and does it well. But what about the rest? Let's say right away that the graphics are not the strong point of this production, which shows off rather sparse polygonal models, equipped with a decent number of animations but absolutely not faithful in appearance to real players. Probably the best thing is the fluidity with which everything moves, which does not reach 30 fps but which at least does not expire in annoying slowdowns. Of course, with such a low polygon count it was unlikely that the engine could not even move them effectively. Volenmaking yet another comparison with PES6, we can say that the Konami title has better graphics, even if the difference is far from abysmal and we sincerely hope that new standards will be reached for PES2008. Nothing to say as regards the sound, however, which amazes right away: FIFA 08 on DS boasts a real signed soundtrack, as in the EA Sports tradition, and the songs sound dignified despite the reduced bitrate. The effects are also excellent, as well as the commentary (in English only). Comment It is clear that if we love the spectacular action of football games above all, taking FIFA 08 in the Nintendo DS version is not the best idea one could have. The game is quite substantial, has good use of the touch screen and boasts good gameplay, as well as having a lot of real teams and players, updated to the latest season (and further upgradable via the internet). But the graphics are hopelessly mediocre, it is functional to the action and nothing more, where there are developers on the Nintendo laptop who have achieved far superior results even if in different areas. Ultimately, consider buying FIFA 08 if you want a fun and substantial football game, own only the DS and pay little attention to the graphics... Pros: Good gameplay Lots of modes, even online Great sound Cons: Mediocre graphics Some small bugs in player control... ...which, apparently, don't get tired", "date": "2007-10-19", "grade": null}
