Devil Survivor in particular is the declination that the Atlus guys have created for the Nintendo DS, combining the classic themes of the saga and its demanding battle system with a strategic gameplay that is best suited to a portable console and which takes several cues from a classic made in Kyoto such as Fire Emblem. On Nintendo DS we find two episodes, and by virtue of their goodness and the fact that, in particular the second one, they came out a little late in the life span of the machine, what's better than a good couple of remakes on the heir to the dual screen laptop? Record Breaker, remake of Devil Survivor 2, can therefore be defined as a commercial operation, but be careful: if new material and painstaking care are added to an already superlative base, even a commercial operation can be a godsend for the gaming public . Remake of an unjustly neglected title on the old Nintendo DS, Devil Survivor 2 is back! A week like a demon The opening setting is very classic for many Japanese stories, a high school full of teenagers struggling with exams, insurmountable problems that they will laugh at once adults and mysterious websites that predict, complete with videos, the death of their friends. Once you have chosen the name of the protagonist, the first thing you come to know from his old friend Daichi is precisely the existence of Nicaea, a website that seems to be popular among peers. Thanks to modern smartphone technology, you too can register immediately, choose the gender of the avatar that will accompany you in its discovery, learn that just the other night one of the predicted deaths occurred exactly as it was described in the related video seen by all your classmates, and for the moment the story, although a little disturbing, seems to end there. Returning home with Daichi, you also meet and talk to Io, a beautiful, shy and intelligent girl on whom the whole school seems to have a crush. So how to improve a day like this? Simple, with a nice video that predicts your death under a derailed train, a huge earthquake that devastates all of Tokyo and a fight with monstrous demons who have come out of who knows where, but who, once defeated, come to your service, with cell phones that, destroyed the normal operators, they seem to be connected only to the mysterious Nicaea which gradually provides you with information and apps. The story that starts from here sees you involved in saving Japan and the whole world from the invasion of demons, with only one week available that will take you from city to city and battle to battle to discover the origin of the mystery. Demon trainer Over the seven days you will send the clock forward by half an hour by choosing one of the various events that are proposed to you. We can divide them into two categories, battles and dialogues, the latter useful for deepening the plot, the characters and also the protagonist's relationship with them. In fact, one of the many apps that Nicaea makes available is Fate, which like the Social Links of Persona takes into account the different relationships of the protagonist which, by becoming closer, give access to new features and skills that are very useful in the fight. However, only some of the events proposed are mandatory: many are only available for a limited period and we must be careful, because if we are told to be at a certain time in a certain place and we don't do it, we will face irreversible consequences such as the death of a non-player character or the inability to access entire parts of the story. In a single playthrough it is impossible to see everything there is to see, which favors replayability for all those who will want to revisit a good sixty hours for the sake of completeness. The focus of the whole question, however, are the many demons that we will be able to deploy in battle. The way to get them is an auction in which the one who offers the most wins the prize: already here you will spend several moments because from time to time different and increasingly valuable ~goods~ are offered, but even better is the possibility of merging two different creatures to create a new one, more powerful and which will inherit some of the abilities of the ~parents~. The Fusion app is so fun that it is almost a game in itself, with the advantage of being fundamental for the purposes of the fights: the demons are many, all very well characterized both aesthetically and in terms of characteristics, and for dthe most on Nintendo 3DS always new fusions are available via Spotpass. Discovering them all is a pleasure and even more pleasant is testing them on the battlefield. The 3D effect Scarcely used and even less visible, simply due to the choice of using the upper screen only in some sections of the game, to display game elements such as the various statistics, which are fundamental but which by their very nature do not lend themselves to extreme spectacularization. The Napoleon of the Underworld However, while the demons take on new skills by simply leveling up, not so the human protagonists, who before each battle must choose which demon to steal one from, and if the aforementioned monster is killed by another team, the relative skill is not acquired. Although later on this rule will be possible to derogate in some way, this does nothing but make the already difficult fights, which we are finally going to talk about, even more tactical and demanding. The battlefield is presented to us in the classic form of an isometric grid, on which to check the different teams at each turn, deciding whether to move, attack or use skills. The easy tactic of moving all the teams towards a single goal and hammering the opponent properly is discouraged by the mechanics of the ~skill crack~ described above, by the very conformation of the arenas and by the various characteristics of friends and enemies, but in general battles can be very difficult both because objectives and conditions often change during the race, and because the opposing demons are extremely tough. The real fights are the classic ones of the saga, three against three in turns, and from the beginning you can forget about having an easy life making it necessary to carefully plan the teams, which must be strong and balanced. Beyond being able to choose between two different levels of difficulty during the adventure, one way to overcome this obstacle is the Free Battles, events that can be accessed without affecting time, which give fewer experience points than normal battles but they're useful for leveling up lesser-used demons and acquiring money to spend at auctions. The Free Battles are an almost necessary concept from the point of view of the game, but they leave the side open to the possibility of abusing them by altering the delicate balance set up by the programmers, even more so given the excellent workmanship of the combat system, and the lack of space for it a limitation constitutes one of the very few defects of the product. However, this limit will necessarily be set by the desire to move forward in the beautiful story, a plot that, although it does not shine for originality, is always interesting and well written. Smart makeovers The horror and infernal themes, sometimes even splatter, are accompanied by a heavy catastrophic genre atmosphere, which creates a great sense of anxiety and urgency, but does not prevent much lighter, humorous and even romantic moments, and classic adolescent themes in anime sauce. A great completeness here too, in short, without counting the many mysteries to solve and the numerous characters to explore, with related last-minute twists that keep you glued to the two small screens of the 3DS, also thanks to the excellently written and dubbed dialogues and the drawing style, characterized by the excellent manga line of Suzuhito Yasuda, very modern and intriguing and which gives great personality to demons and humans. Dialogues, partly rewritten and entirely dubbed, and drawings optimized for a higher resolution, are among the protagonists of the remake operation, which instead only partially affected the technical department itself, which simply makes use of greater cleanliness. If this with regard to the beautiful and varied music by Kenji Ito, ranging from rock to electronica to extremely disturbing compositions, is a welcome plus, the same cannot be said for the graphics, a 2D that was excellent on the old Nintendo DS but which here is simply re-proposed a little bit cleaner, just as the upper screen and its stereoscopic capabilities have been very little used, for statistics and little more. However, the fundamental point of this remake is another, much more substantial: a real second part of the adventure, which starts from the end of the events narrated in the first and which is playable from the beginning for those who have already lived the 'original. Shorter than the base, this second part is still around thirty hours while maintaining the same quality in all respects, and given the average length of video games these days alone it would be well worth the ticket price. Ultimately a much greater meaning given to a rhymeke than a simple technical review. However, all this demon stuff is presented, and we are at the big limit of the entire production, only and exclusively in English. Given the complexity of the plot and game system, this cuts out a large portion of local players, and although we cannot speak of a real defect but only relating to a part of gamers, it is a factor that must absolutely be considered in the perspective of a purchase that for the rest can even be considered indispensable for lovers of the genre, and highly recommended for everyone.", "date": "2015-11-10", "grade": "9.0"}
