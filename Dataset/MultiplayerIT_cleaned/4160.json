{"name": "Slime-san: Superslime Edition", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/slime-san-superslime-edition-recensione-202225.html", "text": "Independent developers sometimes limit themselves to copying ideas seen and reviewed and launching video games on the market that perhaps do not even deserve to be considered such. However, to compensate for the situation, there is also the right handful of talented people who work admirably in the company of a few collaborators, and who are often able to conceive and create real miniature masterpieces in just a few months of development. Slime-san: Superslime Edition is just that, a miniature masterpiece. Its creator is Fabraz, a boy from New York who certainly doesn't just work as an independent developer for a living, but we owe him other noteworthy productions too: Planet Diver and Cannon Crasha are among these. Slime-san: Superslime Edition is the high point of his young and promising career, and it has bewitched us for quite a few hours: we tell you why it has nothing to envy to many other more important games arriving in recent months. Soft but gritty: Slime-san's gameplay Slime-san: Superslime Edition is one of those platformers that could capture the player's attention just a few seconds, before hearing him exclaim ~the classic mobile game~; or one of those that you give away with the PlyStation Plus make everyone snort because they don't even deserve a superficial consideration. But appearances are greatly misleading in this case, because Slime-san could easily withstand a competition against Super Meat Boy and Celeste, and come out with absolutely decent results. Fabraz's platform is not only interesting in its ideas, but above all it deserves praise after praise for its inventiveness, depth, solidity, bonus content and also many other factors that are normally difficult to label, but are nevertheless present: the entertainment offered, the charisma of the protagonists , the many quotes hidden everywhere, not least the fact that it was developed by literally one person (with external contributions). But let's get to the narrative premises: little Slime-san is a soft green ball who, in the company of a bird friend, is suddenly swallowed alive by a gigantic snake. From then on, our task is to lead him safely out of the worm's stomach, facing one after the other a whole series of short platform-based levels, collectibles, enemies and environmental obstacles. For the first two or three schemes Slime-san: Superslime Edition looks like a simple and immediate platformer, but you have no idea of the difficulty levels that it will begin to present later in the course of the more than five game worlds made by Fabraz, not to mention of new game plus modes that chase each other one after the other at the end of each completion: you will really have plenty of time to spend in the company of trial and error sessions, before being able to calculate the landing times on a thousandth of a second certain platform, or how to use the bounce granted by a particular enemy to get to the other side of a sea of lava. The little jelly ball is able to jump, perform a short sprint and can also change its density to cross green colored platforms, offering very successful gamelpay ideas. The beauty is that Slime-san: Superslime Edition is set inside the snake's stomach, and despite this there is no level identical to the other or that recycles an idea already seen previously in the same way: inventiveness of the developer leaves on more than one occasion with a sly smile on his face. The artistic style is exquisitely retro: the whole game was made in just 5 colors, but more than a limit, it immediately appears as an essential stylistic choice; and it is the style, together with the charisma of its crazy protagonists, that makes Slime-san: Superslime Edition an instantly recognizable product. Playstation 4 trophies On PlayStation 4 Slime-san: Superslime Edition offers almost the maximum number of trophies available for a single title: 64, including the coveted Platinum Trophy. And to bring it home, you'll have to know Fabraz's work like the back of your hand, completing not only the story mode of the base game version, not only the individual expansions, but also collecting all the collectibles of all levels, winning timed challenges, and even a large number of levels in New Game + Mode. You'll have some for a while, but we're sure you'll have a blast. Lots of content: it's a Superslime Edition! If the over 200 levels of the basic version of Slime-san weren't enough for you, nor the many collectibles scattered everywhere, and finally not even the extras, including alternative slimes withand its own special powers with which to face the adventure in a completely new way, know that the two main expansions of the game are also included in the Slime-san: Superslime Edition. These are Slime-san: Blackbird's Kraken and Slime-san: Sheeple's Sequel. Both packages offer a rich set of additional content: independent storylines, new levels, boss fights, customizations for slime-san, but also game modes never seen before. Let's take Blackbird's Kraken for example: it transports the player in a tropical context (no more apples to pick, but strictly bananas) made up of 25 standard levels, as many for the new game plus, but it also adds new game modes to the title (for example those to be faced aboard a submarine) and new ideas in the gameplay (the bubble platforms). Sheeple's sequel is instead the latest and most recent expansion released by Fabraz, and on balance also the craziest: take a look at the bonus minigames or the boss fight against a robot that is clearly Mega Man, and you'll understand what we mean. Also on this occasion, new game levels have arrived (20 normal and 20 NG+), new styles, new characters, the speedrunner mode complete with online rankings (so everyone is more relaxed on Twitch), new collectibles, new hub worlds with unlockable NPCs and accessories. In short, we understood each other. All of this is obviously an exponential enrichment of the base game adventure, always accompanied by a very particular artistic style and a seemingly simple, but incredibly accurate and fitting soundtrack.", "date": "2018-07-10", "grade": "8.2"}
