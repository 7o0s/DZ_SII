This belief has stayed with us for a long time, until at GDC 2016 we tried an action RPG that changed our perspective. It was obviously Chronos, a title developed by Gunfire Games that seems to want to blend the combat mechanics of Dark Souls with the adventurous spirit of The Legend of Zelda. All inserted in the context of virtual reality, taking advantage of a damn old school third-person view. On paper, crazy. But not without solid foundations. Here is our verdict on Chronos, an RPG that wants to convince us that VR and third person can coexist! Hunting between dimensions The world has fallen into chaos. In a parallel post-apocalyptic reality, it is the power of a dragon that prevents men from living their lives in peace. Yet there is still hope and a hero can embark on a long journey to finally stand against the enemy and restore all to normal. In short, as per the textbook of a good adventure game we have a dragon, a chosen one and a long way to go before arriving at our destination. However, behind this subtle and far from original plot, Chronos hides something more than a simple dragon hunt, which takes place most of the time in typically fantasy realms, made up of giants, princesses and races as strange as they are interesting . There is a hidden background, which the player must actively research within scrolls, books and computer files. Or he can be content simply to go his own way and eliminate all the enemies and oddities that stand in front of him. In this way, however, an important part of the experience would be lost, which is made even more attractive thanks to virtual reality. The need to literally bend over the books to read their contents is in fact one of the most engaging expedients ever used in a role-playing game, which makes you want to leaf through every page even when cursive writing, we admit, clashes with the definition of the viewer (but we believe, and hope, that with the consumer version it will be easier to distinguish the characters). Obviously, a particularly intricate plot is not to be expected but, in the dozen hours necessary to complete the adventure on normal difficulty, the curiosity will never fail to find out what really brought the world to the brink of ruin. The youth that conquers death Chronos reminds us of being a soulslike right from the start, when we slowly discover the movement system and basic attacks. With rather heavy movements, the hero can attack directly with light and heavy blows or decide to rely on the counterattack after parrying or dodging one of the enemy assaults. Soon a magical component is added, which allows you to dominate the power of some elements such as fire or electricity. This ability recharges precisely by parrying and dodging attacks at the right time and, once activated, it can offer a power boost or grant a temporary state of invulnerability, depending on the chosen element. You can also imbue the main weapon with magic for a short time, either manually or, once again, by taking advantage of evasion and parry at the right time. Dominating these mechanics is not easy and those who have played the various Dark Souls know well that, if the enemy's attack patterns are not studied properly, death is always around the corner. Even the guys at Gunfire Games have made this dictat precisely and, regardless of which difficulty level you choose at the start of a new game, throwing yourself head-on against enemies is never a good idea, not even against the weakest ones. But despite a far from close checkpoint system and the many shortcuts to remember, death cannot be feared because it is an important element, even more than in any other exponent of the genre. With an original intuition, Chronos connects it with the passage of time in the game world: we start with our barely legal hero (or heroine) and, after each death, we see him grow and gradually age. However, the signs of aging are not purely aesthetic and, in addition to the thicker beard and graying hair, the growth speed of some statistics also changes. By investing the skill points earned at each level increase, it is therefore also necessary to evaluate the right moment to improve one of the four parameters available: if the statisticsBasic physiques such as strength, agility and vitality are easier to increase in youth, as the character gains experience the tables are reversed and it becomes less expensive to improve arcane powers. Death then serves to balance the level of difficulty during the game, because it allows the monsters already faced to reappear and ~grind~ in case of difficulty. Also every ten years (starting from the twentieth birthday), the hero can choose one of three specific traits of the decade, until the eightieth year of age, when the ~magic~ breaks and the player realizes that, in fact, it is been defeated. Even without a real game over. Old-fashioned VR In addition to the features of the hero, initially armed with a shield and sword (and dressed in green), Chronos also tries to re-propose that call to exploration typical of every The Legend of Zelda. The game areas are thus characterized by various hidden clues and puzzles that must be solved to face a boss on equal terms, to cross a particularly soft floor or to access the next area. An exploration that is made even more interesting thanks to the peculiar point of view of the player, who sees his alter ego through a fixed camera that closely resembles the first Resident Evil. Unlike the Capcom horror, however, this expedient is anything but frustrating and allows you to literally scrutinize every corner in search not only of objects (indeed far from varied), but also of hidden enemies that could surround us or catch us at unawares. In short, despite being a title that on paper would be very playable even on a normal TV, once tried with virtual reality we would hardly be able to go back. Indeed, Chronos offers an immersion different from that of first-person titles, but equally engaging. However, there is a price to pay and, when we see fifty dollars (about 44 euros at current exchange rates) abandoning our accounts, it is difficult not to take factors such as longevity or graphic quality into consideration. In fact, we are used to role-playing games that go well beyond the ten to fourteen hours offered by the Gunfire Games guys, who didn't waste much even on the side missions and customizations front: there are few weapons, few upgrades and very few non-player characters to interact with. Even the glance is not the best and if from a distance we are faced with well-kept and suggestive settings, when the camera takes us a few centimeters from the polygons, even with all the settings at their maximum, it is clear that the highest tribute to new technology is poured precisely by the quality of the textures. There is never a lack of polygonal interpenetration problems and in some circumstances it is a bit alienating to see your character run without putting your feet on the ground. Finally, the audio sector is really good, which if it is accompanied by excellent headphones contributes decisively to the sense of involvement of the experience.", "date": "2016-04-06", "grade": "7.8"}
