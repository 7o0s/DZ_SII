As if the return of the humor of Sam & Max, the appearance of the shrewdness of Diabolik and the meticulous investigation of CSI weren't enough, here is 2008 to begin with a title that proposes yet another reinterpretation of a genre that is experiencing a second life: Agatha Cristie Crime Under the Sun, the third title developed by AWE Company under the license of the famous novels by the English writer. The story kicks off in a very special way: in a London constantly threatened by bombing by the German air force, Poirot finds himself chatting with his friend Harrison, telling him about his investigation and proposing him to take an active part in the story, investigating the basis of the clues that he will reveal to him as he proceeds in the narration. The player will then impersonate Harrison in turn engaged in the part of the detective. Apart from the interesting narrative device with which the story is introduced, Crime Under the Sun presents itself as a fairly canonical point & click graphic adventure, in which a virtual Poirot is guided, by pressing the left mouse button, through a small cross-section of the British coast in which the heinous crime will take place. Interesting for the development of the plot is the idea of placing the crime rather forward in the course of the adventure, first letting the player know, through a vast choice of dialogues, not only the characters involved, but also the legends about the island, the curiosities about the protagonists of what will be the crime and a thousand other small pieces of the mosaic that will finally allow the identification of the culprit. Words are the means to achieve meaning Crime Under the Sun tries to move away from the other graphic adventures, where the puzzles are the key to reaching the solution, giving much more importance to the dialogues. Like any good self-respecting detective, Poirot will be able to ask the suspects many questions, some of which may even seem completely irrelevant to the murder, and write down everything that will be reported to him in his notebook. It will be by reasoning on these words, rather than by solving the few trivial puzzles presented during the adventure, that the investigation can be completed. A good idea that in terms of the game turns into a continuous movement in the different locations in search of witnesses and suspects in an attempt to discover contradictions in their stories and thus increasingly limit the number of possible murderers. As stimulating as it may be, the system becomes repetitive in the long run, and even the most shrewd player could get bored the tenth time he passes through the same place just because he can't find the hotel porter rather than the lifeguard, not to mention the recitation of the dialogues, halfway between a university lesson and a catechism, certainly not capable of attracting attention. A good panorama but a repetitive photography Speaking of the graphic aspect of the title, it is not possible to note that this seems to have lagged far behind the technical evolution of the gaming world. The characters, first and foremost Poirot, suffer from dull and disproportionate three-dimensional models, with extremely rigid and unrealistic animations and an approximate texturing that limits itself to outlining a certain dress or face without trying to give it any characterization or attention to detail. The quality of the environments is better, evocative and illuminated at the right point, as well as equipped with a good search for detail, however they suffer from the discovery of being simple inanimate backdrops, in which the three-dimensional puppets mentioned in the previous lines move. A sketch of movement of the elements in the foreground (blades of grass, bushes) is not enough to make the game environment less flat, on the contrary, seeing a bush bending in the wind in front of the camera and noticing that the leaves of the tree a few meters are still as if they were made of marble, it doesn't help to make the playing area more realistic. The bad cutscenes shot with the game engine can be avoided. Speaking instead of the sound effects, it has already been mentioned that the dubbing (in English with Italian subtitles) could have been better and entrusted to better interpreters, even if it must be admitted that the dialogues themselves do not offer particular cues for a varied acting. and the sporadic Poirot-like ironic jokes (and therefore not funny) are not enough to make the screenplay less heavy. The soundtrack is negative: the background theme that will accompany our investigations is repetitive and excellent as a cure for insomnia, the crescendos that should underline somehe important action or suspense moment during cutscenes. Comment Crime Under the Sun is presented as a graphic adventure dedicated to purists, therefore accustomed to the spartan graphics that characterize the genre and to the basic repetitiveness always around the corner. The plot of the English writer flows through the events by guiding the player, and from a product based on a solid license like that of Agatha Cristie one could not expect less. However, the technical aspect gives the coup de grace to a product that has demonstrated that a good license and a charismatic character are not enough to package a first-class product, relegating Crime Under the Sun to a small circle of enthusiasts.
