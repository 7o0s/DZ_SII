At least this is what Daniel Cook claims on Lostgarden.com, his personal blog in which he expresses thoughts and opinions related to game design and video game development. Author of Realm of the Mad God and highly appreciated game theory apologist, the co-founder of Spry Fox has clearly demonstrated the validity of his words thanks to the recent Triple Town, a curious puzzle game that draws clearly and liberally from the match- 3  la Bejeweled and from that of city builders, however managing to place itself outside of both types of game and, more importantly, being fun and innovative at the same time. To make the tree... It's curious to think that the original project was born as a game for an atypical platform like Kindle, but Triple Town's gestation went through several stages before landing on iOS and Android devices. The main testing ground was undoubtedly the version on Facebook, and it is precisely on the blue social network that Spry Fox's puzzle game took on its current form and perfected those game dynamics at the basis of its perfect alchemy. The rules are simple, yet they work like a well-oiled cog: the aim is to form groups of three identical objects, a mechanic now overused, but which suddenly becomes fresh when these, once aligned, come together in a new more elaborate element. And here three bushes become a tree, three trees a house and three houses a villa: it's not Bejeweled, but something original in which the goal is to build and match elements in order to fill your grid with high-value objects, such as castles and huge churches. Obviously the more you evolve your elements and the more difficult it is to line them up, but at the same time you are rewarded with more points round after round in an attempt to beat your friends' records and constantly improve your score. Then there are a series of objects that add an unexpected strategic depth: crystals, for example, count as jokers and can be used in place of any other element, while robots eliminate any annoying object from the scenario. And finally there are the teddy bears, annoying creatures that the player will soon begin to hate despite their cute design. These move intrusively turn after turn and turn into a small tomb when locked inside a space in which they can no longer move. Three tombs lined up and voil, a brand new church ready to grind other points waiting to be transformed into something else. The level of difficulty gradually increases, on the one hand due to the ever increasing frequency with which the teddy bears appear, on the other hand due to the arrival of their ninja variants, who are able to teleport to any place in the scenario and tend to occupy the places where the object at your disposal could be more useful. To help the player comes the possibility of spending coins to buy any object, and it is precisely in the management of one's own resources that one sees where Spry Fox has drawn from the genre of city management games and mixed it with the match-3 formula, a combination that turned out to be very successful against all expectations. Over time the player learns to think on several levels, for example by aligning the bushes keeping in mind right away where to make the trees appear later, perhaps keeping closer to the houses already arranged previously and at the same time trying not to create blind spots. This is because in Triple Town the real challenge lies in managing the spaces at one's disposal, and as the small scenario fills up it becomes increasingly difficult to be able to plan one's moves, to the point that one wrong decision can jeopardize the entire outcome of the game. match. Everything is effectively presented through colorful graphics, few sounds and a simple style, although menus and assets end up stretching badly when playing with the device in landscape on the iPhone and iPod Touch. The fact that Triple Town for iOS and Android takes over the same business model from the Facebook version certainly has its pros and cons: the free-to-play formula represents a significant incentive for anyone who is minimally interested in puzzle games, but purchases -apps are offered through the same formula that has fans of Let's Golf enraged withthe third installment in Gameloft's golf series. Unless you purchase a specific bonus, in fact, the number of moves that the player can perform is limited and forces him to wait from time to time for it to reload: a small compromise considering the originality and quality of the game, but what he did turning up their noses to many is the possibility of using real money to buy virtual coins. It must be said that at the highest levels of the game it is unlikely that in-app purchases will affect the score to the point of distorting the ranking, and from this point of view the developers have been farsighted enough to place limitations (for example, it is not possible buy more than a certain number of items per game). Yet the system based on the accumulation of coins inevitably ends up ruining an otherwise perfect balance between two users of the same level, especially considering that a crystal at the right time can make the difference in a now lost game.
