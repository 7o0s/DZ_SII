From Game of Thrones to Minecraft, through Borderlands and Batman. All heavy licenses that clearly highlight how much the software house which for many is synonymous with episodic graphic adventures where there is little to rack your brains but so much to watch in terms of narrative, has grown in recent years. And just The Walking Dead represented the turning point for a company that before working on Robert Kirkman's brand had carved out a microscopic market space working on some spin-offs of Sam & Max and The Secret of Monkey Island and on all a series of other small adventures based on the CSI brand. Now, evidently, the time is ripe again to return for the third consecutive time to the franchise that made them known to the general public with the awareness that they can no longer carry out the mere homework but must, at all costs, return to amaze old and new fans, proposing something in step with the times and, above all, able to excite players again. A New Frontier is the subtitle of the new season of The Walking Dead, which loses any numerical reference but is once again divided into five episodes. It is not clear whether they will follow a rigidly monthly publication as happened to the recent Batman: The Telltale Series or if the cadence will be more rarefied but what the public immediately noticed is that, for the first time, the debut is marked by the simultaneous distribution of the first two chapters. A choice that appeared to the writer rather cunning as it is not justified by who knows what gameplay gimmick or particular narrative choice but probably serves the developer to forcefully bring this historic franchise back on the scene and to immediately earn the whole package a rather economic value Interesting. Exactly as had already happened with Batman, it is no longer possible to buy individual episodes or perhaps download a trial version of the first chapter, at least on PC, but you must necessarily buy the entire season pass to be able to enjoy even just the first lines of the adventure. And it is obvious that if two of the five parts that make up the game are accessed immediately, those who have to proceed with the purchase feel more rewarded for their investment. Furthermore A New Frontier is the first Telltale work that does not arrive on the old generation of consoles, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, although the distribution is also maintained on iOS and Android. A New Frontier is a great starting point for the new season of The Walking Dead Telltale style, always the same Moving on to the actual gameplay, even with this A New Frontier the guys from Telltale wanted to make things clear right away: the style of their gameplay is always, only that. It is clear that the software house has no intention of trying other roads or attempting the difficult path of innovation and, although many players were looking at this third season as a turning point in the company's productions, the very first minutes of the game are enough to realizing that there really is nothing new on the horizon. Most of the time we will see long and intense dialogues, essential to introduce the new characters and to adequately explain the evolution of the situation. Sometimes we will have to take action to choose one of the four possible answers to give during the exchange of jokes. We will have little time available and, very often, our choices will have consequences on what the other supporting actors think of us, sometimes even with important implications that could determine the disappearance or removal of an individual, perhaps in a tragic way, or even a real change of scenery. Exactly as happened in Batman: The Telltale Series, there will be a couple of crucial moments in the progress of the two episodes that will force us to make drastic choices and this will involve a change of direction regarding the scenes that we will face with our protagonist and the characters closest to him. For the rest of the game time, however, we will have to perform in short and sporadic quick time events where we will have to limit ourselves to pressing the right button at the moment in which it is indicated to us, sometimes by repeatedly and quickly pushing the same button, other times by maintaining the pressure or possibly by performing in some bolder combination. There are a couple of situations for each of the two episodes in which we will be able to roam freelynte with our avatar within well-confined scenarios. In these situations we will have the freedom to dialogue with the characters present, explore the environment and also collect some objects that will be placed in our inventory and will be used, strictly automatically, in some sequences, sometimes paving the way for small optional scenes. For everything else we are faced with all the typical elements of Telltale productions: these first two episodes are rather linear in their evolution and offer a narrative arc that has been able to involve us despite the fact that the topic and setting are now all too familiar . In terms of longevity we settle on an hour and a half for each of the two parts that make up this Ties That Bind. A double debut episode that shines for the quality of its narrative, for the pleasantness of the story told and for the excellent cliffhangers with which it leaves us hanging both at the end of the first part and at the conclusion of the second, with perfect timing of the surprise with which stuns us for a moment before the end credits. Old age makes it better As already described above and with the precise desire to avoid any spoilers, we limit ourselves to emphasizing that this third season offers a handful of new characters, starting with handsome Javier, the character we will find ourselves controlling for most of the two episodes, the beautiful Kate, second wife of the protagonist's brother and her two teenage children: Gabe and Mariana. Obviously we will not fail to meet a couple of old acquaintances and Clementine herself, a key character in the entire The Walking Dead saga, will appear soon during the game and will accompany us for the two episodes while remaining very often in the background or even moving away often times from the center of the action. A choice by Telltale that amazed us with its audacity and foresight and, we can already confirm it, helps to make this third season something new and not a long clich of what we have already seen and faced in the past. Among other things, thanks to the timeline which distances itself by several months, perhaps even years from the epilogue of the previous season, we can witness flashbacks in some situations expertly used by Telltale to tell us what really happened in the past by revolving in a couple of occasions the sense of events a bit like what happened with the Lost series by J.J. abrams. We conclude this review with a couple of notes on the technical aspect of A New Frontier. Compared to the beginnings of Batman and Minecraft, this time the software house has been able to work with precision and due care on both fronts of optimization and compatibility. The game, tested on PC, didn't let us experience strange crashes or freezes and even from a fluidity point of view we didn't notice any problems apart from some stuttering and an initial problem with the Windows 8 version executable which forced us to select the Windows 7 compatibility function. Graphically, this third season appeared to us to be extremely more refined and detailed than the company's previous works. While maintaining the cel shading style that has always distinguished Telltale's products, this time the models are more defined, show more realistic facial expressions and body animations and the environments are richer in elements on the screen. Let it be clear that we are still faced with technically not cutting-edge graphic adventures and the system requirements highlight this element but this time the final result is appreciable and well-finished. The dubbing is very good even if, it must be emphasized, it is only in English and unfortunately not even the subtitles can help those who do not know the Albion language since Italian is completely absent.", "date": "2016-12-26", "grade": "8.0"}
