Of course, this is gameplay modified and adapted to work best with the touch screen, but among the simple, geometric and clean shapes of the game world it is possible to glimpse something of the magic of a genre that has practically built the videogame universe between the 80s and 90s. It is a distant reflection of the brilliance of the great classics, mind you, but the spirit that emerges seems that of the minor platform games that could be found on mythological platforms such as the NES, PC Engine, Mega Drive and Super Nintendo, at a time when this seemed be the premier genre. Team Neutronized's official website describes the studio as specializing in ~creating classic games with a modern twist,~ and indeed that's exactly what Super Cat Tales: PAWS is on offer, as it just feels like it's an older platformer but plays like a modern mobile platformer. This aspect can also be seen as a weak point by traditionalists, but it must be considered that on smartphones there is certainly more room for maneuver for productions of this type, a reason that pushes indie developers in this direction even beyond the objective limits of platforms in accommodating certain types of gameplay. The simplification applied to the control system is evident, but it has not prevented the developers from carrying out a certain study in the design of the levels, which are still able to offer interesting challenges. Platform between classic and modern Super Cat Tales: PAWS looks like it's straight out of the golden age of platformers, in terms of graphics The story is about the heroic cats of the PAWS team who, as secret agents, find themselves on a mission to save Neko Land from some dark threat. In short, a pretext like any other to introduce cats as the protagonists of a bizarre adventure between platforms, within different settings and with levels that can be reached from a general map, as befits the classic canon of the genre. Super Cat Tales PAWS is in fact the third chapter of a series that began in 2016 with Super Cat Tales and continued with its sequel, therefore PAWS is in a certain sense a sort of spin-off. However, the structure is practically the same: it is a question of going through various levels bristling with obstacles and enemies, trying to reach the finish line unscathed and at the same time collecting the various collectibles scattered throughout the scenarios. Beyond the basic skill between platforms and combat, it is precisely the collection of objects that unleashes the most complex and interesting elements of level design, thus providing some levels of reading for each level, which can be tackled with different degrees of challenge. control system is the thing that most distances Super Cat Tales PAWS from the more classic tradition of the platform, having been entirely designed to work best with the touch screen. With short touches on the edges of the screen we direct the cat in one direction or another, walking or running in order to widen the range of jumps and hit enemies violently. Super Cat Tales: PAWS also has a classic style map Just the jump, a fundamental element of the platform genre, is simplified here through a semi-automatic system: the solution could be mortifying for the great fans of the genre, but it is in fact well implemented in the mobile context, similar on the other hand to what made by Nintendo itself with its Super Mario Run. Ultimately, it remains a simplified model which somewhat limits the direct control of the protagonist and distances him from classical traditions, but which is still functional to this type of use. Speaking of purely mobile constructs, we point out that Super Cat Tales: PAWS it is distributed as free-to-play with the presence of advertising, but it is possible to eliminate the commercials by unlocking them for 5.99 euros which, in fact, makes the game a real premium with a finite price.", "date": "2023-06-18", "grade": "7.5"}
