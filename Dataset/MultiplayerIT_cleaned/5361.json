The official version, with box and dashboard, is already a myth in itself but it is its simplification with pen and paper, the historic ~Naval Battle~, that has made history, sneaking into every possible situation in which it was available a squared page, a couple of pencils and the desire to wander with the mind and imagine epic battles on the seas, while maintaining a rigorous strategic approach. This is how countless warships have been sunk on school benches, during lessons so long and boring as to require the intervention of the fantastic navy. The game is therefore based on very solid ~historical~ foundations, being practically known by everyone in every part of the world, but seeing it reproposed on the screen still represents a rather strange situation, considering that we are used to playing it in other situations, and some distrust in approach is permissible. However, it must be said that the Frima Studios team and the publisher Ubisoft have done a good job of reconstructing a board game of this genre, moreover as old as the Hasbro title, in a rather convincing videogame form. With the new treatment, Sink the Fleet has become a sort of turn-based strategy game, with some tactical depth and choices to be made at different levels, albeit all simplified in line with the game it still refers to. It is therefore a hybrid between the classic board game and a strategic one, which can excite different types of users, even if the limits of the original mechanics remain evident. Basically, what we are faced with are the classic silent maps divided into boxes, the contents of which must be discovered by bombarding the grids and hoping not to reveal the position of one's ships, but there are several interesting variations. A4? Waterfall! G7? Hit! Those nostalgic for the good old days can rejoice in Sinking the Fleet A new interpretation Sink the Fleet can be played in classic mode or in the ~Clash at Sea~ version, which represents a fundamental first choice with important consequences. The first is simply the revival of the original board game on the screen, which soon tends to show the side with its fundamental simplicity and a certain monotony that transpires in a short time, while the second represents the most interesting element of the game. Clash at Sea is a variation on the main theme: the aim is always the elimination of the opposing fleet by trying to discover the positioning of the enemy ships on the ~silent~ grid, but various additional options are introduced which substantially enrich the structure. During each round the player can use a certain amount of points, which can be used in normal attacks and ~exploratory~ shots, useful for checking the contents of the map boxes. Each ship, belonging to the classic 5 categories (coastguard, destroyer, submarine, battleship and aircraft carrier) is equipped with two special abilities, belonging to the two types of shots, which consume a different amount of points depending on their effectiveness, usually linked to extension of the blow and therefore to the quantity of squares involved. Obviously, larger ships can make the most powerful attacks but these are also more expensive in terms of points, so it becomes essential to make a certain economy of hits. At the beginning of each round, players receive three points for each type of attack but by closing the round early, the unspent points are added to the recharged ones, which allows various strategic calculations to be implemented to save and invest the points for more attacks. powerful. As another consequence on the gameplay, the specific characteristics of each ship make the loss of these during the battle particularly important, which introduces a further element to take into consideration in strategic management. The accompanying elements The game modes available allow you to play alone or in multiplayer in the two main options mentioned above, complete with single player progression and online or local multiplayer. The Campaign proposes a decidedly elementary story, as it is obvious to expect from the attempt to insert the classic Naval Battle in a narrative track, but it has the advantage of offering various particular game situations, perhaps modifying the starting situation of a game with the introduction of a maximum limit of rounds in which to conclude the battle or creating disparities on the forces in the field, justifying everythingwith the premises of the story. Advancing in the Campaign you will meet the various factions that can then be used in multiplayer such as Orcs, Robots and Pirates, in addition to the basic Military, elements that introduce variations that are only aesthetic but useful for creating some visual customization for your ships, with the addition of schemes these are also of color to be conquered by advancing in the game. Although pleasant, the Campaign obviously has its limitations, not being that long-lived, and the heart of the action soon moves to the multiplayer. On this front, the greatest advantage is obviously offered by the presence of online gaming, for which Sink the Fleet seems particularly suited. The problem encountered in the trial period was a certain lack of online players which made it difficult to detect available games, but this should be a physiological defect, linked to the first days of launch and presumably solvable once the game has spread a minimum in the community. Offline multiplayer is present as a solution that is always very appreciated even if in this case it is rather bizarre, even if probably inevitable given the way the maps are displayed on the screen, the request to ~look away from the screen~ made to the opposing player while the ships on the grid, which we don't doubt could trigger some really comical curtains on the sofa. Xbox One goals Sink the Fleet contains 15 unlockable achievements, spread across its various game modes. Many of these can already be conquered in the early stages, experimenting with the various options and completing a rather limited number of missions, other rather rich ones arrive by completing the Campaign and still others are linked to the accumulation of performances over a longer period of time but it is not difficult to complete the complete collection. A simple task? The object lends itself to numerous interpretations on the graphic front, but the need to maintain maximum clarity on the grid, which in any case remains the central attention element throughout the game, certainly limits the inspiration and possibilities for managing the elements on the screen. Certainly more could have been done on the characterization front because Sink the Fleet has an extremely simple, almost aseptic appearance, but at least the interface is remarkably clear, with all the elements of interest constantly on the screen. The representations of the ships are good even if the small portion of the screen in which they are confined allows very little attention to detail, but some additional variation to the animations would have been desirable, given that the repeated vision of the usual scenes at each turn quickly becomes tiring, and indeed leads to yearning for the possibility of skipping all the cutscenes, which unfortunately is impossible. Even some slowdowns detected in correspondence with these cutscenes are hardly justifiable, even if the cause is not clear (they could be linked to the tested build, however saved on a hard disk external to the console) considering that they should certainly not depend on the computational load required to put them in scene. On the other hand, the solution adopted to represent the two grids in the center of the screen is interesting, as faces of a cube made of water that can be rotated to show the positioning of your ships, with a pleasant and practical effect. In general, on the aesthetic front, Sink the Fleet really makes the minimum effort to bring the gaming experience of the classic Hasbro to the screen: on the one hand, general clarity is safeguarded but on the other, a minimum of extra charisma, perhaps with the introduction of some characters or a greater amount of animations, would certainly have helped the characterization of the game.", "date": "2016-08-08", "grade": "7.0"}
