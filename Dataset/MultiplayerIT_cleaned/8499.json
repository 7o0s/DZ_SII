Mors belongs in fact to the order of the Guardians of the Night: a veteran ranger, he takes care of protecting the gigantic barrier that separates the Seven Kingdoms from the northern territories, populated by barbarians who often go beyond their borders and mercilessly attack the populations of Westeros . At the beginning of the story, the warrior once again proves his loyalty to the Guardians, capturing an old friend of his who had deserted and who, for this, was sentenced to death. Alester's story is also characterized by a deep feeling of belonging, in this case to the religion of R'hllor, of which he is a red priest. Fled from his homeland, Acquafonte, fifteen years earlier, Alester returns there with the intention of assuming the role of Lord he deserves, after the death of his father, and prevent his sister from marrying a slimy climber close to the queen . In the game we will find ourselves in control of both, initially determining their fighting style between three variants. In the case of Mors Westford, it is possible to choose between ~land knight~, armed with sword, shield and standard armour; ~errant knight~, powerful and without hesitation, who wields heavy two-handed weapons, caring little about the rest; ~magnar~, a swift and swift brute who favors axes and short swords to assail opponents with fury and frenzy. In the case of Alester Sarwyck, however, the choice is between ~water dancer~, a warrior also able to wield two weapons at the same time; ~sword for sale~, i.e. a mercenary skilled in the use of short swords and hammers; ~archer~, ideal for ranged attacks but relatively defenseless in close combat. The choice of style represents only the first step in the creation of our character, which at this point must be balanced by assigning points to the characteristics of strength, agility, luck, robustness and intelligence. We then move on to the composition of our ~repertoire~, i.e. the attack maneuvers that we can use during a fight and which are unlocked as we acquire ~balance points~. They are divided into two categories, generally combined with the directionality of the shot or with its range of action. Finally, the final touches are applied by resorting to a balancing system that allows us to amplify certain skills if we accept, at the same time, to depress others. The customization process therefore turns out to be very full-bodied and detailed, and is certainly one of the most successful aspects of this production. The PC version Our Game of Thrones review is based on the Xbox 360 version of the game, but we also got to try out the PC version (unfortunately briefly, for reasons of ~delayed unlocking~ on Steam). At this juncture, the game has a better cosmetic due to the high resolution and a frame rate that does not show the side of slowdowns, as often happens on consoles. Unfortunately, the Xbox 360 controller is poorly supported and therefore you have to use the mouse and keyboard, but the controls require by default the management of the view by dragging the pointer (holding the button down) and this only makes exploration more cumbersome. The use of the mouse should go better with the strategic nature of the fights, but in the end the differences are few. Not today Game of Thrones gameplay, as mentioned, sees us take control of a different character depending on the chapter, but with the ability to change alter ego immediately, by pressing a button. The game structure is made up of exploratory phases characterized by the discovery of objects and coins, dialogues with NPCs that can influence the course of events and combat sessions. A variation on the theme is represented by the sequences in which we take control of Mors' dog to sniff out the traces of an opponent or a missing companion, possibly attacking our target with ~button mashing~ type dynamics and in the meantime discovering any additional traces , which can lead us to the discovery of treasures and so on. The third-person view allows us to walk around the kingdom in complete freedom, even if the approximation that characterizes the technical sector does not make this phase particularly pleasant and indeed seriously undermines the potential interest. But we'll get to that shortly. Much of the enjoyment of the experience lies in the quality of the combat system, and unfortunately it is at this juncturethat the title of Cyanide Studio just fails to satisfy. When our character is in the vicinity of an enemy, he automatically enters ~offensive mode~, engages a target among those present and begins to launch random attacks. We can manage the various maneuvers by holding down the right back button on the controller and then selecting the ones we want to use from the list of available attacks, placing them in three slots that will be performed by our alter ego, in fact without our direct involvement. The strategic implications of this approach are many, just think that we can concentrate the blows on a single opponent at a time, order Mors' dog to block the target or deprive him of the shield, switch to the command of one of our allies and execute attacks from distance or targeted maneuvers, and so on. In short, the thickness is not lacking, as is the challenge (you will happen to die even during the first chapters, if you don't ~manage~ a fight well, at the intermediate difficulty level), but the repetitiveness of the mechanics (especially at the beginning, when the attacks available are only two or three) and the purely ~tactical~ approach translate into a pure and simple lack of fun. Xbox 360 goals Getting the thousand gamer points made available by Game of Thrones will not be a simple undertaking. Beyond the objectives that are unlocked simply by completing each of the fifteen chapters that make up the story mode, in fact, the rest of the challenges are not trivial: it will be necessary to obtain all the skills for each character, collect certain objects, ensure that some of our companions do not they die and so on. Blood calls for blood We have mentioned that the exploratory phases, whose role is crucial in an RPG, are unfortunately tainted by major limitations on the technical front. Try your hand at the videogame transposition of an important work like that of George R.R. Martin unfortunately required a commitment, care and even a budget that obviously the developers of Cyanide Studio were not able to lavish, despite the fact that the project was supported by HBO, producer of the television series, as well as by Martin himself, who supervised the script . The settings of Game of Thrones are rather dull, uninspired, ~dirty~ and poorly detailed, but it is above all in the indoor scenarios that we notice the bad work done for the textures, among the least defined that we have seen in the current generation. The absurd thing is that in the face of such poor-quality surfaces, we didn't even have the foresight to ~hide~ them from view, and in this situation the scene in which Alester, having returned to Acquafonte, once again puts on the clothes of lord and the the collar of the dress has such large pixels that it looks like a Japanese censorship application. The situation does not improve for the polygonal models, in particular those of the supporting actors, who tend to look too much alike, even to the point of creating confusion about the identity of our companions. Finally, the quality of the animation is decidedly below average. We had high expectations for the sound and certainly the presence of the musical theme of the television series helps in this sense, but the quality of the speech (in English, subtitled in Italian) has disappointed us a lot, with many NPCs playing their part without any conviction, partially ruining an atmosphere which, in the end, stands as the only great value of the game.", "date": "2012-06-13", "grade": "6.0"}
