{"name": "Scarlett porta Fable a Venezia?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/74179-venetica-scarlett-porta-fable-a-venezia.html", "text": "Tested versions: Xbox 360 and PCItalians, people of saints, poets and... videogamers. It seems to be precisely this last one that is the peculiar characteristic of us inhabitants of the Bel Paese in this decade that has just begun. If Ubisoft has paid homage to our country with the creation of Assassins Creed 2, this push seems not to have exhausted itself yet, so much so that even Deck13 wanted to set their Venetica in the famous Venetian capital. Is Italy turning into a new digital Cinecitt? Before rejoicing in the great consideration towards our culture, however, it is necessary to analyze what are the results that land on our screens, in short, what is the quality of the role-playing game created by the German developers: an experience that makes the chest swell with patriotic pride or a disappointment to forget? Between mines, canals and sewers Venetica presents itself as a role-playing game with fairy-tale and parodic traits, a style made famous by Lionhead's masterpiece Fable 2. The inspiration for Peter Moulinex's creature is clear from the first minutes of the game: a world that is a caricature of itself himself, the light-hearted character of the dialogues and the use of a deliberately self-deprecating register can only convince us that in Germany they greatly appreciated the work of the Lord from across the Channel. Venetica's adventure starts following the peculiar characteristics of a fantasy role-playing game: an assault on Scarlett's native village spoils the serene flow of everyday life and takes away the life of the man loved by the protagonist. These events force the girl to take up arms to complete a mission greater than her, a journey that leads to the city of Venice following the directives of Death himself, here as not the last enemy to defeat but an ally and even father figure. What the grim reaper asks us is to thwart a necromancer's plans that threaten to lead to the now classic destruction of the world as we know it. In order to be successful in the thankless task Scarlett must resort to the dark abilities dormant in her, which obviously we will have to awaken during the game; it is then up to the player to decide whether to pursue the ultimate goal by following the path of altruistic good or whether to abandon himself to the fury of revenge. Thus said, the narrative of Venetica does not seem to deviate too much from the standards of the genre, an honest story, a pretext like any other to take up the sword and reap enemies to accumulate experience and level up, in short, the bare minimum to offer the player a canvas on which to write your own story through a digital alter ego. However, something is missing, or rather the cog of this whole mechanism appears immediately not very smooth, the spring of the desire for adventure finds it hard to snap and with this also the thrust of involvement. What weighs heavily is in particular the absence of a side dish, of a superior and painstaking care that can enhance and make that world and that story enjoyable that by themselves do not seem to go anywhere. Walking around Albion is a unique experience, Fable offers a world with its own peculiar identity and this unique imprint goes to incense the gameplay of the product itself. In Venetica all this is not present, the vast city and its surroundings appear as large empty containers, Ezio's Venice is light years away and in particular the inhabitants in their static nature and in their few and skimpy lines of dialogue have no character, they're just mission dispensers (at best), no one has a story to tell worth hearing. If the task of creating a game environment is done very well on paper, one cannot be satisfied with a body without a soul, not with a game that takes many hours to complete. Never feel at home It is within the Venetian city environment that the heart of the adventure develops. Once you reach your destination, in fact, an ever wider range of quests and available portions of the map opens up, represented by the districts of the city that gradually become explorable. The missions intersect each other in a rather dynamic way so as to transform the subquests into fundamental pieces to complete the main story line. Let's face it, the offer of tasks that Venetica offers does not deviate from the standards of the genre and suffer, in the case of the secondary quests, from the chronic lack of originality typical of the optional objectives, for this reason it would be unfair to blame the game for this when even the titles historical and more famous fill hours of play with low-thickness assignments. Rather, it is evident that this time notnor is it more sufficient to offer the player honest subquests; when missing is the outline that should enhance every more trivial action in the game world, one realizes that even the offer of the usual adventure package is no longer sufficient to keep the involvement high. Without the dreamlike beauty of Albion, the devastated and decaying vistas of Fallout 3, and without a population that seems alive and active in the immediate environment as an incentive, there can be an incentive for the player to carry yet another object from one place to another of the map or to clean up one of the many haunted houses? If the beauty of a role-playing game lies precisely in the sensation of feeling part of something, of helping to move the gears of everything around us with our smallest action, with Venetica this possibility of estrangement is denied to us by a approximate over the entire background. The acting of the non-player characters is insipid, almost non-existent, the feeling of talking to digital dolls is always present, the city has no better to offer than in spite of the noble name that bears nothing has to do with the Venice known with the adventures of Ezio in Assassins Creed 2 and the merciless confrontation certainly does not concern the technical aspect, albeit subdued. Scarlett does not move between the villages of a splendid city of art but in a container devoid of depth and charm, with a level design that assumes a minimum of coherence and logic only of the cramped underground dungeons while the places of greatest interest such as the squares and the markets boast just a handful of characters to haggle with via the haggling menu. Xbox 360 goals Venetica gives away just over half of the thousand points up for grabs by finishing the game once without any particular tricks. It is essential to undergo all training, while it is necessary to finish the game a second time with a different alignment for the relative objective. A guild is forever We said that Scarlett will have to develop her innate skills during the game, the latter are divided into physical skills and magical arts. The first are none other than the special shots that can be used with the various types of weapons available, namely: swords, scythes, hammers and spears. Each weapon has different special shots that can be unlocked by spending experience points in a classic tree diagram, among these there are also passive skills that will permanently increase the offensive capabilities of the protagonist. The same goes for magic, largely linked to the world of shadows, an alternative dimension that Scarlett can cross in order to take advantage of the portals present in it, sometimes useful for solving simple puzzles. The other arcane skills have a purely offensive nature and require a consumption of mental energy and a subsequent recharge time to be performed. The number of skills is considerable and it is possible to assign the most used ones to the directions of the d-pad and to the B key, unfortunately the need to have many more skills at hand is soon felt, a problem solved only in the PC version by a long customizable bar at the bottom of the screen. The combat system makes simplicity its strong point by attributing the physical attack function to a single key that can be chained into simple combos but which, combined with the careful and providential use of dodging and the same skills, manages to give satisfaction. The decision whether to forge a protagonist more prone to physical combat or the use of magic is up to the player's free choice and will be enhanced by the choice of the guild to join. The guilds of the city are three in all, each with a greater predisposition for the use of weapons, necromancy or the formation of potions and trade. The choice is rather small to tell the truth and does not distort the narrative so much that it does not present great narrative crossroads. Urban decay Boasting such a high-potential setting, it was reasonable to expect a first-rate graphic design from Venetica so as to enhance the entire production. It is a pity to note that even in this respect expectations have been betrayed, the polygonal modeling of the characters is really rough, as are their often unrelated animations and ungainly rendering. The textures lack effects and the lighting, despite the day-night cycle, is static and often even unreal in closed places, the light effects of spells and abilities are also uninspired. During the game we also encountered numerous rather annoying glitches, such as stuck characters or bad interactivity with the environment, a symptom of a rather approximate refinement workwhile the Xbox 360 version suffers from poor optimization found in numerous and drastic drops in framerate unjustified by the always modest on-screen action. Certainly the technical aspect is the one that most of all betrays the nature of Venetica, a project born on interesting premises but which did not materialize well in the development phase, the inspiration from masterpieces such as Fable2 can only make it even more it is clear how serious the lack of refinement work is for all the game components which thus inevitably form, each in their poor realization, a whole that fails to exalt the player in any respect.", "date": "2010-05-03", "grade": "5.0"}
