Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to shell out even a penny. Although it takes the mechanics of a 1994 Russian video game entitled ~Shariki~, Bejeweled has certainly shaken up the puzzle game genre and stimulated the birth of a large number of clones of successful, just like Candy Crush Saga. At first glance it could be said that the two products differ only in the nature of the objects to be moved and matched on the board, diamonds in the case of the PopCap Games title and candies in the one developed by King.com, but in reality there are some differences in terms of structure, especially compared to the recent Bejeweled Blitz, which focused everything on the speed of execution and on a ~survival~ approach to the games. Candy Crush Saga also deals with the theme of speed, of course, but it does so with a view to an extremely vast and diversified campaign, which starts from levels characterized by very simple concepts, which can be completed without particular effort, and then opens up towards more complicated thanks to the introduction of rocks, jellies, time limits, target scores and so on, through an explosion of colors that will win you over. It all starts from the story of a little girl who, during a strange journey, meets a series of characters in difficulty and helps them by delivering them sweets. The chapters that make up the campaign develop in this way, gradually unlocking upgrades which, however, can only be used by putting a hand in the wallet: from the lollipop capable of demolishing individual blocks, at the price of 79 cents, to the powerful ~amulet of stripes ~, a skill that remains forever at our disposal to solve the most complex missions but which costs the beauty of 35.99 euros. Free candy? The gameplay of Candy Crush Saga is immediately very immediate, with the traditional board made up of eighty-one boxes and full of candies of six different colors: yellow, red, orange, green, blue and purple. Combining identical candies in groups of three results in their elimination, while eliminating four together creates an ~explosive~ candy that can involve adjacent boxes or those in the same row or column. Finally, matching five candies creates an even more lethal candy, which combined with a single candy causes the destruction of all sweets of that type on the board. Arrived without particular problems at the thirtieth level or so, the freemium nature of the product actually begins to be felt. We are not saying that the game obliges us to buy something, but the ~strategic~ increase in difficulty is clear if our intention is to complete the stages without resorting to any help, also because often and willingly it is the luck factor that determines the fate of matches and not necessarily our ability to match candies of the same type. In fact, if the right objects do not arrive from the top of the board, in the right position, strategic skill and quick reflexes will be of little use. This is therefore the big limitation of the King.com title, which on the technical front defends itself well apart from an incredibly repetitive sound accompaniment.", "date": "2013-03-16", "grade": "7.5"}
