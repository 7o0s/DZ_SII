{"name": "Luigi's Mansion 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/luigis-mansion-3-recensione.html", "text": "Cursed ghosts invite Luigi and the rest of the gang to a beautiful hotel called Hotel Miramostri. Everyone seems happy, Peach most of all, but Luigi immediately smells something burning. In the bedroom he can finally relax but a scream pierces the darkness of the night: it is the beloved princess! With the help of his flashlight, our begins to explore the building to discover that luxury and comfort have been replaced by cobwebs and sinister creaking. And then Peach! Mario! Little Toads! They have all disappeared, indeed they have been kidnapped by an old enemy of ours, imprisoned inside paintings hidden who knows where. For Luigi it is the beginning of a nightmare, but for us it is the fun and the review of Luigi's Mansion 3. And when all seems lost, the big brush finds what appears to be his Poltergust inside a machine, but used here as a motor. Of course, it is Professor Strambic's car, and he too is staying at the Miramostri hotel. We are no longer alone: let Luigi's revenge be accomplished now or never! The extra friend This new Luigi's Mansion 3 is the quintessence of Nintendo games of recent years. A title endowed with absolute perfection, impressive in the transversality that manages to maintain, stoic, throughout the course of the story. There is a risk of a bit of standardization of strictly playful emotions, but at the moment we cannot complain too much. Luigi's Mansion 3 is an extremely successful product, which keeps you glued to the console which in the case of Switch is a big problem, since you can have it with you 24/7. The game thus becomes a pleasant escape from the daily tedium, although working a lot on the details it tends to be a bit tiring to follow on the small standard display, while it definitely comes to life once sucked into the big screen at home. With a well-set panel (for Switch it is necessary to decrease its sharpness a bit in order to round out the image) Luigi's Mansion 3 appears so vibrant that it ends up directly in the top 3 of the most graphically intriguing games ever to appear on this console. The fact that it is mainly set indoors, in rooms well delimited by their walls, helps it, and that's perfectly fine. The particular structure of the levels of Luigi's Mansion 3, which are the different floors of the Miramostri hotel, also gives the game a fun physics simulation on which Nintendo has naturally built its perfect gameplay. Small parenthesis for those who have never played a Luigi's Mansion: here you explore, solve puzzles and capture monsters, all using a modified vacuum cleaner capable of blowing, sucking and throwing Luigi in the air to wipe out nearby objects and enemies. It works precisely because it's simple. In this new game, however, two interesting functions have been added: the first is the possibility of shooting suction cups equipped with a rope which, if sucked in, will allow us to lift particularly heavy objects, or to uncork lockers and other elements related to the progress of the game. The second is Gooigi! In Italian it has been translated ~Gommiluigi~ even if we continue to prefer the original name, and it is the ~slime~ version of Luigi, able to pass through grates, be sucked up by pipes, but woe to get him to touch the water. Inhale, stun and slam As easily predictable, each of these skills, including the ability to use the torch - electric and spirit - will sooner or later prove essential to defeat the different enemies that the game will put in front of us. It must be said that there aren't very many fights, perhaps precisely to limit the boredom that was created in the second episode, where the clashes were many and the ghosts rather anonymous. In Luigi's Mansion 3, on the contrary, we have less frequent clashes, but most of the time against entities characterized in the smallest detail, very often linked to the theme of the room that hosts them, and there are also quite a few of these special ghosts, therefore more frequent of the usual bosses. This does not mean that wandering around the hotel is a quiet activity: there are also more generic ghosts but still of different types who will do everything to hinder the protagonist, even dressing up as attendants intent on dusting the furniture. The biggest novelty here is the ability to smack enemies around once they're sucked in, it works like this: you start sucking up the ghost by pressing the vacuum button, you try to tire it out by moving the analog stick in the opposite direction it's trying to escape, when is finally tired by pressing A and directing the blows you can use it as a sort of cudgel against the furniture, useful for collecting some saving hearts, or against the other ghosts, taking away aa good amount of energy. Saw - The Uigmist In addition to combat, advancement is often tied to solving environmental puzzles: shift weight, pull weight, spin a cogwheel with the Poltergust jet to make an elevator go up. The mastery of the Nintendo team as regards the puzzles (although the fights are not excluded) is to offer a level of difficulty calibrated to the millimeter: in solving them they never make you feel stupid but not even really a genius, practically they are designed to be readable and solvable with taste by all types of players. This is great if you're in the most suitable age group, while it risks making the product a bit flat if you have some experience behind you. The more complex passages are those that include the presence of Gooigi , which although in some situations it is also comfortable in combat, mainly serves to multiply the type of puzzle on which we are going to work. In fact, Gooigi and Luigi can be driven almost simultaneously: if, for example, you start inhaling with the first character and without stopping you pass to the second (by pressing the right analog), you are free to act while the first continues to use the Poltergust where you have it left. The hotel of Luigi's Mansion 3 consists of fifteen floors plus surprises, and it is possible to complete it in about fifteen hours. That's not bad at all when you consider that each plan is linked to different strategies and themes. Furthermore, and this is the most important thing, compared to Luigi's Mansion 2 this sequel is set in a single location, it is not broken up into levels, and this allows it to offer a more immersive experience. Just like in Super Mario Odyssey, to see the difficulty level rise quite a bit it is necessary to dwell on the outline: in the collection of the five hidden gems on each floor, or in the capture of special ghosts which are not infrequently linked to puzzles that we have found it rather prickly. If you put in it, it takes time in exchange for a good dose of satisfaction, it's a pity that there is a temptation that is difficult to keep at bay: with the money that can be sucked up for a long time in the Miramostri hotel we are only allowed to do one thing , and is buying advice on where to find gems and Boo. Knowing the location of a secret is sometimes not enough to put it in your pocket in no time at all, but very often yes, and considering that money is essentially only used for this (as well as buying the golden bone that will fill the our life if it reaches zero), it is clear that they represent the only out-of-focus element, which has little sense and little space in the gameplay while remaining a constant in exploration, of Luigi's Mansion 3. Ghosts for everyone As widely advertised, Luigi's Mansion 3 can also turn into a multiplayer game. During the normal adventure, at any time another player can take control of Gooigi, for a coop which, although limited to single rooms, beyond which the second character must be called each time, knows how to offer a decidedly fun elbow-to-elbow experience. Furthermore, still dedicated to local multiplayer but this time up to eight players, we find three different mini-games, two of which are extremely fun. These activities will invite us to split into teams to capture the largest number of ghosts, hit moving targets through a cannon while stealing the opponent's ammunition, and collect the largest number of coins in a pool by moving on board a very fragile inflatable duck . They make you laugh, and are a great extra. The best of the best is of course the Tower of Chaos mode: here two can play on the same console and up to four online, and the goal is to clear five or ten haunted floors of a procedurally created hotel. In addition to the ghosts to be captured, the greatest enemy is time: it is not enough to be aggressive, but it is necessary to be extraordinarily effective. The Torre del Chaos is really tough, especially if the small group that ventures inside it is not close-knit. The best thing is that every time it will be different, so you won't know where the ghosts are, or the golden key that will give you access to the next floor. You will agree with us that the Torre del Caos will hardly be able to keep us busy for months, in fact it is more a mode to alternate with history, when there is a wifi within range, and also in this case that's perfectly fine.", "date": "2019-10-28", "grade": "9.0"}
