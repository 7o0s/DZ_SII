The occasion seems to have now arrived with the Rabbids Crazy Rush here, based on a model already seen on smartphones and tablets but which is here made with the right measure. Rabbids Crazy Rush doesn't invent anything new, but it does all things right Running on the lanes Starting from the assonance with the name up to the obvious similarities in terms of graphics and gameplay, Rabbids Crazy Rush is in fact a spiritual sequel to Despicable Me: Minion Rush, tie-in of the famous animated film made by Gameloft over three years ago. Passing over a concept of originality which evidently is not the founding pillar of this project, the Ubisoft product uses a real evergreen of the mobile landscape, or that game system brought to success by Temple Run and perfected by titles of the caliber of Subway Surfers. When you work in the context of such inflated genres and you don't have the slightest intention of making great revolutions, it is essential to take care of every aspect of the production, which was actually done by the transalpine developers. The aim of the game is therefore always to lead the protagonist to the end of the round level, by swiping the screen in the four directions respectively to make him jump, slide or allow him to change lanes. Each stage has a specific objective, which may consist of collecting a certain number of cans, walking a certain amount of meters or performing a particular action a certain number of times, an aspect that guarantees a minimum but important sense of variety in the course of the many schemes that make up the game: the challenge component instead lies in the fact that the bunny's running speed increases progressively, making things more and more difficult as the seconds go by. Some valid elements then contribute to reshuffling the cards of a super-tested formula a bit: the Rabbids can wear costumes that give them particular abilities, and during the stages, vehicles that can be driven for a short time appear from time to time . The inevitable free to play dynamics are also inserted in this groove, managed by Ubisoft with a certain nonchalance: the cans collected during the gameplay can be spent to upgrade the vehicles or buy tokens for a washing machine that provides shreds of fabric thanks to which to unlock new costumes, and packs of game currency are offered for sale in the appropriate shop accessible from the main menu. There is also a second category of resources within reach of a credit card (the inevitable plungers), given sparingly during the campaign and above all useful for avoiding starting a level over again in the event of a mistake: neither in this nor in the case of cans is there however, it is faced with those unpleasant bottlenecks typical of many similar titles, thanks to the possibility given by the application to view advertisements to obtain specific benefits. In short, everything works as it should in Rabbids Crazy Rush, last but not least a technical realization that is absolutely up to the task, with fluid, colorful and lively 3D graphics that find their best expression in the hilarious animations of the bunnies. To avoid experiencing a real idiosyncrasy for the genre, the Ubisoft product therefore proves to be an absolutely recommended download for anyone looking for a fun and disengaged mobile game.", "date": "2017-03-06", "grade": "8.0"}
