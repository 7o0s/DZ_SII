The protagonist of the adventure is Desta, a non-binary person who one night, in the throes of anxiety, has an extremely realistic dream, sometimes insidious, in which he has to face the pivotal figures of his past life and to clarify his feelings once and for all, but only after defeating them. A mix that works? We reveal it to you in the review of Desta: The Memories Between. History Desta: The Memories Between, the protagonist turns over in bed As mentioned, the story of Desta: The Memories Between takes place within a dream: the protagonist's conscience intervenes to somehow resolve the conflicts that are gripping her, through a series of dialogues (clearly imaginary) with the characters have accompanied her over the years and from which, for one reason or another, she ended up distancing herself. plot development. What flows before our eyes seems to all intents and purposes a session with a psychotherapist, the elaboration of relationships and events that have left their mark on Desta's soul. In all of this, in our opinion, a profoundly out of tune note lies in the preliminary indication of the gender identity of each character within the dialogues themselves: a move that we fail to understand, given that the authors had all the necessary skills to explain these elements within the narrative. In short, the feeling is that there are some forcings, perhaps for promotional purposes and related to the collaboration with Netflix, and it is a pity because the work done by UsTwo in terms of the story is valid, with characters interesting that are introduced gradually and that we will have to be able to transform from opponents into companions. As? Balling them in the face, of course. Gameplay Desta: The Memories Between, the dialogues indicate the gender identity of the characters Football, in fact: the strategic mechanics that characterize the gameplay of Desta: The Memories Between present in each stage a sort of dreamlike diorama divided into boxes, with the possibility of controlling the protagonist of the adventure and two of her friends (unlocked up to that moment) in order to take possession of the balls scattered around the scenario and use them to hit the enemies. The turn-based system is the traditional one, each of our units generally has two actions and it is therefore possible to move up to the point where a ball is , which is collected automatically, and then attack by throwing it through a mechanism that mimics the famous Angry Birds slingshot, albeit in a three-dimensional context also made up of rebounds and passes. Desta: The Memories Between, our team against some enemies It is these facets, together with the vital energy system and the special abilities available to each character, both ~good~ and ~bad~, that give depth to the experience which, let's not forget, follows a roguelite approach in terms of progression. This means that yes, at each game over the campaign starts over but our characters retain the improvements obtained up to that point. The system works very well, even if sometimes the view tends to ~get stuck~, and the touch controls they are immediately revealed, with a horizontal swipe that allows you to rotate the scenario at any time in order to better see the boxes that interest us. Too bad the zoom doesn't work as well, which makes some sequences difficult to read, resulting in some frustration when a shot misses. Technical realization Desta: The Memories Between, one of the game scenarios The mix of narration and atmosphere developed by UsTwo is supported by a technical realization decidedly up to the situation, which uses stylized characters during the interlude sequences to then welcome us with pastel colors and visual solutions that millions of users have already appreciated in Monument Valley, but decidedly less essential. The graphics of Desta: The Memories Between can therefore count on a certain personality, as well as the sound, composed not only of the English dialogues we have already mentioned, but also of an accompaniment gritty and interesting musical, capable of enhancing the various situationsgame i.", "date": "2022-10-04", "grade": "8.0"}
