F.A.S.T - Flet Air Superiority Training! it is one of those cases in which the potential intrinsic to the mechanics of the iPhone are exploited properly by implementing a truly complete control mode, not immediate but undoubtedly satisfactory. FAST is an arcade with fighter planes in which the player comes across two modes: single or multiplayer. There is no storyboard that acts as a glue in the moments of transition between one mission and another - about thirty of increasing difficulty - but the whole adventure is consumed phase after phase with a common goal: to shoot down enemy planes before this last ones tear our beloved aircraft to pieces. By passing tests after tests, new vehicles built in different years are unlocked: starting from the Vietnam bombers and ending on board fifth-generation stealth fighters, it is even possible to fly Luftwaffe, Russian Air Force and USAF jets. If single-player missions are not a little exciting, the one-on-one and two-on-two modes designed for multi-player play, both locally and online thanks to the wi-fi connection, considerably lengthen FAST's longevity.

The perfect use of the combination of the accelerometer and the iPhone touch mentioned above are the real gem of FAST: the mobile phone screen transforms into a cockpit where with a simple touch you can decide in which position to steer, while other icons are delegate for weapons amidst missiles or volleys of bullets. The actual control of the aircraft is delegated to the physical maneuvers of the accelerometer and good coordination between fingers and inclination is the key to becoming a real Top Gun: after the first moments of training, you find yourself sincerely amused especially in the moments of impact between our missiles and enemy aircraft.
