Five years later, the sequel arrives, which embraces the same formula: beyond a similar setting - they are both collections of minigames - the determining factor is the marketing bundled with the Wiimote, so much so that it is practically impossible to judge its playful quality without taking into account the reduced price. Compared to a simple remote control, the package containing Wii Play: Motion costs ~only~ ten euros more. The main difference compared to the predecessor is that this time the bundle is not with a normal Wiimote, but with a Wiimote Plus, i.e. a standard-sized remote control with integrated motion plus. In short, a device that could be useful to more than one person when the next Zelda arrives. Wrist issue Each minigame in the title requires the use of motion plus: clearly this aspect does not raise any problems in the single player experience, but could cause them in the case of two or more users. This is more serious than it might seem, because without multiplayer you will hardly play Wii Play: Motion more than twice, so it is almost essential to have at least one remote control with motion plus attached. Unlike the original, this sequel was not developed internally by Nintendo: although all supervised by the Kyoto house, various mini-games were made by small Japanese teams. The general quality has not been affected too much, on the contrary: the average value of the minigames is higher, and they are about double, twelve. The general feeling is that the simplest and apparently least interesting ones are instead the most successful: complexity, especially in this field, is not necessarily a virtue. Another general feature that permeates the entire product is the quality of the control system, truly exceptional. The Wiimote plus is exactly what everyone hoped the normal Wiimote would be, and that is an accessory capable of perceiving even the slightest movements on any axis, including accelerations. If - absurdly - this peripheral had been present since the launch of the console, most likely the history of the Wii would have been different; or rather, the history of motion control, and their confinement to ~casual games~, would have been different. Wii Play: Motion is hardly a masterpiece, but it's still a pleasure to see your movements faithfully reproduced on the screen. Kill the mole The minigames are divided into three sections, each made up of four elements, with increasing levels of complexity. Each of them is more structured than those of the first Wii Play: each one has various stages and/or difficulty levels to be unlocked by improving one's score. As anticipated a few lines ago, the most successful episodes are often the simplest ones, so much so that the best minigames are found in the first and second group. ~Occhio all'orto~ is a fast-paced, very classic and always fun killer of moles, which gives its best in multiplayer: various types of enemies and scores, many settings, and above all a hammer that has never been so realistic to move in a video game. ~Target Shooting~ is an expansion of the Duck Hunt clone present in Wii Play, but this time you can move the view, as well as the aim: even in this case - indeed, especially in this case - longevity is assured, since that there are so many levels, each with new and well-characterized enemies. ~Rimbalzello~, despite the apparent naivety, is one of the most interesting games: it's just a question of throwing a stone on a lake, and making it bounce as much as possible, but the precision of motion plus, so sensitive in detecting angle and speed shooting, makes it all extremely fun (much more than it may seem in words). The second group of minigames also has its peaks, starting with ~Flipper~, in which you take control of a series of horizontal bars (to be tilted at will) with which to shoot balls in any direction. This game works well both alone and in multiplayer, and for this reason it is definitely to be included among the best. Equally valid is ~Haunted House~, a sort of Luigi's Mansion in first person, based on a really brilliant idea: you have to look for ghosts around the room, based only on sound (and when we say around the room we mean outside from the TV, pointing the remote behind, above and below you) and bring them ~into~ the screen, where they can be sucked up. To conclude we mention ~Turbumbrella~ and ~Space station~, which at first glance seem the most attractive and profound. The first is a kind of racing game with skates and umbrella for planate, but the ride doesn't flow as smoothly as it could have, and it's held to the ground by an annoying underlying cumbersomeness. The second puts you in control of a spaceship, but the joint use of buttons and motion sensors makes an unoriginal gaming experience artificial in itself. What time? Wii Play is the second best-selling game for the Wii, but Wii Play: Motion got off to a bad start, so much so that it will struggle to surpass 100,000 copies. While it's superior to the prequel in every respect, it's undeniable that it came out late. The life cycle of the console has now come to an end, and the motion plus has never managed to break through, mainly for two factors: it has been poorly supported by the software houses (Nintendo in the lead) and its features are difficult to communicate to the public casual. Wii Play: Motion is a simple but well made product, definitely recommended for those who can enjoy it in multiplayer; despite this, its main effect is to make people regret what could have been and was not. The motion plus works so well, even in an essential title like this, that it is impossible not to fantasize about what it could have added to the many games released for Wii since 2006 - but also from 2009 - onwards, if only it had been kept better into account.", "date": "2011-07-06", "grade": "6.8"}
