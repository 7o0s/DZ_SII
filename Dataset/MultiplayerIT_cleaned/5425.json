{"name": "Quest  la volt buon", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/171054-combo-quest-2-quest-e-la-volt-buon.html", "text": "The developers of Combo Quest 2 are evidently avid readers of Multiplayer.it: during our review of the first chapter, we underlined how the title showed good intuitions and captivating gameplay but we complained that the lack of depth and above all a sense of progression would end up greatly demeaning an experience that was repetitive after a short period of time. A year later, Tapinator comes up with a sequel that is committed to building a real structure around the same playful mechanics, basically filling all the gaps that had prevented Combo Quest from reaching a higher rating on these pages. Thanks to a more substantial structure, Combo Quest 2 is a much better title than the prequel Learn from mistakes The premises behind Combo Quest 2 are the same as in the first episode: in the role of an anonymous hero, you have to save the kingdom by facing monsters and various enemies in succession, fighting through a system that recalls that of rhythm games. In the lower part of the screen, a bar on which an indicator scrolls back and forth makes a good impression, and the player's task is to tap the screen when it overlaps the colored blocks that correspond to a specific action: the yellow ones and green indicate the possibility of inflicting medium and strong hits respectively on the opponent, the red ones allow you to block the duelist's blow and those marked with a specific symbol have different effects on the battle, for example increasing the speed of the indicator or temporarily clearing the slash from all blocks. In short, everything as in the prequel, including the mode of accumulation of the special attack, executable with a swipe after having inserted a minimum of five hit taps and the upgrades that are obtained for each battle won. A winning formula that shouldn't be distorted but only enriched, an aspect that the Tapinator developers took very seriously, starting with the aforementioned sense of progression: while the first chapter was based on the world of endless runners, with random opponents and the obligation to start over in case of defeat, Combo Quest 2 offers a real RPG-style adventure, with stages made up of a predefined number of battles whose completion rewards the user with coins, crystals and chests to open to get different rewards. Everything is hand-in-hand with customization systems and brand new upgrades that act as an ideal accompaniment to the main playful action: it is therefore possible to improve the basic characteristics of the hero, replace him with another character (be it a magician, a archer, a thief and so on), support him with a companion who helps him in battles and even grant him a special weapon that guarantees him certain bonuses in attack. Each of these elements can be leveled up by spending the appropriate green gems, while with gold coins you can buy other items and upgrades: as in all free to play games in the universe, in-app purchases make their good impression and those who don't want to spend real money have to get down to grinding, but the situation is mitigated enough by the possibility of watching advertisements, repeating already completed internships or facing the appropriate challenge scenarios to obtain new rewards. It doesn't hurt that the game is always a lot of fun, even more than its predecessor thanks to a renewed balance of the mechanics that have made the difficulty curve less steep and the experience generally more enjoyable. The retouching from a technical point of view is also appreciable, with graphics still in pixel art but decidedly richer and more refined and a sound that relies on captivating chiptune music and effects that seem to come straight from an 8-bit console. The only real note that we address to the developers who read us so carefully is to make the detection of the swipe that activates the special swipe less sensitive, which is often confused with a simple tap.", "date": "2016-07-07", "grade": "8.5"}
