Now: Those who have already played Crash Bandicoot 4 on PlayStation 4 (and Pro) on March 13, 2021 can simply download the update for PlayStation 5, free of charge. Alternatively, latecomers will also be able to directly purchase the full game on next gen, at list price. Finally, what better occasion to go back to talking once again about a title that convinced us so much as to assign it a resounding 9 already last autumn? Your (our) favorite marsupial is here again, now at its full potential graphically and technically. The conversion on PS5 The conversion of Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time to PlayStation 5 did not disappoint expectations, and clearly limited itself to proposing what was announced not too long ago by Activision; in addition, of course, to all those aspects that it was reasonable to expect on next gen. It is useless to get around it: the production already worked very well on its own on PlayStation 4 and on PlayStation 4 Pro. We already noticed at the time, thinking of a hypothetical arrival on new generation consoles, that at the most it could have demanded some finishing, filing, slight enhancement tied to the new hardware, nothing more nothing less. And that's exactly how things went. Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time also features enemies... huge To be even more precise, on PlayStation 5 Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time receives 4K and 60 FPS: if the former will need a worthy TV or monitor to be fully enjoyed, the latter are certainly a welcome addition for everyone . Recall that on PlayStation 4 Crash Bandicoot 4 was anchored to 30 FPS, and on PlayStation 4 Pro the latter were ~unlocked~ upwards; it was never fully understood if already on PlayStation 4 Pro it touched the exact, precise 60 FPS. Now on PlayStation 5 the answer is yes, and - as far as we have seen - both in less excited and in more crowded situations. In short, it is obvious that at the moment (the PC version of Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time will come later) the best way to enjoy the title, visually and technically speaking, is right here. Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time, do you want pirates? You will have pirates But that's not all, as far as the news is concerned. On next gen, in fact, you can now enjoy even more refined audio thanks to the use of 3D Audio technology; the one that from a commercial point of view was immediately associated with the PULSE 3D wireless headphones, so to speak. In reality, however, you don't necessarily need those to enjoy 3D Audio; nor is it a given that every video game released on the PlayStation 5 supports it. Crash Bandicoot 4 yes, and this is the important detail. Instead, it could have gone much better for the haptic feedback, yes present but still at its historic lows (you will struggle to notice it in the early hours, especially playing as the protagonist). Concluding the paragraph with a quick summary for the listless: if you have a PlayStation 5 and you know what you are buying, proceed without any doubt. If, on the other hand, you don't know what we've talked about so far or you simply want to review the marsupial's latest adventure a bit, proceed further. The perfect evolution of the series Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time: Kapuna-Wa, one of the new masks, linked to time It is important to reiterate a fundamental concept: Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time represents the perfect evolution of the series, in addition to the first true sequel to the franchise ~in over a decade~, as the developers like to say (and it's also true). Everything you loved, appreciated, nostalgically remembered about the first three Crash Bandicoots is also present in this new chapter, with all the further enrichments of any kind, which we already illustrated in the review. Even the plot, in reality, picks up where Warped ended: Doctor Neo Cortex, N. Trophy and Uka Uka have finally freed themselves from captivity; only, to do so, they also ripped through the dimensions, bringing the universe to collapse. Crash's task will then be to recover the four Quantum Masks, defeat all the bad guys, close the gashes and save the day; ordinary administration, in short. Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time, many old bad guys will be back in action Let's leave out the goodness of the level design, the excellent column I knownora, the challenge accessible for newcomers and perfectly sadistic for the older ones: two aspects in particular shine in Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time. They are the Quantum Masks themselves, which alter the gameplay by proposing new ideas in single levels, and the secondary playable characters. The former allow you to deal with some routes in a particular way, slowing down time, making part of the game world appear and disappear ~on request~, giving Crash a very powerful spin and capable of covering large distances, finally alternating the force of gravity. There are some worlds in which these four powers must be quickly alternated all at once: we let you imagine how many times you will have to try a path again before succeeding in the enterprise. Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time, there is also Tawna, but it is not as you remember The presence of old and new faces is also excellent, with which it is now possible to complete secondary sub-plots: thus learning that a Tawna Bandicoot from another universe is ready to hit enemies with a grappling hook, which after all Neo Cortex himself can prove to be an excellent ally in certain situations, and that Dingodile wanted to retire to private life by running a fast food restaurant. Each character has different weapons, movesets and mobility: their presence is never too invasive, and that's fine. Too bad it doesn't even manage to shine in a particular way, as it is very diluted within the main adventure.", "date": "2021-03-11", "grade": "9.0"}
