After a long development, the exit of Studio Ghibli (but not of its main artists) and about a year behind schedule, finally the new Level 5 JRPG arrives on the market. We have played it thoroughly and we know that as always you will have already gone to peek at the vote. Never like this time we ask you to give us the opportunity to really explain what we think. That the score is lower than the original does not necessarily mean that the title is less worthy. There are moments in which it is appropriate to gather your thoughts and decide whether to move along the lines of consistency with what has already been proposed in past years, or to make a judgment based on the needs of the current market. What is certain is that, after spending more than sixty hours on the game in the last week, you can rest easy: Ni No Kuni II, just like the first chapter, is a JRPG with all the trimmings. Of those that make you feel the joy of getting lost in this genre, but that lives on the same slips of the first one, filing away on some elements and losing something on others. Overall it remains a wonderful work, which now is the case to dissect. I reign that you reign For anyone who has lived on Mars in the past few months, enjoy your stay on the red planet; for all the others it will now be clear how Ni No Kuni, as happens for other JRPG series, uses the high-sounding name that has been conquered over the years to baste a completely new story for each chapter, set in a totally new universe. So forget the witch of the first, the peaceful starting village, our child protagonist and the hateful familiars. All is replaced by a world in which there is a very tenuous peace between the five main kingdoms that govern it. The very title of the game: ~The fate of a kingdom~, is a more than unequivocal signal to understand how everything revolves around the geopolitical structure of the world in which we find ourselves. After an extremely cryptic initial scene that seems to closely remind us of the threats looming over our real world, we find ourselves catapulted into the kingdom of Gathmand, where Evan (son of the just assassinated King Leopold) is forced to flee to avoid being a victim of the blow of state sorted by the faithful adviser of his beloved father. With this rather unexpected premise for a JRPG that would seem to focus on extremely lighter topics, a long and substantial campaign opens. We cannot hide that, in some situations, we have perceived Level 5's desire to stretch the stock a little too much, probably to avoid ending up with a main quest considered too short; but it must still be said that when the plot works, it does wonders. The search for one's father's memory and the determination to unite the whole world under one umbrella is masterfully accomplished, with the help of the genius of the artists who have brought each of the elements on the screen to life. If we combine this with the great freedom that the ~multi-kingdom~ approach has allowed in terms of themes, which range from love to friendship, from fidelity to betrayal, it is obvious how the plot of Ni No Kuni II can still be praised as a whole, net of some poorly understood choices and a final twist (before the post-credits one), which in reality definitely leaves the time it finds. Certainly forget the plot of a Kingdom Hearts but, apart from some inconsistencies, we are sure that you will enjoy the journey that Ni No Kuni II will have to offer you, at least as much as we did. Shifts are not for me There was a time when JRPG was all about turn-based combat, tactics, elaborate thinking, and lots (lots... lots) of breaks. Over time, the market has evolved and with it the software houses have tried to keep up with the times. Level 5 has always been one of the studios that has most attempted to vary its game systems and with the first Ni No Kuni I fielded a hybrid that, to be honest, didn't even work very well: the combat system was dull and soon it boiled down to a few simple options. The new chapter in the series abandons any strategic ambitions to move to pure action. The dual nature of the title, devoted to the present but with flashes of an exploration system reminiscent of Final Fantasy VIII, means that nostalgia for the past blends perfectly with the freshness of an immediate but rather fun combat system. Therefore, if the dungeons and cities are reproduced with the unmistakable feature of the Ghibli studio, the open map is transformed into a super deformed world made up of reproduced landscapes.you on an extremely small scale compared to the characters and monsters that populate it. While in the first case the clashes are immediate and are activated in the vicinity of the enemies themselves, who are all already visible on the map, when you are in an open field it will be enough to touch a single opponent to break up the action and find yourself on a battle scenario filled with the most varied types of monsters. Thanks to a really immediate and well thought out rapid travel system, and loading close to non-existent, the work on the elimination of dead times carried out by Level 5 is absolutely commendable. Each clash is based on a few simple actions, which however can give more than one satisfaction. As happens in a classic action, there are two keys assigned to standard and heavy attacks, with which it becomes easier to stun your opponent. The continuous or alternating pressure of these two keys allows the chaining of combos and a constant increase in damage inflicted on one's enemies. With the circle it is possible to jump (and also attack while jumping), while with the backbones it is possible to roll, parry and launch magical attacks. The latter are of two different types: the standard ones are nothing more than the replacement of the ranged attacks, while by pressing R2 and one of the four frontal ones, it is possible to cast a spell among those equipped (there are many, with their variants and all individually potential in the appropriate emporium). To conclude the roundup of options remains the X, delegated to the interaction with the Cioffi, small sprites who broadly replace the familiars of the first title but which fortunately require much less attention and mainly act as support in battle, through actions and particular skills, as well as the activation of some elemental parameters to attacks. We are talking about a hundred different creatures, all of which can be recruited and upgraded several times. As for the equipment, each of the six heroes (the party in battle is always made up of the three chosen by you) can count on pieces of armor, accessories and four active weapons: of these, three will be melee ones and one for attacks at a distance. Every time you score a hit, a percentage increases the power of your weapon which, once it reaches 100%, allows you to cast stronger spells, to then be automatically changed to one of the others equipped. However, we cannot fail to report what is the main problem of the title, which also partially afflicted the first: the difficulty. Ni No Kuni II is a simple game, sometimes almost frustrating for how problematic it is to be able to lose consciousness. Just think that in all of our run, we were not able to see a single game over screen despite the fact that the final boss was 17 levels higher than ours. The positive decision to insert a limit on consumable items for each individual fight is not enough, and as fun as it is, you will hardly be able to find an adequately high degree of challenge in Ni No Kuni II. All this is a great pity, especially in relation to a series of advanced contents which are still too easy to entice you to complete each task. The world is Mine Needless to go around it, Ni No Kuni II is full of activities to be completed. One of the most important, which will make some happy and others bored, is the need to create your own kingdom. Level 5 has included a real game in the game, which will be able to take away a disproportionate amount of hours and which loudly recalls the management software that is so popular on mobile in recent years. Being Evan a king exiled from his own kingdom, he soon decides to found a new one together with his companions. Rather than confronting us with an automatic growth of the charming Eostaria, the developers have decided to give us the burden and the honor of being ourselves to give splendor to the kingdom. Starting from four huts and a wooden chair, through the enlistment of new talents and the accumulation of resources, it will be possible to increase the level of your structures more and more and expand the borders of the kingdom. Although it may seem like a simple pastime to lengthen an already watered-down broth, it must be said that the system works properly and, since the growth of the kingdom is linked to the possibilities offered by the gameplay, we soon find ourselves scraping together the necessary for the will to upgrade the forge or the armory (so you can create and upgrade your own paraphernalia), or spend your coins to unlock new Cioffi, or still use the savings to lower the cost of resources from the merchants. The possibilities are so many and cso deep that you will hardly get bored in this mode, except for the need to wait for the accumulation of real coins for the conclusion of the research, separate from the standard ones and totally dedicated to management. For those who are probably scared just to name the mobile experiences of this genre, we reassure you by saying that there is no type of multiplayer or even microtransactions. The Field Battles Another of the modes present in Ni No Kuni II, which blends well with the rest of the gameplay and which adds even more content to the total, is the Pitched Battle. As already mentioned, the whole title is based on the desire to found a kingdom and for this reason Level 5 has fielded a method that broadly recalls pitched battles for the conquest of the territory. By recruiting new talents for your city (through one of the game's hundreds of side-quests), it is possible that some of them bring their own armies with them and that it is possible to deploy them in battle. These clashes (the only ones on which it is also possible to choose a difficult mode) turn out to be a hybrid between a strategic one with an isometric view (complete with skills that can be launched after consuming a certain amount of one's action points) and a classic Chinese morra. There are different types of troops, and each of them has an advantage and a disadvantage with the other two respective. It will be up to you, through the pressure of the backbones and the rotation of the troops around Evan, to decide how to proceed to lose as few men as possible and reach your destination. Although it often turns out to be quite confusing, the pitched battle remains a decent extra to have fun with between one monster and another. Above all, it is pleasing to see how everything is well placed in context, both narratively and in terms of gameplay, making each mechanic important to be known to complete the adventure. A world full of colors We come to one of the features most loved by those who were enchanted by the beauty of the first chapter. Let's immediately reassure the skeptics regarding the general care placed in the creation of character and enemy models. The style of the Ghibli studio (which we remember not being personally involved but only with some exponents enlisted as individuals) is always very recognizable. It is impossible not to notice those pastel colors that are so full but melancholic at the same time, which have characterized the entire long history of Miyazaki's studio. We cannot hide from you that overall, especially with regard to 3D environments and open world maps, perhaps the general quality of the artistic impact has dropped slightly, where the general technical aspect is clearly better. The game world, which can be explored first on foot and then by other means which we do not want to reveal to you, is alive and full of areas to discover and in which you would not arrive except through your free exploration. The map is large enough to allow for a good variety of environments and biomes, ranging from forest to desert, to large snowy expanses. Each of the five major cities in the world closely resembles one of the cultures that distinguish ours and, not wanting to spoil anything about the plot, we will stop here, to avoid giving you information about creatures and ~gods~ that it is right you can discover for yourself . From a purely technical point of view, Ni No Kuni II performs very well. In more than sixty hours it will have happened just a couple of times to notice some slight drop, but nothing to be scared of and that would not resolve itself in a fraction of a second. The soundtrack, like the visually stunning aspect, is a flagship of the production. Each area, each city and each different situation can boast of a theme dedicated to it. All extremely spot on and capable of getting into your head in just a few minutes. What unfortunately leaves a bad taste in the mouth is the very small amount of cutscenes: it would almost seem that the budget in this sense was smaller than the first chapter, but it is probably precisely the lack of the most famous animation studio in Japan that has directed the team towards reducing animated scenes. This, together with the small amount of dubbed dialogue, is a real shame and will make more than one enthusiast turn up their noses.", "date": "2018-03-19", "grade": "9.0"}
