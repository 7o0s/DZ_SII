After the indicative examples of Modern Combat Sandstorm and NOVA, to extend this list this Zombie Infection has recently arrived on the App Store, a survival horror more than evidently taken from Capcom's Resident Evil 5. Chris!!! Oh no, it's you Damien... In reality, the choice of the transalpine house is absolutely not to be condemned a priori, especially in the specific case: in fact, on the iPhone the ~official~ Resident Evil is nothing more than a watered down and disappointing reduced version of the fourth chapter, created by a still incapable Capcom, with the exception of the excellent Street Fighter IV, to make a strong contribution to the catalog of Cupertino platforms. So we can certainly say that the spirit of Gameloft was to fill a gap, for the happiness of all lovers of the survival horror genre; having said that, it is also true that the replication of protagonists, enemies and settings is truly sensational, to the point of making people smile on more than one occasion. The heroes of the moment are a couple formed by special agent Damien Sharpe and reporter Alex Rayne, sent to Brazil to shed light on unethical experiments by the usual unscrupulous corporation. Too bad that since the helicopter disembarkation things immediately go much worse than expected, with a population reduced to the state of zombies that are anything but friendly. If so far there are already many dj vu, observing the construction of the theater village on the first level, truly sensational copying peaks are reached, probably capable of surpassing even those seen with the aforementioned NOVA; fortunately continuing in the game the tenor changes slightly with locations occasionally a little less ~Capcomian~, but at the same time also less inspired and technically pleasing. Nonetheless, Zombie Infection always remains a pleasing product to the eye, with a high level of detail and a good polygonal complexity; the weak points are to be found fundamentally in the animations, which are all too woody and simple. The gameplay, on the other hand, finds its balance in a focus shifted more towards the component of the fights rather than the puzzles, the latter present sporadically and with situations always and in any case of a disarming simplicity. The clashes with human zombies or animals of various kinds therefore constitute the predominant part within the 12 available levels; sticks and virtual keys allow good control of the character, which combined with the laser sight and the possibility of moving while shooting give a minimum of dynamism to the clashes, however never particularly exciting. Unfortunately, the monotonous progression of Zombie Infection affects the final result, since you find yourself roughly doing nothing but going through the levels (all very linear) eliminating the enemies present from time to time, until you reach the boss. The narrative weakness certainly does not help to resolve everything; if it is true that part of the charm of survival horror lies in the B-Movie plot, it is also true that an excessive dose of clichs and poorly characterized characters certainly does not help.
