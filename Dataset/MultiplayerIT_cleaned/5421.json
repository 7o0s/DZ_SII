Therefore, the decision by Disney to pull the plug on the Disney Infinity project after three episodes that have in any case consolidated a robust fanbase and achieved good sales success cannot be considered a surprise in the absolute sense: products belonging to the genre of ~ toys to life~ are very demanding to sustain financially given the increasingly consistent ecosystem of figurines and related accessories, and the project conceived by Avalanche Software had enormous ambitions that had led to development costs perhaps considered excessive, also given the involvement of numerous other support team. Among other things, the decision not to make a new episode for 2016 had already sounded an alarm bell, which then materialized in the saddest and most severe way. The adventure of Disney Infinity 3.0, after the many contents dedicated to Star Wars, Marvel and Disney, therefore closes with a last Play Set focused on the film ~Finding Dory~ by Pixar, to be released in Italian cinemas on September 15th but already present in US theaters since mid-June. The Play Set based on the latest Pixar film represents the farewell to the Disney Infinity series Fish to save First of all, don't worry if you haven't seen the film yet and are afraid of spoilers: exactly as happened with Inside/Out, even in this case the points of contact between game and film are rather tenuous, and certainly not enough to ruin a subsequent visit to the cinema. The fact is that the Oceanographic Park has undergone a sudden flood which made all the fish flee; once they know of the problem, Dory, Nemo and Marlin decide to run to their aid, so as to bring them back to safety before the tanks are drained. The Play Set is basically divided into two main sections: one, set in a calm seabed of a bay which represents the home base, to be populated precisely with the fish saved around the levels and to be enriched and customized with structures, buildings and decorations . In this case, the gameplay is based on a 3D mechanic with a third-person view behind the protagonist, therefore with a certain freedom of movement which, however, is not supported perfectly by the camera, a bit lazy and unwilling to make itself available of the exploration of the environment, especially in the tightest changes of direction. Considering the absence of enemies and dangers, it is a defect that all in all can be absorbed without too much difficulty. For the rest, the sections inside the bay are certainly more relaxed, with a calm and calm pace, decidedly different from that of the rest of the game. The ~normal~ levels of Finding Dory are in fact based on a more easily manageable 2D action/adventure mechanic, which in fact proves to be more satisfying when tested. In this case the Play Set shows its best thanks to a compact and dry structure, which requires the player to cross levels in a mostly linear way, starting from point A to get to B. The main purpose is to recover the as many fish as possible, while solving simple puzzles and fighting enemies who are never too fierce. That it is a game mainly aimed at children is therefore more than evident, nevertheless a poor quality production is not hidden behind this choice: the level design is in fact well studied, certainly never surprising but in any case beyond the threshold of dignity. The possibility of using helpers (a cuttlefish, a shrimp and a crab), to be unlocked during the adventure, then allows you to add further gameplay solutions that increase the overall variety. The combat system then rests on a pair of skills to be used often in combination: the bubble with which to trap enemies can be followed by the blow of the tail, so as to launch the bubble itself against some elements to be destroyed. The levels also enjoy a fair replay value, in the face of the stimulus to collect all the objects and complete the side missions available. From a technical point of view Finding Dory is a more than pleasant product, obviously strong in an original material of absolute quality that derives from the work of Pixar. Certainly the richness of details and the care in the creation of the settings is not even remotely on the same level, but the atmosphere and style have been preservedlargely. It should be noted that, as happened with Marvel Battlegrounds, this Play Set also brings with it, at the price of around 30, the miniature to unlock the adventure and only one statuette, obviously Dory, to which Nemo can also be added is sold separately. However, there are no particular differences between the two, in the face of practically overlapping capabilities. Ultimately, it certainly cannot be considered that Finding Dory represents an exit from the scene with a bang for Disney Infinity, also because it was certainly not thought of as the conclusive content of the franchise. However, it is a pleasant Play Set considered precisely the target user to which it is addressed, capable of entertaining for a few hours, which enjoys the great quality of the original Pixar material by proposing simple gameplay but free from serious or macroscopic defects.", "date": "2016-07-08", "grade": null}
