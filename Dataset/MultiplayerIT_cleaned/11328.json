{"name": "Kung Fu Panda", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/kung-fu-panda_a.html", "text": "After the various Shrek and Madagascar, the types of DreamWorks have churned out a new cartoon in computer graphics, taking up the classic theme of anthropomorphic animals and combining it with martial arts. The protagonist of the story is Po, a panda who dabbles in kung fu but every day he has to deal with what people think of him, his species, namely that they are fat, lazy and slow animals. A fighting tournament is held in the city which will decide which of the most worthy warriors will have the task of stopping the advance of Tai Lung, a character as powerful as he is evil, who according to the premonitions of the old master Oogway is about to escape from the prison in which it was locked up years before. Po ~surprise~ enters the tournament, and his arrival is interpreted a bit as a ~divine sign~, so much so that Oogway decides to entrust him with the important task of countering Tai Lung... In this mobile reduction, Kung Fu Panda is presented as an action game full of platform elements, divided into ten stages in which we will not only control the panda Po, but also his nemesis Tai Lung. It all begins with a sort of tutorial, which teaches us how to master a really simple and immediate control system: the joystick allows you to move the character and jump, while the 5 key is used to deliver blows (on the ground, in air or while crouched), which turn into powerful combos with continued pressure. The levels are quite well characterized, with the scenery changing as the story progresses and a number of different situations to deal with. Being a mobile game, the brevity of the stages combines well with an impromptu and short-lived use. The problem is that, in this way, completing the game turns into an all too easy undertaking, which also succeeds on the first attempt and does not take more than half an hour. In the role of one or the other character, we will be faced with enemies of different nature and size, capable of attacking but rarely dangerous: usually it is enough to take the measures well or make a jump at the right moment to be able to eliminate them without losing even some vital energy. The locations are filled with items to collect, mostly bonuses or food. The overabundance of the latter indicates a balance of the wrong difficulty or clearly aimed at a very young user. The technical realization of the game is decent, with the main characters dominating: both Po and Tai Lung are well drawn and have decent, if anything but smooth, animation. Let's say that the graphics are typical of video games that aim more at maximum compatibility than at achieving who knows what technical results. Proof of this is the quality of the backgrounds, which differentiate one stage from another but are very often poor and repetitive in the graphic elements. In short, this is not a disastrous result, but there is much better around, even with regard to tie-ins. The control system, as mentioned above, is very simple and immediate, responds promptly to inputs and does not suffer from any particular problems: you can move the character, fight and jump without any particular effort.
