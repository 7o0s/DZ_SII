The underlying philosophy of Basketball Stars is quite simple and refers to the reality of American suburban playgrounds, where semi-professional players challenge each other for money in a completely clandestine way, just like Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson did in the film ~Who doesn't jump white is ~. In this case the element of competition is provided by the multiplayer nature of the title created by Miniclip, which in terms of mechanics is a real clone of Basketball Kings and who knows how many other basketball games available on the App Store and Google Play, but he manages to make good use of his cards and to offer a fair variety despite the only two modes available, ~Shots~ and ~Attacker-Defender~. In both cases, whoever scores the most points wins from the point of view of a limited number of shots, but if the first mode sees the two players side by side targeting the basket, the second offers interesting strategic implications, given that in turn a player must shoot and the other player must try to stop him by blocking the ball or stealing it. There are many variables, it is possible to make side feints and rejects, so in the end this part of the experience turns out to be the most successful and interesting. Basketball Stars is a simple and fun casual basketball game based only on online challenges stop for a while It is no coincidence that we were talking about the competitive nature of Basketball Stars: the game is completely based on one-on-one multiplayer in real time, and for each single ~scenario~ of the two modes the number of users available on the net is indicated. After all, just open the application to go online, there is no dedicated section and this translates into a matchmaking that is always rather quick and effective, which during our tests did not highlight any problems, early exits or episodes of excessive latency . The similarities with the aforementioned Basketball Kings are immediately evident, given that on the left side of the screen there is a vertical indicator for the power of the shot, an indicator that we will have to try to respect while we draw an upward line with our finger to make a jump jump. There is a minimum of tolerance with respect to absolute values, but above all it is possible to buy bullets that guarantee different bonuses in terms of reliability and accuracy, which will obviously make us more competitive. To unlock the various customizations we will have to collect two types of currency, dollars and gold bars, both obtainable by winning games, obviously with a much narrower distribution of seconds, which can be purchased via in-app purchase by putting your wallet in hand. But be careful: to participate in the challenges in the three different scenarios (Underdogs Court, Venice Beach and Venice Nights, for the moment) you will need to invest money and therefore risk running out of banknotes when you lose more games. Fortunately, there is no shortage of daily bonuses, and they will always ensure that we have a fair amount of autonomy. On the technical implementation front, there isn't much to say: the impact of the ball has been well valued and the polygonal models boast a fair level of detail, as well as the settings, but in the field of sports productions we have seen much better.", "date": "2016-03-05", "grade": "7.2"}
