And yet, those who don't appreciate the French group's declared policy of copying the atmospheres, aesthetics and game mechanics of the most famous franchises have almost always decided to pass the round without giving even a chance to its products for iPhone and iPad . The recent Rainbow Six: Shadow Vanguard is certainly not an original title, but if nothing else in the eyes of the players it did not appear as a shameless attempt to mimic Halo or Call of Duty, allowing many to approach it in a less unwilling way, and Gameloft of experience a more tactical and complex approach than in the past. Tactic out of control Faithfully to the other chapters of the Rainbow Six series, Shadow Vanguard is a tactical shooter in which the management of your team is fundamental. As a member of the Rainbow Alpha team, the player finds himself facing a series of missions around the world, in urban and non-urban environments: ranging from rescuing hostages in an embassy to avoiding a dam explosion , passing through hostile villages in Africa or contaminated laboratories. Moving with a virtual stick and aiming at enemies with the help of both the touchscreen and the gyroscope is certainly nothing new for those who are not new to FPS made specifically for iOS devices, but having to give orders to your teammates ends up complicating things . And quite a lot, too. The actions that the team can perform are indicated by some contextual icons present in the scenario and which must be touched with extreme precision. A green button to either side of a door indicates that teammates can cover up and prepare to clear the room, while tapping the stun grenade symbol instructs them to fire a flashbang before entering. Usually the player is led to use the fiberscope to look beyond a door, and perhaps indicate to his companions the order in which to attack the enemies, but the level of strategic depth offered by Shadow Vanguard remains quite low even when, after the fourth mission, you get the ability to set team attack priority at any point in the mission. Unfortunately, giving orders in the middle of a firefight is far from easy, and even often you end up touching an icon by mistake, shooting in an attempt to move the view or accidentally sending your companions into the open. Shooting, moving, crouching, aiming, switching weapons or throwing grenades - the crowded player HUD only amplifies the problem, and so there are always too many elements on the screen to interact with. What was a more than satisfactory control system in Modern Combat 2 becomes a real nightmare when you have to manage two other companions, demonstrating that, despite the excellent results obtained so far, more complex and articulated genres such as tactical shooters they can hardly adapt to an interface full of limitations like that of the iPhone. In the cooperative mode, the AI in the team is replaced by real people, but the result, paradoxically, is even worse: not only does the match abruptly stop if one of the players disconnects, but the absence of a voice chat it makes each mission much less tactical. Multiplayer also offers a deathmatch option, although the game has inherited the poor layout of respawn points from Gameloft's previous FPSs. While waiting for the transalpine giant to reveal its first games made with the Unreal Development Kit, Shadow Vanguard still looks very good, with very detailed graphics but which in the exterior and in the vegetation loses comparison with NOVA 2. good technical realization is counterbalanced, however, by a poor AI of the enemies, who limit themselves to cover when possible and never try to get around the player and his companions. Between one mission and another, the experience gained allows you to rank up and unlock new weapons, gadgets and upgrades, but unfortunately the game does little or nothing to encourage the use of other weapons: smoke bombs, flash bangs, guns assault and machine guns can be equipped either at the start of a game or at one of the many lockers scattered throughout the scenario, but having an optical sight on your tactical pistol is more of an embellishment than a real advantage in battle.
