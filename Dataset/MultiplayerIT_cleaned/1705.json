{"name": "Crimson Sea", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/crimson-sea-2.html", "text": "Love Vs Hate!!!! In addition to the various upgrades that you can purchase for your character, there is an element of no less importance: all the characters you meet during the game (to be saved or not), will join you in the fight against the invader, increasing if nothing else the chances of victory in the most critical situations. You can control up to five different characters (one at a time, of course). The computer-guided parties will do quite well, the implemented artificial intelligence does its duty, without exaggerating, but it proves to be effective. There is an editor where you can choose which character to use at any time and increase skills. Among the skills we find the inevitable spells, which will be the prerogative of only some of the characters in your possession. Each warrior will act differently: some will fight with white weapons, some with firearms, some with magical evocations, some with both. The design of the characters is original and inspired, as is that of the aliens and settings. Futuristic, but with an eye to nature, given that the multiple metal structures arise in beautiful and boundless green expanses. The controls are simple and immediate: one key to jump, two more for the different types of attack (sword and pistol). The only annoyance in the controls could lie in the automatic aiming system, which does not always reflect the optimal aim for that particular moment. You may find yourself shooting at an insect that is three kilometers away, while there is one right next to you. In this case, the sword will be very useful. Love Vs Hate!!!! Player engagement is good, but not great. There are well-crafted cutscenes that will gradually reveal the developments of the plot. The action only becomes frenetic when the screen is invaded by myriads of aliens, but the player will find the title rewarding above all for exploring the levels in search of as many objects and money as they can obtain to strengthen his team. 3D or not 3D....that's the question! Koei has never been famous for games with amazing polygon graphics, but this time I have to change my mind. The characters have been modeled with skill and care, you hardly see such beautiful ones. And it's not just the inspired design, but just the amount of polygons used. During the cut-scenes in real time (not FMV) the programmers, risking plagiarizing the Squaresoft productions (the characters' faces might seem plagiarized, but after all, that's the Japanese style) joined this last, managing in some cases even to overcome it. Certainly thanks to the powerful hardware that resides in the Xbox. Love Vs Hate!!!! Everything is softer, more fluid, the characters move naturally almost as if they were produced in FMV, the animations are realistic, they never give the feeling that some kind of robot is moving, and the complete absence of aliasing is noticeable. Unfortunately, the rendering of the characters fails during the actual game, even if the graphics engine does not lose frame-rate even in the most crowded situations. If they had spent more time developing, they would have exploited the characteristics of the hardware more fully and there would not have been this sudden drop in quality between movies and game. On the other hand, the aliens during the game are made much better. This does not mean that graphically the game is bad, on the contrary, only that much more is expected from Xbox. The lighting effects are top-notch, with dynamic reflections and shadows and lighting that refract both onto the scenery and onto the characters. A special mention goes in favor of the special effect ~Terminator2~. Several monsters between one section and another have the same liquid consistency as the famous T1000 from the film described above: a feast for the eyes, well done Koei! Love Vs Hate!!!! Collisions are almost perfect, you will never see your character's polygons mix with anything on screen. A small negative note on the camera, which is not free, and always turns so that we can see our team's backs. The annoyance is generated by the sudden change of the shot every time we turn right or left inside a structure. This doesn't happen in the outdoor sections, or at least, it's not noticeable. Koei, because it's you, Koei ! The obvious final comments this time will be less verbose than usual: there is little to criticize about this production, but little to praise. Crimson Sea is one of those games that lies in the middle: either you immediately get passionate about it, or you discard it a priori, maybe forr heard from a friend who tried it. It certainly isn't a game to play for a three-minute game, because you don't understand its meaning without at least having completed the first level (which is a sort of tutorial). It is not a superficial game, but not very deep either. It's not a game that will require all of your spare time to finish (about 10 hours to finish, with quite a few weapons and skills), but it's not short either. It's not mediocre, but it's not a masterpiece either. It's fun, but it can get boring at times. It's a little different than usual, but this could prove to be a double-edged sword. Try it before you buy it, but not superficially: you might regret not bringing it home! PROS: + Atypical + Jappo style a go go CONS: - Technically not excellent - Camera not perfect Love Vs Hate!!!! Why this title, you will say! Well, because Crimson Sea is one of those games that caused discussion and divided the ~sources of videogame thought~. Disproportionately loved by Japanese critics moderately awarded in the West. I never like to talk about votes, but it is a ~figurative~ way to give an idea of the different criticism that has obtained the aforementioned title. Crimson Sea is a game that can give the feeling of deja vu, but that's only the initial impression. The structure of the title is similar to that already seen in Dynasty Warriors, but has substantial differences that make it a product in itself. It looks like an action, but it is also a shooter and winks at fantasy by combining some rpg elements to upgrade the character. Set in an undefined future, the game initially takes place in an Earth space colony; you will have to clean up the game areas infested by different alien entities. The forms of alien life are many: huge insects, blobs in the form of cyclops, giant parasites .... all ready to kill you. The beauty of Crimson Sea is that you don't have to just shoot like hell and kill as many monsters as you can; you will have to collect objects and coins that can be acquired by destroying the surrounding scenery. Initially you will have a laser pistol for ranged attacks, and a sword for melee attacks. Continuing the adventure, the character will need more firepower, and thanks to the objects and coins collected, it will be possible to upgrade weapons or buy new ones.", "date": "2003-03-27", "grade": null}
