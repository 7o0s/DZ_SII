{"name": "Rising Kingdoms", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rising-kingdoms.html", "text": "Few but heroes The attempt to mix the more traditional concept of real-time strategy with the soul of RPGs is undeniable and commendable, made up of narration, fearless heroes, enemies with unpronounceable names and a bestiary that does not know natural selection. The result is somewhere in between that perhaps doesn't do justice to the sources of inspiration, but is still interesting. The action is always centered on a character who initially has to face various missions to continue along the way and obtain the resources necessary for the construction of buildings or to gain control of posts already present in the area. In fact, in Rising Kingdoms the heroes are the fulcrum of the action and for each race there are four to choose from, with very numerous and extremely destructive powers and abilities. The troops revolve around them who see among their ranks numerous extras equipped with unique abilities, including innovative creatures introduced by the developers in order to broaden the horizon of Equiada. The use of the main characters is very interesting because if on the one hand with the money and resources that you will be able to get you will be able to erect new buildings to feed your war force, the growth of the heroes is however linked to the accumulation of points -glory, which derive from the capture of enemy colonies, as a result of territorial expansion or for successfully completing certain tasks. Spending these credits grants you access to an ever-growing number of abilities and spells you can use to bend fate on the battlefield, ranging from healing your men to the devastating call of a dragon. It is interesting to note how the greatness of the power exhibited by the heroes corresponds to a general balance of the game, which does not go too far but on the contrary gives the aura of legend to the champions without depriving the troops of the offensive power they deserve. Speaking of the races in the game, it is important to underline that the world of Equiada is actually populated by five other neutral factions, among which trolls and dragons militate and which play a key role in the strategic component of Rising Kingdoms. In fact, by taking possession of the colonies, you can access their precious resources, also being able to draw on exclusive skills for your heroes; the construction of new structures and the conquest of neutral settlements thus become the cornerstones of the management part that every real-time strategy game stages. So much richness would seem to prelude a great strategy game but unfortunately the reality is much simpler, in the sense that the very poverty of the actual action heavily destabilizes the background system. In fact, the necessary complexity is lacking in terms of actions that can orchestrate a real management of the units extended to multiple components, while one ends up focusing on the use of a few specific characters, when the screen is crowded in the meantime with a multi-variegated swarm of creatures that look like more to the sack of Rome than to a strategically oriented army. They are points of view and the imaginative scenario grants it, but the low CPU capacity combined with very few lean controls, which among other things do not prevent your troops from assaulting anyone who comes within range or by nose (in fact, here there are also the werewolves), make the fight unsatisfactory and at times trivial. We therefore end up dealing more with how to obtain points necessary for the enhancement of our avatars rather than thinking about controlling the army, even if this does not mean a hasty resolution of the missions, which on the contrary require a good planning. Low budget: low cost? It would be nice if there was a flash on the visual side capable of doing justice to the rich world of Equida, but the graphics engine for the two-dimensional management of the backgrounds rests on its predecessors. If you have already tested a title that bears the Black Bean brand, you will recognize many technical gimmicks already seen and reviewed for the landscape animations, as well as the same actions of the units are a bit wooden, especially if we consider the progress achieved by the latest generation games . However, the design of the creatures remains to carry the flag high, giving the characters an intriguing and well-made appeal. In addition to the possibility of customizing the campaign and the presence of an interesting editor, the inevitable multiplayer component is usable, complete with the option to search for opponents of the same level. Naturally, the commentary totally localized in Italian does not hurt, which, however sporadic, is passionate and credible. Of note are some very successful motifs obscured only by fished out sound effects in some old archive, while the budget price is always an excellent incentive to buy, especially when there is a game like Rising Kingdoms underneath, which, although lacking in great merits, does not fail to present itself as a complete product. Comment Rising Kingdoms tries to mix a real fantasy universe within a gameplay that rests on the foundations of real-time strategy and despite a somewhat simplistic tactical component, brings into play numerous races with many different creatures. The centrality of the heroes points towards a gameplay oriented towards the individual units and the action directly managed by the player, renouncing a greater articulation of the clash, which opposes the very articulated and engaging mission structure. Too bad for the outdated graphic rendering and for the ingenuity that afflict a game system rich in presentation but without solid and in any case dated foundations. Despite this, we still have a finished product in our hands that walks on its own legs and boasts some original gimmicks, perhaps more suitable for those looking for the thrill of a fantasy world or who love RPGs rather than a strategy-oriented audience. The reduced price is still worth the thought for both. Pros: Creature-rich universe Numerous skills available Fulfilling quests Cons: Technically dated Naive strategy component Lumbering controls and interface If god is dead then all is fair Black Bean takes the field again with a strategic title, which abandons the gloomy scenarios of the Second World War to indulge in a more naive traditional fantasy setting. Even before diving into the world of Equiada (name for a fantasy world in which any phoneme is allowed to baptize places and people), one cannot spare a praise for the game's packaging. It is in fact a beautiful box set with a luxurious manual and moreover sold at a reduced price, a style lesson for the many great titles accompanied only by two advertising leaflets. That said, however, the substance of this Rising Kingdoms does not exactly correspond to the great premises, which runs a little too much on the worn-out tracks of its predecessors, but which proves to be a sincere product made with love. So let's paint the background with the narration so dear to the RPG tradition, which sees three great races on stage including the Humans, custodians of culture and technology, the Forest Inhabitants (yes, they are really the elves) , irreplaceable gardeners of Mother Earth and finally the filthy and always feared Inhabitants of Darkness, keepers of the secrets that separate the living from the dead. Contrary to what one might think, there was a time in which all three sides coexisted without strong friction, but the sinister disappearance of the gods threw humans into chaos, and without a sanctioning god they gave free rein to the ignorance that characterizes: from that moment it was war for peace or for the definitive end of Equiada. You will not be surprised to know that Rising Kingdoms provides three campaigns associated with the warring races, all available at launch but ordered in sequence according to increasing difficulty level. If you don't fear the challenge you can start directly from the last one, but the coherence of the story and the rich tutorial of the human scenario are excellent incentives to start from the beginning, so fire to the dust and to death nudist elves and undead!", "date": "2005-07-14", "grade": null}
