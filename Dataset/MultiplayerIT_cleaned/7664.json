Just when massive titles are needed to boost sales of its flagship, Kyoto chooses to refresh the hot Wii U summer with the most imaginative title ever produced by Platinum Games. To understand the genesis of the present paradox, take us on a step back in time: more than a decade has passed since the days of Capcom's Fabulous Five, when that bombshell announcement in November 2002 shook the chairs of the owners of the small Nintendo cube. Five projects by the Osaka publisher exclusive to the machine, with Shibata, Mikami, Suda, Kamiya and Kato engaged in the caravan of wonders. There are those who say that dreams must be confronted with harsh reality, and it took Capcom little time to adopt the bitter philosophy. The succulent package, in fact, never saw the light in the form it should have had, and the weak sales figures of GameCube prompted Captive Communications (aka Capcom) to change its plans: one of the projects was canceled and many of the remaining they went cross-platform. The publisher followed the strict guideline a few years later: at the end of 2006, the corporate board of directors closed Clover Studio, container of most of the names behind the Fabulous project and responsible for Viewtiful Joe, Okami and God Hand. Three niche brands, far from being commercial successes, but still powerfully in the hearts of gamers of the time today, thanks to the undisputed quality of the productions. It was at that moment that the Japanese talents of Clover decided to leave Osaka, in search of a place to carry on their visions and mature the wealth of experience they had gathered. Platinum Games, the studio behind The Wonderful 101, is the final product of the story we have told you; it took Nintendo, as publisher, to review the talented team to indulge themselves with its best repertoire. Quality, ideas and a lot of courage: this is the Rising Sun we always want. Friends of art The moral of what has been said exactly represents the strengths and weaknesses of the new Platinum title. The Wonderful 101 is a concentration of old and new concepts that choose Nintendo hardware to blend together, while the duo Kamiya-Inaba orchestrate their own unique development topics, here elevated to new heights of stylistic extravagance. The vibrant artistic choice goes well with the qualities of the AMD Custom mounted by Wii U: the textures and colors are bright, clean, rich and with a level of saturation that makes every corner pleasant. Of course, as far as polygons are concerned, we are not dealing with end-of-generation miracles, and the weak anti-aliasing filter implemented only partially masks a few too many playlists. You can't expect much more from a title that enters the market not even a year after the release of the machine; analyzing it as a whole, the sum of the parts largely covers that tiny set of technical inaccuracies. On the other hand, the fluid flow of frames never tires, especially if you combine it with the frantic action of The Wonderful 101; we'd like to say that the screen refresh is always pegged at 60 frames per second, but sadly we can't. Platinum has chosen to create advanced situations in which the multitude of enemies on the screen considerably strains the game engine, sometimes slowing down the progress of the action. Honestly, we would have appreciated a less ambitious but more coherent choice: it's a bit out of place to enjoy a largely fluid game and then find yourself some sequences in which the lack of optimization causes the number of frames to collapse. We are sure that everything derives exclusively from a lack of improvement of the individual situations, which could have been managed by better balancing the level of polygons deployed on the field, without overdoing it. It might seem like the proverbial hair in the egg, but calculating the commitment of Platinum Games productions, this aspect clashes quite a bit with their philosophy. Fortunately, the Japanese guys know how to stand out: the greatest artistic praise certainly goes to the character, mecha and boss design. The characterization of every single supporting actor in the Wonderful army is detailed and, in the case of the main characters, also successful on a psychological level: the interlude skits highlight a certain care in proposing relationships of friendship, hatred, love and hilarity, helped from a well packaged dub. Platinum has also chosen to characterize most of the enemies, allowing them to evolve their appearance as the fight continues. In ~Bayonetta tradition~, the bosses of Wonderful 101 draw heavily on Kamiya's cinematic tradition, which leads to epic showdownsand very varied, thanks to the playful peculiarities of the title. Curiosity The Wonderful 101 is a concentrate of quotations. In addition to the self-referential ones (Viewtiful Joe, Okami, Killer7) the work from which it draws its inspiration most is Power Rangers and more generally from the Japanese genre of Super Sentai (literally, Super Teams). Movements, suits, mechs: everything refers to the canons drawn by the mangaka Shotaro Ishinomori, in which teams of colorful heroes fight to defend the Earth from enemies from outer space. Just Kamiya, in a tweet, confirmed that the nature of The Wonderful 101 is a cross between Pikmin and a Super Sentai. Wonderful Joe-Terasu Explaining the gameplay of a title like The Wonderful 101 is no small task. Apart from the apparent base action, the Platinum product is a cauldron of more or less successful ideas that blend together, without however being able to find a defined identity. Let's start with them, the Wonderful 101. The terrestrial army defending the planet from the invasion of the Geathjerk aliens is made up of terrestrials equipped with the usual, incredible suit that gives special powers. At the guide we will find Wonder Red, helped by the main characters represented by the colors of the rainbow (Blue, Green, etc.) and by secondary ones that we will be able to recruit around the levels; in reality, while waiting for the various required completions to enrich the list of Wonderful available, random civilians enlisted by Red and his companions will be able to join the group. The progress along the game sections has a watertight compartmentalized structure, with the beginning and end of the session geographically well defined; as per tradition, Platinum Games forces the player to provide high performance to have better grades at the end of the level and consequently more points to spend in the game shop, a factor which intrinsically increases its replayability. It is precisely at this moment that the legacy of the ex-Clover Studio enters the field: the combat system takes Viewtiful Joe's key evolutions to outline two attack combinations, one of the whole Wonderful team which will serve to weaken the enemy and make him lower his guard, the other of the main hero chosen for that fight. But can it all be summed up in a mere and frantic keystroke? No, obviously, and it is Amaterasu who intervenes to have her say: The Wonderful 101 takes up the interesting playful solution of Okami's wolf goddess and makes it her own, making it a focal element of the gameplay. We then return to drawing on the screen with the stick, tracing shapes, lines and diagonals to unleash the actions connected to them. In addition to being many, they will also be necessary: thanks to the continuous drawing of specific lines, we will be able to quickly call one of the seven Wonderful heroes into the field, each with its own weapon and attack, without a break. Ditto for all the other actions on which the progression is based: draw bridges, hang gliders, ladders, collect objects, enlist civilians in need of help and plug holes. Fun, ingenious, refreshing but also problematic. Colorful chaos The Wonderful 101 is a title full of dynamism but sometimes extremely confusing and stingy with suggestions. There will be rare occasions in which it will not be clear what is happening on the screen or others in which the first game will spend minutes if not half hours wondering what to do to overcome this or that environmental puzzle. Platinum has gone for an extremely hardcore, but often frustrating solution. In fact, it is not always clear what to do or the path to follow; if then everything fits into a furious or ill-expressed context, demoralizing anger is triggered. Even the window / palette is not always studied in the right way: sometimes out of phase with the pointer, it will not be uncommon to find yourself drawing lines outside the game screen and therefore, in a nutshell, totally at random. A bad mole for an extremely interesting concept that we hope will be taken up and improved. Platinum Games' art has never been afraid to show itself in its beauty, and in The Wonderful 101 the stylistic juxtaposition between cel-shading and a decidedly hardcore title makes you think. The reference to the past is clear, both in the technical realization and in the desire to mix visual extravagance with playful difficulty. The result is particular: on the one hand it seems to have in your hands a cartoon full of style, ironic, just out of a Japanese animation studio. On the other hand we find playful impositions which, combined with a fairly punitive degree of challenge, create a product not very suitable for easy nerves. In case of death you can try again as many times as you wantsidera, under penalty of lowering the score at the end of the level; with each attempt, both the life bar and the game ecosystem are restored to their initial conditions, but the same - inexplicably - does not apply to the bosses. At the default difficulty level this causes a slight humiliation to find yourself, after a demanding late stage of combat in which the scenario has been heavily changed, to lose your life, try again and find yourself as if nothing had happened, with only the boss to carry the wounds of the clash, often making its completion trivial. The wink, as Kamiya has stated in his recent interviews, is clearly squeezed for newbies, but the difficulty levels below the default one are all too accessible; we are not at the levels of Bayonetta's one-button automatic mode, but never forget that little effort also means less satisfaction. The inability to exploit the pool of moves that the system studied by Atsushi Inaba makes available does not allow the clashes to express their potential, which quickly changes into a refinement challenge at higher difficulties, available however only after a first completion of the adventure . A decidedly tangible downside. Launch window But the Gamepad, in all this, what is it for? In addition to supporting the off-TV play function, its primary use is as a game radar, in which the Wonderfuls of the army to be equipped are listed, each belonging to one of the military schools represented by the protagonists and with their own growing experience, or as a container of the menu on which to scroll with the stylus. And if drawing lines with analog doesn't seem like a practical solution, Platinum has included an alternative method: drawing directly on the resistive screen of the Gamepad. Inconvenient option, in reality, as the activation of the form still forces you to rely on the physical buttons, with a consequent loss of rhythm in carrying out the attack strategies. But that's not all: on some occasions Platinum has chosen to make it an actual game window with a unfortunately disappointing result. If already on a home LCD the title has to manage a considerable chaos on the screen, the phases on the Gamepad panel have the defect of amplifying the sense of confusion, with obvious problems of visual, action and composition of the drawings. What is not clear is why allowing, by pressing the - key, to play those theoretically exclusive phases of the Gamepad even on a home LCD. One wonders: but if you provide the ability to play them on a large screen, then why ideally push them to the small one? We are sure that this is a starting point to make the Gamepad the protagonist, everything simply still appears a bit immature. What satisfies, on the other hand, is certainly the longevity factor: contrary to the expectations that gave it for a short but intense adventure, The Wonderful 101 offers more options for returning to pick up the pad. The first adventure will take no less than a dozen hours, to which must be added the high replayability, the collectibles and the purchase of all the special moves sold in the game shop. The addition of secondary missions closes the circle, to be tackled in single or multiplayer with the help of Wiimote and Nunchuck. The Wonderful 101 is a breath of fresh air: fast, fun and varied, but not without flaws", "date": "2013-08-19", "grade": "8.5"}
