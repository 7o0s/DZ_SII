The goal always remains to find out what lies behind the epidemic that is plaguing the region, making women give birth to monstrous children and distorting the limbs of men. It is also necessary to understand what some of the appearances previously had mean, even if for the final revelations we will have to wait for the third chapter. To do this, the terrible inquisitor, with an increasingly irascible character, will have to find Father Jacinto Corona, another inquisitor who disappeared while carrying out his own mission. The game begins in the inn where we left Eymerich at the end of ~The Plague~. Waking up after rest, he will have to carry out some preliminary activities before being able to hunt down evil again. The very first puzzle requires you to sort through some drawings that fell from the diary with the inquisitor's notes. It is a good expedient to summarize some of the main facts of the first episode, synthetically represented in the drawings. Already here it is possible to verify the work done by the development team, the Italian TiconBlu of Ivan Venturi, to fix some of the problems that afflicted the previously used interface. Now the icons are arranged more rationally and the interaction with objects works better, even if in some cases the movement of the camera remained when the mouse is clicked on a hot spot, which causes the interaction to be lost and forces click again to make the icons reappear. However, this is a minor problem, given the progress made in other fields. The most evident novelty is the new three-dimensional model of Eymerich, much better than that of the past (it should be noted that it was also used to update the first episode) and decidedly more expressive. While this is a purely cosmetic adjustment, it's nice to know that some criticisms have been heard, without however distorting the game. Eymerich has arrived in Calcares. Will he be able to discover the origin of evil? Vessa the Plebs If you look on Facebook every now and then and frequent the right pages, you will surely know ~Feudalism and Liberty~, one of the funniest pages that has appeared in recent years. We mention them in this article because the dear scoundrels have collaborated with TiconBlu in the creation of ~Vessa la Plebe~, a mini-game included in Nicolas Eymerich the Inquisitor: The Village FEL Edition in which you have to go around the country in the role of a tax collector to squeeze money out of the people. Basically you have to click on the villagers purging them of their coins, but avoiding killing them. Understood the system it takes little to finish it. Sure, it lasts a few minutes, but it's particularly entertaining thanks above all to the voices of the FEL guys who do the dubbing, guys who also worked hard to write the texts. What else to say? To the fight! To the fight! The inquisitor Nicolas Eymerich Inquisitor: The Village is divided into seven acts, some shorter, others longer and more articulated. The fulcrum of the game, and probably the most fascinating element of the entire production, is the protagonist: that Eymerich born from the pen of Valerio Evangelisti who mixes faith and culture in a rough and ruthless shell against what he considers evil. Eymerich is an all-encompassing character, capable of holding the scene for the entire adventure (apart from some situations in which another character is guided) and who alone is worth exploring the scenario to stimulate his salacious comments and fits of anger , often directed at the player himself who forces him to perform actions he considers simply stupid or inappropriate (for example, try making him use the urinal at the beginning of the game). It must not have been easy for TiconBlu to handle such a structured character without distorting it, but the result is really excellent, to the point that it manages to overshadow some defects which we will discuss later. From the point of view of the contents, without giving you inopportune advances, this second episode is much tougher than the first, with disturbing and controversial situations, often caused by the excesses of Eymerich himself, which will appeal to lovers of genre fiction and tinged stories strong. In strictly playful terms, The Village offers many more puzzles than its predecessor. Let's also say that, in general, they are more difficult (although not impossible) and satisfying to solve, despite the presence of several mini-games that break the rhythm a bit and are characterized by alternative control systems, often imprecise and impractical. Of course, if you are among those who love challenges chey resolve themselves, here you will find some obstacles that are difficult to overcome, unless you continually use divine help, represented by a large crucifix on which you can click to obtain satisfaction. Rough diamond Another novelty compared to the past is the possibility of freely exploring the village, with the important places visited which are noted by Eymerich on his map, to return quickly in case of need. Too bad for the narrow shot that makes wandering a bit confusing, but the map solves the orientation problem after the first lap. The most painful note of the whole production remains the technical side. Let's say immediately that graphically Nicolas Eymerich Inquisitor: The Village is better than La Peste, either for the new model of Eymerich, or for a better composition of the scenarios created with greater wisdom. However, some fairly obvious problems remain, such as the interpenetration of the elements, partly due to some congenital defects of Unity, and the quality of the models of the other characters, lower than that of the protagonist. The first dialogue is enough, with the alternation of close-ups, to understand that most of the resources have been spent on the representation of Eymerich, given the mono expression of the supporting actors.", "date": "2014-05-01", "grade": "7.9"}
