The game formula, as in the great titles belonging to this genre, is as simple to learn as it is difficult to fully master: in short, it is a matter of rotating pairs of colored blocks that fall from above (Tetris style) and then compose in turn mono-colored blocks as large as possible. The latter are then detonated with special spheres, also colored, which act as detonators for the compositions with the same chromatic characteristics. So far, everything is quite normal. The brilliant intuition of the Capcom programmers was in fact to understand the game as a one-on-one title from the beginning, with the opponent who can be controlled by the CPU or, even better, by a human challenger. Let's fight without rancor And it is right here, in the challenge against a character and not trivially with yourself in search of the best score, that the spring is triggered capable of making Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo an authentic source of addiction as well as the best way to ruin decades-old friendships with blows block cascades. Yes, because the matches are based on a continuous interaction between the two players, since blowing up one's colored compositions then results in sending a shapeless cascade of squares to one's opponent, thus inevitably ruining his projects and inexorably bringing him closer to the high limit of the screen, equivalent to game over. The amount of blocks sent to the other side is proportional to the size of the explosion created, with a number that is further increased in the case of more or less complex combos. The only way to shelter from an avalanche of blocks is to create explosions in turn, perhaps with the possibility of reversing the situation if these are larger than those of the challenger. Such a well-studied, exciting and stimulating gameplay is also enhanced by the choice of characters, 8 initially with others to unlock, taken from the Street Fighter II and Darkstalkers series, destined to fight each other with good reason on the occasion of the relative hits performed by the players; the choice of one wrestler rather than another has not only aesthetic purposes, but rather determines the pattern of the blocks thrown at the opponent. And precisely this last aspect has been the subject of a balance, to tell the truth almost imperceptible, in the X' mode, which joins the original one. Also borrowed from the Dreamcast version, released only in Japan, are the variations Y and Z; the first is based on the concept of ~join 3 blocks of the same color to make them explode~, while the Z requires you to rotate the pieces already on the screen rather than waiting for them to fall from above. But the most interesting aspect is undoubtedly in the online mode, which marries perfectly with the nature of the game, guaranteeing hours and hours of exciting challenges to the last block. Obviously there is no shortage of rankings and objectives created ad hoc for this version. The graphic component, on the other hand, as per the subtitle, can count on a tasty entry into the HD era, with greater cleanliness and a general improvement in the menus and backgrounds. It is strange and disappointing in this sense that the same treatment has not been guaranteed also to the characters, who therefore appear detached from the rest in a decidedly marked way. Goals 360 The 200 points available in the 360 version achievements are all quite accessible, and in most cases only require you to achieve normal game situations such as winning 20 ranked matches, completing various modes, creating large combos or winning difficulty levels higher. Comment Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo HD Remix is the definitive version of one of the best competitive puzzle games in video game history. A gameplay so good that it stands the test of time without showing even a wrinkle, enhanced by the online mode and the (truly not faultless) graphic remake close the picture for one of the best downloads you can give to your Xbox 360 or your Ps3. Pro Outrageously fun Good graphic remake Online multiplayer, finally! Cons Characters not redesigned Some lag online", "date": "2007-09-05", "grade": null}
