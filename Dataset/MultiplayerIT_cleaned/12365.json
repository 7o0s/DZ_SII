{"name": "Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/grand-theft-auto-vice-city-stories-3.html", "text": "Chronicle of an announced success It is useless to go around it so much: that of GTA is a series so rooted in the preferences of the mass public that it would be capable of selling millions of copies even simply based on its name. A situation that, in some ways, has undoubtedly occurred since the release of the seminal GTA III, after which progress has been made in the evolution of the gameplay (mostly of a quantitative nature), but at the same time done nothing to eradicate some very evident limits of the play structure. Limits that, punctually, also appear in this Vice City Stories. A direct conversion of the homonymous product released at the end of last year on PSP, the game narrates the rise to the top of crime by Vic Vance, an ex-marine apparently of sound moral principles but who will end up committing atrocities of all kinds. The obvious inconsistency of the protagonist is a reflection of a storyline that - for the first time in the course of the saga - does not fully convince: many situations feel like they have already been seen, several characters lack personality, the jokes are not as brilliant as usual. With the passage on PS2 the control system returns to its natural dimension Nothing transcendental, just a pinch of disappointment for this half misstep by Rockstar in an area always so well cared for in the previous GTAs. For one aspect that is less than the prequel, there are still others that make Vice City Stories a better game overall: first of all, the more substantial and varied structure of the missions, now longer, more elaborate and more demanding. Even if the playful canvas is always the same for better or worse, the action of GTA always manages to be exciting and fun, whether it's about stealing cars, killing enemies, requesting protection money, losing the police and so on. Obviously, with the transition to PS2, the control system returns to its natural size, making life easier for the user in his wanderings through the city of vice compared to the PSP experience: a second analog stick and two shoulder buttons in plus they really manage to make a difference, mainly by facilitating the management of the camera and the pointing system. Having said that, this last aspect (which has always been the weak point of the series) also in Vice City Stories proves to be completely uncomfortable and unsuitable for the purpose, unchanged since its first appearance in GTA III. It is accompanied by an obsolete management of saves and a camera that tends to go crazy with considerable frequency: all elements that Rockstar should have been committed to improving for some time, especially considering how similar titles - and of decidedly lower success - have already done so without particular effort. Up(scaling) and down(grading) However, a conversion like Vice City Stories cannot be blamed for not having taken steps to remedy the historical defects of the series, just as it would not have been legitimate to expect an amazing visual impact from the Rockstar product. The upscaling from PSP to PS2 certainly could not give rise to a game capable of squeezing the Sony hardware, but at the same time the obsolete look of this episode of GTA leaves a little bitterness in the mouth. The size and characteristics of the city have remained unchanged, with a slight increase in definition as regards the textures and polygonal models of characters and elements of the scenario. However, although the glance and the vastness of the environment are decidedly inferior to a title like San Andreas, Vice City Stories on PS2 still has a frame rate that is not exciting, subject to the usual drops in particularly agitated situations. On the other hand, the work done by Rockstar as regards the sound, which has always been the flagship of the series and which here proves to be spot on and brilliant as never before, is absolutely unassailable. The multiplayer component has been mercilessly cut out of this conversion Up(scaling) and down(grading) The soundtrack is a compendium of the most representative songs of the 80s (a polygonal version of Phil Collins even makes an appearance in a cutscene of the game), as usual inserted in a context of fake radio stations capable of giving moments of great hilarity thanks to the demented commercials and the politically incorrect speeches of the speakers. The voice acting is also of great quality, with characters making up for a substantial lack of sophisticated personalities with voices that play their assigned parts perfectly. Returning instead to the sore points, it is a pity to note how the -although not exciting- multiplayer component of Vice City Stories on PSP has been mercilessly cut out of this conversion. Instead, the Empire mode remains very present in the quale you can try your hand at creating your own criminal business by expropriating the buildings of the rival gangs and adapting them to businesses such as extortion, prostitution, etc.: a really not exciting expedient which still contributes to breaking the normal flow of the action a little and which dilutes not just the playful experience. Comment The transition from PSP to PS2 certainly could not foreshadow great upheavals, and so it was: Vice City Stories therefore brings the same experience seen on the PSP to the Sony console, which loses the multiplayer component along the way but which benefits from a more comfortable. Even if a little disappointing from a technical point of view, Vice City Stories is certainly a good title in a narrow perspective to the GTA series alone, but which, when compared with other productions, pays for the obsolescence of some technical and gameplay aspects . Let's take it as a low-cost pastime while waiting for the alleged leap in quality of GTA IV... Pros A good episode of the series Sound at the highest level More playable than the PSP version Cons Prehistoric camera, aiming and saving systems Graphically below standard Storyline unconvincing When it comes to video game blockbusters, it's impossible not to think of GTA, to all intents and purposes the most controversial, talked about and above all successful series of recent years. The Rockstar saga is an (almost) unassailable battleship, capable of generating monstrous amounts of hype and even capable of reversing the usual market logic, even converting products from PSP to PS2 instead of the other way around. This is exactly what happened with Liberty City Stories, an event that is now repeated with the present Vice City Stories.", "date": "2007-04-11", "grade": null}
