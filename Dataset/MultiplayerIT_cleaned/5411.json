Regardless of the technical power of the gaming machines of the period, creatives from all over the world have transformed many types of sports into various types of video games, gradually more and more complex with the arrival of more performing computers and consoles. Of course, this does not mean that less realistic works have disappeared, as Super Mega Baseball 4 demonstrates. The Metalhead Software series, a team that was purchased by Electronic Arts in 2021, was born about ten years ago and now reaches its fourth numbered chapter, which offers small improvements compared to the previous one, without distorting an already tested formula. For all the details, read on for our Super Mega Baseball 4 review. The lightweight style of Super Mega Baseball 4 The style of Super Mega Baseball 4 is very cartoony Super Mega Baseball 4, as it is easy to guess from the images, is a game that absolutely does not aim to steal space from the more realistic MLB The Show. Not only does the EA title not have the official license of the US professional league, but it offers a cartoonish and caricatured style, which allows it not to take itself too seriously and not worry about the realism of animations and settings, which are therefore always suitable for the work, but never particularly impressive. The cartoon style, however, does not automatically mean that Super Mega Baseball 4 is completely devoid of depth. With a mixed approach between arcade and simulation, Metalhead's game allows you to enjoy a game without worrying too much about advanced strategies and moves, but provides refined gameplay and a semi-manual control system, deciding, for example, with little pressure whether to try to reach an additional base while the defense recovers the ball or, on the opposite side, to jump to reach the ball in time instead of letting the AI do all the work. The players have various statistics that determine their effectiveness in various situations and above all they have a level of fatigue, so that you have to manage your team in the best way in the case of long games. Added to this are various abilities, bonuses and maluses of sportsmen who condition the performance of the players, also depending on our actions on the pitch. In short, anyone who wants to delve into all the strategic possibilities of Super Mega Baseball 4 (and does not already have experience with the previous chapters, of course) will have a lot to learn. In this sense, the game offers a series of text tutorials that explain all the mechanics, but it could be a bit overwhelming for a new player. More generally, the graphical interface of Super Mega Baseball 4 is somewhat cumbersome and, even if you can ignore the bulk of what is on the screen and still bring home an inning (on low difficulties), it would be good to review in the next chapters the user interface and lighten the screen, so as not to confuse the newcomers too much. Mode and Ego Super Mega Baseball 4 introduces new stadiums We have mentioned the difficulty, a factor that will surely interest many players, as thanks to it it is possible to transform a relaxing game into a real challenge. Super Mega Baseball 4 offers the ~Ego~ value, i.e. an indicator that can be increased from 0 to 99, with the real leap in difficulty that occurs between one dozen and the next. Thanks to it, each player can easily find the perfect level to play at, which affects, among other things, the shooting speed of the opponents and the ease with which one can aim during the launch. It's not just the difficulty that allows all players to find the best way to enjoy a Super Mega Baseball 4 session. Metalhead Software offers many different modes, which allow you to play single games or mini-tournaments against the AI, in local or online co-op with cross-platform matchmaking (the game is available on PC, Switch, Xbox and PlayStation). In Franchise you must carefully manage the team to truly be the best The most substantial part of Super Mega Baseball 4 is certainly the Franchise mode, a multi-season league in which we have to manage our team, its budget, hire new players, train those we already own and make sure that the team is in harmony, paying attention to factors such as the personality type of each member of the team. Considering the caricatured style of Super Mega Baseball 4, some players might think they are dealing with a trivial title lacking in options, but this is not the case and Franchise proves it with its various options.managerial roles, with also a new team loyalty system (which is conditioned by events over which we have control). Therefore, those who love slightly more structured methods will not be disappointed. Among the most important novelties of this chapter there is then the Shuffle Draft, or a draft system that allows you to create always different teams to be used in various ways, both with fictitious and historical players, with important names from the past recreated with the style of Super Mega Baseball. In general, however, the work does not revolutionize the contents of the previous chapter and prefers to play it safe. Technically it's not an incredible game, but Super Mega Baseball 4 doesn't aim for realism Super Mega Baseball 4 also offers a deep graphic editor that allows you to customize the players' crests, uniforms and appearance, even changing their name. There are no real teams in the game and the ones created by Metalhead Software are a caricature, so none of your absurd creations are out of place. Indeed, as often happens on these occasions, the editor can be used to remedy the lack of official licenses. On the other hand, we are sorry that the PS5 DualSense functions (version we tested) have not been exploited. Feeling the impact of the ball on the club or the sensation of sliding on the grass when we lunged to catch a volley in our hands would have given that extra touch to the games, but we realize that realism is not a priority. At least the Activities have been used, which allow you to directly start the preferred mode. Too bad that Italian is missing.", "date": "2023-06-16", "grade": "8.0"}
