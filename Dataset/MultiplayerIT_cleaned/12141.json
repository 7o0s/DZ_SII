{"name": "Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-recensione.html", "text": "Raidou Kuzunoha vs the Soulless Army The title of the paragraph recalls the subtitle of the game itself, probably one of the longest and most tacky ever conceived: in fact, the player will play Raidou Kuzunoha, a dark Japanese special agent who will have to investigate a supernatural mystery, destined in a short time to become something decidedly above its human limitations, with at stake - but lo and behold - the salvation of our world. For this Raidou will have to resort to the power of his enemies, summoning them in combat and manipulating their powers to make his way through increasingly stronger opponents that his sword and his gun cannot scratch: in little more than a line, here is the gameplay summarized by Devil Summoner. Basically, the player will control Raidou and will have to wander from one location to another in search of information that will direct him to the next destination, perhaps passing through some hostile area where our intrepid investigator will have to face demons and esoteric creatures of all kinds: the variety there is no shortage and the bizarre and captivating design of the various monsters is sophisticated enough to justify, even visually, the actual mechanics of the game. In fact, by exploiting the weak points of the enemy demons it will be possible to perform a sort of ~mini-game~ that will allow us to catch the enemy, and then use it later during the fights, evoking him and using him as a member of the party. In practice, Pokemon esoteric version. In reality, the system soon turns out to be much more interesting than it appears: not only is it possible to exploit the war capabilities of the various monsters, but by fighting alongside them, the mutual relationship of trust with Raidou will rise, and new spells and special abilities will become selectable, expanding the already considerable sample base. And the possibility of merging creatures at will could not be missing, a bit like in Lucifer's Call, to obtain new and more powerful ones. Furthermore, by sacrificing a demon it is possible to infuse its powers into Raidou's katana, which will acquire new fighting skills. The powers of our demonic allies, among other things, will be necessary to continue the development of the plot, when it becomes mandatory to use them to interact with other characters or the environment: it follows, however, that Devil Summoner in the long run becomes a sort of demonic Pokemon for real, given that if on the one hand the mechanics and the variety of monsters and spells are intriguing to ~catch them all~, it is equally true that in the long run the mechanism gets tired, especially when it includes long trips back to recover of fundamental creatures naively overlooked, constantly interrupted by random, irritatingly frequent fights. Mirror of my desires... Sarcasm aside, Devil Summoner cannot be exactly defined as the technically best product made for PlayStation 2. To be honest, it hardly falls into a possible top50. In reality Devil Summoner is crudely programmed, with an approximate polygonal modeling of the characters, which even makes them out of tune with the pre-rendered backdrops: the latter are accurate and well made, faithful to the idea of that distant Japan, and at the same time close, both by distance and by mentality. The historical background is in fact the most convincing element of Devil Summoner thanks to the care placed in the details and in the reproduction of these villages poised between the past and the future, but its effectiveness is undermined by a choice for the musical tracks that is sometimes inexplicable, if not questionable: the songs are in fact rather discordant with the atmosphere of the game, definitely below productions such as Digital Devil Saga. Incredible to say, there are no dialogues or vocal tracks even in the most important scenes: basically, Devil Summoner is a technically mediocre product, where the character design of creatures and monsters is the only truly remarkable thing. Comment Devil Summoner is unfortunately boring and repetitive. There are no terms that better summarize this new Shin Megami Tensei, embellished by a series of truly remarkable ideas and sunk by a mediocre technical realization and an excessive frequency of random fights, which manages to make a gameplay based precisely on collecting more monsters tedious possible to strengthen our powers and our mini-army. Generally in these games it is the plot that helps the shack, but in Devil Summoner it starts after at least a couple of hours of play, and in a decidedly flat and banal way: persevering one stumbles into a twisted and compelling plot, but the average player he will get bored before fighting every two steps without a precise goal. Fans of the more experienced JRPG genre will appreciate itProbably the ingenious gameplay and the truly original setting, all the others fall back on games of the same genre but decidedly more deserving. Pros Some original ideas Intriguing gameplay Cons Technically mediocre Lame plot Too many random fights Here we are again, after a few weeks, talking about Shin Megami Tensei, a series that is starting to make its way into the western market: after being confined to Japanese territory for years and years, the series has finally made its way onto American shelves first, and then Europeans, and Digital Devil Saga, a videogame bilogy that we recently reviewed, struck by its quality, boding well for subsequent productions. Devil Summoner, unfortunately, is not up to the odyssey of Serph and the Embryons, but it would be almost superior to Lucifer's Call, above all thanks to the original setting and a decidedly interesting game system, if it weren't for some not exactly marginal flaws .
