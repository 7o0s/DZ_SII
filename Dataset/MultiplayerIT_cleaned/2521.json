After the success achieved on Nintendo 64 by the Battle Tanks series, 3DO dusts off the same genre, bringing a new crackling game to PlayStation 2. Presented as a TV show, World Destruction League: Thunder Tanks is an action game that allows us to drive one of the 11 tanks in the game, and to challenge dozens of opponents no less armored than us in vast arenas. Each vehicle is characterized by particular strengths, weaknesses and secret weapons. The tank design features the classic small-fast, big-slow match found in other fighting games. Each armored vehicle has its own driver, which is not really relevant, except that each character will bring their own grit and humor to the game. 11 metal monsters... M1A3, Ram, Banshee, Dragonfly, Ironfire, FLP-E, Titan, Manticore, Rhinoceros, Predator, Spectre... these are the names, to say the least, of the 11 vehicles that you can initially select. Each tank is equipped with a main weapon. For example, Titan uses a large cannon to destroy targets. It is also one of the best armored vehicles, but on the other hand it is not equipped with any secondary weapon. Ferrofuoco, on the other hand, can have a flamethrower capable of enveloping enemy tanks with fire, it appears to be rather easy to maneuver, but it is not sufficiently armored, thus resulting rather vulnerable both in absorbing cannon shots and in frontal clashes with the opponents. Some tanks can also roll, teleport, or activate super-speed. In short, all or almost all prove to be well balanced, apart from a couple of them which are somewhat fragile. Born for multiplayer We have many arenas available, real battlefields, located all over the world and even in legendary places like Atlantis. The encounters, or perhaps it is better to say ~clashes~, with buildings, columns, bridges, ships occur with a certain frequency, and the funny thing is that we will be able to destroy practically everything that comes our way. From time to time, different items will pop up to collect, actually special weapons with limited use. Among these I cannot fail to mention the incredible atomic bomb (the explosion is hilarious), the satellite laser, and the guided missiles of which we can take a subjective view in an attempt to hit the target. Born for multiplayer WDL: Thunder Tanks was born as a multiplayer game, offering us the possibility of confronting 3 of our friends in one of the combat modes: Tournament, Death Challenge, Capture the Flag, Pandemonium, Domination, Family. Endless explosions, twists, traps enliven the show and the fun to an extent that is difficult to compare with other games of the same genre. Precisely because of its vocation for multiplayer challenges, the game turns out to be rather boring and inconsistent if played alone. After the first few games, the many game modes do not in fact constitute a sufficient stimulus to continue the solitaire game. An explosion of sounds and colors From a graphic point of view, WDL: Thunder Tanks aims at the concrete without too many concessions to the touches of class. Don't expect millions of polygons, screaming lighting effects or super-detailed textures, but a very robust graphics engine capable of delivering frenetic game speed with a constant framerate. However, the construction of the tanks should be commended, all well characterized and detailed. The sound reaches moderate levels thanks to the voices, almost always dubbed in Italian, which most of the time turn out to be hilarious. To tell the truth, the music goes almost unnoticed, covered by the roars and thunderous sound effects. Peace and love in the world! After the battle, I can finally conclude the review with the final comments. World Destruction League: Thunder Tanks is a great game when played with friends, capable of giving hours and hours of carefree and frenetic fun. Uncontrollable destructive impulses will breach your minds, finding fulfillment only in the annihilation of your opponents. If, on the other hand, you don't have friends willing to take up your challenge, if you are pacifistic or don't have the multitap, I suggest you forget this game and save your money for future purchases.the. I am sure that Maggio will reserve very welcome surprises for you. Pros: Devastation at the highest level! Numerous arenas and game modes Fast-paced and fun... Cons: ...only in multiplayer make love, not war :) Fifty years after the great war, humanity had now recovered from the ravages of the conflict, rebuilding a semi-functional society. One of the biggest technological innovations dusted off was the television. With television thus grew the need for a certain type of entertainment to satisfy the masses. To prevent the resumption of hostilities between the rival gangs, and to raise the morale of the survivors, the World Destruction League was thus created. These WDL see as protagonists the most heated and violent fighters from all over the world. WDL Network TV broadcasts live images of a spectacularity never seen before. We are in the year 2062, in the squalor of planet Earth, devastated by radioactivity, the only weapon of salvation seems to be television. All over the globe crowds gather around gigantic schemes to watch the most successful programme. Live from the future is the World Destruction League!", "date": "2001-05-02", "grade": null}
