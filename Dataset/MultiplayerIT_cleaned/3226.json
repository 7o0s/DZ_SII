As we will see in the course of the review, it is a successful mix between Dungeon Master, from which it takes up the general setting, and Darkest Dungeon, of which it welcomes some ideas in party management and roguelike elements. In the game we take on the role of the director of a secret agency charged with regaining control of sector 451 (the reference to Ray Bradbury's book is not accidental) on behalf of the Senate of Conglomerate City, a colossal and decadent metropolis, theater of struggle between power-hungry multinationals and criminal gangs. The agency has the license to create human clones with cybernetic implants, which will form the teams that will actually take to the battlefield to tackle the various missions. At the beginning of the game we have to choose between the story mode, which will allow us to follow the events preset by the developers in a campaign that will slowly reveal the secrets of sector 451, or the infinite mode, with random events and no time limit. The game itself is divided into two macro sections, one management and one on the field. We will examine both in detail in the next paragraphs. Management part The managerial part of Conglomerate 451 is the one that allows us to create our team of clones and to manage all aspects of it, with one eye on finances and one on technological research. Basically from a side menu it is possible to select the various items that give access to the different sections of the agency, all useful for some purpose. For example, the cloning laboratory allows us to create new agents, choosing from the available classes, the research center gives us access to the five technology trees, which unlock the agents' structures and abilities, while the medical center allows us to treat the wounded pain and trauma, using regeneration tanks. The lodgings deserve a few separate words, where we have direct access to the already created agents. It is here that we can manage their endowment, make them level up, implant new chips, check their status, verify their mutations and, in essence, perform all those micromanagement operations necessary to make them more efficient. If desired, we can also withdraw them to free up slots, so as to use fresh clones in the field that enjoy all the bonuses unlocked in the research center. In addition to managing the team, the agency menu also allows us to access valuable information. For example, in the cemetery we can find all the agents withdrawn or destroyed on the battlefield, while the archive and the director's office present us with a series of interesting statistics on our game, as well as the progress made in taking control of the various territories. Finally there is the New Mission menu, which is self-explanatory: it is from here that we can select our next task and choose who to take to the field to try to complete it. Each assignment has its own level of difficulty which usually determines the number of enemies present and their strength. Obviously the higher the level, the more a well-tested team will be needed to be able to get out alive. Exploration and combat Once all the most appropriate choices have been made in the management part and the operational team has been assembled, we are ready to take the field. Here Conglomerate 451 reveals its dungeon crawler nature. In fact, the control system is typical of Dungeon Master games, therefore with fixed movements and ninety-degree rotations for changes of direction. However, the comparison ends here because the combat system is completely different. In fact, when our team encounters enemies, a turn-based system is activated that allows us to have the agents act one at a time directly on the battlefield (the view remains the same). The actions available depend on the agent's class and on the skills selected during creation (or modified in the lodgings). Let's say that in principle each agent can have offensive, defensive, healing or support capabilities, with some specializations given by the class to which they belong. There are therefore some classes that are more versatile for combat, others that act above all as a shoulder and still others that are perfect for hacking operations, the latter useful against opponents equipped with cybernetic or completely robotic grafts. During the missions, clashes are inevitable, so it's good to go prepared. Unlike other titles, here you don't have to worry so much about resource consumption, since each skill can be used without limits, but just about which skills to use to get the better of it. Some are in factthe most useful against robotic opponents, others against human ones and still others protect against specific attacks carried out by certain enemies. The latter are all taken from the sample of the perfect cyberpunk game: therefore we have the classic criminal gangs, various types of robots, the agents of rival corporations, turrets and various dangers. Each of them can be equipped with melee weapons, pistols, rifles, machine guns, grenades and special weapons that are particularly effective against agents. In level 1 missions it is not easy to notice some nuances of the combat system, but already at level 2 things change and the choices to be made become more thought out. Adding another layer of complexity to everything is the battery: each agent is equipped with a certain amount of energy that can be spent in various ways. One of them is to recharge the shields, which are vital in order not to be immediately destroyed. In any case, energy cannot be used indiscriminately, because it is not only used to fight, but also to carry out all the hacking actions in the game. Once all agents have run out of energy, it will no longer be possible to hack terminals or use combat hacking. The risk of getting stuck doesn't exist, but there is that of making life difficult and losing some important resources. To find the latter, you must essentially explore all the maps, even going beyond the set objectives. Each mission is divided into two distinct maps: that of the city, completely avoidable, and that set in one of the neighborhoods, which is where our target is, be it an enemy to eliminate or an object to find. The maps are procedurally generated, so they change from game to game, however there are some fixed elements that can be found every time you log in. For example, in cities there is never a shortage of shopkeepers, i.e. under-the-counter sellers of enhancing drugs, of illegal single-use software that give substantial bonuses and of electronic chips to be grafted onto weapons or cybernetic parts. In addition to selling goods, shopkeepers can also buy the items in our possession, making us accumulate money and technology, the two main resources of Conglomerate 451. For this reason, it is sometimes necessary to visit him, even at the cost of making a mission more difficult. The scenarios are not very interactive, but it doesn't matter since we are in the standards of the genre. Let's say that around there are openable containers, some hackable electronic objects, switches that unlock doors, keys that do the same thing and little else. The random nature of the maps has probably prevented the creation of more complex puzzles, although it must be said that the focus of Conglomerate 451 is above all on the fights, so everything else is considered a kind of extra. Graphics and final notes On a technical level, the work done by Runeheads is excellent. Not only are the objects that make up the scenarios of Conglomerate 451 well made and spot on, including animated neon signs, metal corridors, gigantic buildings and so on, but they are used in a very intelligent way, so as to mask some limits, all of a productive. As the hours go by, a bit of repetitiveness emerges, but it is a flaw that can be forgiven in a title created by a team of two people and which costs a third of a premium game. Even the human models, while not exceptional, are well done and detailed. The design of some robotic opponents is less apt, too much in the standards to emerge from the rest. The worst side of Conglomerate 451 is definitely the soundtrack. We're not just talking about the music, in this case, which gets tired after a few minutes and can be eliminated without too many regrets, but also about the chatty droid that we take on a mission and that constantly annoys us with his jokes. Unfortunately the latter cannot be eliminated, unless the sound is completely disconnected... or if the speakers or headphones are not destroyed. Goodbye drone The developers tell us that with the latest patch, unfortunately published while they were finishing writing the review, the option to disable the chattering drone has been added. Now you know what to do...", "date": "2020-02-25", "grade": "8.0"}
