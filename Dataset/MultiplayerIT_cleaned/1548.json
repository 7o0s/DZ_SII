{"name": "Dynasty Warriors 4", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dynasty-warriors-4_a.html", "text": "~The Oath in the Garden~ After this little parenthesis, due, it's time to describe what Omega Force have created this time. The style of play has remained unchanged from the previous chapters: we are facing a hack'n'slash with missions, enclosed in a story mode to give the plot the possibility to evolve. It therefore begins with the choice of which of the three kingdoms to relive the glories and which general of this to impersonate among those available immediately. The various missions in which we will have to take part will be connected to each other by a narrative part (often introduced by high quality computer graphics films) first, and subsequently by a short briefing on what awaits us and we will have to do to complete our goal . The actual action takes place in the third person, where we will command our alter-ego making our way through hundreds and hundreds of enemies to be able to complete our mission. There are two keys to hit: square for successive hits to make combos, and triangle for the loaded move that concludes the conclusion and has very high damage. With X we will make the character jump, while with the backbones we will have the possibility to parry or get up immediately after being knocked to the mat. We will be able to have control over the map by enlarging or reducing it and displaying or not the names and energy bars of our opponents and companions. The select key influences the tactic that our bodyguards will take, while start will call up the menu from which we will be able to view the map in its total size and thus be able to see how the troops are positioned. The Circle key contains all the power from which the original name of the game (Shin Sangoku Musou 3) derives. When the bar below our character's energy indicator is at its maximum, by pressing this key we will unleash a series of truly devastating blows (precisely called Musou) which will often tend to pulverize any opponent close to you. But not only that, if your vital energy is at critical levels, turning red, you can unleash the TRUE power of your character, preceded by a Matrix-style effect, where fire, flames and lightning will surround your combo for a while longer. prolonged, giving it a decidedly exhilarating effect. Often your missions will have the aim of killing the enemy commander to be completed, being careful in the meantime not to let your own die, but it will never be easy; ambushes, surprise assaults, reinforcements, betrayals and surprise events will be the order of the day, and will often force you to change your approach strategy or established path to achieve your goal. ~The Conqueror~ Described in this way, the game does not appear anything original or new in the modern videogame scene; but despite everything it has something that makes it special and unique. First of all, the historical background and the historically true events that follow one another, feed a remarkably original atmosphere. The characterization of the characters, both graphically in the beautiful 3D models with highly detailed costumes and numerous weapons (ranging from the classic swords and broadswords, to tonfa, long axes, multiple bows reaching fans and claws for a total of more than 100 weapons) , which psychologically in the relationships between protagonists of different factions that will give life to numerous clashes and cut-scenes, often depending on what you will do during the game. The truly numerous game modes fill in the truly appreciable story mode. Composed of numerous missions and crossroads, influenced by the achievement of certain objectives, by multiple endings and told just like a book, they accentuate the player's identification with the character and make him fully participate in the story and its events. The game mechanics may be simple, but this is where the strength lies; once you pick up the pad it takes ten seconds to understand the game mechanics and the high number of unlockable secrets and extras increase its longevity dramatically. ~Jiang-Dong's Tiger~ Graphically, the graphics engine does its job, beautiful and detailed 3D models even in the animations that are no longer woody as in the previous chapters, is accompanied by a somewhat poor and bare landscape realization. This is mainly due to wanting to focus the action on a high number of sprites on the screen (which can even reach a good fifty) without slowdowns, flickering and pop ups of any kind, and tothe large dimension that the maps want to reach. The two-player split-screen mode adds a lot of gameplay and fun as you'd expect. And in addition to the extras, as already mentioned, the various role-playing elements, such as the level up of your character and weapon, the quests to obtain extra items and final weapons, as well as the edit mode to create your own officer and own bodyguards definitely increase the satisfaction that this game can give and its longevity. The soundtrack has been completely rewritten for the occasion, with oriental music which, however, does not blend perfectly with the game but often gets too caught up in the action to notice; nothing to complain about the really powerful and explosive sound effects, if you pass me the term. The speech however is not perfect, not all the actors are up to it, both in the movies and during the game. Final comment Ultimately Dynasty Warrior 4 is a great game, but not a must-buy. If the simplicity in the game mechanics can be an incentive, it is also true that its repetitiveness and monotony in the long run can tire those who do not get fully caught up in everything that surrounds the game. Its strengths which reside in a truly solid structural background, in the large number of characters and weapons available, in the variety of game modes and in the numerous unlockable extras, can be weaknesses in the hands of less savvy players. Although it can be improved from many points of view, it is a satisfying and complex game but not too difficult. Those who have already played the previous chapters of the saga will be faced with substantial innovations, such as 3 new characters, restyling of the previous ones, new or old missions modified, different character management system, new implementations such as war and assault machines, a more solid graphics engine and various tricks to make the gameplay smoother. However, I would recommend the purchase to these owners with reserve as they may not be satisfied with these innovations, as the gameplay is essentially identical and hackneyed from the second episode. The final vote refers to those who have never had the opportunity to try a game of this saga in all its facets, to those who want to have fun with an excellent hack'n'slash and to all fans of the saga who love the characters and their history. For those who have already had experience with other Koei titles, the vote should be lowered to 6.5. N.B.: The version in our possession and reviewed here is in English. For the Italian market, one totally translated into our language was presented. Pros: Very deep and intriguing story Lots of extras and unlockables Fascinating background Cons: Repetitive game mechanics Sound not up to par Nothing new or original ~These are the events that will be known to posterity as ~The Romance of the Three Kingdoms~ Swords, bows, arrows, spears, fire, lightning, winds, storms, towers, castles. Heroes, knights, wizards, courage, loyalty, revenge, love, battles, winners and losers. They are definitely all elements that we could find in any fantasy novel or video game, and not even too original to be picky. But how do we put it if all this belongs to history, the real one? Things would get interesting.. yes, definitely. And so it is. We are at the turn of the 3rd century BC. when China had not yet been unified and was divided into various provinces dominated by local lords, remnants of ancient dynasties now decayed. In this picture made up of continuous battles, insurrections, famine and poverty, three men took the first steps with the intention of unifying the kingdom into one large state. Everyone moved by their own reasons, some out of lust for power and greatness, some to give their people economic and political stability and some simply to consolidate their ancient territories now devastated by continuous rebellions. At the same time everyone was chasing their dream, inevitably ending up colliding, but thus giving rise to three great dynasties, three great kingdoms. The ambitious CAO CAO created SHU's empire by settling north of China but plotting to forcibly take over all the rest of the as-yet-unknown nation; he was opposed by the courageous and valiant LIU BEI father of the WEI dynasty who, supported by the loyal strategist ZHUGE LIANG, became the most bitter enemy of CAO CAO. Among these, the WU dynasty, commanded first by SUN JIAN and later by his son SUN QUAN, heirs of the great general SUN TZU, located south of the territory, was the third wheel. A century made up of great battles, naval battles, tradimentities and alliances; where a large number of brave commanders would have written a small piece of history. All of this (which deserves a great deal of study, but this is not the place) has come down to us in the form of a novel, written by Luo Guanzhong, called precisely ~The Romance of the three kingdoms~. Obviously, since it is written prose, everything has been emphasized by giving more depth to the various protagonists and their relationships than to battles or historical events. And once again Koei teleports us into this magical world by granting itself videogame licenses, as we could call them, making us protagonists of this wonderful saga.", "date": "2003-09-05", "grade": null}
