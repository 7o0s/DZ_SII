In short, it is a profound title, not only because it is set in the depths of the sea but because it requires an atypical commitment for a smartphone or tablet game: let's see if this desire of the developers to go against the tide has paid off or not. Survivalvania Shinsekai: Into the Depths introduces the user to the game world in a very direct way, without any preamble: in the context of an underwater scenario, we only see the anonymous protagonist wearing a diving suit engaged in some of his routine activities, before a ice avalanche forces him to flee in a hurry from his shelter. From here begins the real adventure, with the player who is left alone to interpret the cryptic fragments that gradually reveal why the on-screen character is in that situation. The first impact with the game is rather unsettling: you have to get used to the ~slippery~ controls due to the submarine setting, the menus are difficult to read and the survival component makes itself felt immediately, given that the survival of the protagonist is linked to a reserve of oxygen which runs out rather quickly. Also thanks to a setting as mysterious as it is fascinating, however, Shinsekai: Into the Depths immediately gets into the right gear, soon ending up involving the user in its mechanics which definitely favor the exploratory component at the expense of present but rather weak action phases. Basically the aim of the game is to descend deeper and deeper into the abyss, however paying attention to the red colored waters that represent the areas with a higher pressure than that tolerated by your suit: to be able to immerse yourself in it, you must first upgrade your diving suit by collecting resources and minerals hidden in the map. This situation is renewed for all the approximately seven hours required to see the end credits, producing an undeniable underlying repetitiveness but at the same time representing the solid backbone of a game that invites the user to calm down, urging him to proceed in small steps instead of rush headlong towards the finish line. This is also demonstrated by the particular fragility of the protagonist: a few blows suffered by the opponents or even a too violent impact with the seabed are enough to see one's oxygen tanks crack and then break definitively, an eventuality that forces one to look for others along the way. The survival aspect then extends to a modest but effective crafting component, with the resources collected from elements of the scenario or released by killed enemies which can be combined to create objects useful for restoring equipment or giving momentary bonuses. As mentioned at the beginning, Shinsekai: Into the Depths gives its best in the situations described so far, instead showing the side in purely action terms. Although you can count on a melee attack and a series of ranged weapons to unlock during the adventure, the fights are rather clumsy, also considering the slowness of the protagonist's movements and the very limited attack patterns of the enemies: there is to say that the game seems aware of this factor, and as far as possible always pushes the user to avoid clashes that are not strictly necessary. Even by marrying this cautious approach, Shinsekai: Into the Depths is more pleasant when played with an external controller, a setup that allows you to proceed with greater safety especially when it comes to performing precision maneuvers or sparingly dosing the oxygen discharges that allow you to brake falls or reach elevated positions. We close with a comment on the technical sector of the Capcom product, which can count on three-dimensional graphics with great attention to detail and an excellent set of animations for the protagonist, while perhaps something more could have been done to make the interface more readable . However, the game fascinates with its evocative seabed - so rich that it happens to confuse the interactive elements with the purely aesthetic ones - and with a really excellent sound accompaniment, with spot-on music and perfectly themed sound effects that absolutely deserve the use of the headphones.", "date": "2019-10-01", "grade": "8.0"}
