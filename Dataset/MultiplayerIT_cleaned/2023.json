{"name": "Project Zero", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/project-zero_a.html", "text": "Vision denied The secret of the Tecmo title lies here, in the setting and clearly how it is functional to the unfolding of events: the darkness, the empty spaces, the shadows, the weak light of the torch, everything is dosed in the best way to immerse the viewer in a disturbing nightmare, dirty, absolutely, if you will pass the terms, normal and realistic, which touches the nerves more than the stomach. Playability is also the daughter of an unconventional approach to the genre: everything is firmly anchored to the cornerstones seen in the past, but manages to definitely seem like something original. All thanks to Tecmo's ~pacifist~ choice: there are no weapons, the only means of offense as already mentioned is an old camera. After all, it is always a disguised weapon, also given the possibility of making upgrades and loading different films, but it can be used not only to take photos with an offensive value. The machine is mainly used to see what the eye of the protagonist, but also ours, cannot see. The sight, the eye, the vision and the denial of it is the leitmotiv of the game: the intro is exemplary and chilling at the same time. A female voice, that of Miko, as if in a sort of confession, wonders how long ago she and her brother began to see things that others don't see. Few words were enough to describe what awaits us in the adventure, no full motion can compete with that simple sentence spoken on a black screen Playability and gameplay We were talking about the camera: precisely because the surrounding environment is dark and the direction of great effect, often the classic view is not enough for us, so that the only way to see clearly is to grab the camera by sifting through the world through a restricted subjective (also because only through the machine it is possible to see clues that are hidden behind our simple gaze). All this is implemented perfectly in the moments of the fights with ghosts: the beacon at the bottom lights up, a moan is heard and immediately after the pad vibrates realistically in accordance with the heartbeat of a frightened Miko. We turn around, we move the flashlight which casts more darkness than light, but we see nothing. We take up the car and point blank we see something floating in the dark trying to throw its arms around our necks, certainly not to greet us warmly. Now Project Zero has become a fps: the target is locked, the shot is loaded and a photo is taken; the more you upload and the closer you are, the less photos you will use. Photos that should not be wasted because they serve as projectiles, to carry out rescues and, as already mentioned, to go beyond the simple eye. The internal dynamics of the game are also typical of the genre, objects are found, doors are opened and more or less complex puzzles are solved. The main feature is the slowness of the narration and a certain lack of clarity of what must be done: there is no strong narration line, one must not carry out actions that have rigidly to do with cause and effect, one turns in the mansion at looking for clues, you take time to listen and read the fragments of texts left by the previous expedition, in short, you let yourself be enveloped by the mosaic of words and images that make up the mystery to be revealed. But if the whole title stood on these levels of excellence we would be dealing with the next touchstone for survival horror to come. Unfortunately for Tecmo, P. Zero also has some flaws scattered between gameplay and graphics. First of all, the aforementioned camera will make those who expect a war arsenal at their fingertips turn up their noses. The medium is so particular and not very visually exuberant that warmongering geeks will certainly have something to say about it. There is little destructive action and little blood, on the other hand the anguish and tension are cut with a knife. Technically speaking, the control method is not without flaws. The protagonist guides herself on her wanderings inside the mansion with surprising ease, making us forget the much-maligned control of Resident Evil. However, it must be said that sometimes the view precludes us from correctly circumventing the corners, and this in the middle of a book with a ghost is certainly not the best. A similar speech occurs during the first-person battle with the ghosts: grasping, aiming, shooting, wriggling, reloading, shooting are certainly not actions implemented in an impeccable way. As usual, practice will come to our rescue, but the fact remains that teaEverything always seems to be a bit precarious and not very performing when needed. Audio Video Graphically speaking, the game is open to some criticism. First of all, the polygonal models of Miko and his brother seem to be poorly defined. They are poor in detail and the animations are decidedly woody and not very varied. They are not unwatchable, but certainly made much less well than the general picture of the title. An example of the negligence with which the models have been made is running: without saying anything else, let's say that our favorites awkwardly accelerate their pace. Instead, the care placed in the play of light and shadow is striking, especially as regards the torch, a real joy for the eyes, which realistically illuminates the surrounding environment poorly and poorly. The textures applied to models and backdrops are of fluctuating quality: many are of an almost disconcerting flatness, the others do their duty without however making one cry for a miracle. The beauty of the whole is certainly not the graphics per se: we said that we can find refinements (lights / shadows) and disconcerting style drops (animations of the models), but what is most striking is the very cinematic use what the authors do. It's not just a question of lopsided shots and sudden changes of point of view, but here the grain of the image is also simulated with showy lines and dirt and, disconcerting for these times of orgiastic graphic rituals, it is played in black and white. The result of this is that our nerves are once again put to the test. Another point in favor of the Tecmo title is the lack of room-to-room uploads. The mansion is all explorable without any break to break the atmosphere, no doors that open to Resident Evil: needless to say, this is dramatically exploited impeccably by the programmers. The audio sector is instead of absolute respect. There is not much music, only sound effects which also systematically participate in the work of destroying our nervous system. Creaks, noises and voices massacre us throughout the game, giving us unease and pure terror. That's it, the dubbing is done really well, and even the distortions of the Japanese names don't bother that much. In the end. Summing up, PZ is certainly an excellent title, respectful of tradition, but also strongly breaking, if only for the original use made of the protagonist's strange paraphernalia. In the end, too many graphic lightness does not ruin a title with a strong emotional and visual impact. In my eyes I always have the images of Resident Evil for GameCube, which however photorealistic they may be, do not inspire the same unease and terror that one feels entering a mortuary room that is almost entirely in dim light, with the pad returning the beat of the our heart, with a few photos (!!), unsuccessfully looking for the specter that wanders aimlessly among various Shinto trinkets. Pure horror, a classic of its kind, perhaps too particular and not very explosive. But didn't the same be said of Silent Hill?? pro eerie atmosphere texture particular graphic style cons some flat textures sometimes imprecise control method That villa next to the swamp that is next to the cemetery........ Tecmo through Wanadoo allows us to experience an adventure that sometimes seems to revive the glories in terms of tension and disturbing capacity of the Konami masterpiece Silent Hill. But the analogies end here, luckily for us, and P. Zero proceeds along a highly peculiar road with an extreme emotional impact. Put simply, you don't play peacefully and relaxed and really playing it at night in the dark is not recommended for the most susceptible. The Japanese programmers have succeeded in a skilful mix of fear caused by sudden apparitions, in short, the easiest terror, and the creation of a strong and oppressive atmosphere that surrounds the Himuro Mansion, drawing heavily on the most disparate cinematographic references, without however looting and recycle low. Fear is not only that of the zombie who suddenly turns around and bites our calf, terror is that of wandering through large, dark, poorly lit spaces full of crunches, which thanks also to a skilful directing work give us moments of healthy hysteria when it seems to see something moving in the background. The effect you want to create is the one seen in the film ~The Sixth Sense~ and probably (which rarely happens) the Tecmo title gives us back better than any other tie in the atmosphere and sensations ofi a movie. In other words, given also the protagonist that we play, we are always on the alert, every mere step forward is a significant progress. This is Project Zero, a strange survival horror that leaves aside the machismo of Resident Evil to throw us into a real nightmare in which there are no loud grenades or assorted weapons to remind us that in the end our enemy is made of blood like we. Imagine a girl who wanders in the dark at night in a gigantic mansion and above all haunted by ghosts and various apparitions, ~armed~ only with a rudimentary camera and a tiny torch that does everything but illuminate. The story begins with the disappearance of a writer and his staff in the Himuro Mansion, a gigantic old mansion in provincial Japan, while researching a book. Mafuyu Hinasaki, a friend of the writer, also goes to the villa, but he too never returns. At this point the real protagonist of the game enters the scene, Miko, Mafuyu's sister who will have the difficult tasks of revealing the mysteries of the mansion, as well as discovering what happened to her brother. The starting plot is this, but proceeding in the narrative we will be buried by a flood of information that will gradually make clear a plot that abandons the easy-to-kill zombies of Resident Evil, in favor of more adult themes such as spiritism, Shintoism and decidedly creepy rituals .", "date": "2002-08-29", "grade": null}
