The player's task will be to spread a series of filmed images and 3D images over this sound carpet, trying as much as possible to go in time, not because you have to pass a level, but to give a logical sense to the frenetic swirling of lights and colors that they pulsate on the screen. In addition, as in an old Mondin clip (like the 80s ones by Prince and Neneh Cherry to be clear) it will be possible to insert written text using the pad or keyboard. That's all. The player will choose his own play list and the effects to insert, and in real time he will be able to add 32 colored solutions such as flowers, stars and similar amenities. The heart of the product is the visual mixer; from here we manage the themes and objects, as well as short clips of various kinds that we will superimpose on the tourbillon of vaguely lysergic images. Each theme, organich, tech, surreal, motion, and demo has 3 tool libraries available to draw from: objects, movie clips and images, for a total of almost 2000 choices. Very varied it would seem, but this is where the problems begin. The title is terribly cumbersome, and not having multiple windows on the screen, but always one at a time, gives a sort of feeling of helplessness and incompleteness that doesn't facilitate the practical verification of one's choices. Let me explain: first I choose the music and then the images and effects: I can't change the entries made on the fly, but I always have to go through the main menu. I don't have everything under control, it's as if something is missing, one is always dumbfounded and sincerely bewildered. Another thing I didn't like is the general quality of the graphics, if you pass me the definition: the 2D background images are ugly, I am aware that the enormous variety can be to the detriment of quality but here it is clear very little what they represent and if it weren't for the many colors used they would seem very similar to each other. Even the 3D ones aren't much better: anti-aliasing is banned and the choice of colors doesn't seem very appropriate to me. There aren't many textures, whether it's polygons with at most a few shades of color applied, nothing more. The making of the movies is very unattractive: the quality of the compression is scarce, but the fact that the clips are encapsulated between two gray bands is disheartening. Really bad to see. Is it worth the ticket price? The general sensation is that of being faced with the king of chaos: giving an organization and structure to one's ~productions~ is always a difficult undertaking: it seems that the commands respond late, but the truth is that one is unable to have a practical and immediate feedback of what you really want to do. And the frustration comes quickly. We are not given the possibility to do what we want, this is the great problem of the product. What else can we say: from a musical point of view, we take home a collection of tracks that are difficult to find in our parts except for expensive parallel imports, which represent the best that can be found around Europe, 5 hours or 60 pieces they can be enough. From a purely playful point of view, the matter becomes complicated: the fact that it is not a real game makes us make a leap of parameters to use, no longer playability and longevity, but functionality and usability. And unfortunately we are not here and frankly sorry given the potential inherent in the originality of the title. The game is frankly inconvenient and not very immediate to use, and as already written it leaves little room for filing and correction work by the user who wants to improve their product. More than a real game in some situations it seems to be faced with a rolling demo full of spatial and surreal images thrown there to impress good-mouthed spectators. The final judgment can only be negative: an excellent idea exploited badly, perhaps a second chapter will benefit the title, perhaps by implementing a Windows-like interface; for now, all that remains is excellent music. That's all. Pros: Original Very varied Cons: Graphics not exciting Limited interaction Boring over time... From the Ministry of Sound in London... MINISTRY OF SOUND is frankly a very strange title, it is what we could define, using a much abused term, a non-game game. In other words, we are dealing with an elongated tech demo, like the one present with the free CD of the old Psone. The title contains 5 hours of music by the best DJs of the Ministry of Sound in London, a very cool disco, immortalized in the Chemical brothers' ~hey boy hey girl~ video, and in a vast database of images, videos which, based on the nOur imagination or desire, can be mixed to create a sort of very hallucinatory and Mtv style miniclip. The music is by 5 different DJs, each with his own personal genre: Tall Pall, delights us with his hard house, Ferry Corsten massacres us with his trance, Paul Jackson produces refined house&garage executions, Krafty Kuts and Paul Dakeyne us play breakbeat and progressive house respectively. In short, you sound very advanced or simply tracks that have little to do with the average Italian discotheque, entangled in the Italian commercial Italian, always the same and not at all accustomed to styles and contaminations of all kinds. In short, high levels, the air is very international, not like an open-air summer dance hall.", "date": "2001-07-19", "grade": null}
