{"name": "Black Clover: Phantom Knights", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/black-clover-phantom-knights-recensione.html", "text": "To say that a certain weariness towards the mobile RPG has taken over is an understatement, but given the great appeal of the anime series in question, the review of Black Clover: Phantom Knights may be interesting. The Black Clover series actually has all the credentials to be part of the now endless trend of role-playing game with tactical combat and collection of heroes in mobile format, being a story with a fantasy setting characterized by a rich cast of characters, c Indeed, one wonders why Bandai Namco has only moved now by proposing the game in question, after the experience of Black Clover: Quartet Knights on PS4 and PC. It is decidedly late to emerge in a genre that has long since reached saturation, but when it comes to licenses of this appeal there is always the possibility of relying on a good slice of the public made up of fans of the series and it is in fact precisely to these that the game addresses itself in a privileged way, given that for the rest there are no elements such as to distinguish themselves decisively from the competition. This doesn't mean that it's a completely bad game, just that it really comes out of time and also has some obvious technical limitations that can't make it stand out among the huge mass of completely similar and largely better titles. However, there is something that Black Clover: Phantom Knights deserves a look for, as the game tries to propose something new in the standard formula especially in regards to the combat system. This offers more marked tactical elements than seen in many other cases, in particular as regards the choice of formations and teamwork between the heroes, proving to be rather tactical and profound. The problem is that even this is soon submerged in the typical assembly-line dynamic that emerges in the long run in this type of game. On the other hand, we already know what the presence of auto-battle is destined to bring: once we learn the basic dynamics and enter the inexorable mechanism of constant progression, the pleasure of combat disappears and is replaced by the need to get rid of more quickly as possible of these superfluous interludes, leaving just the taste of the growth of statistics and the collection of new heroes, which are the foundations of the whole game. Knights, wizards and gems The game unfolds according to the classic methods of this genre, proposing an original story, divided into various missions, and a plethora of various activities that essentially offer the same structure in progressive fights but capable of leading to rewards of different types. The standard dynamic is therefore represented by fights in sequence against waves of enemies with progressive difficulty, with an occasional don boss fight at the end. If you are in a mode with narrative support, at the end of the quests there is some simple dialogue between the characters, mostly made up of static screens with the faces of the characters alternating, involved in the discussion. The story is specially built for the game but does not seem to reach the richness typical of the world of Black Clover and it is not easy to get into it if you don't already know the basics of the series, on the other hand it is the great fans who will be able to appreciate it to the fullest, eager to also know this particular backstory of events. The combat system is turn-based and requires the player to compose the party of fighters and deploy it on the battlefield through different types of formation, with the characters arranging themselves on a chessboard in a tactical manner. This aspect has a considerable importance on the outcome of the battles and is probably the most original feature of Black Clover: Phantom Knights, which has at least a thin layer of strategy over the traditional combat system. For the rest, it is a matter of activating special abilities and combined attacks as usual when the various indicators are loaded, then being careful to manage the cooldown of the moves, but they are all elements that are lost in the background once the autoplay is activated . The other mainstay typical of this type of game is the collection and management of characters, obviously also present here. The summons take place by investing the gems - which obviously can also be purchased with real money - through the usual gacha mechanics, allowing you to obtain fighters of different rarities and levels in a random way but also according to the invested value. The tactical management of the heroes is deep and complex, through skilltrees capable of modifying the staskills unlock numerous chained skills and this is also an aspect that can be particularly appreciated by fans of the original series. Even technically we are not exactly faced with an impressive title: the character design is obviously the original one and emerges in the static cutscenes, but an extremely simplified semi-chibi style is used in the combat phases, with graphic effects that do not help more than that to make the clashes spectacular, restoring a certain sense of general flatness.", "date": "2020-01-30", "grade": "5.7"}
