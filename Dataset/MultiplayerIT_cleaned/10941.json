{"name": "DJ Mix Tour", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dj-mix-tour_a.html", "text": "Given the commercial success of games such as Guitar Hero and Rock Band, it is now clear that the rhythm game genre is in perfect health. And as always happens in these cases, it didn't take long for someone to decide to translate this type of product onto mobile phones. Gameloft, in this case, has already released Guitar Rock Tour, a real Guitar Hero clone in which you had to play a certain number of songs paying attention to the rhythms and pressing the number keys in correspondence with the notes that scrolled on the fretboard of a guitar. It was a technically well done title, which however paid the price due to the technical limits of the Java platform on certain mobile phones: the songs were not played in sync with the notes to be played, therefore it was necessary to rely on the visual feedback rather than on the rhythmic one, with the result of an inevitably ~incomplete~ and uninvolving experience. Has this DJ Mix Tour solved the problem in some way? From the start screen of the game it is possible to choose your character from among four available (two males and two females), then you will start immediately with the first song, in front of a not very large but involved audience. We will see the ~notes~ to be captured move along the plates, so we will have to press the corresponding keys at the right time to ~play~ them. As usual, the shots will be distinguished between single ones and prolonged ones, which require continuous pressure, while in the background the song will continue to play for about a minute. Performing the song successfully will result in triumph, our DJ will become more famous and desired, and we will find ourselves performing in front of increasingly numerous and demanding people. At the same time, the controls will undergo a change, adding keys and types of ~notes~ divided within the usual three ~stripes~ (left, center and right). We will therefore have to act on the entire numeric keyboard, possibly pressing the 0 key to enter ~fever~ mode and multiply the points for a short period of time. The action therefore enjoys a progressive increase in difficulty: rhythm game experts may get a little bored during the early stages, but then they will find bread for their teeth... The graphics of the game are characterized by the typical Gameloft style for this kind of productions: the characters are drawn with an excellent style and the choice of colors is always perfect. The scenarios in which we will find ourselves performing will change as we complete the stages, becoming more full of people and more beautiful to look at. The effect of the ~notes~ and their passage on the console has been rendered very well. Turning to the sound, unfortunately, the same problems encountered with Guitar Rock Tour remain: on certain terminals (the test was carried out on a Nokia 6120 Classic) the sound is not synchronized with the action on the screen, and this in fact ruins the experience completely. What rhythm game can it be if you can't rely on rhythm? The audio quality of the songs is discreet, certainly the dance genre is less fascinating than rock but it certainly boasts a large number of admirers.
