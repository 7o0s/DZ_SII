After a short time spent in the training area, you will be able to smoothly control the character through the various levels of the game. In addition to the initial training section, the virtual reality simulator that you will use to obtain LEILA license upgrades will also be very useful. To access it, you will have to collect an ever-increasing number of credits. The credits are accumulated by completing the various missions of the game or by demonstrating your ability to drive a mighty two-wheeled racing car through the streets of the city. This is another interesting aspect of the game, which helps to give depth and variety to the gameplay. In fact, to move from one mission to another you will have to drive left and right, reaching the locations where the various phases of the game will take place, and this is where the heart of the adventure lies. In fact, you will have at your disposal a series of weapons (depending on the level of LEILA license you have reached) and a radar that indicates the position of the enemies (does it remind you of anything?). The latter will be essential to be able to successfully complete the missions, as the various enemy guards you will face are certainly not stupid, and you will have to use a lot of cunning to proceed on your steps. If you plan to enter a room and shoot wildly at everything that moves, you are free to do so, but keep in mind that there are also other ways to proceed, especially in the more complicated missions. Remember that your every action causes a reaction from the bad guys, and if you're not careful you'll find yourself surrounded and out of bullets right at the climax. Pros and cons The variety of missions to be tackled is remarkable, just like the balance of difficulty: already in the third mission, don't rule out having to repeat a piece of the level several times to be able to save bullets or to get to the end with as much energy as possible (it's a tough job , but I chose it!). With an incredible presentation, what is immediately striking about the game is a soundtrack worthy of being defined as ~cinematic~, even recorded in the Abbey Road studios in London. The sound is very engaging and well studied, with effects that are sometimes essential but always of a good standard. Unfortunately, the graphics are less prestigious which, although beautiful, lack depth and are affected by the porting from the Dreamcast console. The most annoying aspect is in fact the management of the camera in the third person: sometimes it will happen that you have to leave and re-enter a room to be able to see some ~shadowed~ areas and be able to explore them with due accuracy; during stalking, I sporadically noticed some flickering probably due to too close a wall to the camera. Despite these flaws, the title turned out to be very fun and long-lived enough to keep you glued to the console for some time. Noteworthy are the movies of the fake ABCBS network news, really hilarious, which gradually presents the scenario and will accompany you for the entire duration of the game. Definitely HeadHunter has an excellent concept made more than discreetly, which could have that something extra to be a must, but which if you buy it will entertain you, and not a little. Pros: Very complex and well articulated plot... ...that makes you want to play it to the end. Truly engaging and atmospheric sound and music. Remarkable playability... ...accompanied by an ever increasing and well calibrated difficulty. Cons: Occasional camera management problems sometimes annoying The control of the bike is not always impeccable Graphics not excellent when compared to current standards And the story begins... California, late 21st century. Organized crime is taking over the order and the status quo, and the government has decided to outsource the defense of justice to a private company called the Anti-Crime Network (ACN), which is given carte blanche to arrest the criminals. Society measures the importance of individuals based on their wealth and therefore on how much they contribute to its well-being. For this reason, the government has an interest in protecting the health of the wealthiest citizens, according to the ~richer, healthier~ principle. This type of philosophy has greatly increased the demand for human organ transplants (preferring them to artificial ones) and criminals have become the official source of supply: when they are arrested, the outlaws have to pay their bills.done and, if they do not have enough money, the debt to the Government will be paid thanks to the removal of their organs. Weapons around the world have therefore been modified so that if used (and every citizen has the right to do so) they do not damage the internal organs of the victim. But who are the HeadHunter in the end? They're the mercenaries hired by ACN to fight crime, and guess who's the best around? Just him: Jack Wade, that is our digital alter-ego, that we will have to help unravel a complicated skein. In fact, the protagonist wakes up tied to a kind of operating table, in the throes of the greatest amnesia that has ever happened to him (probably why the first?) and the only thing that comes to his mind is to escape from the two bad guys in white coats who they are approaching him menacingly (not stupid!). After escaping and being rescued by doctors who found him unconscious in the street, Jake learns that he has been fired from ACN, that his LEILA license (Law Enforcement Intelligence and License Approval) has been revoked and that, above all, he must not trust no one: there's no denying, the premises don't seem to be the best and of course to do this Jake certainly won't have an easy life. In a context full of details and a compelling storyline, your goal will be to obtain a class AAA HeadHunter license, in order to have access to all the files in the ACN database and therefore be able to find out who killed Christopher Stern, ex head of the Anti Crime Network, as well as a friend of Jake and father of Angela Stern (could the beauty of the moment have been missing?) and, why not, find out what happened to him before losing his memory.", "date": "2002-02-20", "grade": null}
