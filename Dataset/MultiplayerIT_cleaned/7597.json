The user-side indulgence in enjoying an exciting title hides a much greater commitment on the developer side in balancing, innovating and making the proposed dose of strategy satisfying but never frustrating. Although Eastern and Western philosophies see the strategic RPG genre in a very different way, Nippon Ichi is a candidate as a white fly who observes the evolution of the counterparts from the outside. The Chubu team has always had an irreverent, disrespectful, almost bizarre approach in proposing pure and uncompromising gameplay, which frightens for its depth in the face of a rather simple and transversal artistic presentation. The Disgaea saga, though relatively young, remains one of the most prolific; it is therefore not surprising that the new iteration goes to draw the characters, the plot and the narrative strand in the events of the early days of the franchise. There is a doubt, however, which recurs frequently with each sequel: how blurred is the line between the real need for a new chapter on an annual basis and passionate fan-service? Disgaea D2 refines the gameplay and increases the content, but the leap in quality is postponed Playstation 3 trophies Disgaea D2: A Brighter Darkness offers 74 trophies, respectively 66 Bronze, 5 Silver, 2 Gold and the final Platinum. Many of the bronzes are based on joining the team of particular characters, progressing in the main quest and performing combos and damage in battle. To scale in difficulty, Silver and Gold are based on completing sub-quests, defeating certain secondary bosses, and collecting all items. The usual hell The return of the protagonists who made the franchise famous will delight those who chose, at the time of PlayStation 2, to reward Nippon Ichi's versatility, but the thumbs down when considering how little effort the team has put into rendering the plot captivating. Laharl, Flonne and Etna return in a quest to give the new ruler the right fame and thus allow his boundless ego to be satisfied; Nippon Ichi remains one of the best Japanese software houses to instill the right amount of sympathy and light-heartedness in the interlude scenes, but their use as a mere common thread between one battle and another is clear. Enjoyable and ironic, therefore made forgettable precisely by too much simplicity, an apparent strength but here it has become a screen due to the lack of a thick story. Adding up the huge playful substance, all this pales in front of the real fulcrum of the franchise, but taking up what was said above, it remains a bit bitter to discover, battle after battle, how Nippon Ichi is actually squeezing his brand of tip. You don't need to mince words to always and in any case appreciate a new episode of the saga, but this shouldn't even be an excuse for not expecting something more in-depth on the narrative side, with an insufficient trend that started since the most recent spin-offs proposed . The progress is pleasant by virtue of a well-established gameplay structure; although the D2 is the eighth in order of time, the formula entertains, excites and keeps you glued for hundreds of hours, thanks to a practically infinite growth tree. From that point of view, Disgaea never disappoints. Old and new Disgaea D2 adds novelty on the one hand, taking away when added by Disgaea 4 on the other. The heart of the strategy remains unchanged, with grid maps in pure strategy jRPG style to dictate the law of the battlefield. The new episode completely abandons the online system present in its predecessor, certainly not the foundation of the franchise but a pleasant distraction, focusing on the offline plot, certainly not poor in content. Then we say goodbye to the maps created by the player and the customization of the ship, removed in this episode, pirates included. If in the transition from Disgaea 3 to Disgaea 4 Nippon Ichi worked heavily on the technical aspect, promoting clean high definition sprites for the characters, it cannot be said that the D2 takes another evolutionary step. Coming out of the safe garden of art infused into the artwork of protagonists, supporting actors and enemies, the rest is visibly stuck in the past. Given the stylistic choice adopted, the brand has never been asked for a technical miracle, but in the backgrounds and locations the title truly offers the bare minimum. A defect that is not such for the fans, who have always been hammering on playful iron regardless of the technique, but it is right to underline it in relation to the now necessary analysis of what Nippon Ichi has included in this blu-rayalmost exclusively a heavy dose of strategy. But as anticipated, on the one hand it is removed from the other it is added. The Japanese team has well chosen to simplify some phases that are all too expensive in terms of time, such as the evolution of the enemies, here entrusted solely to a special shop, or the promotion of the reincarnated allies, made much more fluid, obviously with some renunciation in the final performances. In the process of evolution it is necessary to mention the possibility for the characters to become apprentices of others, thus allowing the acquisition of techniques from this or that master. Backpacker An interesting addition concerns the Evility traits, real conditions that can be assigned to created or reincarnated allies, making them more or less ideal for dealing with certain situations. This aspect adds a new level of strategy, no longer entrusted to the mere numbers of statistics and equipment but finally also dependent on minor elements but on traits suitable for facing specific enemies and clashes. A purely playful criticism should be addressed to the Geo Panel crystals, catalysts of area conditions perfect for the strategic structure of the brand: unfortunately the element becomes a true source of joys and sorrows only starting from the second half of the game, making the first dozen hours more a sort of advanced training than real advancement fraught with difficulties. The same thing cannot be said for the evergreen ability to use allied monsters to turn the battle in one's favor. Unlike the possibility of transforming them into weapons, as in the past, in Disgaea D2 Nippon Ichi has decided to make the little demons a sort of mount on which to jump humanoid allies. In this way it is possible to transport and defend the weakest elements by sharing the damage with the mount, all while the rest of the troop is busy jumping on each other's shoulders to quickly reach distant areas of the map. As per tradition, it will take some time to master the learning curve of the title, especially if you want to face all the many extras inserted outside the main quest, such as battles inside objects or Laharl's challenges.", "date": "2013-09-27", "grade": "7.5"}
