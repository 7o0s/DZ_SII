A secret agent posing as a pizza maker. Music, pizza and wild dancing. An old colleague is trapped inside the structure, will we be able to free him with dice? Cosmo D returns and does so with a work that is the sum of all his favorite themes, set in the same universe as his two previous videogame works: Tales From Off-Peak City Vol. 1 and The Norwood Suite. Composer, musician and game designer, at some point ours must have felt the need to experiment with game mechanics and, as we will see in the review of Betrayal at Club Low, he has created another surreal and over the top adventure, which does not betray his style. Pizza mission Pizza and music, the mission is served The video game industry needs titles like Betrayal at Club Low so as to remember what it can be, beyond the fees imposed by the big industry. Cosmo D is a heavy authorial figure, capable of imposing his style on the entire gaming experience and making his weaknesses strengths or, at least, artfully masking them. He develops practically alone, following at the same time many other passions and, aware of having limited means, he acts like a painter choosing meticulously and with great attention what to put and not to put in the painting. The result is that, however small, his games are autonomous and complete universes, part of a larger and stronger imaginary, in which his passions and idiosyncrasies continuously chase each other in the representation, giving life to moments of sincere amazement . As mentioned, the mission to be accomplished in Betrayal at Club Low is very simple and, apparently, linear: you have to enter a nightclub and take out an undercover agent before he is discovered. The disco alone represents almost the entire scenario, with the only weapon at the protagonist's disposal, an agent dressed as a pizza chef who is... the pizza, i.e. his disguise. No weapons, but many actions fought with dice. The game system is really very simple. Basically we are dealing with a kind of point and click adventure in which the majority of actions and puzzles are related to the roll of dice (even if there is no shortage of objects to collect, such as keys or other). The protagonist is endowed with a series of social skills, linked to the actions that can be performed (for example breaking down a door will require a certain strength, while to sympathize with a DJ you will need to show him a certain taste in music), each represented by a six-pointed dice faces with variable values, more or less high depending on the money the player has invested in them. Money is earned in various ways, such as by successfully performing certain actions, or by rolling dice. In addition to the basic die, each action is accompanied by the roll of extra dice, which reflect the current physical and moral conditions of the protagonist, as well as the pizzas (one die per pizza) that he has cooked in one of the ovens scattered throughout the game and that he always carries with him. All the extra dice produce bonuses or penalties which are added to the basic roll, determining the final result. If the latter is equal to or higher than that of the current opponent, be it a human or an object, victory is achieved. Otherwise you suffer various penalties depending on the circumstance, such as the loss of health points or motivation points (which are recovered by rolling dice with healing faces, of course). The case The imagery of Cosmo D is clearly visible Although chance plays a decisive role in the final result, even if sometimes the dice seem to be a little too guided and at the beginning of the adventure there are imbalances that require a minimum of patience to get around, the truth is that Betrayal At Club Low requires a good evaluation capacity on the part of the player, who must continually decide whether or not a roll of the dice is worth the risks it entails, based on the potential positive or negative effects it could obtain. Some actions are in fact more or less easy depending on the current conditions of the protagonist, which vary greatly within the adventure. Thus the progression system seems to have been specifically designed to favor a tactical approach: better to grow a few skills, so as to have more chances of success in relative launches, or better to grow them all in a balanced way, however making some situations more difficult ? The choices made have a great influence on the reactions of the other characters and on the chances of success, making everything replayable several times to try the various solutions available, also considering the many endings presenti and the overall brevity (we are talking about three hours), in any case perfect for a similar title, which if stretched too much would probably have been cloying. Dice and pizza, a tasty combination The art of Cosmo D takes care of everything as a corollary, between dialogues and surreal scenarios, over the top characters and lots of music, in what appears to be a distorted world, sometimes meaningless, but all too similar to ours, in a kind of magical realism in which the planes merge continuously putting themselves at the service of the representation, the true keystone of the entire work, which stands as a radical critique of modernity, in its apparent lightness.
