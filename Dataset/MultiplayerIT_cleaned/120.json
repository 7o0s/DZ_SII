{"name": "Children of Mana", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/children-of-mana.html", "text": "Dungeons of mana The plot is almost a pretext this time, and the protagonist can be chosen from among four heroes: the audacious Fennik, the sweet Tamber, the funny Poppen and the rabbit Wanderer. The splendid animated introduction immediately introduces us to a world in which the divine Mana Tree and its benevolent powers are threatened by a mysterious entity that brings catastrophes: holding the Sacred Sword, we will have to make our way through the enemies and track down the bad guy, before a new cataclysm, like the legendary one that happened ten years earlier, hits this fairy-tale world again. In reality, the plot is of a disarming simplicity, linear and with truly predictable implications: choosing the protagonist changes very little, moreover, apart from the dialogues that somehow characterize him, given that the differences in terms of statistics are extremely marginal and the one character's fondness over the other for magic or physical combat ends up being totally glossed over. In fact, it is the central mechanics of the game itself that are almost buggy: Children of Mana is nothing more than a ~dungeon crawling~ game, i.e. a title in which the exploration of dungeons is predominant in order to enhance the character through level- ups and equipment, whether these are imposed by the story or optional. In fact, the plot unfolds through a series of missions, which revolve around the few explorable locations, which are nothing more than dungeons: the only peaceful place is in fact the tiny village where it is possible to talk to other characters, buy at the shop and accept of optional quests. Once you have chosen what to do, whether to continue the adventure or revisit a dungeon to complete an extra mission and obtain new items, you summon Flammie the dragon and launch yourself into the action, quickly and painlessly. And this is where the combat system comes into play. Fighting'n'casting Mainly the weapons available are of four types: sword, chain, bow and hammer. It is possible to use two weapons at a time by associating them with two buttons, and swap them on the fly by accessing the ~ring menu~ using the right back button. The L button, on the other hand, allows you to assign an object to another button, to be used if necessary, perhaps to heal yourself. Holding down the attack key will trigger a secondary action, depending on the weapon, such as parrying, or hypnotizing enemies. However, the variety is apparent: in reality, the use of weapons such as the chain or the hammer is only necessary in certain situations (such as certain bosses at the end of the dungeon) since anyone would prefer the speed of a sword or the safety of a weapon to their slowness. ranged weapon such as the bow. In short, the combat system of Children of Mana is reduced to a sort of decidedly repetitive hack'n'slash, which not even the Fury Mode or the spells save from monotony: if the first is simply a special power-up to be used when available for increase the speed and power of the character, sometimes enabling special attacks, and which is often ignored, the spells deserve a slightly more complex discussion. In the Mana village it is in fact possible to choose which elemental spirit to be accompanied in the next mission, and each of them allows you to take advantage of two spells: by pressing the appropriate key it is therefore possible to summon the spirit which, if left to act for a couple of seconds, will unleash an area attack spell, while by coming into contact with its sprite we will be able to enjoy the second of magic, usually an upgrade for the weapon or a healing effect. Although it is possible to enhance the various spells to obtain more effective and spectacular ones, the magic in Children of Mana is extremely cumbersome and not very effective: the attack spells are nothing more than ~smart bombs~ to be used in the most thorny situations, but in in reality, the slowness of activation makes them useless to say the least, and while you wait for the sprite to do its job it is easy to find yourself obliterated by enemy attacks; on the other hand, the magical upgrades have no influence on the player's performance, and the combat is reduced to a bit of a wander around the screen looking for a point from which to attack as many enemies as possible with the same weapon, trying not to get involved in the ~ping pong~ mechanism that causes enemies to collide and bounce against each other for additional damage, at the end of an attack, and which often ends up damaging the player as well. Fortunately, the monotonous battle system is made a little more intriguing by the system that allows you to customize it according to the player's tastes: by using gems and placing them in a special container, it is possible to obtain additional effects and bonuses, which vary a little the attacks and the power of our protagonist. Respecting the space ofavailable and inserting the right gems, you can choose, for example, whether to increase our physical or magical strength, or perhaps take advantage of the space necessary to insert the relative gems and use another one that adds a special effect to our attacks instead. The combinations are several, and the variety from that point of view is not lacking, too bad that repeating the same dungeons by pressing the same key almost endlessly really weakens this good idea. Italian adaptation Two words deserves the Italian language adaptation of the game. The texts in most cases are flowing and free of typos, genuinely enjoyable, which is quite rare in this environment. However, the translation of some terms, which is not necessary and which probably tries to mimic adaptations such as that of Harry Potter, leaves us stunned. Perhaps Salamander in Salamander or Dryad in Driade are acceptable, but if Shadow becomes Darkness for a choice of elegance, one is stunned by Wisp transformed into Ciuffolo (which does not make any sense), Undine into Ondina (so much for mythology) or even worse the funny Dudbear become... Sarchiaponi. Let's drop a pitiful veil on the rest, it's better. Revival of Mana? From a technical point of view, fortunately Children of Mana is a real gem, but with rivals like Tales of the Tempest or Final Fantasy III, not to mention the imminent Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, the two-dimensional realization begins to feel the weight of the years, although the nostalgic choice to refer to Sword of Mana and Legend of Mana is clear. The design of the environments and the artwork of the characters perfectly render the fairy-tale atmosphere of the world of Mana, and it really seems to have entered a fairytale book, thanks also to the perfect choice of colors and the detail of the sprites, perhaps a little small but rich in animations, even if the bosses stand out for their size, really menacing. It is a pity that the dungeons are few and have the same graphic pattern from location to location, varying only in the structure of the labyrinth and in the type of enemies. On the sound side, the excellent music strikes for its quality and clarity, decidedly composed with care even if sometimes it tends to repeat itself a bit too much. Thumbs down for the sound effects, however, reminiscent of those of the Game Boy Advance: often crude and annoying. The World of Mana project seems to start with some hesitation: after the discreet but moving Sword of Mana, much better was expected from Children of Mana, but those same expectations have not been met. The simplicity of the story surrounds a ~dungeon crawling~ type RPG that lacks in the extreme repetitiveness and monotony of a truly archaic and not very varied combat system, cumbersome above all in the use of anything other than repeated pressure of the same key. Short and linear, Children of Mana shines a bit in the decidedly fun multiplayer mode and in the simply delightful technical realization: it will certainly appeal to those looking for a simple and thought-free ~RPG~. But still, there remains a missed opportunity for the Mana Sword to shine again in the gaming market. Pros: Technically great Simple and smooth Good multiplayer mode Cons: Outdated combat system Extremely repetitive Irrational Italian adaptation The Seiken Densetsu (literally, ~Legend of the Holy Sword~) series has been largely ignored in recent years, keeping a large number of admirers still clinging to the memory of those splendid titles that Squaresoft produced for the SNES more than a decade ago. In reality the progenitor was Seiken Densetsu for the very first Game Boy (in Europe known as Final Fantasy: Mystic Quest), snubbed by most as a Zelda clone due to the similar visual and playful setting, although it was distant from the Nintendo series in many respects, starting with the most complex plot and close to Final Fantasy standards. The next title, for SNES, won the hearts of gamers and became better known with the Western title Secret of Mana, still considered one of the best video games ever today. And Seiken Densetsu 3 was even better than him, a fabulous multi-narrative epic (no less than nine characters whose plots intertwined depending on the choice of the initial ~team~ of three heroes) that pushed the technical capabilities of the SNES by giving players a true masterpiece which, ironically, never made it out of Japan. In the years following the 16-bit era, the series created by Koichi Ishii made a timid appearance only on PlayStation with the fourth chapter, which in America was titled Legend of Mana (again, no European edition), better known for the particularsgreat and splendid visual rendering as well as for the playful quality. It took five years before Square, meanwhile merged with Enix, gave birth to the most recent Sword of Mana for Game Boy Advance, a remake of the historic first episode updated to modern standards: an ambiguous title, technically spectacular as playfully retro and narratively sparse . With Sword of Mana, however, the infamous ~World of Mana~ project began, a sort of revival of the series through the production of several titles dedicated to the Mana Tree and its fairy-tale world. The first ~child~ of this project is Children of Mana.", "date": "2007-01-31", "grade": null}
