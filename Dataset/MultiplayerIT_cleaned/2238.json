{"name": "Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ecco-the-dolphin-defender-of-the-future.html", "text": "Here's mission The title of the game, Ecco The Dolphin: Defender Of The Future, helps to give us an idea of the story that sees us take on the role of a wonderful dolphin named Ecco, who has the difficult task of saving not only his magnificent race but also the human one threatened by an evil species of aliens called ~the Enemies~. To accomplish this feat, Ecco must necessarily learn skills from other dolphins or friendly marine beings, he must solve puzzles and find hidden secrets, all this while exploring 30 underwater levels. One of the main defects of the Dreamcast version was the enormous difficulty for the player to move in a huge marine world with very few reference points and the complicated understanding of the proposed puzzles. Fortunately, the PS2 version features a map and a compass as well as a decidedly more calibrated level of difficulty thanks to a series of clues useful for completing the missions. Despite this, don't think it's a simple game; the level of application must be constantly high to finish the puzzles, and this still represents a high level of challenge with consequent satisfaction in case of success. However, while presenting these improvements, Ecco The Dolphin fails to give the feeling of living a ~story~, and everything is resolved in a continuous solving of the turn puzzle which in the long run could become repetitive and bore the players who try games with greater depth, while those who love difficult games, puzzles where mental effort is necessary, could find the right game to spend a large number of hours in the company of Ecco and his marine friends. A world to explore As for the technical realization, we are instead faced with one of the best audio-visual works ever made in the world of consoles. The feeling of living in a real marine world is indescribable. Everything is made to perfection and reproduced to the smallest detail. Here too the improvements compared to the DreamCast version are noticeable. First of all, the numerous and evident drops in frame rates are just an old memory, also a more accurate choice of colors takes this version a step further than the previous one. The rest of the graphics are nothing short of impressive! The world of Ecco is populated by every possible and imaginable marine species, from the smallest fish to huge whales, passing from ferocious sharks to sweet turtles, all this under a fantastic light effect given by the sun which is reflected in the water continuously movement! The textures are truly convincing and reproduce very effectively everything that a seabed represents in our imagination. Perfect frame As if that weren't enough, to frame the splendid graphic creation, the developers have included the 2 options most loved by gamers: the 16:9 option for widescreen televisions and the 60 Hz option for not losing even a frame compared to the non-European versions. To underline then the total lack of aliasing and flickering and menus and subtitles completely in Italian. I almost forgot the very successful reproduction of the dolphin Ecco, made with such care as to make it identical to a real dolphin! With him we will be able to enjoy fantastic and peaceful explorations, very fast runs and acrobatic dives, which some of you may have seen in some dolphinarium. All this thanks to a precise and quite simple control system with which, after a few minutes needed to gain confidence, we will be able to perform high school tricks, such as keeping Ecco suspended for  out of the water waving the tail to admire the outside world. Just missing the word! The sound is absolutely atmospheric, recreating very well the noises, even if very simple, of an underwater world. Even the music is of high quality, typically New Age, making it the ideal accompaniment for Ecco's adventures. In conclusion... Here's The Dolphin: Defender Of The Future is certainly not a game for everyone. Only lovers of puzzles and high difficulty can fully appreciate the game in question. Those who love frenetic games, exciting and engaging stories and immediacy will most likely get bored after a short time, wandering in this immense ocean without knowing what to do given the high difficulty, despite the efforts of the programmers in this sense. YouHowever Ecco represents a unique title of its kind and it is an experience that no game released so far can offer. Technically speaking however, to use a term ~on the subject~, Ecco The Dolphin can be defined as a ~rare pearl~ that enthusiasts absolutely cannot give up! Pros: Graphically beautiful! Mood Sound Soothing Finally an original game! Cons: Its slowness could bore those who don't like the genre High difficulty Lack of an engaging storyline A dolphin evicted! There is no doubt that Sega's decision to bring its best titles to other consoles has been a move much appreciated by PlayStation 2 owners, especially in the latter period. In fact, while the wait for the sports titles Tennis 2k2 and NBA 2k2 and above all for Virtua Fighter 4 is increasingly unsustainable, Pal versions were released almost simultaneously: Rez, HeadHunter and Ecco The Dolphin: Defender Of The Future. The latter is in fact the latest effort by Sega which has enjoyed the conversion from the now lamented Dreamcast to the PlayStation 2. Here is The Dolphin was originally born in 1995 on the legendary 16-bit Sega Megadrive developed by Appaloosa, the same ones who brought it first on Dreamcast and now on PS2. Obviously the passage on the 128-bit consoles could not go unnoticed, and the DC version had already made people cry out for its fantastic underwater scenarios. Obviously the PS2 version is no different, presenting a respectable graphic design and bringing some improvements that should make it more enjoyable than the original version, which was not without defects.", "date": "2002-02-21", "grade": null}
