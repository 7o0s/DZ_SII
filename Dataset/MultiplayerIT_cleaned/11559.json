{"name": "Warhammer 40.000: Squad Command - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/warhammer-40000-squad-command-recensione_a.html", "text": "The game After a brief introduction, a briefing will explain what the objectives of the current mission are and we will be given the opportunity to organize our team of six elements. Each of them has two slots available for weapons, and as we progress through the stages we will also be able to choose their equipment. Depending on the scenario, in fact, we may need a very strong unit in close combat and therefore we will opt to assign the terrible chain sword to a character. Or there may be great distances to cover, which would make it ideal to choose a slug or beam sniper rifle. Each weapon has a different mode of fire, so switching between them results in a radically different approach to the game. Furthermore, when choosing the equipment we will have to take into account the action points available for each soldier: there are weapons, such as the rocket launcher, which require a large number of action points to be used, therefore automatically limiting our movement capacity. We can spend our points to move and to attack, but also to do only one of the two things. This means that we will have to be very careful to position the elements of the team in the best way to accommodate any frontal assaults, and not be discovered without the possibility of finding cover because we no longer have action points available. The battle rages Most often, the purpose of missions is to eliminate all enemies on the map. We'll be able to control the action on the Nintendo DS touch screen, while on the upper screen we'll always have a tactical map that shows us the position of our units and those of the enemy at a glance. To select a team member, all we have to do is move the cursor over him with the d-pad, or ~touch~ him with the stylus; then select the point towards which we want it to move, or the enemy to attack, with visual indicators that make us understand what the cost will be in terms of action points. After doing some tests, you realize that playing with the stylus and the touch screen is an extremely cumbersome and limiting experience, so you will opt for a classic approach with the d-pad and buttons. This DS version of the game came out after the PSP one, and although it boasts the same structure seen on the PlayStation Portable, unfortunately on a technical level it makes you feel all the difference between the two consoles. Apart from the absence of the splendid animated sequences dubbed in Italian, replaced by static images with text commentary, Squad Command on Nintendo DS often ~struggles~ to run. The developers managed to manage the same scenarios and characters in a discreet way, but they necessarily had to cut something and the visual impact suffers: it is no longer possible to rotate the view (which, however, even on PSP was very limited, and frankly useless ), but above all there are evident ~jerks~ when moving quickly on the map, a clear sign that the engine is a bit at the limit of the possibilities of the Nintendo portable. The tactical map itself, displayed on the top screen, moves very jerkily and is not comparable to that of the PSP version. For the Empire! Ultimately, therefore, the technical realization of the game is a ~I wish but I can't~: analyzed individually, Warhammer 40,000: Squad Command for Nintendo DS has good graphics, but placed next to the PSP version there is really no story. Moreover, the ~tiring~ management of the scenarios and characters also affects the playability, as it is more complicated to select an element of the team and the inputs of the buttons are not readily understood. A similar argument can be made for the sound sector: the voices (in Italian) of the soldiers and enemies have been maintained, as well as the excellent music, but the reproduction quality is what it is. As for the multiplayer mode, however, nothing to say: it works very well and gives us the possibility, after completing the single game, to confront people from all over the world within some scenarios of different types. Unfortunately, just like on PSP, online challenges can also be very boring: waiting for the opponent to make his moves in the minute and a half available can be tiring, but above all, it is not possible to reach a quick conclusion due to the presence of ~ reinforcements~ for the team that can be called up after a few turns. Comment In its PSP version, Warhammer 40,000: Squad Command has proven to be a very well done strategy game, quite rich in depth and also long-lived. The developers have gone the extra mile for maKeep all these elements on Nintendo DS too, but despite the obvious ~cuts~ to the technical sector, things didn't go as planned. Let's be clear, the game is still valid and remains highly recommended for those who know the original boardgame, but it probably needed to be tested more thoroughly to identify its defects: the graphics move ~with difficulty~ and this affects the selection and management of the characters on the map, the stylus control system is practically unusable and could have been studied better, the sound is the same heard on the PSP but with a much lower quality. Ultimately, a discrete product only; with a little attention, much more could be done. Pros: Valid game system Lots of weapons and characters Online multiplayer Cons: Many graphical uncertainties... ...which also affect playability Different cuts compared to the PSP version Warhammer 40,000: Squad Command is available for Nintendo DS and PSP. The tested version is the one for Nintendo DS.", "date": "2008-03-17", "grade": null}
