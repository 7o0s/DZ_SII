{"name": "Naruto: Ultimate Ninja", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/naruto-ultimate-ninja.html", "text": "The Chronicles of the Leaf Village Naruto: Ultimate Ninja is part of a real Namco Bandai project, in the sense that it boasts a well-established game structure through the production of titles such as Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi and Knights of the Zodiac. In this sense, after the inevitable animated intro, a menu appears from which you can access the various modes available: Scenario, Mission, Training, Free Clash, Naruto's House and Shop. Let's immediately liquidate the minor ones: Training allows us to become familiar with the game control system, in particular to understand the mechanisms underlying the combos and special moves; Free Clash provides for the organization of one or more clashes between human players or against the computer, choosing any of the available characters (starting with six and reaching fourteen) and any of the locations (twelve in all), all with various degrees of customization (handicap, presence of special moves, etc.); Casa di Naruto is basically the settings screen, where you can turn off the awful English speech to select the Japanese one (the screen text is fully translated into Italian, by the way), among other things, or you can watch the various bonus items purchased in the Shop (by spending the money earned in battles and missions), i.e. movies, images, animations, cards and so on. [C] Rock Lee is; one of the most important characters; cute in the series. Denied for Chakra management, he makes up for it with physical skills and training. Kakashi certainly has the most powerful moves. hilarious... The game is inspired by the first saga of the manga. [/C] Main game modes and gameplay As you can guess, the soul of the game lies in the Scenario and Mission modes. The first is a real ~story mode~, in which you choose a character and face the related saga, with the clashes programmed according to what really happens in the manga, for a total of six fights. By completing the Scenario with Naruto, you get one of the unlockable characters and after that, you just need to complete the mode with each of the unlocked characters to get the others. In the end we will have fourteen ninjas, including alternate versions of Naruto and Sasuke. The Mission mode is the one in which it is possible to find some thickness: you choose your mission from a list that is unlocked as you proceed, and to complete it we will have to face a fight on which particular rules apply, for example example you must not only win but do it within a certain time limit, or using a special technique, etc. The game control system is truly unusual for a fighting game: a single button for the generic attack, a button for throwing shurikens or collected throwing weapons (selectable with a back button), one for jumping and one for Chakra control (spiritual energy). The parry can be performed either using the directional pad or one of the backbones. The gameplay is based on combos (there are different for each character) and pressing the right button at the right time, so we are faced with a very, very strategic approach. The first games, honestly, are disarming and you have to persevere to understand the mechanism that animates the clashes. Once you get the hang of it, Naruto: Ultimate Ninja turns into a great game, full of variables, spectacular and fast, in which the special moves have reason to be given the amount of energy they manage to subtract and therefore they don't stay there just for aesthetics. In the economy of the fights, the scenarios play a role of great importance: each of them develops on two or more levels, and it is then possible to move to another new location. By hitting the many interactive elements you can collect power ups or weapons. Finally, the special moves work in the way that is now considered standard for Namco Bandai titles: you take your opponent by surprise and then switch to a series of animations in which you have to hit a combination of buttons for the attack to have the most possible effectiveness. The system in Ultimate Ninja works much better than in Knights of the Zodiac: Hades, however. Technical realization This new Namco Bandai product boasts a respectable technical realization. The graphics are completely cel shading and work very well in the representation of the characters, also thanks to the generous use of polygons. Each clash is introduced by an animation that shows the passage from the pages of a manga to the scenario: a nice and original effect. The bulk of the graphics apparhe keeps to the locations, however, which almost always show a large number of details and many interactable objects. If it is true that two or three internships are below average, it is also true that each has a double nature. The graphics engine manages to handle everything in the best way, with a high and stable frame rate, in any situation. As far as the sound is concerned, unfortunately the music is not one that remains in mind and the speech in English is unpleasant, while the situation improves as regards the sound effects and the speech in Japanese. In short, a draw. Naruto, the manga, represents for many fans something very similar to a new Dragon Ball. Of course, there is a big difference in the degree of enthusiasm with which each new volume is approached: in the case of Dragon Ball, I distinctly remember that levels of very strong addiction were reached, and it was impossible to detach oneself from the pages until the volume was finished . Naruto in this sense fails to rival, but offers very similar themes, decidedly youthful, managing to be even more varied than Akira Toriyama's masterpiece. Created by Masashi Kishimoto, published in Italy and broadcast on our networks also in the form of anime, Naruto has enjoyed success almost everywhere or now it rightly enjoys a certain popularity, which is evident as usual with the birth of some Namco Bandai video games , the first of which is Ultimate Ninja. Comment Among Namco Bandai's new products, Naruto: Ultimate Ninja is probably one of the most successful. The numerous innovations introduced, which make this fighting game decidedly out of the ordinary, can initially scare but then translate into added value, which added to any passion for the series can really make a difference. Technically well done, average longevity, fun and quite original: what more do you want from a tie-in? Pros: Nice graphics, especially the locations Original game system Spectacular special moves Cons: No alternative mode to fights Numerous characters, but a bit too similar to each other Not only for enthusiasts, but almost", "date": "2006-12-04", "grade": null}
