{"name": "Battle Engine Aquila", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/battle-engine-aquila_b.html", "text": "Game development The game structure of Battle Engine Aquila develops hand in hand with the plot: your first missions will be a ~baptism of fire~ (to be faced after a quick tutorial) to convince the army managers of your talent. You will then begin to carry out assault and reinforcement operations, becoming familiar with the Eagle while disintegrating some Muspell armored vehicles. Once you have passed the first stages, you will join a special army corps and you will be given the opportunity to choose, before each mission, the optimal configuration for the Eagle, as well as an officer to support you. The various configurations differ substantially in the presence of certain weapons or in their greater or lesser effectiveness, while your eventual fighting partner can be selected based on your attitudes to combat in the air or on the ground. The Aquila, in the intentions of Forseti engineers, is the most powerful and versatile combat vehicle in existence. Its strong point is the possibility of acting effectively both on the ground and in the air, although the flight capacity is limited by a special bar, which is automatically recharged in land position. Between heaven and earth During one or the other phase, the control system of the vehicle remains essentially unchanged (a combination of the two analog sticks for the fundamental movements, the back buttons to fire or select the weapon, a button assigned to the transformation and a other than the activation of the thrusters for landing), but the approach to combat changes profoundly: the land position allows you to strike with precision, perhaps from a distance (there is a zoom function), and offers you greater shooting power fire, at the cost of speed and therefore making you very vulnerable; using the flying attitude, on the other hand, you can eliminate the Muspell air forces without particular problems, but your direct hits on ground vehicles will be much less precise and, don't forget it, you will have limited autonomy. Weapons change according to configuration and attitude. The ~Pulsar~ configuration, for example (the starting one, which I personally prefer), is equipped in the ground configuration with a Vulcan machine gun, a pulse cannon and a grenade launcher. In flying position, on the other hand, in addition to the Vulcan machine gun, it will only be able to use micro-missiles. Difficult or realistic? The developers of the Lost Toys team have evidently made a precise choice, as regards the ~feeling~ of the Battle Engine Aquila. Vehicle control is cumbersome, it distances itself from the man-machine symbiosis seen in titles such as ZOE in favor of a more realistic but obviously more complex approach. Proof is also given by the management of ammunition, which runs out (the weapons run out of bullets or temporarily overheat) but which can be restored - together with the energy of the shields - by reaching a specific location. The discourse of complexity is not limited to these aspects, as the missions themselves offer a strategic reading key not inclined to indiscriminate massacre. In each stage you will have primary and secondary objectives to achieve (sometimes there will also be imposing ~bosses~ to eliminate), so you will have to follow the instructions that your superiors will give you in real time to the letter, without wasting time and being careful not to expose yourself too much to enemy fire. The achievement of all the objectives will allow you to unlock ~alternative~ missions, positioned in parallel with the normal ones in the graphical representation of your path towards the final resolution of the conflict. Given the presence of a two-player mode, it goes without saying that overcoming the various missions will give you extra scenarios in which to set up your deathmatches or collaborative operations. Technical aspect The graphics of Battle Engine Aquila boasts a large number of polygons and is powered by a well-crafted engine. The Forseti and Mospell vehicles have been made in a fairly detailed way, but above all they are very numerous in some stages and will really give you the feeling of being in a large conflict. The settings are not very varied, but this defect is justified by the scenario in which you move. The sound offers little substance between music and effects, but is enriched by a large number of spoken phases. As for this aschest, it must be said that the game has been completely localized in Italian: voices, texts and even the alarms of the Eagle! A praise to Infogrames Italia for the excellent work done. In summary... Battle Engine Aquila is a well-made title, which boasts a respectable technical realization and a solid plot even if not very original. The technical approach of the game and its complexity make it suitable for gamers more prone to reasoned action than frenetic shooting. Even these are not lacking, however Pros: ~Alternative~ missions to unlock Great depth Completely in Italian Cons: Not suitable for arcade lovers Non-immediate control system Some slowdowns Forseti and Muspell The more the resources of a planet are lacking, the greater the risk of creating conflicts to have the total prerogative. A rather current concept, which we find in the new Activision title: following the upheaval of the ecosystem of their planet, Forseti and Muspell clash for control of what remains, giving life to yet another bloody war. The reckless Hawk Winter, undefeated illegal racing champion, is chosen by the Forseti army to pilot an innovative and fearsome weapon of war: the Eagle. The clash with the Muspells is in a delicate phase, and unfortunately there isn't the material time to properly instruct a person to control the new vehicle, which just happens to be equipped with a command system very similar to the one Hawk is used to always used to. As this character, it will be up to you to help the Forseti faction (which, to be honest, won't leave you much choice) to get the upper hand over their usual enemies!", "date": "2003-02-10", "grade": null}
