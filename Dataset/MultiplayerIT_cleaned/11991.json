{"name": "Halo 3 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/halo-3-recensione.html", "text": "Everything and the opposite of everything has been said about Halo 2: that it was a disruptive success; which has indelibly marked online gaming on consoles; which was one of the most beloved games of the last generation of hardware; which had a single player campaign that was a bit slow and with a disappointing ending for some. The day after tomorrow Halo 3, the third chapter of the saga, is released worldwide and, after having played extensively and finished the campaign, we are preparing to tell you about the impressions aroused by the single player and the cooperative mode, one of the flagships of this chapter. Looking forward to having thoroughly explored all aspects of multiplayer and online. The end of the journey. With Halo 3 the canonical four difficulty levels are back to choose from before launching with the Master Chief and the Arbyter in the hunt for the Prophets, the artifact (or alienfact, more correctly) that they are looking for in the middle of Africa and, of course, Cortana , inseparable virtual companion of our hero. The adventures of the ~Chief~ have always changed radically depending on whether you face them on an Easy, Normal, Heroic or Legendary level, but this time even more, given that Bungie, after the criticisms of the second episode, gave a jolt to the Campagna, making it compact, full of different locations, almost completely devoid of backtracking, but shorter. On a Normal level it takes less than ten hours to make this journey that brings the epic of the Flood and the Covenant to a worthy conclusion, with a crescendo of situations and some truly epic moments, which we don't have the heart to mention anything about, but which we are sure they will delight any Halo fan, but also those who immerse themselves in this universe for the first time. As on other occasions, however, it is on Heroic and Legendary that the AI of the Brutes and Grunts becomes insidious, perfidious, so much so as to make the simple hand grenades almost useless, given that the opponents throw themselves on the ground, make pirouettes and they repair themselves to avoid any damage, often succeeding. There are no obstacles or shelters of any kind that can prevent him from coming to find us and, once he becomes familiar with the paraphernalia and controls, the game manages to be exciting in many situations. Especially also thanks to the possibilities offered by the new incarnation of the engine that spews dozens of opponents on the screen at the same time. The gameplay of Halo has remained largely unchanged from previous episodes, but some of the maps really get the feeling that they are among the best born from Bungie, not to mention a precise balance between sections on foot, in flight and on board the vehicles on wheels. Not to be underestimated, however, is the introduction of new weapons, including the gravitational hammer of the Brutes, already seen in the series, but only now usable also in multiplayer, which throws any object and opponent around the screen; or the new Spiker pistols, truly deadly especially for the blade mounted under the barrel which makes them perfect in close combat when you run out of ammunition. The insertion of accessories such as the bubble-shaped energy shield also works, which creates an area where you cannot be hit by any projectile or bomb, forcing the Brutes to enter close combat, or the energy regenerator which creates a zone in which anyone who is in sees their defense shield restored. They work because even the Brutes are able to use them just as effectively, managing to create ever-changing situations. Unfortunately, the allied marines of Master Chief cannot be said to be equally intelligent, completely irrelevant on the battlefield and disastrous in driving the vehicles, so much so as to force the player to personally take care of controlling them. Unless you want to find yourself running in circles at the mercy of the shots of the pursuing Wraiths or Ghosts. Fortunately, the Covenant Elite and the Arbyter take care of rebalancing the situation, especially in the final stages of the game. Co-op, multipliers and skulls! The most striking novelty of the Halo 3 campaign is the introduction of the four-player cooperative mode in split screen, system link and via Xbox Live. This alone is already able to guarantee a nice boost to longevity, but as if that weren't enough Bungie has put its own with one of those touches that leave their mark. From the options it is possible to unlock the activation of the Score, which can be in Team or All against all. For each killing, for each enemy killed during any level, each player who participates in the game receives points, which go to determine a total that ends up in a ranking, individual or in teams, in fact (each death, on the other hand, leads to a penalty of 25 points). The points scored arethen, augmented by a series of multipliers, one of which, for example, is inversely proportional to the time taken to complete a level. Once the Campaign Score has been activated, the timer appears at the bottom right which marks the minutes that have elapsed since the start of the stage and the relative multiplier which starts from 3 and goes down to 0, once a precise limit has been exceeded. But the real gimmick is having scattered skulls throughout the stages that must be found and collected as if they were weapons. Each of these gives the possibility to activate penalties from a special menu, such as the disappearance of the viewfinder, for example, for all participants in the co-op game, or the doubling of penalties for each death. The greater the number of skulls/penalties activated, the greater the multiplier for the score of the individual or team, which will be encouraged to test themselves to unlock the objectives that require the achievement of at least 15,000 points for each level. Considering that a player usually accumulates between 2000 and 3000 points, the multipliers of the skulls become necessary to fill the gap between the 8000 and 12000, normally obtainable by a full team, and those necessary to achieve the objective. Among other things, the skulls are certainly not easy to find, given the size of the maps, and to find them all it will take a lot of patience and time. Here too, several achievements are provided as further gratification for the players. Of course, provided you have friends to take home or an Xbox Live subscription. Means of future motion In Halo the vehicles have always represented one of the spearheads and this chapter is no exception. In addition to all the old vehicles, the Brute Choppers make an appearance, the Brute motorcycles that can sprint with a thruster and fire front-mounted cannons. The Choppers really go everywhere and allow spectacular stunts between clouds of dust and particles that arise from the crashes. Also nice is the Prowler, a kind of Brute sled with a cannon mounted on the back. The light of Halo This will undoubtedly be the sector of Halo 3 that will cause the most discussion. The first two levels are perplexing, because apart from the HDR, the excellent lighting system and the water that ripples and even breaks into small waves when the current is interrupted by any solid body, there are some elements that do not convince. In fact, the great protagonists of the scene are the soldiers and the narrow spaces of a forest (albeit beautiful) and of an underground base recovered as a fort. The models of the human characters are few, even in the cut scenes, and the underground base is littered with trucks and freight elevators that can only make you turn up your nose at the few polygons they are made of. Going forward, however, the maps open up, the number of enemies increases exponentially and with them the lights and explosions that fill the screen almost never slowing down. Some clashes are certainly to be remembered, especially those with the Scarabs, huge quadrupedal means that had appeared in Halo 2 and which here must be tamed and destroyed, climbing on them as they continue to walk, jolting the view and the Brutes who guide them. We witnessed excited scenes with a Ghost splashed from a hill and planted himself inside the belly of the Scarab, while we had just climbed trying to eliminate the guard soldiers, and all around a good number of marines supported us aboard the Moongose and the Warthog, motorcycles and jeeps from Halo. Given the frenzy and speed, only thanks to the replay options can you really understand everything the Halo 3 engine can do between one explosion and another, but rest assured that the Bungie game is capable of hit with several well-placed blows. Unfortunately, the aliasing that appears above all in some scenes and which, if it fades almost completely in VGA, is quite evident in Component, at least on the panel we tested. Many words could be spent on the Halo soundtrack, but here it is enough to say that it is confirmed as one of the best ever and that manages to mark the times of the game, with impetus when needed, or with melancholy in the most touching scenes. Still in the context of a sci-fi blockbuster like Halo, of course. Campaign comment The single player campaign of Halo 3 is the worthy culmination of a series that, undoubtedly, has marked the history of FPS on consoles and which is inextricably linked to the Xbox brand. As in a great Hollywood blockbuster, the plot proceeds along the classic science fiction canons that have always inspired Bungie, but with twists and turns that will captivate Master Chief fans from start to finish,also thanks to an increasingly sumptuous soundtrack. The cooperative mode is what is needed to give longevity to a game that is completed in less than 10 hours, but which will hardly be abandoned after a single passage, even if only to test yourself with the highest difficulties. At the end, we can only savor the sensations left us by a game that seems to have everything it takes to become the most loved of the Halo trilogy. The most complete game ever made by Bungie. On the following pages: Cinema, multiplayer and voting! Everyone to the cinema One of the slogans that accompanied the launch of Halo 3 was certainly the now well-known ~With Love, Bungie~ and the most evident result of this can only be the photos and videos that can be obtained from any game played with Master Chief and Arbyter, both in the campaign and in multiplayer. After years of Halo 2, the only thing left in the hands of fans were stats and memories of the most frenetic games. Now, however, thousands of images, in many cases far more beautiful than those officially released by Bungie, are carpeting community forums around the world. After each session, the replays remain in the console's memory in the form of movies that can be watched at any time, even online with other friends like in a virtual cinema. While watching, which can be accelerated and stopped at will from a special menu (rewinding, on the other hand, is a bit more cumbersome), it is possible to take screenshots which are immediately passed on to the player profile on the www.bungie.net website, from here downloaded to PC and disclosed on the internet thanks to image hosting sites (or transferred to Xbox 360). During the replays you can unhook from Master Chief and roam freely with the camera for the levels, which are all kept in memory, thus allowing you to take glimpses, sometimes really suggestive, from any angle and point of view. A headshot that determined an online match or a feat that left friends and opponents dumbfounded are no longer entrusted to delusional stories, but to images to be shared and voted on in what is a small revolution for the world of consoles and the way of convey the emotions of those who play it on the net. Everyone to the cinema A forge of ideas There was much talk about it before the launch of the game and now that the Forge has opened, it is clear that it will take months to understand its exact contours. Bungie has added a real-time map editor to Halo 3's online modes, where any player can, at any time, transform into a metal ball and fly around modifying game elements. From the means available, from the respawn points, to the crates and weapons, always respecting a limit of items that can be manipulated; any of the participants can drop a Ghost in front of it, for example, return to the field and use it at will. Or at least until another player intervenes by taking it off or carrying it around and then making it fall to the ground with hilarious results. This is the basis of the Forge, which however also allows you to create offline maps and share them with other users, even changing the energy shield's recharge capacity, the length of the players' jump or the visibility on the Spartan radar and the Covenant. A configuration in which only the host is able to intervene on the editor is even conceivable, while the other players battle it out divided into two distinct teams. Like a sort of table-top role-playing Game Master, who engages in setting the rules of a God Game disguised as an fps. The perplexing aspect, however, is that it is not possible to start matchmaking in this mode, which can only be played with friends and players recently met on Halo. It therefore becomes difficult to convince others to try the possibilities it undoubtedly offers and, certainly, it would have been easier for the more daring to return to the fray after having experienced the thrill of the Forge with randomly met players around the net, learning tricks and secrets that would spread like wildfire. By doing so, it will take much longer for players to get used to it. And this will probably only happen after the 11 maps available for the classic modes have been stripped and digested, seasoned as they are with a gameplay that makes you feel immediately at home. Apart from the introduction of gadgets, which we have already talked about, and small adjustments, in fact, Halo's multiplayer has remained substantially unchanged. There is a much stronger emphasis placed on melee clashes, much more decisive than before, and an e", "date": "2007-09-24", "grade": null}
