In truth, the almost Zen simplicity of its structure and the austerity of its graphic elements don't seem to have much to do with the audio-visual chaos of the mythical neighborhood in the Japanese capital, even if something of its spirit shines through in the game , especially when the pace starts to get frantic. The first chapter was released some time ago on the App Store, receiving a good reception albeit from a niche of the public, without however being able to leave its mark that much, considering that many probably will not know it. However, Nevercenter has kept the original concept in store while waiting for better times, cleaning and refining it until it reaches the right evolution: here is Shibuya Grandmaster, which also arrives in a propitious period presenting itself as a perfect pastime in view of the summer, given the ~prt--porter~ essence of the gameplay, extremely simple and immediate and perfect for quick and repeated sessions in any situation. In essence, it is a variant of the oldest videogame puzzle game concept, namely the one that concerns the arrangement of blocks that inexorably fall from the top of the screen and accumulate on the bottom until they fill all the available space, with the need to eliminate them somehow. The way in question is just as classic, that is the good old association by color of contiguous blocks, obviously with the application of multipliers and progressive levels by carrying out concatenations and combos of associations between falling blocks. Note that the game is completely free to play and the only in-app purchases are the totally optional custom backgrounds, which makes the download of the game highly recommended for any user. If you think that matching blocks by color is obsolete, Shibuya Grandmaster might surprise you The road to perfection Shibuya Grandmaster gives the player rather limited choices, or at least this is the initial impression if we start from the perspective of other similar puzzle games, but the structure is still deep and well thought out overall. The screen, placed vertically, progressively fills with falling rectangles from above and the player is required to color them with a simple touch. The colors cannot be chosen and are assigned by the CPU in a sequence visible in a corner of the screen, which allows a strategic approach on the order of the next three or four rounds, but time is running out because once deposited the rectangles can no longer be colored and in this case they are eliminated only by associating an adjacent sequence of equal colours. The aim of the game is to make the rectangles disappear by placing those of the same color on top of each other, which is obviously made more complex by the alternation of the colors proposed by the CPU among those that can be used. Progressive combos require quite complex planning as, ideally, they would need colors placed in an alternating ~sandwich~ manner, in such a way as to trigger a chain of color pairs from the center to the outer edges, something not easy to do given also the limited time available to decide how to arrange the blocks. The race for the high score that characterizes this genre of games is also amplified here by the particular progressive degree system that rewards the player, in the event that a series of objectives are gradually achieved, with increasingly advanced titles up to the ~ Grandmaster~ of the title. Again, a simple but highly effective solution to provide an additional stimulus to improve again. The simple and functional mechanism of the gameplay is perfectly supported and integrated by a clean and highly elegant technical realization, which manages to make even the simple representation of numbers and colored rectangles pleasant with a style that recalls similar games such as Lumines and Meteos.", "date": "2015-08-19", "grade": "8.2"}
