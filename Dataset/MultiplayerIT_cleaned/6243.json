Here, perhaps the blue things are a metaphorical representation of the French. But parochialism aside, this frog is particular, it is trained in the arts of the ninja, and therefore manages to free itself with a certain ease. Freeing yourself, however, is one thing, escaping from Fran... that is, from the world of so blue, quite another. Nitrome's latest production talks about frogs and martial arts: how not to be fatally intrigued? Burgundian frog And this is where we obviously come into play, who for 65 levels have to accompany the dear frog among many obstacles and enemies. The gameplay is similar to that of other Nitrome products, with the protagonist who, expertly directed by our finger, can only move along the main directions. Being then a frog, theoretically it adheres perfectly to surfaces, and being moreover also a ninja, it is enough for him to simply come into contact with an enemy to eliminate him by showing off his fearsome flying kick. So far we have described what might seem like a typical action game, but in reality the level design is structured in such a way as to configure a real puzzle: the levels consist in fact of a single screen in which the arrangement of the various platforms/surfaces, enemies and all the numerous particular elements - various obstacles such as jets of fire, surfaces that cannot be adhered to, others that vice versa are extremely adhesive and from which one cannot jump, movable blocks, switches, certain opponents who instead of standing still move to the movement of the frog and so on - which are gradually introduced with a certain wisdom, should theoretically lead to one of those situations in which it is necessary to study the level and plan the strategy before each move, under penalty of being unable to eliminate all blue monsters in case of some wrong movement. Ninja frogs to the rescue We say ~theoretically~ because in reality only some of the stages really have this characteristic, the others, most of them, are structured in such a way as to be able to follow various paths and to always have the possibility of completing them without having to start over. It is most likely a deliberate choice since, given the context and the realization of the whole, even going ahead, let's say so, at random, can be fun especially if understood as a pure unpretentious pastime, but it is nevertheless a pity, a bit because a game that always requires you to keep your brain on and wide awake would have been far more significant, partly because there doesn't seem to be a precise criterion in the tare of the difficulty curve: it can happen, for example, to face a very difficult level, which demands a strategic thinking of a certain stature and does not forgive mistakes, and find some internship after a rather trivial one in which you simply have to move the protagonist at random to get the better of all the antagonists. This is the main defect of a production which is otherwise always satisfactory, especially if taken in small doses, as is appropriate for a mobile environment. This not only for the freshness and immediacy of the gameplay, but also for the technical and artistic realization. Not that the first makes you cry out for a miracle, it is a fairly basic 2D that will not test even the most ancient processors, but which perfectly conveys all the sympathy and madness of the artistic direction, a colorful and fun parody of all possible and imaginable clichs on martial arts both visually and sonicly. Above all, the excellent combination of the use of vibration and sound effects should be underlined, which when hitting an enemy give a certain satisfaction, a subtlety that underlines the care taken. Finally, Green Ninja: Year of the Frog is a totally free game that adopts the policy of in-game advertising. They are not too invasive either, but if you want to get rid of them the asking price is certainly not prohibitive.", "date": "2015-06-27", "grade": "7.6"}
