In fact, the game puts us at the head of a dynasty of merchants, who under our guidance will have to be able to conquer the commercial leadership in his continent, in the historical period that belongs to him. The game is divided into episodes, similar to Zeus, each of which is dedicated to a particular civilization and a particular historical period such as Ammurabi's Mesopotamia, the Egyptian and Roman Empires, the European Middle Ages and so on, up to the dawn of the industrial revolution. For example, one of the earliest game scenarios is set in China around 1700 BC. and covers a period of 600 years, after which your dynasty is expected to achieve a number of goals, such as establishing a profitable silk trade route between two very distant settlements, building a network of canals, or reaching a remote mine of precious minerals to be resold to the highest bidder. The game is therefore articulated across 4 continents for a period of more than 4000 years, gradually making available about 30 different units, including merchants and means of transport and more than 200 structures, ranging from the humble weavers' workshop to the more grandeur of the pyramids, up to the more modern buildings of the 19th century. The main course: the gameplay Playing Trade Empires certainly doesn't mean deciding on trade routes and then sitting around watching your bank account skyrocket. First of all we will have to hire the best merchants on the market, choosing them among those who possess the skills useful for our needs (ability to travel in the absence of roads, particular propensity for the traffic of luxury goods, etc.), providing them with the most convenient means of transport relatively to the historical period and technological advances that you will have acquired as you progress through the game. We will then have to worry about infrastructure, providing for the construction of paths, roads, railways, ports and shipyards, as well as the opening of new markets in order to promote the growth of cities and attract new potential buyers of our goods. In the event that we find ourselves in difficulty in attracting buyers, we will always be able to invest part of our capital in buildings useful to the community, which will not only attract new inhabitants, but will themselves represent a user base that will constantly be willing to buy certain goods. An example is the construction of a religious temple, to which we can then sell wood, furniture and tools. And speaking of goods, it will always be the player's task to search for sources of raw materials, such as mines, agricultural fields and sheep pastures and subsequently provide for their transformation into finished products (iron tools, food, clothes) so that they can be sent to the markets that need it, after once again establishing the appropriate trade routes. The outline: graphics and sound Functional. This is perhaps the adjective that best fits what Trade Empires makes appear on our monitors. The interface is really well structured, allowing with just a few clicks to access all the parameters and options we have control over, from the list of trade routes, to the quantity and kind of goods required by a particular market, arriving at visualizing the amount of money carried by each individual merchant. The game's graphics are perhaps too static and essential, when compared to other titles of the genre, but it still does its job very well, even if a greater amount of animations could have made it more attractive. On the sound front however, promotion with full marks. Although the effects are a bit repetitive, the music is well done and catchy and the attempt to dedicate a characteristic musical theme to each civilization that we will get to know is commendable. Conclusions for dessert Trade Empires is not a game for everyone. Conclusions for dessert As you may have noticed by reading the review, it is certainly not a product made to attract attention with bombastic special effects and killer graphics. We could say that it is a 100% substance game, a product intended not for the usual circle of ~enthusiasts~, but for that of ~inveterate enthusiasts~, those who have made their daily bread of management titles and who in this title they will find enoughhard on their teeth. So if you feel like a manager and you're not afraid of a title with a decidedly high learning curve (even for its genre) buy it and give it a go! From the creators of Imperialism I and II, a new thoroughbred of the management genre hits the shelves: will we be able to build a commercial empire capable of crossing the oceans of time unscathed?", "date": "2001-11-24", "grade": null}
