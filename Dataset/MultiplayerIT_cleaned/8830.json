{"name": "Sonic CD", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/97324-sonic-cd-velocita-massima.html", "text": "Version tested: iPhone The Mega CD was a very interesting peripheral, but apart from an advertising campaign bordering on fraud (~16 bit plus 16 bit equals 32 bit~?) it had very little chance of making it big. Primarily because of the price: 599,000 lire, which aren't bruscoletti now, let alone back then; secondly due to the lack of a line-up with the numbers and quality necessary to push sales, enticing the children and adolescents of the time to annoy their parents to see the full motion video sequences of Night Trap or try your hand at the ~arcade perfect~ conversion of Final Fight. In fact, many publishers limited themselves to re-proposing their titles with the addition of some extra elements to take advantage of the greater capacity of the CD-ROM format, and this made the Mega CD anything but ~exclusive~ in playful terms. Speaking of exclusives, however, SEGA created one that actually exploited the peripheral properly, focusing precisely on the possibility of playing with the size of the levels, as well as proposing different variations following the dynamics of the gameplay. We are obviously talking about Sonic CD: an episode of extraordinary importance for the classic series of the blue hedgehog, which returns today on all platforms, iPhone and iPad included, with a version faithful to the original but equipped with some new features such as the graphic adaptation to the wide format, the double soundtrack (American and Japanese) and the character of Tails that is unlocked once the adventure is completed. Run, Sonic! But also not Anyone who knows Sonic knows of his ability to run at supersonic speed, a characterizing element of all video games dedicated to him. Video games which, however, have progressively enjoyed a ~double personality~, lending themselves both to very rapid exploration, in a sort of speed run towards the finish line of each stage, and to slower and more prudent sessions, in search of bonuses and hidden objects. Sonic CD focuses on the latter approach in a particular way, given the degree of extension of the scenarios, and therefore sees us slow down rather than run at breakneck speed, use springs and trampolines to project ourselves up and check if a particular wall hides a secret passage. The seven areas that make up the game, each divided into three acts (the third of which is represented by a boss fight against the evil Dr. Robotnik), have flags which, once ~activated~, allow us to travel to the past or in the future and therefore to face the same internship in three different versions. Collecting at least fifty rings before reaching the end of a location also allows us to access a sort of alternative dimension in which the character can move in three dimensions, eliminate opponents and collect more rings. In short, in this episode more than ever the Sonic the Hedgehog experience can be lived in various ways, guaranteeing excellent longevity for the product. Of course, the historical limits of the series have also been reproduced in a faithful way, for example it can happen to run into a sudden death because there is a trap at the end of a tunnel and we are suddenly left without rings (which represent the only Sonic's defense to not perish from any attack suffered). Furthermore, the touch controls, although precise and well implemented, sometimes tend to ~enchant~, putting us in serious difficulty during the most complicated situations. For the rest, the graphics are practically those of 1993 but stand the weight of time well (apart from the repetitiveness of the plots), while the soundtrack is still very enjoyable, especially the original Japanese one.
