{"name": "Dracin: la recensione dellavventura per PSVR", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/deracine-recensione-psvr.html", "text": "When we see FromSoftware's name pop up in a review, we automatically associate it with the Dark Souls series, forgetting that the story of this Japanese team goes far beyond the works of recent years. The studio led by Hidetaka Miyazaki has in fact been carrying on its activity since 1986, from which it has also created titles of a different genre than Bloodborne and colleagues. Going back to the 90s it is in fact possible to find titles such as Echo Night, an exponent of the adventure genre to which FromSoftware has returned with Dracin, a game that also marks the debut of the Tokyo boys on PlayStation VR, as well as a new collaboration by them with the ubiquitous Japan Studio. A work with a strong poetic vein, as we have seen during our previous meetings, with respect to which we can now analyze it completely also from the point of view of its use of the virtual reality viewer. After spending the last weekend in the company of Dracin, here's what came of it. Playstation 4 trophies Dracin brings with him seventeen PlayStation Trophies, quite generous in terms of quality. In fact, Platinum can be obtained in a simple way even by completing the game only once, performing all the necessary actions to take home the eight Gold-type trophies and eight Silver-type trophies that complete the list. However, we strongly advise you not to take a look at the latter before completing Dracin, to avoid even quite heavy spoilers on the story. The plot: fragments in time Dracin is set in a boarding school in an unspecified era, even if its characteristics strongly link it to the classic English ones. Three boys and three girls live inside the structure, together with the elderly director who takes care of organizing their everyday life. Everyone's existence changes when there are some sightings of a spirit (us) within the boarding school, or rather of a kind of benevolent fairy with whom the six boys gradually become friends. Even if overlapping, the world of humans and that of spirits have different laws: one of these differences concerns time, which flows normally in the first while in the second it remains motionless. There is no way for the spirit to interact directly with those in the boarding school, but to get in touch with the six boys and the director, however, their memories can be collected, imprinted in the parallel dimension in the form of shadows. Memories represent an important trace to use one's powers to influence the world of humans, thus demonstrating one's presence even to the most skeptical. This is precisely the objective of the first chapter of Dracin, where you have to insert a series of herbs into a soup being prepared in the kitchen, taking them from hidden places to prove to all the boys the presence that is at their side. From that moment, the initial part of the adventure is dedicated to deepening the growing bond between the six pre-adolescents and the spirit, often called into question by them to obtain favors or even carry out playful teasing within the boarding school. Being careful not to reveal anything else to avoid entering the minefield of spoilers, we limit ourselves to saying that from a certain point on the events of the story will change in their theme, making the spirit an integral part of a story told through fragments made up of memoirs mentioned above and some written notes, to be collected and listened to (or read) carefully to better understand what is happening inside Dracin. The central part of the plot does not fail to put those with a helmet on their head a little tense, above all thanks to the bond built in the initial one. As events unfold their course, the epilogue becomes a bit phoned, but that doesn't mean that Dracin's story isn't still worth watching. The gameplay: around the boarding school The only type of control allowed to play Dracin is the one that requires the possession of two PlayStation Moves, through which we can mimic the hands of the spirit that we interpret in the first person. The movement instead takes place only in the form of teleportation, with the possibility of rotating the view at predefined angles as we are now used to doing in virtual reality. Giving up free walking eliminates any possible discomfort due to it, even if we must say that in some moments we would have liked to have it available to walk some stretches a little faster, avoiding constantly pressing the central button of the counterller. However, the decision to place stakes gave us the idea that the developers wanted to strengthen the idea of static time in the world of spirits in this way too, removing as much as possible the concept of movement from the dynamics of Dracin. Going further, the rest of the controls are mainly related to the interaction of the spirit that we interpret with the surrounding world. While it is true that we cannot interact directly with the boys, we can still steal objects from them or make them find others, using the powers we are endowed with to solve the ~puzzles~ that Dracin places before us. The use of quotation marks is obviously wanted as the dynamics of the game are all quite guided, without the need to particularly rack your brains to continue the story. When you happen to get stuck it is because you haven't paid attention to a memory or a note, but in addition to the possibility of going back to examining them, you still have a tool available which most of the time tells you quite explicitly what to do, thus solving the problem. root situation. At this point we rejoin our past doubts about limited interaction with surrounding objects, which we now understand was intended by the developers so as not to divert the player from the main track. For those who understand the genre of adventures as something to bang your head on, Dracin will therefore be quite simple throughout the six to seven hours (depending on the attention you intend to pay to the details) necessary for its completion, after which probably someone will catalog this title among the so-called walking simulators rather than among the adventures. After playing it, our feeling is that the developers could have been more daring in the puzzles to solve, without compromising the atmosphere of Dracin or the pace of its story. Graphics and sound: it is like autumn leaves on the trees Dracin takes place predominantly at the same time as it reaches the public, pointing the calendar back and forth only on the occasion of a few particular events. The choice of autumn is by no means accidental, given Hidetaka Miyazaki's desire to offer the player a strong sense of melancholy and loneliness, dictated by the detachment of the spirit from the world of humans. The same word that gives the game its name, Dracin, literally translated from French identifies those who, having left their environment, feel uprooted and disoriented in their new place. Green light therefore to trees covered with yellow leaves and a heavy sepia filter, which makes the images of the game similar to those of old yellowed photographs. It is precisely to the latter that our mind goes as we explore the boarding school, with the complicity of the static nature of time in the world of the spirit making everything extremely distant and melancholy. The strength of Dracin is undoubtedly the atmosphere, fueled by FromSoftware and Japan Studio also through a soundtrack that perfectly accompanies the various moments that make up the story, up to obviously embracing us in the final scene. It is no coincidence that the Collector's Edition of Dracin (available only in Japan) contains the various songs in physical format.", "date": "2018-11-05", "grade": "7.0"}
