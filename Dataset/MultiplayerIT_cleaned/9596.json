The Electronic Arts franchise has always focused on spectacular action, adapting the structure of its episodes to the technical capabilities of the platforms on which they were intended to run. It is therefore clear that the developers have found it difficult to deal with the Wii, a system capable of great things from the point of view of interaction but evidently backward in terms of computational capacity. Insisting on redesigning products made for next-generation consoles in a poorer guise has proved to be a questionable strategy, and it's no wonder that the best chapter ever to appear on the Wii, Need for Speed: Nitro, is the only one to be completely unrelated to HD incarnations of the series. In that case it was decided to use a cartoonish style, with cars with huge wheels that darted very fast within well-designed cities, despite their architectural simplicity. While referring to the excellent episode released for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and PC, Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit, in its Wii version, does not make the mistake of taking a step back and instead tries the ~middle way~ card. offering us a racing game with a different structure and ambitions, but undoubtedly with large numbers and good playability. Net of the shortcomings, of course. Leave the wheel at home Like all recent Wii titles, Hot Pursuit supports any type of configuration regarding the control system. We can therefore play holding the Wii-mote horizontally (or, better, use a steering wheel-shaped adapter), connect the Nunchuk to drive via the analog stick, resort to the more conventional solution offered by the Classic Controller or even recover a GameCube controller . Let's say right away that the last method turns out to be the best ever, given the quality of the device and the presence of two excellent analog triggers. The Classic Controller follows closely, which as already mentioned on other occasions suffers due to the not very ergonomic line but above all due to the poor quality of the keys, equipped with a stroke that is anything but fluid. A ~classic~ experience from many points of view, certainly far from the prerogatives of the Wii, but in the end there's nothing you can do: it works better. Using the Wii-mote / Nunchuk combo is in hindsight the only viable solution if we don't have an alternative controller: the analog stick appears reliable, while the accelerator placed on the B trigger on one side benefits from the analog input, from other is uncomfortable in the long run. Finally, we come to what on paper should have been the configuration closest to driving reality: the Wii-mote held horizontally, preferably placed in a steering wheel-shaped adapter. There is nothing wrong with this solution, in the sense that the management of the brake and the accelerator is simple and immediate, just as the device perceives the inclination well and translates it faithfully on the screen. What just doesn't work is the behavior of the car during the drift, which like it or not is one of the key elements of the gameplay of Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit. The problem isn't so much sliding the car as correcting its trajectory once you're in the middle of a powerslide: using only the Wii-mote, the maneuver becomes really complicated and frustrating. Little globetrotter Preferably armed with a Classic Controller, therefore, we can access three different game modes: a local multiplayer (unfortunately no online) for up to four players in split-screen, a fast race with stipulation and track of your choice or The carreer. The latter constitutes the fulcrum of Hot Pursuit, thanks to the large number of unlockable cars and the presence of five different locations, divided in turn into four sections, each containing four single races (apart from the boss fight, which occupies a ~section~). Quite a few things to do, in short! The scenarios are Chongqing, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Las Vegas and the Grand Prix, and alternate cross-sections of the city and rough areas, urban roads and ring roads, in a well-assorted mix of closed circuits and linear tracks. The individual races that must be tackled in each area boast a different stipulation from time to time: the ~Hot Pursuit~ events are presented as simple speed races for a variable number of competitors, in which to win it is enough to cross the finish line first; ~Eliminator~ is instead an intense and exciting challenge that is regulated by a timer ridonante, which eliminates the car in the last position on expiry; ~Hora di Rush~ sees us face as many as one hundred opponents at the same time, with the aim of overcoming a certain number before each checkpoint; finally, the battle with the bosses is based on reaching some checkpoints before the other car, trying to guess the right road on the map to get there first. In the ~quick game~ there is also the ~Interceptor~ mode, in which you put on the police uniform and launch yourself into spectacular ~Chase H.Q.~-style races, i.e. with the task of ramming and stopping a certain number of outlaw drivers . All this is accompanied by a technical realization only slightly higher than the (very bad) average of Wii games: low polygonal count, simple colors, few textures and some slowdown in the most agitated phases. However, the action flows quickly and the soundtrack is interesting at times.", "date": "2010-12-03", "grade": "7.2"}
