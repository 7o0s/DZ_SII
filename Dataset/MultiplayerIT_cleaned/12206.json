{"name": "GripShift - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gripshift-recensione.html", "text": "From PSP to PlayStation 3 As the levels progress, there are more and more puzzle elements inserted to make driving even more difficult, such as magnetic fields, air jets and so on. These features make Gripshift a sort of racing-platform, and it is no coincidence that in the ~challenge mode~ the goal will not simply be to reach the finish line before the opponents or set a record time, but to collect all the numerous stars scattered along the course or the Gripshift icons. The curiosity of the driving model is that, in spite of any law of physics, it allows players to accelerate and brake even in the air (!), very useful practices for correcting the trajectory of jumps and not ending up off the track. During the races it is possible to collect one of the powerups scattered on the street: barrier (protects from a single hit), TNT case which is dropped from the back of the car, and finally homing missile. It is also essential to collect the refills for the nitro: even if it is fully restored at the beginning of each lap, it is always better not to risk running out. If the difficulty initially appears to be proof of a single-celled organism, we soon realize that the reality is quite different: advancing with the levels, Gripshift becomes bread for the teeth of true old-fashioned hardcore gamers, offering a level of challenge worthy of the best arcade years 80 and forcing the player to learn every single corner and choose the car that best suits each track. As well as cursing and risking throwing the Sixaxis out the window at every race, but that's another matter. Graphics and sound The graphics are quite pleasant, fluid, colorful and cartoonish. Even if in the long run the tracks seem slightly monotonous and the variety of cars is not extraordinary, we can say with certainty that for a PSN game which in the end is nothing more than a PSP port, we are on more than enough levels. The music will put a strain on those like me who can't stand techno/dance and derivatives, but it will be a bit monotonous even for those who live on bread and Gigi D'Agostino. Pretty nice voice dubbing and sound effects that simply do their job without infamy and without praise. Comment A fairly entertaining game, which like many of the titles on the PlayStation Store should be taken for what it is: an immediate, fast and carefree pastime, but which also manages to guarantee an abominable level of challenge to those who want to go beyond the simple game in all relaxation. Unfortunately, the excessive similarity of the tracks and the lack of an editor lead the interest curve to drop dramatically after a few hours of use. Pros Immediate and nice Level of challenge worthy of the most hardened hardcore gamers Cons Gets monotonous too soon No track editor From PSP to PlayStation 3 the wheelbase is short, and Gripshift had no problem doing it. This ~Mario Kart clone~ in a revised and corrected version lands on the PlayStation Store at the modest price of 10, being able to enjoy the greater control precision offered by the Sixaxis and the enormous potential of the equally enormous black console. The game modes are different, ranging from single race to championship, up to online multiplayer. Initially, you can choose between four drivers (influential from the point of view of performance) and four cars, with the ability to customize bodywork, color and rims. Each vehicle has its own handling, acceleration and top speed characteristics. New cars will be unlocked once the necessary credits are collected. The controls are extremely immediate and intuitive: accelerator, nitro, brake, handbrake, steering and aerial inclination (useful for improving the impact point of landing after a jump). For aerial tilt it is possible to activate the motion sensors of the Sixaxis, but this adds practically nothing to the gaming experience. Gripshift offers 125 unique tracks set in four different ~dimensions~. All the tracks border on the visionary: they are as if suspended in the void, full of ramps for jumping, loop-the-loops and self-propelled platforms.", "date": "2007-06-12", "grade": null}
