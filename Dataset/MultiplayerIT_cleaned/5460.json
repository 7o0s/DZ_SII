As we had the opportunity to describe in the preview, this new project should have been a further evolutionary step compared to the good results already obtained by Crimes & Punishments two years ago. The main source of reference for the previous works had always been dictated by the characteristics of the original subject, born from the pen of Arthur Conan Doyle. Frogwares has continued on the path already traced in the recent past, trying to meet the favors of a slightly wider audience and presenting us with a decidedly more dynamic Sherlock Holmes, always brilliant in his intuitions but with a less detached personality. Given the premises, a multi-faceted character should have emerged, even inclined to show his own psychological fragility in the face of situations that are not strictly investigative. In short, the intent was to obtain greater emotional identification on the part of the public and to guarantee itself a fair amount of space to innovate a structure that had remained unchanged for too long, despite the fact that the previous episode had already introduced some substantial innovations on a purely interactive level. The Devil's Daughter has been available on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One since June 10th. So let's go into more detail and understand if these new ideas have been able to blend correctly with the experience offered by the game. The narrative component that forms the background to the cases of The Devil's Daughter did not convince us Investigations and more In the introductory movie we meet Sherlock Holmes curiously on the run in a wood. Someone is chasing him, we manage to hear an eerie whistling before we glimpse the barrel of a rifle and a bullet being fired towards the protagonist. Without giving us any way of knowing if the coup will go well, events rewind 48 hours, taking us to where it all began. Are we just in the presence of yet another intricate case to unravel, or is there more? The question arises spontaneously, while the first assignment leads us to search for a family man who disappeared into thin air after accepting an elusive ~special job~. Obviously the investigative component remains a major part of the game. However, as a background to these activities there is a broader and more connecting context, involving Katelyn, Holmes' adopted daughter, and an eccentric and mysterious new neighbor, who will give our brilliant investigator many worries. Thanks to the succession of events, one is stimulated to continue further, to face new cases, until one understands which folds the story will take in view of the epilogue. The real problem is represented precisely by the quality of the ending in itself considered, which does not do justice to the expectations nurtured for the entire arc of the adventure, nor to the narrative quality of the individual cases to be solved. We are not at all convinced that Frogwares' choice proved to be spot on and the bitter taste that remains in the mouth, once one's game is over, is typical of wasted opportunities. By indication of the developers, the cases themselves should have had a logical succession such as to somehow affect the epilogue, giving it coherence. In reality all this does not happen, the final phases, in addition to being at least confused, lack that contextualization which instead would have been necessary to make the screenplay make sense and give the impression of having been added a little at random in the economy of a game that was already standing on its own, thanks to the excellent workmanship of the investigations. The art of deduction The deduction mechanics that must lead the player to think about the possible alternative outcomes of each case have been further refined compared to the past. Frogwares intent was to deliberately reduce the number of situations you have to deal with, while extending the duration of each individual adventure. In this way it was possible to give even more weight to the choices, giving rise to various doubts in the player when deciding who is the character to be condemned, or perhaps to be acquitted for problems of mental instability. The spectrum of alternatives, once again delegated to the effective brain nodes, is fun to use and invites you to complete the experience, thanks also to the presence of an effective alternation between interrogations and solving puzzles or riddles of various kinds, equipped with a discrete level of complexity and often also very differentiated from each other. As per tradition, the epilogue can lead to a correct choice or vice versa to dewrong deductions, although this does not in any way prevent us from reaching the final part of the story. Compared to Crimes & Punishments, a new system for identifying the characteristic traits of each character was introduced, called Imagination Mode. Thanks to the marked spirit of observation of the protagonist it is now possible to choose some items that serve to frame the exact profile of a character and can derive from the clothing, expression or other objects immediately surrounding the person being questioned. Thanks to this system, a handful of alternative observations must therefore be chosen, by means of which it is possible to complete the profile of each individual and then keep track of them, at any time, within one's notebook. During the dialogues it is still possible to choose between several probative evidences in order to unmask the interrogated and induce them to admit that they have omitted some details or even lied to their interlocutor. However, while in the past these sequences necessarily had to be repeated, in the event that a player's choice was proved to be incorrect, in this case the dialogue will proceed anyway, thus preventing the obtaining of some probative evidence. The same mechanism is also triggered when the profile of a character has to be outlined and consequently the profile deduced in the notes could be inaccurate. Xbox One goals The objectives of Sherlock Holmes: The Devil's Daughter are 25, all closely related to the completion of tasks. Walking around London Remaining with a view to offering a slightly more eclectic product and getting out of the niche that belongs to it, Frogwares has inserted some action-oriented mechanics into The Devil's Daughter, which embrace in various ways both the development of cases and the final stages of the investigation. We had already had the opportunity to appreciate the stalking in the role of Wiggins, the boy who supports Holmes' investigative activities by carrying out some fundamentally important jobs. The sequence is only one but it turned out to be more extensive than we thought by looking at the gameplay videos. The global impact on the economy of the game remains negligible, but of all the interlude phases it is the most effective one to space out the investigations. The same cannot be said for the scene in the role of the nice Toby - Sherlock Holmes' dog - which, on the contrary, seemed too approximate and short-lived to be taken seriously. Not even the action phases in the role of Holmes himself have been able to conquer us. Always arranged at the end of each case, they offer different gameplay solutions, unfortunately united by a wooden control system and frequent graphic stability problems. Compared to the previous chapter we have perceived slight improvements of a technical nature, at least as regards the appearance of the characters and the chromatic vivacity of the settings. Some of Holmes's physical traits have also been changed, while Watson looks radically different from how we remembered him in Crimes & Punishments. Even the voice actors have changed, although the dialogues are still in English with Italian subtitles. From a graphic point of view, Frogwares has chosen to rely once again on the archaic Unreal Engine 3, introducing some sporadic innovations such as Physically Based Rendering for the management of light and shadow effects. The result is certainly not a miracle, especially when it comes to evaluating the new stages of the game on foot in the streets of London; in fact, exploration remains very limited, it is possible to decide to move through these segments of the scenario or alternatively use the traditional fast movement. The excessive amount of tearing and endless loading times that afflict these parts testify to Frogwares' inability to handle the interactive dynamics that go beyond solving puzzles and completing investigations, and it's really a shame.", "date": "2016-06-13", "grade": "7.5"}
