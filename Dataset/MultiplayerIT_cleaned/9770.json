The imagery of this era is rich and full of stories worth telling, and an episodic structure is well suited to a huge sandbox like this, which is a game set on a map full of places, characters and events that they taste like chewed tobacco. In the world there are those who have a gun, and those who dig. The title chosen for the latest update of Red Dead Redemption, Bari e Liars, is certainly the right name to fictionalize the events set between midday shootings, saloons crowded with gamblers and dens of bandits, exactly what this downloadable content is rich. This is certainly the most substantial DLC of those already seen online: Bari and Liars offers first of all fifteen new characters taken from the main story to be able to use them in multiplayer, but also the possibility of playing online poker comfortably seated on old wooden chairs of a suburban saloons, new hideouts for bandits and new locations to create shootouts against friends and matchmaking. Furthermore, the new online horse racing mode to compete against other riders riding our steed is beautiful and appreciated, like a sort of ancient wild racetrack competitions. It works pretty much like the one already appreciated in the single player story, but with the possibility of facing friends from all over the world. It's about running from one point to another on the maps passing through some checkpoints (consisting of smoke bombs) with the interesting variable that consists of shooting and knocking down the other jockeys (hence the title of this upgrade also comes from). The new multiplayer modes, also contained in the package, make it even more appetizing and indispensable for all fans of the old West made in Rockstar. ~Roccaforte~ is a new mode of Bari and Liars that features teams of eight participants each, intent on attacking and defending a series of objectives to reach the pre-set score for victory. The game in this case obviously stimulates a sort of team tactics through communication and the creation of a joint strategy: there is to cover the companions, run, infiltrate, distract the attention of enemies, and in general all those typical actions of a team that moves in a team multiplayer environment, all with excellent results from the point of view of gameplay, game speed and above all the resulting fun. Unlike other online modes, in ~Roccaforte~ there are some points to be conquered by attacking all together, in turns (as in baseball or American football, to understand), and this favors the attention on the common objective rather than on a generic ~everyone does what he can~. Roccaforte is very reminiscent of some similar modes already present in famous shooters such as Battlefield or Halo, and will obviously make the most savvy and veteran players of the genre happy. In practice it is a matter of attacking some points on the map (dens, strongholds, cities, houses) and taking possession of the place by defeating all the opponents present. Once all the objectives have been taken, or the enemies are all dead or the time to complete the missions is up, the defenders become the attackers and you start all over again. The game is fun because it puts a fair balance between the parties on the gameplay plate thanks to well-designed locations that facilitate the attackers' approach to the objectives, but at the same time put the defenders in a position to defend from privileged positions, which for most of them are snipers or characters crouched in the shadows who tend ambushes to the first unfortunates who pass by. Even the powerful cannons play a fundamental role in defending the bases to be controlled, resulting very precise and therefore perfect for taking out any possible attacker. Bari e Bugiardi is not only this, however. There's a new explosive rifle, an extremely destructive weapon, new hunting grounds to face never before seen wild animals of the Old West and the ability to compare the scores of your brigade online to decide who is the most fearsome in Red Dead Redemption . Bari e Liars represents what all DLC downloadable from the internet should be, that is the right way to spend the price it costs thanks to numerous exclusive contents and new ways that definitely extend its life, provided obviously that you have a connection toInternet.", "date": "2010-10-01", "grade": "8.5"}
