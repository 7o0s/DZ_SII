{"name": "Il seguito dell'anno?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/108794-torchlight-ii-il-seguito-dellanno.html", "text": "In 2009 Torchlight was a bolt from the blue: Runic Games, a team of thirty people founded by the initiative of some industry veterans known above all for their commitment to Diablo and Fate, embarked on a company born with the idea of create a hack and slash and quickly make it follow an MMO, thus creating a varied role-playing universe suitable for different users. There have been several such attempts over the years and, after a promising start, things have regularly foundered, colliding with a very harsh reality that requires you to be successful immediately, have enough funds to last a few years and finally get on the market with a second title. Thanks to a constant consensus, which has extended its life on the virtual shelves of Steam well beyond the launch period, and a successful Xbox port, Torchlight has put its creators in a position to work for three years on the direct sequel, a step back from the original idea of developing a mass online experience but the inevitable choice considering the number of only sketchy elements at the time and the many requests from the community. After a thousand delays Torchlight II is finally available for download on PC, thanks to an unbeatable value for money and lots of new features. A new, old Torchlight Torchlight II introduces a multitude of novelties while inventing nothing. Unlike Diablo III, which tried to reinterpret itself by introducing mechanics that have radically changed the experience in some ways, for better or for worse, here the foundations on which the gameplay was built remain those of the second chapter of the series blizzards. However, the fear of stagnation is immediately erased by a vast series of novelties, all faithful to a retro spirit that permeates the entire production. The Engineer with his turrets is added to the three original classes, revised and corrected with lots of new names but linked to the same stylistic elements. A welcome introduction that mixes in a hack and slash sauce a figure that has been very used in other genres in recent years. The progression through the maps is standard, a single click on the enemies that explode, crumble and disappear under our blows whether they are elemental attacks, devastating blows or projectiles. Anyone who has played an action RPG of the past will feel immediately at home immersed in a world of randomly generated maps and story-based specious quests that serve as an excuse to wander around and destroy anything that moves. On the other hand, the environments abandon the monotony of the past to embrace a structure that divides the game into three main acts and an epilogue, each with a village from which to access the dungeons, now present both in the form of large open areas and labyrinthine underground. The aesthetic diversity of the environments is truly remarkable and ranges from the classic deserts, forests and snow expanses to the more original steam punk levels, with enemies that include everything from mercenaries to golems, from skeletons to ghosts and a whole host of others creatures taken from a thousand different sources of inspiration. Although the absence of a strong artistic direction that really links the aesthetics of the individual acts is felt, the use of cel shading has made it possible to create a scalable but distinctive title, full of details. The animations are accurate and the variety of magic exhibited is remarkable. Compared to Diablo III, the visceral sensation of impact of the blows is missing and overall the staging is less articulated, but considering that it costs a third and the graphic aspect is the only one that really distances it from a title sold at full price, these annotations boil down to mere details. Among other things, finally, Torchlight II introduces the cooperative multiplayer component for up to six people, with dedicated servers managed by Runic Games and the possibility of configuring LAN computers to play together locally. The abundance of options, by the way, is only the beginning of what will be the offer: in a few weeks the tools for the development of mods will be released with a lot of support for Steam Workshop, which in conjunction with some good sales will mean almost infinite longevity. Meanwhile, the hardcore mode is added to the four difficulty levels, with the characteristic permanent death, and an end game system that asks you to buy maps that are then randomly generated, each with particular difficulty reasons and modifiers. If you wish, you can also start over with the same character to reach the 100th level - it took us 16 hours to complete it the first time, at level 49 - and further develop your alter ego. A charactersor only yours Options and the freedom to customize your gaming experience aren't the only elements that make Torchlight II a very good compendium of how a quality hard and pure hack and slash should be made. Those who have not appreciated the linear growth of Diablo III should in fact know that here the individual statistical points must be allocated manually and the same goes for those that can be spent in the three skill trees open to each class. As for the stats, the feeling of freedom is somewhat armored by the type of weapon you want to use and in any case by the chosen class, making some directions more sensible than others. Instead, each point spent on a single power, whether active or passive, has a special meaning because the possibility of reallocating them is limited to the last three choices and also comes at a high price. Among other things, the skills can be enhanced fifteen times and every five unlock a perk that causes a change or improvement. In fact, you are forced to make difficult decisions and a clear position on how you want to approach the adventure. A Magician, for example, can choose which element to focus on between fire, electricity and ice, while the Engineer has at his disposal an attack tree, a defense tree and the last one focused on the construction of robots and turrets. As tradition dictates, this ecosystem of game mechanics is completed by the collection of the loot left on the ground by the opponents: weapons, armor and upgrades of different rarities accumulate on the ground by the dozen, giving a lot of freedom of choice and a mountain of objects to check, compare and sell or reuse. The series brings some small but interesting ideas in this sense, such as the possibility of investing money to add a random bonus to a weapon or buy one ~in the dark~ from a special seller, discovering what it is only once collected in the 'inventory. The randomization involves further aspects, such as the presence of special creatures which, if killed, leave portals on the ground to be crossed to reach areas used for unique challenges. They are details, of course, but they make an already very rich experience even more varied. Pet management has also been refined with new functions and customization reasons, proving useful both in clashes and for carrying back and forth the loot to be sold and the supplies that can be purchased remotely. In co-op Torchlight II becomes a title of exceptional value but even alone it is superior to the original thanks to the additions and superior care involving aspects such as the bosses, now more varied and equipped with interesting attack patterns. There are some small critical issues, such as the substantial dependence on potions to overcome certain passages at higher difficulty levels, but these are minor aspects that do not affect the overall goodness of the time spent playing; indeed some will appreciate it. Finally, a special mention for the soundtrack, edited by Matt Uelmen, truly effective and always adequate.", "date": "2012-09-24", "grade": "9.1"}
