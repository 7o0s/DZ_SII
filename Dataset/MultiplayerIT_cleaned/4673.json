This strange whirlwind of upheavals and crises has affected, among many others, Slightly Mad Studios, the team responsible for the Need for Speed Shift and the GTR series. In a difficult situation, however, our people did not lose heart and managed to raise a few million dollars on Kickstarter, in order to finance the development of the ambitious Project CARS. The gamble paid off: CARS proved to be an excellent driving game - and found a reliable distributor in Bandai Namco - but either due to the team's initially limited resources, the difficulty of creating a similar project from scratch, or the simple need to respect timings that are not exactly flexible, it arrived in homes with more than one annoying bug, a non-superlative fleet and revisable physics. However, today we will not talk about that title and its shortcomings, but about its sequel: a potentially excellent chapter since it is built around foundations that are already stable and can be dramatically improved. Will it be the great work of the British team, or is there still a lot to do? Impossible ambitions? The intentions of the developers of Project CARS 2 are very clear: to offer, in today's market, a valid alternative to Gran Turismo and Forza, but cross-platform and strongly simulative. You got it right, the Slightlty Mad title wants to contend with the best-selling and most loved racing courses on the market, but to do so it does not intend to follow the same path as those two titles, and rather aims at a driving system closer to works such as Assetto Corsa and rFactor 2. This should be mission impossible, because while Forza and Polyphony's work are incredibly complex and layered games, a large part of their success lies in their accessibility to the general public and the gradual progression they manage to offer... Project CARS 2 has therefore decided to open up to the masses by focusing on a clear factor: the personalization of the experience. In practice, the game starts with realistic settings for the aids, automatic gearbox and a moderate difficulty; however, each element can be modified: the driving aids can also be activated on cars that do not normally have modern electronics, curves and trajectories can be revealed both by symbols on the screen and by the typical colored indications on the track, and artificial intelligence can even be retouched in both track ability and aggression. Put simply, it can easily become attractive even for those who don't have a professional workstation with a steering wheel and don't eat bread and petrol for breakfast, to the detriment of realism. If in any case you decide to take the next step, limit the facilities, increase the level of challenge and devote yourself body and soul to learning the various disciplines, Project CARS 2 offers a cornucopia of experiences that are difficult to replicate by other titles in the same genre. Let's explain ourselves better: when we were talking about simulation we weren't joking, and the game is keen to clarify it by offering not only a monstrous diversification of the various types of cars (clearly perceptible even within the same categories when cars from different manufacturers are chosen) but also a superlative tire physics and a top-level atmospheric system, which reach unexplored heights thanks to the so-called Livetrack 3.0. It is basically a model that is based on scanning the slopes - obtained with a mixture of drones and lasers, according to the developers - and causes them to change based on rainfall. You will therefore see puddles forming after short showers, sleet and ice sheets in freezing conditions, all in areas where they should actually form (again according to the words of the team). The importance of feedback Returning to the tires, these react to these changes in the tracks as they are deformable, and give (even with the pad) sensations that are far from the flatness of a ~mixed~ title or an arcade. For obvious reasons, these features require a wheel equipped with Force Feedback to be perceived at their best, and the only weakness of the experience lies right here: without a decent workstation Project CARS 2 fails to exploit its full potential, despite the guidance system remains excellent. Ah, since we're talking about the ForceFeedback; if you are part of the group of players who cursed the previous chapter for a long time precisely because of the problems related to this aspect, you can rest assured: this time the software house has worked at its best to manage everything properly, and most of the steering wheels on the market seems to respond great. A big step forward, no doubt about it. If driveability is promoted with flying colors, however, it does not mean that the system is perfect: the sheer number of cars has inevitably led Slighly Mad to focus more on certain models, and there are some style drops here and there. The Catherams (not to mention the super light ones in general) on a wet track seemed almost undrivable to us, for example, and there are categories that seem to respond rather insanely on tracks battered by the weather. However, we are not necessarily talking about cars deliberately made difficult to manage: in general, Project CARS 2 is a title that aims at ~controlled~ realism, therefore most of the cars are well planted on the ground, and losing control of a modern racing car results extremely difficult if you don't make huge mistakes (paradoxically, this approach is more real than the ~hardcore~ one of other simulations, where certain cars are absolutely unmanageable despite highly advanced technologies making them rather docile). For heaven's sake, we are talking about isolated cases if we consider how much goodness the game offers, whose roster of racing cars ranges from various Formula categories to classic power monsters, passing through supercars, go karts, Rallycross cars and common road vehicles (we're talking about over 170 choices, not bruscoli). Watch out for spins Outside of tire physics and handling, things aren't quite as exciting. There have also been noticeable improvements to impacts, the damage system, and AI in this sequel, yet these aren't fixative improvements. Let's take for example the challenge offered by the CPU, which is certainly more awake, active and prone to more realistic behaviors than in the past, but at the same time is extremely fluctuating from specialty to specialty. Pumping the AI skill to the max offers a challenge only for super experts, sure; it's a pity that in certain categories (on certain icy tracks this is evident) the opponents struggle a lot to lap with worthy times, making them very easy to beat. Not only that, it is advisable to keep the level of aggressiveness low, because while on tracks with good maneuvering space you will hardly see other drivers ram into you, the same cannot be said of their behavior on tracks with narrow roads, where you sometimes risk being hit treacherously even at the start. A similar situation also for impacts, which are far from driving realism, and would hardly cause problems in most cases if it weren't for the penalties and the damage system. A little more could have been done. No protest instead for the contents, to say the least monstrous. Project CARS 2 does not offer a progression a la Gran Turismo, as we have already specified at the beginning of the article, it has no ~licenses~, and all cars are unlocked immediately for single races. However, the same cannot be said of the career mode, which divides numerous tournaments into skill levels, and allows you to start from the minor categories to move from time to time to increasingly faster and more spectacular competitions, which in turn can be customized in detail (most part of the cups allows you to choose the number of laps, and whether or not to run qualifying and free practice). It's a good way to push the player to test every type of car available - the minor category competitions remain unlocked and playable even as you level up - and the only real flaw of the whole lies in the need to complete an entire cup once selected, with no chance of abandoning everything and starting over in another team. Indeed, to be honest there is also another lack: the decorations are missing. Pure racing No, we are not talking about the technical sector, we are talking about frills, side dishes, elements capable of embellishing the experience. The career is very rich and varied, true, but once you win a tournament, the ~prize~ offered by the game is nothing more than a short film with a three-dimensional cup, accompanied by the unlocking of special events separate from the typical competitions. No visual customization of the pilot or cinematics capable of making you feel really in the thick of the action, and even the emails received from your team managers are cold, impersonal, and often repeated (seriously: string together a series of victories and your capo will congratulate you with an equal series of copy-and-pasted mails). The only thing that makes you feel part of a real team is the presence of a track engineer, who automatically changes the set-up of the car based on a series of questions related to single aspects of the player's experience (a clever way of bypass the enormous complexity of the car's tuning options, which can however be modified manually separately). F1 2017 and Forza are still far from this point of view. On the other hand, the situation with regard to online is quite different. It is clear that Slightlty Mad want to focus on the thriving world of e-sports with their latest born, therefore - among classic multiplayer options such as time trials and custom races - you will also find a menu dedicated to online streaming and official events, and community challenges that will see you compete against the times of countless riders around the world. It's a nice package, capable of making an already gigantic title practically infinite for an enthusiast. Then the technical sector is excellent, which boasts over sixty tracks of commendable quality and stupendous cars: the visual quality of the Forza tracks and the maniacal care of the cars of the Polyphony series are another thing, but Project CARS 2 defends itself very well, travels at 60 FPS even on consoles (not perfectly stable, but still feel) and its dynamic weather makes it make a decent leap in quality. For heaven's sake, on PlayStation 4, where we tested it, obvious sacrifices were made in terms of detail, yet there's no need to complain in front of such a glance. We close with the sound, which has divided us: on the one hand the sound of the engines is very respectable, and the roar of certain monsters gives great satisfaction; on the other hand, the soundtrack is forgettable to say the least, and we didn't notice any options to customize it.", "date": "2017-09-18", "grade": "8.8"}
