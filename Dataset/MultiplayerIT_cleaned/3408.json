{"name": "Outbuddies", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/outbuddies-recensione.html", "text": "Born from an idea of independent developer Julian Laufer, Outbuddies required six years of development to be finalized, also thanks to the financial support of some enthusiasts with a small Kickstarter campaign dating back to 2017. The project is clearly inspired by a great classic of the past as Super Metroid, also taking inspiration from other popular indie titles of the recent past such as Axiom Verge. While based on the typical play structure of metroidvanias, the author places the emphasis on underwater interaction, which alternates with the typical platform phases. The debut on Steam took place last October 15, while the release on PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch and Xbox One will take place in the first quarter of next year. If you are curious to find out more, all you have to do is continue reading our review. Underwater Metroidvania Outbuddies is faithful to tradition both for the conformation of the game map and the graphic component, as for the progression linked to the constant increase of one's equipment through exploration. Players are called to delve into the depths of Bathlam, an ancient sunken fortress built by mysterious gods who have now disappeared in the depths of the South Atlantic Ocean. After his own ship is wrecked, archaeologist Nikolay Bernstein awakens in this place seemingly forgotten by the rest of the world with a new ally with strange powers at his side. The couple will have to work together actively to make their way through the threats that dwell in the ruins, looking for a way out that can bring them back to the surface. From a narrative point of view, the information provided to the player is limited to some synthetic details on the place where you are and on the divine entities that have shaped this imposing structure. The single-player mode requires the player to alternately assume the role of both characters, thus taking advantage of complementary skills with which to try to overcome the roughness of the path. At first Nikolay is completely devoid of equipment that allows him to defend himself from the surrounding threats, so it is necessary to rely above all on the support character to make his way towards the following areas of the map. Once selected, the latter is also able to activate a series of blocks which, if moved to the right points on each screen, can guarantee access to other rooms or the opportunity to reach otherwise precluded areas. At the same time, the entity is also capable of placing small square-shaped platforms that can be used as a foothold for overcoming the most difficult obstacles. Added to this is his ability to scan the surrounding environment in search of places of interest and points of interaction to indicate to his travel companion. The map is revealed step by step, gradually highlighting the presence of some fundamental equipment that must be recovered in order to survive. Bathlam is a forgotten place yet still teeming with bizarre creatures who are openly hostile towards the two unwanted guests. The player will then have access to a range of resources including bombs that can be placed on the ground to take out enemies or open openings in the less resistant walls, in search of secret passages to other portions of the scenario. Continuing on your journey, you then have access to a series of weapons with varied characteristics and potential, which, moreover, are closely connected to the opening of the portals that give access to the more advanced areas. The alternation between the two characters is an interesting aspect of the gameplay, although one cannot help but highlight the limits of a control system which in more than one phase has proved to be unjustifiably cumbersome to manage. Switching between subjects is handled by the right analog stick; the protagonist's attacks are mostly linked to the use of firearms, vice versa the droid that supports him is able to launch a single shot that must be loaded and then hurled towards the target in a sling-like manner. What has proved to be more inconvenient, however, is above all the movement of objects entrusted to telekinesis, which has proved to be all too artificial and frustrating to use. The situation improves when entering the co-op locally for two players, with the second user in charge of dealing with the support entity. As they search for answers, Nikolay and his singular ally come across a multitude of secrets and seemingly forgotten creatures that dwell among the mostly flooded ruins. Between thatthere are also the Wozans, a funny tribe dedicated to mining that the player must gradually free to allow them to rise to the surface. Clearly, the presence of stubborn bosses could not be missing either, who overall managed to convince us for the variety of their characteristics and attack patterns.", "date": "2019-10-26", "grade": "7.0"}
