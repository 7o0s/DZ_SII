{"name": "Mazzate mortali", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/87733-mortal-kombat-mazzate-mortali.html", "text": "Tested version: Xbox 360A legend from the 90s who in the days of bar cabinets and arcades made patrons consume dozens of tokens, including the author of this review, is re-proposed to us today in a semi-new guise, in the attempt to revive the saga. But without distorting it too much, if not in the contents and in the visual sector. Warner Interactive, which holds the rights to the saga inherited from the defunct Midway, has entrusted the arduous task of bringing Mortal Kombat back to its former glory to the development team of Netherrealm Studios. The latter have taken up the challenge and decided to adopt a formula that has made Capcom's fortune in recent years. That is, to combine graphics that exploit the third dimension with a gameplay anchored to the more traditional expression of the fighting game, resetting the saga and making it start practically from scratch. Sonya Blade. The chapter we are dealing with in this review, in fact, constitutes a real reboot of the franchise, while maintaining strong ties with the past, it is no coincidence that the developers themselves have used the term fan service to indicate it. Simply put, the game is a remake of the first three Mortal Kombats. Starting from the plot that begins from the final scene of Mortal Kombat Armageddon, where Raiden, shortly before being defeated by Shao Kahn, now ready to dominate all kingdoms, sends a mental message back in time to himself from a few years ago to warn him of the danger and direct him to prevent the events that will lead to that catastrophe in the future. The scene then moves to the past: we are in full Mortal Kombat, the martial arts tournament that takes place every generation on the island of Shang Tsung, a powerful sorcerer. Warriors from all over the world can participate to try their hand at a series of clashes which will then establish who is the absolute champion. In reality it is much more than a simple tournament: few know that it is the means by which Shao Kahn, the evil emperor of Outworld, can take possession of the Earth. The Fighters in the ring To stop him, or at least to try, there are Raiden, the god of thunder and protector of the Earth, flanked by a select group of warriors of various ethnic and social backgrounds, among which stand out Liu Kang, a monk, Johnny Cage, an actor, and Sonya Blade, a special forces agent. All this is told in what is the fulcrum of the game, that is the Story mode, which allows players to try their hand at a series of challenges related to each other by a discreet plot and excellent direction. Contrary to what we usually see in other products of the genre, in fact, here the clash sequences are interspersed with videos made with the same graphic engine of the product, and tell a series of events as if it were a film. Sexy and lethal. In practice, there is not only a sequence of fights in the ring which then lead to a final film, but also moments of struggle outside the actual tournament. It starts with Johnny Cage who then leaves the scepter to Sonya Blade and so on, as in a sort of relay. Following the flow of the plot, the wrestlers managed by the user change, as do the scenarios where the fights take place and the reasons for which they are unleashed. But Mortal Kombat is also characterized by a myriad of other game modes, many and such as to satisfy the requests of the users as rarely seen in a fighting game. Among them undoubtedly stands out the one called Kombattimento, which then ideally is the classic Arcade, only enriched by various contents and possibilities: inside it you can in fact choose, from a series of sub-menus, different types of competition to face both single and in tags, even with friends. This last function allows the player to select a team made up of two characters to alternate successively in the ring at any time, giving rise, at the moment of the change, to assisted or combined moves. It depends on how the user has chosen to plan the special attacks and quick inside-outs before the battle to strike the opponent by stealth. Xbox 360 goals Mortal Kombat offers users fifty objectives to unlock, ten of which are secret, for a total score of 1,000 G: they are distributed across the various game modes, both online and offline. Some are obtained simply with the progression of the game, others by satisfying particular requests of the product. Maybe winning 100 fights on the web, or achieving 10 consecutive victories in classified fights always on the net (Awesome goal!). Or, again, by unlocking alternate characters and costumes, performing a Fatality con all characters, either by gaining full mastery of all fighters or by completing 25 tower quests (Tower's Apprentice). A Thousand Modes Still within the Kombat mode, among the options there are also a series of challenges called Tests. The latter consist of a series of mini-games along the lines of the old fighting games of the past, in which the character controlled by the user is called to undergo to a series of challenges, in fact, which consist of tests of ability on strength, dexterity or luck. Other interesting modes are then Torre delle Sfide, where you have to face dozens of matches one after the other characterized by rules that vary from time to time and which put a strain on the player's mental and reflective abilities, with the inclusion here too of some of the famous mini games of the saga. And again, Extra, which contains biographies of the characters, downloadable content and the Krypta, an interactive environment where you can unlock costumes, moves and much more with the gold tokens acquired by winning matches in the other modes. Lastly, online deserves a separate discussion. To use all the services connected to it, you need to have the Kombat Pass contained in the purchased game package. There are several modes for multiplayer via the internet, ranging from classified fights to fast ones, both one-on-one and two-on-two, passing through the different variants of the case and up to eight players. But King of the Hill is in our opinion the best and most innovative online mode available. By entering in the form of an avatar in one of the rooms used for the purpose, resembling a theatre, the gamer can not only challenge one of the other users present, but also attend the meetings in progress as an audience. The peculiarity of this session consists in the fact that even as a simple spectator one can interact with what one sees on the stage, insulting or taking sides with one fighter rather than another. You can even express your dissent by throwing vegetables or tomatoes at the stage, or by giving a negative vote to one of the participants in the challenge just seen at the end of the match. Conversely, one can laugh or incite, as well as give a positive judgment to the one who instead fought well. As for the discourse related to the actual fight, in the tests that we were able to perform we occasionally encountered some lag problems when executing more complicated moves and once we were also disconnected. In most cases, however, everything went quite smoothly, even if we wait to see how the dedicated servers will behave when the title is in the homes of millions of users. Fatalities and Babalities Having thoroughly analyzed the modes available in the product, it's time to focus on the actual gameplay. Once you have chosen your favorite character from a plethora of wrestlers made up of about thirty elements (more will be added with future DLCs), each of which is uniquely characterized both aesthetically and in techniques, you find yourself fighting using the usual structure of the saga. The battles, which take place in two-dimensional scenarios with a fake 3D effect for the backdrops, with a camera that follows the action, zooming or enlarging in the key moments of the challenges, concede nothing or almost nothing to tactics, and in general they are the frenzy and the speed of the commands to be the masters. Sub Zero at work. This does not mean that, especially with human opponents, the game is reduced to mere button mashing, but only that the title requires less attention to strategy than, for example, Street Fighter. The original moves of the series, executable as always in these cases with the combination of the four upper keys of the pad (now assigned to the individual limbs) and the backs, which individually are mainly used for grappling, changing guards or parries, are all present, and the old players of the saga will immediately find the feeling with the controls of the past. Just as newcomers will find a gameplay purged of the complications, sometimes successful, sometimes less, that the series has allowed itself over time. Scorpion throwing his pointed chain to skewer and then throw enemies into the air, Sub Zero with his icy breath and Kung Lao throwing his hat with a spinning blade, just to name a few, they are all there. But there are, of course, new moves. Many of these are related to the innovations introduced by the developers in terms of gameplay. The first of these is the inclusion of the Super Meter, a three-bar gauge that is typically filled by parrying an opponent's attacks or by repeatedly hitting them.definitely, better if with combos. Based on the filling level of the aforementioned and the fighter controlled by the gamer, a specific special move can be performed, both defensive and offensive. Curiosity On PlayStation 3 the game enjoys a couple of more tricks than the Xbox 360 counterpart, evidently the result of an agreement between Warner and Sony. There is a special character, namely Kratos, directly from God of War. And stereoscopic 3D is supported for those with a suitable TV. Moreover, specific work has been done on the 3D that allows you to adjust the level of depth, while always leaving the focus of the image on the wrestlers so that they can also be seen by spectators who may not be equipped with goggles. Brutality and blood In detail, you have an enhanced version of any special move with a full segment, while with two you have a Breaker to perform to interrupt the opponent's combo. At the overall increase of the three notches, an unstoppable attack called X-Ray is performed: these consist in violently hitting the enemy by shattering the bones of the body and skull, in order to subtract 25-30% of the life points. All this is accompanied by a predefined sequence with graphic effects such as a black and white view limited to non-impact areas, which in turn is left in color to highlight the limbs involved in the action. Also in this reboot the Fatalities could not be missing, the true strength and symbol of the series, here re-proposed more violent than ever. Having beaten one's opponent to death, in particular conditions the now famous ~Finish Him!~ starts, the signal that starts the final havoc on the defenseless body of the enemy, to be quartered into a thousand pieces. Also present are the Babalities, that is, the ability to transform one's opponent into a childish counterpart. Basically some of these skills are already available, but a large part of them must be earned and unlocked instead. Blood splatters on the bodies and sticks to them. All the retro energy of the new Mortal Kombat can also be seen in its audio-visual creation. Stylistically and choreographically, the characters are similar to the originals from the 90s. But despite this look not in step with the times, the new 3D polygonal look, the good number of animations and moves that distinguish each of them, make them fascinating in their own way. The combat environments are beautiful which, as described in the article, are strictly two-dimensional with a fake three-dimensional background effect: they are characterized by an excellent level of detail and range from fantastic ones such as Hell to more realistic ones, such as deserts , forests and metropolitan buildings. It should be highlighted that it is often possible to admire moving objects or characters in them, such as planes or characters from the series, who, as in the stage The Pit where Daegon, Kenshi, Frost, Sareena and Reiko fight in the distance, make a cameo. Some arenas have Stage Fatalities, or executions that can only be performed in that precise context involving environmental elements. For the sound sector we have a dubbing in Italian, which is present only during the interlude scenes of the story mode, and not during the battles, where it remains in English, without infamy or praise. The choice of some voices in our language did not fully satisfy us, such as that of Johnny Cage. Others, however, seem decidedly spot on. The soundtrack is discreet, epic in the introduction of some meetings, a bit retro too in other situations.", "date": "2011-04-22", "grade": "8.6"}
