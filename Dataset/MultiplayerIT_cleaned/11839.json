{"name": "Naruto: Ninja Council - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/naruto-ninja-council-recensione.html", "text": "Naruto: Ninja Council is available for Nintendo DS. Naruto is now a commercial phenomenon also in Italy. The manga has been published for some years by Panini, who had bet on the work of this young cartoonist, Masashi Kishimoto, defining it as the spiritual heir of Dragon Ball. In terms of merchandising, Naruto certainly is: in Japan it has had a resounding success, and cartoons have been dedicated to it for the big and small screen, action-figures in all guises, all kinds of gadgets, video games in abundance for all platforms. Naruto is a young ninja from the Leaf Village, but unlike his peers he carries a heavy weight on his shoulders: in fact, since he was a baby, the essence of the monstrous Nine-Tailed Fox has been imprisoned in him. Too bad Naruto , despite the power enclosed in him, is a listless playful, rather than a model ninja: his teammates, Sakura and Sasuke, and his master, the wacky Kakashi, pay the price. Since this team was formed, a lot of water has passed under the bridge, and in the manga now Naruto has grown up and fights with all his strength to restore broken friendships and defend his Village from the plans of very powerful enemies: the evolution of The story has had its ups and downs, but certainly Kishimoto has been able to give us some of the most memorable characters ever, managing to characterize dozens of supporting characters with remarkable care and sensitivity. Ninja Council is actually the third episode of the series, which has already had two prequels belonging to various playful genres: the episode adapted for our market is a sort of fighting game that ideally retraces the first part of the series, and more indicatively the tournament to establish the new ninja of the Village. From comics to video games Beyond game-design, the various locations and sprites in Ninja Council are decidedly well-finished, colorful and full of animations. Although the various generic enemies are not distinguished from each other at all, the development team has placed painstaking care in the realization of the various main characters, whose sprites have been practically ~ripped~ from the prequel never proposed in Europe, and re-proposed with greater number of frames and details. The various battlefields are large, full of platforms, obstacles and chasms, and a certain skill is required on the part of the player to fight without falling victim to the turn stage, between super-jumps and wall pushes: a pity that the control system makes it virtually impossible to properly enjoy great design. From an aesthetic point of view, the winning element is certainly the rendering of the special techniques of the various characters, which give life to sequences faithful to the cartoon created with the sprites of the game, animated excellently and decidedly spectacular and exciting. Terrible on the sound side, Ninja Council offers dull and repetitive tunes, and a series of terrible sound effects that are so reminiscent of 8-bit consoles, annoying and intrusive. What is worse is the absence of any digitized speech: while the original versions proposed various battle cries, as well as the names of the special techniques shouted when necessary, in the European version of Ninja Council everything is silent, and during the game sessions all that remains is to put up with the unbearable jingles until the console is turned off, which becomes almost liberating. Comment Naruto: Ninja Council presents some interesting premises that are completely debased by an absurd control system in the first place, and by various secondary defects that complete a decidedly less than mediocre picture. The idea of offering the player dozens of missions to complete to obtain new characters and special techniques is nice and would increase the longevity of a condemned title, however, on the shelf as soon as you come across the tricky management of the character and his movements, a problem that it obviously also affects the multiplayer mode for four players. Graphically Ninja Council is a decidedly valid title, but from the sound point of view the absurd elimination of the digitized speech remains, which leaves room only for unbearable jingles and paleolithic and annoying sound effects, so as to disappoint even the most experienced fan of the nice ninja from Kishimoto. Pros Spectacular special moves Manga readers might appreciate the fan-service Cons Poor controls Silly missions Audio to review Confused Ninjas The original idea of the developer Eighting was probably to mimic another remarkable manga-based fighting game already available for DS in two incarnations: Jump! Superstars and Jump! Ultimate Stars. The setting in effecttti is really very similar to that party-game/beat'em-up that allowed the most popular characters of the Japanese comic scene to collide in small arenas: Ninja Council is in fact a kind of fighting game with platform elements, a structure that suitable for a manga of ninjas and fights. The main course of the menu is certainly the single-player mode, through which it is possible to unlock the various fighters, and then eventually use them by challenging a human opponent. The adventure unfolds through a long series of missions: completing one will give access to others, a chain effect that makes new stages available to be tackled in the preferred order. As interesting as it is, the system collapses in the face of the banality and repetitiveness of the various quests: those in which you have to face the various characters of the saga certainly prove to be pleasant, often imposing some limits (the use only of a certain attack, for example) which increase its difficulty and complexity, but most of the various missions soon turn out to be rather pointless and very little fun, such as in the case in which you will have to kill thirty enemies in a few seconds, or collect objects before time runs out, or even recover flags before the opponent does. The underlying problem is certainly the abstruse control system: a decidedly poorly studied key arrangement is also added to by a slow and uncertain response to inputs. Controlling one's character therefore becomes decidedly difficult even after hours of practice, discouraging the player especially in those missions that require lightning-fast movements and jumps with attacks following to annihilate the various enemies from one platform to another (a practical example, the volcanic stage with the thirty bats to kill, horrifying). The situation improves only marginally in the fights against the other characters in the series, made up of very simple exchanges of blows followed by chases and escapes in order to catch the enemy unprepared and inflict on him the special attack of the moment, a real means of offensive: in these cases, Ninja Council reveals its best side, proposing spectacular special attacks that are triggered by a sort of mini-game in which the player is asked, from time to time and depending on the character, to blow into the microphone of the DS, press the button right at the right time or rotate a spiral on the touch screen and so on. The secret techniques of the various ninjas are probably the most interesting element of Ninja Council, both from an aesthetic and gameplay point of view, as they are also the basis of the personalization of their favorites, who can exchange the various special techniques before each mission or clash, thus proposing a certain variety, which does not save the apathetic solitary mode, however.", "date": "2007-11-13", "grade": null}
