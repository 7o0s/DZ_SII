For Image & Form, the Swedish team authoring the project, it would have been much easier to capitalize on the great and unexpected success of the previous Steamworld Dig, a ~metroidvania~ in steampunk western sauce which, after its debut on 3DS, was then released on practically all platforms . On the contrary, the software house headed by the eccentric Brjnn Sigurgeirsson has chosen to take another path with its new project, with the only point of contact represented by the fact that they are both part of the same ~universe~, with a vaguely similar. Steamworld Heist is therefore a turn-based strategy set in space in the distant future and which puts the player in the shoes, or rather in the bolts of a group of traffickers and robot pirates led by Captain Piper Faraday. The aim of the game is basically to travel aboard your own spaceship to recruit new crew members and then use them in combat, raiding enemy ships and recovering as much loot as possible. Steamworld Heist is an excellent strategy that enriches the offer of the Nintendo portable Two dimensions may suffice We said above that Steamworld Heist is a turn-based strategy, yet certainly not without original ideas. In fact, if the basic mechanics relating to the management of movements and the control of one character at a time can be traced back to the classic dictates of the genre, the choice to adopt a 2D gameplay already gives a certain peculiarity to the product. Each of your robots has the ability to move a certain number of squares, and then perform an action; otherwise, one can choose to broaden the movement by going even further but giving up any other option. Exactly with in X-COM, so to speak, but with the presence of only one two-dimensional plane. Inside the settings you can climb stairs, take cover behind covers, open doors and so on, because exploration is a fundamental component of the whole. However, the action takes place rather quickly, both due to the speed of the movements of allies and enemies, and because usually the ships to be attacked are not particularly large: for this reason the levels end in short times, all in all, a factor that helps to guarantee a good pace of progression. It should also be noted that the ships are randomly generated in a procedural way, an aspect which, if on the one hand does not make the level design particularly refined, on the other it guarantees that you will never be faced with the same situation to explore. Undoubtedly one of the most successful aspects of Steamworld Heist is the combat system, which differs from most turn-based strategy games: if in fact in other titles of the genre usually the effectiveness, trajectory and aiming of the projectiles are managed automatic based on the relative characteristics of his soldiers, in this case instead the player is solely responsible for whether a shot is successful or not. This is because, once you have chosen which attack to use, the aim is then managed in real time by the player, complete with the ability to use the walls to also perform daring rebounds. An interesting solution, which offers an original approach and minimizes downtime: the result is potentially attractive gameplay even for those who don't particularly like classic strategy games, and at the same time a fresh alternative for fans. Of course, there are some perplexities, linked above all to the repetitiveness of the action and the not particular depth of the mechanics themselves, which somewhat reduce the variety of situations that one finds oneself facing, partially compromising the interest in the long run. Even the behavior of the enemies does not differ much from each other, despite the discreet aesthetic variety that distinguishes them. A lot of friends To partially mitigate these defects there is the managerial component, which represents an equally important slice of the experience. In fact, from the space map you can access not only enemy ships, but also bars and cellars that house small shops or that have potential new members of your group among their patrons. After having engaged an ally, this will find a place inside its ship, in a remotely similar way to what was seen in Mass Effect, so to speak. With each of them it is then possible to have great chats, even if the element of the plot and the development of the characters cannot be said to be fully successful, since it is difficult to find a real interest in the progression of the events. Although the lyrics areall in English, the announcement by the developers of an update for January destined to bring the translation into Italian should be noted. The fact is that each character can count on different health characteristics and movement capabilities, as well as an affinity for different types of weapons. Inventory management is also extremely important: in addition to the very precious water, a fundamental element in a world driven by steam and which represents the game currency, the loot collected from one's raids can offer new weapons, armor, grenades, and a whole series of objects to equip to increase the hopes of survival. And there are also hats: a totally accessory element and for aesthetic purposes only, but which is fun to collect by stealing them from enemies to then have your companions wear them. Successfully completing the missions then allows you to obtain points to level up the robots, so as to then unlock new skills and strengthen the strategic component on the field. Finally, as regards the technical component, Steamworld Heist confirms the qualities of the Image & Form artists in the creation of a world full of personality, with lots of details and a really spot on and pleasant style. On the other hand, the sound is less effective, which is limited to making the minimum wage. The price of 19.99 appears to be correct, and a temporary promotion should also be noted which allows you to buy the game for 16.99 until December 31st.", "date": "2015-12-09", "grade": "8.4"}
