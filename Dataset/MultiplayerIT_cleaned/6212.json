The great variety of events has therefore become an important source of inspiration for art starting from the second half of the twentieth century and consequently even video games have exploited the complex themes related to the actions of Nazi Germany. Often, however, the most affected fronts are those of open warfare, major military actions and the most emblematic stories. The occupation of France and Paris, military campaigns in Africa or concentration camp events, with horror discovered in the final stages of the war. The Second World War, however, affected everyone and everywhere, even the most remote and unknown ones, of which it is difficult to find mention in the broad spectrum analyses, submerged by the noisiest facts of the Axis actions. Gerda: A Flame in Winter therefore aims to tell us a ~minor~ but no less important story. It does so by taking us to Denmark, an area less covered by video games, putting us in the shoes of a heroine who won't necessarily act out of sheer goodness. To find out more, keep reading our review of Gerda: A Flame in Winter. Tinglev Tinglev railway station Gerda is a young woman of Danish ancestry on her mother's side and of German ancestry on her father's side. A nurse by profession, Gerda returned to Denmark shortly before the German invasion (1940) after having studied for years in Berlin. Together with her husband, Anders, she spent years under Nazi domination, trying to cope with the limits of supply and freedom imposed by foreign invaders. However, her adventure begins in 1945, when her husband is captured as a member of the Tinglev resistance, the village where the couple lives and where the whole story takes place. Forget soldiers at the front, war machines and global military tactics: Gerda A Flame in Winter puts us in the role of a woman who suddenly finds herself alone, with few friends, few resources and the simple desire to see the own spouse. Dot graphic adventure Gerda in the surgery where she works, with the doctor and some Nazis Gerda A Flame in Winter is a modern graphic adventure in which we will be asked to make various choices that will influence the plot. We will have to continually carry on dialogues and choose how to act in certain situations, with the aim of gaining the trust of those around us. In fact, the whole adventure is based not only on the macroscopic choices made in key moments of the plot, but also on the small comments that will improve or worsen our relationships with the main characters and with the ~communities~ of Tinglev. As half-Danish, half-German, Gerda stands on a dangerous, but certainly useful border: she can be friends with the Danes, as well as with the Germans (who aren't all Nazis, mind you). He may also be openly pro-insurgent, or maintain a positive relationship with the occupation. Let me be clear, the game doesn't really allow us to praise the German action with passion and overall it pushes us towards resistance, but we will still be the ones to decide how to act, also taking advantage of the help of some Nazis to try to free Anders. A typical dialogue of Gerda A Flame in Winter Two other elements are also important: the objects that we will find in the environments - such as food, doctors and luxury goods - and the ~mental~ points, classified as Compassion, Wit and Intuition. The latter accumulate between one ~level~ and the next: in this moment Gerda writes what happened in the most recent phase of the game in her diary and we will have to decide what the woman's sensations are on the subject. For example, after Anders' capture, we may understand his actions and his need to drive out the Nazis, or we may admit that he was careless and put us in danger. Mental points are used to ~win~ certain arguments, obtaining a sure result by spending a point. In the event that we do not have the necessary points or even an important object, we can choose a ~neutral~ dialogue item or try to obtain a positive result with an extreme affirmation, with the risk of a negative result. In the latter case the result will depend on a roll of the dice which will be conditioned by the relationships with the person we are talking to and with the groups to which he belongs. Gerda A Flame in Winter is therefore a sort of chess game where every action is determined by or determines the points available to us. Sometimes this ~score chase~ will break our roleplay attempts and make us rYou find yourself in the strange situation of being on positive terms with both the occupation and the resistance, but to some extent it is Gerda's unique characteristic, who has both feet in two shoes due to her mixed ancestry. A captivating story Gerda's snowy settings A Flame in Winter are like paintings What matters most is that Gerda A Flame in Winter puts us at the center of an exciting story. The cast of the adventure is varied and interesting, uniting Danes, Germans, Nazis, rebels, sympathizers of the regime, profiteers, survivors and many people who move in a gray area and whom we can praise or criticize according to our conscience. The adventure, which lasts five/six hours, is always stimulating and allows us to investigate the depths of Tinglev, which starts out like any small village and becomes the center of attacks, clashes and intrigues. Obviously Gerda A Flame in Winter offers many different endings and is replayable as during the adventure we will often have to choose which places to visit and which characters to meet, thus losing the opportunity to see other sequences. Not only are there parts of the game that will not be seen in a single playthrough, but the fate of certain characters will be sealed by our (non) actions. Saving Anders is the only thing that matters to Gerda, but will our conscience allow us to sacrifice everything and everyone? Gerda's Pleasant Style: A Flame in Winter Gerda A Flame in Winter is also very pleasant in terms of visuals and sound. The graphic style is inspired by Nordic impressionist painting and each section is a small painting: however, it works much more when stationary than in motion, as the animations are a bit crude, even for a game that doesn't aim for detail, and make plastic doll characters more than people. Even the pathfinding is a bit iffy at times, creating strange ballets back and forth of Gerda as she tries to reach the point we have indicated. The soundtrack always accompanies each section, effectively conveying Gerda's difficulties. Finally, we confirm that Gerda A Flame in Winter has texts in Italian, with English or Danish dubbing.", "date": "2022-09-01", "grade": "8.5"}
