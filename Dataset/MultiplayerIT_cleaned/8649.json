Probably yes, at least after taking a look at the number of expansions and additional packs released over time for the three major editions of the Maxis-branded ~life simulator~, which has increasingly become a goose that lays golden eggs also for Electronic Arts . Only for the latest in the series (The Sims 3, which arrived on the market in 2009), the bill divided between real expansions and so-called stuff packs has reached a total of six and five released respectively over the last three years, increasing thus furthering the success of a brand that has become a guarantee of an absolute best-seller in the videogame market with each of its incarnations. We find ourselves talking about the latest news made available at the beginning of 2012 by the California-based development team in this article, in which we offer you our main opinion on the sixth expansion just released, Showtime, dedicated to the harsh world of entertainment. We also took advantage of the opportunity to take a look at the fifth stuff pack released a few weeks ago, Master Suite Stuff, thanks to which we can transform the homes of our virtual characters with a touch of warmth and elegance. Showtime! The expansions of The Sims traditionally offer something more to the base game: not that The Sims 3 actually needed to be made further complete by its expansions, but fans of the series now also live on these appointments. The charm of the themed additions periodically introduced by Maxis knows how to exercise its appeal, as in the case of Showtime, for which the singer Katy Perry was involved as an exceptional testimonial: no person could have been more suitable to promote this expansion , given that in Showtime our Sims can attempt success in the complicated life of the show, in the various ways suggested by the game. In fact, Showtime introduces the new professions of singer, magician, acrobat and DJ, destined to show off our favorite characters throughout the district: we also have the (optional) task of setting the scene for a show that viewers can remember, even thanks to the new objects made available by Maxis. We were just talking about the neighborhood, but Showtime's possibilities go even further: among its main features we find a new level of interaction with one's online friends, thanks to mechanics intended to increase the degree of communication and exchange of players through the network . Once he has become famous in his profession, our Sim can in fact be called upon to carry out a real tour of the towns of our contacts on the EA platform, allowing us to follow their performance and also to unlock some ad hoc objects, as well as climb the special classifications dedicated to his profession. Throwing yourself headlong into the new show business jobs introduced with Showtime is quite simple: for example, you just need to resort to the newspaper delivered to your home, to respond to one of the ads present and thus embark on the desired career, then carrying on with it to increase skill and popularity . To allow this, Maxis has introduced a special series of new objects also within this expansion, such as the DJ console, actually already seen in the past: the same goes for the traits and desires of our Sims, who can thus forge their personality and their ambitions based on the new possibilities opened up by the world of entertainment. Simwood The novelties are not limited only to the professions and objects connected to them, given that if in reality we find Hollywood as the ~gathering place~ of the star system, even in The Sims 3 a self-respecting celebrity must have his home in a special place : this is why in Showtime we find the new town Starlight Shores, in all respects similar to the famous Californian resort mentioned above, complete with writing on the hill translated into Sim language. Little new to detect on the technical level in general, where we are in the presence of an expansion that follows in all respects the (excellent) style of the base game, however offering some interesting glances on the occasion of the performances of our little ones virtual friends, perhaps to the detriment of performance on some older configurations. Master Suite Stuff In evaluating Showtime, we also had the opportunity to try out the smaller of the two works that recently arrived on the market: the traditional stuff packs add new (more or less useful) objects to the game, without making any changes to the game. gameplay. Master Suite Stuff is not going to change established habits, going to focus above all onthe romantic and elegant aspect of our Sims' homes, giving them (and therefore us too) the possibility of adding luxurious and refined furnishing components. In fact, the player can count on a whole series of novelties, with which to transform areas of the house such as the bathroom and bedroom into a real hotel suite, equipped with thermal baths, canopy beds and various types of decorations always themed. In all this luxury, of course, the protagonists themselves cannot disfigure, and this is why Maxis has added a series of new clothing items, some of which are sexy to add further spice to the atmosphere created with the new objects, which our virtual alter-egos demonstrate their appreciation to the delight of all voyeurs. Even if a stuff pack is probably already an end in itself by definition, Master Suite can only be of interest to the hottest fans of The Sims 3: those who aren't quite so passionate could in fact think of saving money, instead of spending it on what they want. on balance it is something that only adds superfluous elements. Given the price of around 15, however, everyone can make their own considerations by considering whether to make the purchase or not.", "date": "2012-03-23", "grade": "7.0"}
