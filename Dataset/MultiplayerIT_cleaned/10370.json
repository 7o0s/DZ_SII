Rock Band has been able to carve out a space of its own, above all thanks to the large number of songs to download as an addition to what is offered by the basic packages and, first, thanks to the recent episode related to the Beatles, has taken a direction often invoked by many fans genre: a turn towards a repertoire more accessible to everyone and not just to virtuosos of the guitar and other plastic instruments. Lego Rock Band fits exactly in this groove, proposing a repertoire of songs for the whole family, avoiding the Heavy Metal turns typical of the more difficult songs that this genre of games has always offered to make the challenge in the final phase more demanding. single player mode. It does so by maintaining the typical structure of the first two Rock Bands already released and replacing the digital replicas of the group's musicians with the characters from the best-selling plastic bricks in the world. Did you know that Lego bricks... In Lego Rock Band you have to lead a group of bricks to conquer the most famous stages of Legolandia. The structure, as mentioned, is the same as the other Rock Bands before The Beatles, with the player having to conquer the stars to unlock new concerts and acquire fans and credits with which to buy the means to move along the stages of the virtual tour. The novelty consists of a series of concerts, accompanied by very imaginative videos, in which the band, to the sound of music, must, for example, help workers to demolish a building or must defeat the giant octopus who gets angry because his little son eight-legged was refused the position of drummer in the band, in increasingly funny and crazy situations, evidently designed to entertain a very young audience. A lot of imagination and a series of very funny sequences, which end with a victory just by playing the pieces correctly. For the rest, there is always the possibility of hiring a manager who will take care of the group's career, hiring collaborators and record companies so that each concert gives a better result in terms of money and fans won. Money that is used to buy objects with which to embellish and furnish the band's base, with dozens of objects and characters taken from the world of Lego. In addition to, of course, giving the player the opportunity to buy a myriad of tools and accessories with which to dress up the members of the group, in an escalation of legosity that brick aficionados can only adore. And, as you learn during the game, there are so many, since with each loading - a bit long to tell the truth - you are informed about the memorable successes of Lego, with the millions of packs sold, and the hundreds of thousands of bricks that will be manipulated by children from all over the world in the upcoming holidays. These messages, perhaps, become a little too present. Note, again from a ~Casual~ perspective, the introduction of the Super Easy difficulty level, in which you just need to give the picks or hit the drums in time, regardless of which button or drum you hit. Thus ensuring the usability of the game truly to any member of the family. Xbox 360 goals As is now the practice for musical games, designed to last a very long time, the objectives to obtain the fateful 1000 points are distributed along all the modes present and require you to try your hand at all the available tools. It takes a little patience, but the repertoire certainly helps. Play it again Sam! The package includes 45 songs that travel from pop to rock, without excesses and with a well-distributed pleasantness throughout the repertoire. The cutest aspect is the inclusion of reruns of singers like Freddy Mercury and David Bowie as little Lego protagonists, in addition to the fact that one can only be happy for the songs combined with these presences. The main problem is that at each concert, and there are many, only a couple of new pieces are introduced, and that in order to move on to the next phase we are continually asked to play the same pieces already performed, given that the long career is played however around the basic repertoire which is too small compared to the number of times we are asked to go on stage to be able to complete the game. Certainly, the audience that Lego Rock Band is aimed at, the younger one, will know how to overlook this feature while having a lot of fun just the same.o, but given that the expert level of difficulty is present and that even the best can find something to have fun with this repertoire, a few more songs (there are only 45) would not have hurt to conquer even the most seasoned of the genre and that now they will have to consider the purchase, perhaps taking into consideration the fact that LEGO Rock Band songs can be imported into the playlist of any Rockband episode that you already own. Which is useful, considering that there is no implementation of any online mode.", "date": "2009-11-23", "grade": "7.8"}
