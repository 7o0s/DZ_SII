The question has always gripped those who were not born with the gift of knowing how to use a pencil properly, shipwrecked on attempts that went wrong. Fortunately, technology has been helping us for some time now, allowing us to (at least try to) do what we are unable to do with a sheet in front of us. With the advent of virtual reality, this type of support has not been lacking: in fact, PC viewer owners have applications such as Tilt Brush and Quill available, while something like this has been missing for PlayStation VR until now. Let's talk about the past because Wildbit Studios has thought of putting a patch, allowing those who have used PlayStation Move to fight to use the device as a brush with CoolPaintr VR. Let's find out what it is. Learn the art From subjects rather denied in drawing, we approached CoolPaintr VR with a certain awe. If you haven't understood yet, let's say first of all that it's not a video game, but a real drawing application, which must therefore be addressed and considered as such. The Madrid team has tried to put everyone at ease with a minimal interface, within which it is possible to move with the use of a single PlayStation Move. In reality, the application also supports DualShock 4, but Sony's ~ice cream~ adapts for obvious reasons much more easily to the movements performed to create things in CoolPaintr VR. There is also the support of a contextual tutorial, useful for understanding what can be done with the various drawing options available. After choosing a few elements such as the background color to be displayed and the presence of a grid with which to have a better perception of space, CoolPaintr VR allows us to indulge ourselves as best we want, brushing in the space in front of us what we end up seeing reproduced inside the lenses of the viewer. From this point of view, it is essential to be in the PlayStation Camera field, and to make sure that you have adequate space available while using CoolPaintr VR: waving widely to give shape to our ideas, it is in fact easy to run into the limits in which the camcorder can follow our movements, or get between it and PlayStation Move in case you are making a particularly articulated drawing in space. In addition to painting, we can in fact also talk about 3D modeling, given the tools that Wildbit Studios makes available to us with CoolPaintr VR. Playstation 4 trophies Even if it is not a game, CoolPaintr VR brings with it a good number of Trophies, including the Platinum which can be reached by obtaining all the others. The rest of the achievements are made up of seven Gold, Five Silver and seventeen Bronze Trophies. To get them all you need to get busy with all the tools that CoolPaintr VR has to offer, up to - we quote - painting ~a scene as big as the Sistine Chapel~. Touch with style The amount of strokes and shapes made available by the developers is sufficient to create everything you have in mind, starting from simple tools to get to more complex ones. In the case of the normal brush, the width of the stroke is determined by the pressure level exerted on the trigger located on the back of PlayStation Move, instead using the front buttons to interact with the menu. As we said, CoolPaintr VR has a minimal style, effective in its goal of putting within a few actions those who have the viewer in their head from the type of solution they have in mind to create their work. Just look at some videos on YouTube to realize that with CoolPaintr VR you can really do everything, especially after becoming familiar with the more advanced elements, such as the organic type that allows us to model elements on the 3D shapes by interacting with their skeleton. There are also some effects such as falling snow and fire, each of which can be customized with a palette that covers the entire color spectrum. In case you want to reproduce something that already exists, the application allows you to import a JPEG image from a USB stick into the drawing space, thus using it as a reference without having to remove PlayStation VR to look at it on another screen. Similarly, you can also choose music from MP3 files from the external memory, thus choosing your own soundtrack. In fact, CoolPaintr VR arrives without any background music, always with a view to maintaining a minimal style that makes it particularly light in terms of downloads and disk space: not even 100 MB. Jobs done with this application can finally be exported tofile with the extension .dae (Digital Asset Exchange), a standard in the field of modeling that can also be opened on a PC with professional tools such as Photoshop, AutoCAD, 3D Studio Max and Maya. No vote? CoolPaintr VR is not a game and therefore will not be judged as such with a vote. Having said that, the work of Wildbit Studios does not aim to be an alternative to the professional applications mentioned above, but still offers all valid tools to give vent to one's artistic vein. At the same time, what was previously a gap in PlayStation VR is being filled.", "date": "2018-05-28", "grade": null}
