Gates of Horizon is the myth of conquest, of the unlimited accumulation of resources to become the most powerful in the galaxy, despite the fact that the starting point is another. It is the story of a frontier that extends beyond human understanding but which is rationalized in the playful space by the simulation of a large-scale economic and political system. In 2149 the Neldai attack and conquer the solar system in less than twelve hours, despite the fact that for the first time in history the various colonies had decided to work together against a common enemy. It could have been a fateful moment in human history, with the first space nodes being activated that would have enabled space travel, but it turned into a massacre, with colonies destroyed in minutes by carpet bombing, orbiting colonies wiped out in few seconds and spaceships transformed into cosmic light in instants. Only a few survived, jumping into open space nodes to unknown destinations. The various fleets split up and no one knew anything about the others for centuries. All started from scratch developing new forms of government and new technologies, ready to welcome those who had driven them from the solar system. Hundreds of years have passed and the Neldai are back to strike. It is the year 3218 and some outlying colonies are not doing so well. Experience the universe What is the use of knowing the plot of a space strategy based on the accumulation of resources? Little if not explaining why we live in this universe, why we will hire our first commander, build our first spaceship and go about mining raw materials from asteroids and battling pirates and members of rival factions in search of adventure and riches. Gates of Horizon is a bit EVE Online and a bit 4x in its desire to mix genres and cards looking for an original twist, but without straying from some already visited star systems. The beauty is that you pay (little) once and you play forever. Of course, it makes no sense to look for the production values of the greats of the genre in the title of Hex Keep. It would be wrong, as well as unfair, also because the objectives are different. Do not misunderstand, because Gates of Horizon does its thing more than well. Meanwhile, it allows you to lead an entire corporation and not just a single ship, a significant feature that after a few hours of play makes the gameplay dynamics truly peculiar. Imagine being able to control up to seven ships per fleet, roaming the galaxy in search of the best markets, more powerful ships or parts to upgrade those already owned. The pace is rather slow, especially at the beginning, when the possibilities are less and you have to settle for the lowest and most humble jobs, as if you were Italian precarious workers. Soon, however, things to do increase and, since there are no constraints of any kind (Gates of Horizon is a pure sandbox), you can really range a lot. So between roles to be assigned to pilots, galaxies to explore, enemies to shoot down and resources to find, one is always busy. Combat in particular is managed with a semi-automatic targeting system, a bit cumbersome initially, but soon natural and excellent when you find yourself with more complex battles to manage. We tried Gates of Horizon, an all-Italian 4x space MMO available on Steam But the story doesn't In short, what more could you want from an economic title without pay-to-win mechanics which, once purchased, allows you to play online forever without paying any additional subscription? Surely you can't complain too much, also considering that it is an independent product. However, we would like to underline some aspects that could demotivate you a bit. The most important is certainly the narrative side, practically non-existent. We know it's not essential, but given that the background is there and that the game was born from a precise series of events, it would have been appropriate to make them evolve, so as not to make them a cardboard backdrop in front of which to play anything. From this derives another problem, which for some could be of no small importance: there are things to do, but without a narrative glue there is the risk of perceiving them as ends in themselves. In short, if you like pure sandbox mechanics, in which the objectives are set by the player, the problem does not exist, while if you are looking for something more contextualized, you need to better evaluate the situation. From a technical point of view, Gates of Horizon is certainly not an exceptional title. Let's say that it does what it should, also considering the price it costs. Hard to expect too much ofmore, even if something could be done especially in the design of the menus, functional but a little anonymous.", "date": "2014-12-24", "grade": "7.5"}
