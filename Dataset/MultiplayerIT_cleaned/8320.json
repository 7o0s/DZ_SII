However, they have always been ultimately derivative products, which by mere similarity or characteristics were based on great console hits. In short, there was a lack of a shooter that proved to have been designed ad hoc for use on iPhone and iPad, and that was not simply the reduced version of the Halo or the Gears of War of the moment: well, thanks to the Trigger Fist present here, things can finally change... Shoot yourself for no reason Developed by hitherto unknown Lake Effect Applications, Trigger Fist gets off to a good start, turning what might at first appear to be a major shortcoming into a strength: in fact, the game does not have a storyline or a campaign mode, there are no intros or even particular options to customize your alter-ego. The title simply allows you to select one of the three available classes (Rifleman, Gunner and Scout, different in terms of characteristics and equipment) and embark on frenetic offline combat sessions against bots or online, using four distinct modes and six maps. A no-frills product, which pushes the user to immediately jump into the fray precisely because he knows that he is able to give his best on the battlefield. And in fact Trigger Fist is in all respects one of the best multiplayer experiences currently available on the App Store, thanks to an immediate and satisfying gameplay and a finally reliable control system. In this sense, the winning intuition of the developers was to completely abandon the Y axis, making the firefights take place exclusively on a horizontal plane: a gimmick that is only apparently trivial, but which in reality greatly facilitates the player's life , allowing him to move and aim with greater comfort. There are the classic virtual stick to manage movements, a large on-screen button to fire and a couple of smaller icons to touch to perform the melee attack, change weapon or reload, all in the name of ease of use and of reactivity. A streamlined solution that goes hand in hand with a playful structure that favors pure action, as evidenced by the rapid respawns and the presence of a radar that indicates the direction from which the shots come, so as to keep the user always in the heart of the guerrilla . In other words, Trigger Fist is damned fun, and proves to be suitable both for short and sporadic games and for more intense use, thanks to a well-structured character progression system: each game earns experience points that allow you to unlock new weapons, skills and items of equipment, but the most impatient can always anticipate the times by taking advantage of the inevitable (but far from invasive) in-app purchases. The good thing is that these upgrades do not give disproportionate advantages to the players who use them, making the battles always sufficiently balanced and never frustrating: iPad users will probably have a slightly more advantage than those who play on an iPhone due to the size of the screen, but these are really negligible differences. With the same ease we overlook some limitations of a product that is certainly not perfect, and which will hopefully be improved with future upgrades: six arenas are not enough, and some corrections should be made to the behavior of explosives, which right now prove to be dramatically ineffective . On the other hand, the improvement of a purely functional cosmetics, made up of basic and barely decently animated polygonal models and scenarios that leave something to be desired in terms of spectacularity and complexity, is less likely. A price that, considering the goodness of the playful experience, is still willingly paid.", "date": "2012-09-18", "grade": "8.9"}
