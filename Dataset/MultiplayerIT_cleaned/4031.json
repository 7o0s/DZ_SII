{"name": "Super Mario Party", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/super-mario-party-recensione-party-game-nintendo-switch.html", "text": "When a new console is proposed on the market, the questions players should ask themselves are basically two: will there be enough varied games? Will there be adequate support from first party titles? From this point of view, Nintendo Switch owners have very little to complain about: the first year of life of the hybrid console was excellent, the second will kick into gear by Christmas by offering a series of unmissable titles. Among these there is also the new Super Mario Party, which we are talking about today with this review: is it true or is it not true that on Nintendo Switch the great absent up to now has been a party game with all the trimmings? Gap filled, because Super Mario Party is one of the chapters of the series full of novelties, and for the first time perhaps it will guarantee enough fun even in single player: read on and you will understand why. Classic gameplay: Party Time! The launch of Super Mario Party is quite slow, and perhaps represents the only unsuccessful aspect of the production. An improbable interlude scene sees Mario and company grappling with a dilemma not just: to decide who among them is the real Super Star. It is decided to resolve the issue with mini-games (come on?), however Bowser and his henchmen also arrive, as well as Wario and Waluigi: why shouldn't they join the party too? So let's go, everyone plays together and may the best one win: from here the player is literally swallowed up in the gameplay of Super Mario Party by the so-called Party Square, the main hub of the title from which it is possible to access every single proposal designed by Nintendo . Just as if it were a real village festival, Piazza Party is decorated with festoons and various stalls, each of which allows access to the various game modes of Super Mario Party. The setting up of the individual stations in the square and the long opening speeches for each game mode did not seem the most suitable for a title that should focus everything on immediacy and light-heartedness: the Super Mario Party player wants to get on the track and laugh in the company of friends while humiliating himself with crazy mini-games, not reading two thousand explanations on the screen from Toad for all in all intuitive rules. In any case, and we reiterate it, after these first few minutes of getting to know Super Mario Party, it gets off to a great start, proving to be fresh, fun and above all varied. As could be expected, the Game of the Goose mode, or the real Mario Party, is back more solid than ever: a team of four players moves around a board by rolling dice, obtaining bonuses and malus depending on the boxes . The goal is to accumulate enough Super Stars by the end of the established game rounds: whoever has more stars than the others at the end of the game wins. The unexpected is always around the corner: now a Bob-omb comes out to penalize us in the roll of the dice, now an environmental event linked to the board is activated which modifies the path. At the end of each round, players are offered a random mini-game to be played individually or in teams: there are more than eighty of them, so it's really impossible to fall into repetitiveness, unless you play Super Mario Party at all hours of the day and night . The purpose of the minigames is to allow players to accumulate coins, which after the Super Stars are the second most important thing in Mario Party: in fact, without coins you cannot buy Super Stars, nor useful tools to use when rolling the dice. such as point multipliers. Among the innovations related to Super Mario Party we must mention at least the presence of variants within the dice: it is possible to use a classic six-sided die, but also very particular alternative dice, which will be unlocked during the game or which are linked to the individual character used (and there are at least fifteen characters). For example, Bowser has a die that doesn't know half measures: the results are almost always either 2 or 8; Luigi, on the other hand, as a support character, will rarely give us anything higher than 1. But genius really emerges from everywhere, from small details and events that make the game always unpredictable and fun; moreover, the game maps also reward a pinch of strategy, because it is not whoever arrives first who wins, but who knows how to stop exactly on the right squares. Innovative gameplay: Wild waters and online play Super Mario Party is not just a board dedicated to the game of the goose in Nintendo sauce: we could even define the main game mode as the least original of all, although it obviously winscent and very inspiring. This is because the other contents proposed even go further, offering a gaming experience unthinkable on other consoles: Acque Selvagge, for example, requires a group of four players to control a dinghy by mimicking the movements of the oars with the Joy-Con . Gradually along the rapids of the river you have to choose between crossroads, different types of obstacles and (obviously) still mini-games, but the group will only be able to reach the end of the path by winning all the proposed challenges. Organization is key, otherwise the time will drop to zero before you've even reached the halfway point. Palco del Ritmo is the third game mode proposed, another ideal starting point for carefree fun within the family: just hold a single Joy-Con, get up from the sofa and follow Waluigi's movements in his improbable sketches. The level of difficulty increases little by little, and ever greater reflexes and precision are needed to keep up with the evil purple plumber, but laughter is always guaranteed. If everything we've told you about so far doesn't interest you, because for some reason you've always hated the game of the goose, boat rides and stage ballets, you'll still be happy to know that all the Super Mario Party mini-games will be accessible freely within the Minigiocathlon. Here it will be possible to challenge the CPU or up to three friends to the best of five: who will accumulate the most points by tackling each single minigame? There are 80 Super Mario Party proposals, and many of them will have to be unlocked by playing and replaying the game modes present: naturally some mini-games are more inspired than others, but almost all of them manage to take advantage of the Joy-Con functions in an excellent way, both in terms of motion control and vibration. One challenge required us to pan-roast a piece of meat, shaking the controller just like the handle of the pan itself; another demanded that we recognize a precise vibration among the many proposed just before. But there are paths to complete while keeping your balance, pole challenges, coins to collect, enemies to avoid, rackets with which to throw bombs at your opponents, and so on and so forth. If unfortunately you don't have friends to play Super Mario Party with, know that the online mode is finally available, a further enrichment for the longevity of the game that fans have been asking for for some time. Not all minigames support it, and obviously for the moment we have not found online opponents, but we are sure that soon there will be quite a ruckus there too.", "date": "2018-10-03", "grade": "8.2"}
