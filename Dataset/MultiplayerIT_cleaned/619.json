{"name": "Bust-a-Move DS", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/bust-a-move-ds.html", "text": "History repeating The purpose of Bust-a-Move is always the same, unchanged over the years: the player will have to deal with a series of patterns containing agglomerations of colored balls that will have to be exploded until the last one in order to continue. The peculiarity of Bust a Move, what makes it substantially different from other puzzles, is the simple assumption that the pieces will not fall from above, it will not be necessary to rotate them or change their color sequence, the player himself will be the advocate of his luck by shooting with a kind of cannon with adjustable angle the colored balls that will follow the game. The easiest way to pass the stage will therefore be to place three or more balls of the same color close together, so as to cause their disappearance and continue with this work until the end. Some stages due to their particular conformation can be beaten for example in a couple of simple moves by hitting the agglomeration of balls directly at the base to make them all collapse, others will require more strenuous work, the fact remains that they can still be tackled in the most disparate ways as long as they lead to the total cleaning of the screen. In all this, the DS enters almost on tiptoe without ruining what good Taito had created, simply by rewriting the ball throwing mechanics by adapting them to the touch screen: in this portable chapter, to make your own throws you will need to throw the ball and direct it as if he were in a hypothetical slingshot and, when the choice is made, release to launch the colored projectile. History repeating The single player present in Bust-a-Move Ds is divided into: Puzzle, Endless and VS Cpu. The first mode is the one that can commonly be associated with the story mode in a puzzle game, it will be possible to choose your own path (trivially divided into ABCDE) and after passing ten stages you will access the second chapter in the presence of a new crossroads and away you go until the end of the game. The decisions count as real crossroads in terms of stage structure: it is not the story that changes but the type of arrangement of the balls, some crossroads will put the player in front of stages full of colored bowls, others will put him to the test with stages where the ballistic capacity of the right shot at the right time will be the discriminating factor between continuing or losing the game. The Endless mode will engage the player with an infinite scrolling level only where as time passes more and more lines of balls are added from above; in this mode there is no real purpose and there is no way to complete it, all you have to do is challenge yourself to beat the best score and race against the clock until the classic game over screen appears . The VS CPU closes the mode triptych, a tasty preview of the multiplayer mode in which it will be possible to challenge from 1 to 4 enemies controlled by the CPU at the same time, the aim of the game -almost needless to say- will be to beat each opponent by keeping the own playing area. Vector supports However, multiplayer proves to be the real lifeblood for this Taito puzzle game: present in both the ~download ds~ and ~wireless~ incarnations, it allows you to play up to five players simultaneously in a slightly different version (as regards the game rules ) but much more additive than the single player. In addition to the canonical basic setting, much of the game strategy will be based on chains and diamonds: in multiplayer games the key to victory, in addition to good speed, lies in diamonds, these jewels represent the amount of bubbles burst in your stage and are used to put opponents in trouble by adding unwanted bubbles to their screens. The actual imbalance between skill and the use of diamonds is caused by the chains, a method whereby if you destroy - for example - a group of red bubbles by also dropping others of other colors, these instead of ending up lost forever will automatically start again towards the 'high going to find pairs of the same color to make them pop and to create destructive combos. The result of the equation that comes out of this process is therefore: the more bubbles you will burst, the more jewels you will get and the more devastating the attack on your opponents will be. Beyond the actual fun, the problem that afflicts the excessive simplicity of chain creation remains, all you need to do is throw a few balls down to create unexpected and incalculable chain effects, making multiplayer at times like a continuous launch pad of diamonds rather than exploding balls in the Bust-a-Move style. Supportvector you Graphically the judgment can only be positive, the series has never shone for graphic wonders and the developers' search for a style that is both simple and well-finished and that recalls Taito's light-hearted style at first glance is evident. However, the backgrounds of the stages are not worthy of note, on the one hand there is certainly the intention not to distract the player with too complex animations or images, on the other there is the bitterness of having grainy images in front of you, blurry or simply ugly (in stark contrast to the pleasant vector cleanliness of the menus). The sound sector remains quite average for Taito-Bust a Move productions, with a whole series of effects and tunes that could make the game recognized even with your eyes closed. It's Bust-a-Move, and when they say a name is worth a thousand words in this case it's true. It remains the same as ever, a good single player game and a great multiplayer game. Some doubts remain about the presence of multiplayer chains which perhaps unbalance the game structure a little too much towards something less fun and less technical. The integration with the touch screen is almost perfect and some slight inaccuracies do not change the actual value of the game. Pros: it's bust-a-move well integrated touch screen infinite in multiplayer Cons: sometimes the stylus is imprecise unbalanced difficulty There is a whole category of traveling games, those born in times that hardly anyone remembers but that everyone knows and that everyone has played due to the different reincarnations of everything the market has offered in terms of hardware. Proudly part of this category is Bust-a-Move (alias Puzzle Bobble in Japan), a fun spin-off of that milestone of the video game that was Bubble Bobble, which has now largely reached double figures in terms of appearances on consoles and which in order not to contradict itself, it is proposed in a slightly new guise also on Nintendo Ds. By adapting the touch screen mechanics to what has been solid and unchanged gameplay for more than ten years now, Taito invites us to sharpen our aim and make an orderly massacre of colored balls.", "date": "2006-02-15", "grade": null}
