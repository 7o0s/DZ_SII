{"name": "Dordogne", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dordogne-recensione.html", "text": "Dordogne is one of those productions capable of remaining immediately imprinted in the viewer's mind thanks to its distinctive and particular artistic style: Cdric Babouche's watercolors skilfully outline the French countryside, its colors and its peculiarities as the weather changes, the all accompanied by the calming sound of the Dordogne River, which flows through the video game setting of Umanimation and Un Je Ne Sais Quoi. Thirty-year-old Mimi grappling with the death of her grandmother and a past clouded by a mysterious amnesia, is called to move to these places and to rediscover her own history, as well as that of her family. It is a pity that an excellent artistic direction does not alongside an equally effective gameplay, and in the end also the story of Dordogne, after excellent premises, turns out to be impalpable, not very consistent, like a thin sheet at the mercy of a downpour. Certainly some interesting intuitions remain, but Dordogne fails to carry out its excellent premises with conviction. We talk about it in detail in our Dordogne review. Go back to go forward The artistic direction of Dordogne, all sketched in watercolor, is one that remains impressed We were saying that Mimi doesn't remember anything from her past, and precisely she has no memories of what happened to her before she turned thirteen. When her grandmother dies, she feels called to the country house of the deceased, who lived in the splendid and sunny Dordogne. Despite the hostile reaction of her father - who, for reasons that will never be fully clarified, harbored a strong resentment towards her mother - Mimi moves away from the city to throw herself headlong into this completely different environment, with her own rhythms, capable of bring her back into her past and make her rediscover, slowly, some significant events of her childhood. Everything happens through the interaction with particular objects; in each of the chapters of the adventure, lasting about four-five hours, even trivial household utensils manage to upset the mind of the protagonist and project her into the past, in which we will be called to move in the various settings of the campaign and get to know the cast of the adventure. It's a pity that the various spaces - although wonderfully outlined in watercolor, with a truly unmistakable and spot-on style - soon end up repeating themselves over and over again, severely limiting the player's sense of wonder and discovery. Even some stereotyped representations of the supporting actors would have deserved a review, or at least a more careful meditation: the figure of the thief, in particular, is completely unhappy from this point of view. Overall, the plot of Dordogne soon expires in the most complete predictability, and not even in the finale is there any authentic participation in Mimi's adventures and in the lessons that the young girl draws from this dive into her past. Dordogne is unexpectedly cold, unfocused in its narrative choices, and full of obscure points on aspects of the plot which, if they had been explored, perhaps would have led to a different outcome and a greater attachment to Mimi and the co-protagonists of the adventure. Drawings, photos, recordings, poems The kayak sessions quickly become monotonous, but they allow you to appreciate once more the wonderful style of Cdric Babouche Already in our trial in Dordogne we had drawn a parallel between the French production in question and the Canadian one of SEASON: A Letter to the Future, released just a few months ago. Just like in Season, the protagonist Mimi finds herself, as a child, composing the pages of a binder, formed with poems, photographs, stickers and audio recordings. The idea is excellent, at least in principle, but the implementation is much less free and ~open~ than seen in SEASON: it is not possible to insert more than one element per page for each of the categories listed above, and in the end of the process one feels more constrained than anything else by the collector and the mechanics that involve it, unfortunately not capable of making the players feel like the real authors of their memories in this videogame Dordogne. The scarce options for customizing the pages of the binder make the collectibles that Mimi can find during the exploration lose meaning: what is the point of collecting a plethora of stickers in the various settings if, at the end of the fair, only one can be used for each chapter? In addition to collecting memories to pass on to the future, Mimi will find herself playing a series of mini-games that will intersperse the more distinctly narrative phases: kayaking on the Dordogne, fishing for lost forks in the river in the cohaving a picnic, shopping at the market, planting herbs and much more. Everything is very simple, and the interactions are not always precise and significant in the economy of the adventure as a whole; even from this point of view, we found Dordogne rather elementary and far from unforgettable. The Dordogne storyline fails to surprise and leave a strong impression on the hearts of the players An English dubbing of fluctuating quality (definitely better than the one in French) and a translation of the texts and dialogues in Italian seasoned, unfortunately, by some unpleasant oversights do not help. Dordogne is, all in all, not very refined also from the point of view of the music and sound design as a whole.", "date": "2023-06-13", "grade": "6.5"}
