Therefore, having concluded the positive forays into the construction, air and railway transport sectors, NimbleBit tries again, but this time dealing with a zoo: let's see, therefore, if the formula works in this case too or if it starts to creak a bit. .. Even the animals dance As we mentioned at the beginning, the Disco Zoo present here immediately showcases the typical characteristics of the most recent NimbleBit productions, i.e. the pixel art graphics and a playful structure based on a sort of micro-management which tends to be enjoyed with short but frequent gaming sessions. The title remains on the path traced by its predecessors also as regards immediacy, considering how the few initial tutorial screens are sufficient to have full command of what happens on the screen. The goal is therefore to build and expand a zoo, following a very simple management scheme: each guest animal in the park produces an income of a certain amount of coins per minute, a value directly proportional to the rarity of the species to which it belongs. The zoo is divided into boxes, each relating to the cage of a specific group of creatures, and can be easily explored by swiping on the touch screen: in this way, it is possible to view all the statistics relating to the various specimens, collect coins with taps donated by visitors and above all - with a method that could also hurt the feelings of animal rights activists - wake up the sleeping critters and therefore unable to generate profit. In a similar way to the previous Pocket Planes and company, Disco Zoo in these phases does not offer many things to do, and it is for this reason that the ideal method of approach is that of short but frequent game sessions: once all the matters that request your interest, you can easily close the application and reopen it when one or more notifications appear informing you of the procedures to be completed. Disco Zoo reproposes without too much conviction a formula that perhaps needs a refresh Even the role of virtual money and the inevitable in-app purchases closely resembles what NimbleBit has explored so far with its management software. The coins are therefore used to buy new means of transport with which to go and find increasingly exotic species, but there is also a second currency (here called DiscoBux) which is used to speed up or simplify some procedures or to unleash a party - from which the title of the game - which doubles the income produced by the various animals for a limited period of time and resets their rate of tiredness. Both coins and DiscoBux are given extremely sparingly, forcing the user who does not want to spend real money on in-app purchases to undergo long grinding sessions to get the funds necessary to purchase the desired upgrades. Nothing new even here, considering how this aspect is also part of the NimbleBit tradition: a pity, however, that, compared to its predecessors, Disco Zoo demands too much in proportion to what it really has to offer. The more strictly playful part, the one relating to the catching of animals, appears more like a money-eating machine than a proper game component. At this juncture, in fact, the title brings into play an unconvincing revival of the typical mechanics of naval battle, with boxes relating to a single creature instead of boats: having a limited number of attempts available, one must try to identify as many animals as possible, bearing in mind that each specimen has a distinct arrangement on the grid, be it horizontal, vertical, oblique or a combination of all three. It all boils down to a matter of luck to be paid dearly: each game has a cost in coins that gets higher and higher, and when one's moves are exhausted one is always encouraged to spend DiscoBux to reveal the contents of the boxes or get extra attempts. A truly exaggerated outlay in proportion to the meager satisfactions that this gameplay solution is capable of guaranteeing.", "date": "2014-03-04", "grade": "6.4"}
