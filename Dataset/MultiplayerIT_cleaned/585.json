{"name": "Sonic Riders - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sonic-riders-recensione.html", "text": "sonic world Sonic Riders is clearly a spin off of the saga, it is not a platformer but a skateboard racing game that takes its cue from the speed of the SEGA character and uses the characters from the series and the classic Sonic storyline as a means to articulate the different game modes . The main mode is in fact a story mode that pits Sonic against the historic enemy Doctor Eggman, both engaged in contending for a new Chaos Emerald. The plot is therefore the most classic that can be found in the Sonic universe but it is all in all functional since it is a racing game and eliminates the risk of disappointing or upsetting the fans of the saga a priori. Between a movie and an animation made with the game engine we are therefore approaching the recovery of the coveted emerald but the nature of the game means that the real objectives of the story mode are characters, boards and tracks which, with a couple of exceptions , are unlockable thanks to this mode and the completion of its various parts. At the end of the games, a fan of the saga can only be satisfied by finding practically every relevant character in the saga and having a track available for every classic environment found in past titles dedicated to Sonic. Part racing, part skating, part Sonic If I had to briefly describe the gameplay of Sonic Riders I would say that we are faced with a sketchy mix of SSX, Sonic and Wipeout. Specifically, we find rather short routes and to gain speed it is necessary to use platforms and bonuses scattered along the route, the turbo is obtained by collecting the notorious golden rings and maneuverability decreases radically with the increase in speed, forcing us to choose the trajectories to follow. As a small variation on the theme, we are given the possibility of recharging the turbo also using the energy ~booths~ scattered along the track. Fortunately, the Sonic Team did not limit itself to simply collecting and mixing classic elements but indulged in the implementation of rather interesting novelties. For example, performing chain stunts and landing with a certain precision will not give us points but will allow us to temporarily increase our speed. Another peculiarity is represented by the possibility of making a lightning-fast rotation which proves to be incredibly useful in hairpin bends but which, in the event of a mistake, can slow us down drastically or project us in a direction other than the optimal one. But the most relevant novelty is represented by the wakes of the other runners which manifest themselves as real turbulence capable of guiding us along the track and helping us to maintain a high speed. In truth, the help provided by the wakes is far too marked but it is functional to the possibility that we are given to use the turbulences themselves as air ramps to be used to perform acrobatics and combinations. Potentially these features alone would be sufficient to promote a skateboard title, but they inexorably collide with a control system that is too rigid and linked almost exclusively to maintaining the trajectories and with an extremely limited number of stunts that are limited to rotations along the eight main axes of the controller stick. Furthermore, the aforementioned brevity of the routes does not translate into a richness of the same, the routes are in fact rather poor in bonuses, ramps, tunnels and details of all kinds, limiting the actual difference between one track and another to the surrounding environment. The multiplayer is limited to the classic split screen but the modes are numerous enough to represent a valid option for an afternoon with friends. Part racing, part skating, part Sonic A thorny problem The poverty of maps in terms of design unfortunately coincides with their aesthetic poverty. If the character models defend themselves after all, the elements that we find along the routes are isolated and hungry for polygons and, although there is a certain number of animated elements in some tracks, overall the tracks do not offer a good show. Some tracks are partially saved thanks to particle effects, heat distortions and other graphic additions scattered here and there but the title as a whole does not deviate from a narrow enough. Yet even in this case the horizon is not completely dark, in fact the techno and speed ambient traces go well with the sensation of speed which is rather marked thanks also to the very solid 60 frames per second. Cross-platform The game is essentially identical on all platforms. The choice, therefore, depends on which one you prefer to play usually. Comment Even this Sonic, despite the efforts made and the news that Sonic Team tried to introduce, misses the mark. Beyond the positive or negative points of the individual elements, the amalgam is missing and the sensation of speed, albeit excellent, fails to give a sufficiently dynamic imprint to the title. On the technical side Sonic Raiders settles on rather low standards and the design of the tracks is insufficient. Ultimately it is a title dedicated almost exclusively to those looking for an off-season and unpretentious skateboarding title and is specifically aimed at the most hardcore Sonic fans thanks to the good variety of unlockable content, although the fact that the supersonic being having to use a skateboard might be too hard for someone to digest. Pros: good feeling of speed 60 frames per second nailed full of extras Cons: technically poor control system not dynamic enough short and uninspired courses Despite its remarkable speed, Sonic has always pursued Mario, at least considering 8 bits as the starting point for the mass market. Yet the two symbolic characters, for years fighting as the greatest representatives of two different ways of conceiving the platform, have always run on different tracks. In fact, Sonic, despite being a pursuer in sales, has always presented himself as the innovator, as the new generation platform, no longer focused on the simple jump from one platform to another but characterized by levels built to express speed and adrenaline like a racing game. However, both found themselves having to deal with the need to evolve with the times and with the new tastes of the players. Ironically Mario proved to be the easiest to innovate, perhaps thanks to his classical background or simply thanks to the solidity of Nintendo, which refused to be dragged into the impetuous and expensive market imposed by Sony thanks to its capital from external markets. Leaving aside the SEGA misadventures, and the market issues that are difficult to precisely define objective or subjective responsibilities, we can unfortunately say that in the three dimensions Sonic has lost his legendary charge. The most surprising element is that the last chapters dedicated to the blue hedgehog cannot be classified as trivial titles, on the contrary, they remain unique titles that show a good deal of work, if only in some aspects that are different from time to time, but which for one reason or another miss the mark, sometimes sensationally.", "date": "2006-03-15", "grade": null}
