{"name": "Life is Strange: Wavelengths", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/life-is-strange-wavelengths-recensione.html", "text": "As we wrote in the interview with Katy Bentz and Mallory Littleton, Stephanie ~Steph~ Gingrich proved to be an interesting secondary character in Life is Strange, to the point of becoming a thicker supporting character in Life is Strange: True Colors. This, evidently, was not enough for Deck Nine, who also wanted to dedicate the Wavelengths DLC to her, set a year before the main events and which leads us to discover Steph's slow acclimatization in the small community of Haven Springs. Hers is a character that has allowed the developers to range over different themes: she is a lesbian, so she allows Deck Nine to touch on an always delicate theme; she is a lover of tabletop RPGs, which gives that hint of nerd that is never out of place; more importantly, he lived in Arcadia Bay before and especially during the events of the original Life is Strange. If there's anyone who can act as a leitmotif, offering us another point of view on events and characters, it's her. Does it succeed? We can say yes, without reservations. Wavelengths is a story that starts slowly and grows progressively, just like Steph's life in Haven Springs: she has to acclimatise and therefore proceeds gradually, in small and often uncertain steps until she finds her space and closes the circle, reconnecting to the first meeting Alex during True Colors events. The most particular aspect of this DLC is that everything is set inside the record store: you never leave there, yet exploration is always rewarding, offering us new details on the various True Colors characters, returned to us through another lens which, however, is, in a certain sense, common to Alex's. Inhabitants and citizens are filtered through the eyes of a stranger, just like Gabe's sister. The end result is a pleasant introspection that mixes with the daily work of DJ and record store saleswoman, a marriage in which she still manages to find once space the nerd part of Steph: if you're wondering how it is possible to adapt the role-playing game within the confined space of a shop, you just have to keep reading. Before getting to the heart of this Life is Strange: Wavelengths review, a piece of advice: the narrative is appreciated much more if you have played the original Life is Strange, since there is no shortage of references, regardless of the final choice. Playing this DLC without having experienced Arcadia Bay will certainly not give you the same emotions as those who know the previous events. New life in Haven Springs Life is Strange: Wavelengths, Steph grappling with his work as a DJ Picking up on the previous paragraphs, Wavelengths opens with Steph ready for her new job in Haven Springs: DJ and shop assistant that belonged to a long-retired woman. Over the course of a year, which will be covered through some highlights, Steph will have to become familiar with her role and settle into a community ready to welcome her with open arms. We, on the other hand, will discover what Katy Bentz and Mallory Littleton's words have already suggested to us, namely that behind her dazzling smile and always ~cool~ air, Steph's emptiness is much bigger than we think. believe. We would like to tell you about it in detail, but we would end up ruining the experience: we limit ourselves to saying that, particularly in its connection to the original Life is Strange, Wavelengths once again manages to hit where the adventures of Max and Chloe they are more impressed. We personally made a precise choice, at the time, which we have never regretted nor have we thought of reloading to see what would have happened otherwise: already with Before the Storm, Deck Nine has outlined characters who have made that decision a bit heavier, but it is with Wavelengths that it sinks definitively. Steph lived through those moments and we can tell that she suffers from PTSD, something we would not have expected from her character. Yet it is there, ready to re-emerge when least expected, opening a series of scenarios and conversations which in their introspection give even more depth to the choice made at the time. Conversations Life is Strange: Wavelengths, a lot can happen in a year The beauty of Wavelengths is just that: the conversations. Throughout the course of the DLC, Steph will never see anyone and all her interactions will be via smartphone messages, computer and calls during DJ sessions. It's as if the record store detached itself from reality while continuing to be part of it: no one enters, no one leaves, although it is obvious that behind the scenes this happens - Steph certainly does not sleep in the store and records are not sold for nothing. Step by step,his character is deepened and we players are invited into his daily life, between the repetitive DJ tasks and the unpredictability of a D20: we told you, Deck Nine has found a way to implement D&D here too, partly with a regular session to prepare for remote play but, above all, thanks to Steph's guessing role. Following her first call, she is jokingly (or maybe not) believed to be able to predict the future and from that moment on viewers will call her to have predictions made: the answer will first of all be established by the launch of the D20, following the which will open up two possibilities to follow, which Steph will narrate by letting the imagination run wild, but remaining in the perspective of the situation presented. As funny as it is on the one hand, this DJ/spectator dialogue touches more or less serious themes: in the day of Pride, one of the characteristic moments of this DLC, we will listen for example to a sorry father who tells of the evening in which his son came out; on another occasion we will talk about potential harassment at work; again, a nephew who doesn't know how to react to the all too important gift given to him by his grandmother. The situations are different and, little by little, we understand how that little corner created for fun has become a fixed point for many people, who call to seek a comparison and perhaps some comfort in our words. But this will be up to us, because the die gives a direction but one extreme or the other will still be up to us to decide. Life is Strange: Wavelengths, all of Steph's interactions will be via smartphone, phone or PC Beyond the DJ duties, there are personal notes to follow within the DLC, which help shape Steph even more and her relationship with the other characters, but also with herself. There's the dating sim component, where you have to swipe through potential interesting people via a dating app and from there decide whether or not they're the right one for you. Considering that they change with each new context, the number of candidates is considerable and we don't know how many have an effective match with us (certainly not all, the possibilities obviously increase with common interests): if there is, you can start a conversation which, depending on when you start it, can extend all the way to the end of the DLC. We underlined it in the interview and we repeat it here, Deck Nine's approach to the topic of homosexuality - and not only, in the LGBTQ+ sphere - is natural, fluid, no forcing is perceived. Steph is a lesbian and does not hide it but this aspect is not exacerbated: even the choice to introduce Pride as a key moment among those of the DLC is not a wink for its own sake, but offers further insight into Steph and the his past relationships, while giving the opportunity to introduce situations (see that of the father mentioned above) without making them appear comfortable. Not that certain speeches have to be addressed during Pride, but precisely because it is intended to be a celebratory event, it makes sense to make it the sounding board for certain conversations in the game. main game and rightly so because it was specifically developed around a character to make him better known. Although it is set only inside the record store, the repetitiveness never comes to us since the gap between one period and another, with the changes that follow, always pushes us to look around to see how, slowly, the shop is becoming what we knew in Life is Strange: True Colors. It's a slow closing of the circle, which starts from Arcadia Bay and ends with Alex's arrival in Haven Springs, dictating Steph's progressive evolution and her awareness of certain situations. Once again, even more than in the base game, music is the master: we are the DJs and we always choose the rhythm of the day, as well as compose our own very personal song that we will be able to enjoy in the final bars of the game. The only thing that's a bit jarring is the short transition between when you enter and leave the DJ room: the cut to black and above all the interruption of the music create a small but heartfelt detachment from what otherwise turns almost immediately in a pleasant everyday life.", "date": "2021-10-04", "grade": "8.0"}
