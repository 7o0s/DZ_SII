It is a dungeon crawling RPG with turn-based combat, random encounters and some comic-~spicy~ element in perfect anime style. The incipit at the base of the plot is, as always in these cases, an excuse to stage absolutely crazy situations, between succinct but never vulgar little women, double meaning jokes and much more. In fact, the story tells of some girls that the player, as a newly hired guardian, must accompany on their long journey of redemption through the various floors that make up Hell, where their souls have been condemned to damnation. The criminals will have to pass various tests in order to come back to life and thus have a second chance to redeem themselves, suffering a good spanking or a few whips when necessary. Criminal Girls arrives in Europe in a new version exclusive to PlayStation Vita To Hell and back The game structure is the classic one of the genre, with the shot from above, the labyrinthine dungeons to be explored with your party in search of treasures and enemies to face in the more classic setting of turn-based combat. The latter actually differ from those of other productions for the particular mechanics that govern their actions, which at first glance might seem to be governed by a certain randomness and make many turn up their noses due to its unpredictability. This is because in these situations it is not possible to access all the skills of the party characters, but only one at a time, and moreover to those decided by the girls themselves, who will offer the user a series of actions to choose from. In fact, you can therefore perform only one action to use a single object, physical or magical attack, or ability. All this requires the gamer to carefully plan every move, taking into account what the four members of the group will offer him from time to time, but also their fighting characteristics and affinities, and to try to develop the party in a heterogeneous way, in in such a way as to change even while running a character with another more suitable for the type of battle in progress. To do this, as well as with the various objects that can be purchased through the game currency, i.e. the CM, with the level-up or with other upgrades that can be scraped together around Hell, he can resort to corporal punishment, here under Motivation. It is therefore enough to go inside one of the many infirmaries scattered in the basement, and start the work. In fact, during the Motivate Time the figure of the gamer's educator comes into play, who through the use of the analog sticks and the tactile controls of PlayStation Vita finds himself interacting with the bodies of the girls, to punish them and ~lead them on the right path~. eliminating their temptations. In reality, these phases are not only used to have a laugh (or to give vent to the little pervert inside each of us) while like new Fantozzi users touch the console screen in front and behind to spank or stimulate the criminals through QTEs, but also to unlock hidden character abilities. Some of these are active, and become indispensable during the combat phases, others more passive but still necessary for the increase of some statistics. Then there are the Field Skills, that is to say specific actions for each damned young person that can also be used outside of battles. Tomoe, for example, can teleport the group to the last save point, Ran can temporarily prevent random encounters, while Kisaragi can indicate the number of unopened chests on the floor being explored, including hidden ones. Also in the infirmaries it is possible to rest the party to restore health, save, access a shop in which to shop and quickly teleport from one part of the various dungeons to another, given that the various astanteries are connected to each other. If the gameplay of Criminal Girls: Invite Only does not excite that much, the same can also be said for the technical part. From a graphic point of view, the character design, which offers stereotyped female figures, is well-finished and pleasing, with its slightly manga, slightly super deformed style of the old titles for Super Nintendo or Mega Drive. At the same time, however, the character sprites on the screen look a tad blurry and in battle, where everything takes place on a fixed screen with the four player-managed female fighters positioned on the four sides of the screen, and the monsters in the center, are practically static. Ups and downs also in the realization of the scenarios, con underground all the same, apart from the presence or absence of snow and other surrounding elements. The much touted hot skits, actually quite restrained, were subjected to both video and audio censorship in the western localization. Therefore the pink mists remain even in the more advanced levels of the adventure (in the Japanese edition they were eliminated), some ~critical~ points are more covered and the voices and moans of the girls have been removed. However, the sound offers a good Japanese dubbing during the rest of the adventure, with English subtitles, and a decent soundtrack, where the opening song of the game stands out in particular.", "date": "2015-03-11", "grade": "6.5"}
