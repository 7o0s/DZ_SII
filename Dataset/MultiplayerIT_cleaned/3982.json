{"name": "Sinner: Sacrifice for Redemption", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sinner-sacrifice-for-redemption-recensione.html", "text": "Being identified in the eyes of the world as the ~Chinese Dark Souls~, having emerged as one of ChinaJoy's most interesting projects several months ago, can be a double-edged sword, with the visibility that gives such a juxtaposition and conversely the difficult to establish itself under a labeling of this type. However, Sinner: Sacrifice for Redemption must be acknowledged for having tried to propose something truly new in the souls-like field, as we will see in this review, and it is certainly no small thing, considering how little space is allowed for the digressions from the path traced by Hidetaka Miyazaki and his companions in this sort of videogame genre, whose definitions are rather ephemeral. The same concept of souls-like is vague and creaks on different sides, because in fact the peculiarity of the gaming experience is a fundamental trait of From Software titles, therefore the claim to broaden its characteristics to include an entire genre under those traits so strange and peculiar it seems a bit of a contradiction. However, there is no doubt that there are similarities between the various Souls and games such as Lords of the Fallen and Nioh, even if thinking of approaching any action RPG director a little more rigid and selective than normal to Miyazaki's game vision seems a bit ' specious, because certain elements of the gameplay have existed since well before Demon's Souls was born. If the doubt may remain regarding the aforementioned titles, which are also characterized by a well-defined lore and a rather complex structure, for Sinner: Sacrifice for Redemption it is difficult not to think that it is a project built to fit in the wake of Dark Souls and the like, even for a rather limited production that has prompted the developers to focus on a very spartan and compact gaming experience, as well as relying on a very high level of difficulty as usual, to further certify their belonging to the pseudo-genre. The results immediately showed good potential, with some doubts more or less intact up to this point. The seven deadly sins The choice to build a sort of boss rush rather than a more standard-shaped video game could be a reflection of a certain limited means available to the independent Dark Star team, but it is still a courageous decision, choosing to focus exclusively on the gameplay leaving out everything else, including the construction of a story and a convincing lore. Not bad, one might say, in case you manage to find a stylistically elevated approach that compensates for the unsaid with a truly overwhelming atmosphere, unfortunately this is not exactly the case. Not that action RPGs of this type need a plot to go on, as Souls themselves have shown on the other hand, but if there is one feature that goes beyond dialogues and cutscenes, it is at least the construction of a deep lore and convincing, able to at least involve and create a sort of suture between the player and the nameless hero on the screen. In this case we are dealing with a mysterious traveler who finds himself fighting against eight monsters, seven of which represent as many deadly sins. The animations that open each fight and illustrate something of the creatures we have to fight are fascinating and create a certain interest, but everything remains extremely superficial and undeveloped, making it difficult to stimulate a real connection with the strange world staged, which always remains halfway between explicit and enigmatic, resulting in a sort of sketchy construction. Not that the atmosphere is missing in Sinner: Sacrifice for Redemption, indeed its departure from certain clichs of the now standardized dark fantasy is commendable and the characterization of some bosses is truly spot on, but in its reduction of everything to the bone it does not prove to have enough character to support such a tight narrative hermeticism and everything seems to be limited to a sort of somewhat naive style exercise. Boss rush with some peculiarities The idea behind Sinner: Sacrifice for Redemption is the reduction of souls-like to a set of boss fights. From a sort of central hub it is possible to access seven levels, each of which contains only one boss fight, obviously very difficult and particularly spectacular. It is therefore a question of immediately committing oneself to the maximum, studying the attack patterns and working on tactics to try to pass the test, because here one cannot even rely on the buffer offered by the possibility of dedicating oneself to grinding to thin the difference in height with the power of the bosses, nor conquer new weapons and armor seen chand the basic equipment remains unchanged in every fight. The concept is to reduce the experience of this genre to its core, stripping it of the grinding and exploration to focus exclusively on the intensity of the most challenging fight, an idea that on paper is also very interesting but which creates continuity problems, character and compactness of the experience, leaving the impression of a sort of still incomplete prototype rather than a complete game in all its parts. However, it is not the only original feature of the game, which inserts another peculiarity to increase the technical rate of the clashes: before entering each arena, you suffer a sort of penalty, with the reduction of some of the protagonist's statistics. It can be a drop in hit points, a reduction in the amount of usable secondary weapons or a broken shield, which makes defense difficult, but each boss requires a toll to be paid just to be encountered and this strongly affects the characteristics of the character , imposing precise choices and tactics, which further complicate things. It is this ~sacrifice~ also mentioned in the name of the game, which is required before entering any battle. It's a kind of leveling down instead of up as usually happens in action RPGs, and it is in all respects the best idea and with the greatest potential implemented in Sinner: Sacrifice for Redemption. The possibility of choosing the order in which to face the bosses and the consequent sacrifices to be made first is somewhat reminiscent of the classic setting of the Mega Man level selection and imposes a further level of strategy to deal with, also because the various sacrifices also affect subsequent fights, imposing a careful balance on which ones to run first, with the possibility of being able to ~withdraw~ them if the relative boss has not yet been beaten. Iron and wood Following the style imposed by Souls, the control system is deliberately difficult and woody, simulating the heaviness of movements with weapons and armor through a slowness imposed by the need to prioritize animation. This translates into a certain delay in the response to inputs which, however, is part of the gameplay itself, because it varies according to the type of weapon used and makes the differences in weight, power and agility between the various solutions in the arsenal truly significant in the heart of the clash. The particular setting of Sinner: Sacrifice for Redemption provides for a fixed arsenal, thus removing an interesting element such as the search for new weapons and the experimentation of different types of equipment, transforming everything into the study of an effective strategy for each different boss that is substantially univocal, or nearly so. Therefore, it becomes necessary to master the use of each short and long range weapon to perfection, because the combinations and possibilities of use in the end are not many: this, if on the one hand requires an even more reasoned tactic in some ways, from the the other represents a certain impoverishment of one of the typical elements of action RPGs. The Dark Star team is very small in size but reveals a considerable ambition, considering the characteristics of this project. Also thanks to the limited extension of its levels, Sinner: Sacrifice for Redemption demonstrates a remarkable care lavished in the technical sector, although various roughnesses emerge typical of an indie production by a team that is perhaps not yet very expert. The characterization of the bosses is truly remarkable, in particular as regards some of these which are decidedly original (Levin Undok with his almost fairytale-like appearance, the enigmatic and fascinating Chanel and the disturbing Faiz Tilus remain somewhat etched in the memory, for example example) making almost every boss fight exciting and characterful moments. The same cannot be said of the anonymous protagonist (whose lack of distinctive features could, however, be a desired effect) and of some technical flaws that are quite evident such as a certain inconsistency in the frame-rate and some really unrefined animation, even for as for the main character.", "date": "2018-10-29", "grade": "6.8"}
