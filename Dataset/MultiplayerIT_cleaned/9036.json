It's about guiding an electronic entity who has remained a prisoner within a computer world, constantly hunted down by an evil CPU who wants to prevent its escape. There is a harmony that is created between the player and this virtual character which strengthens a certain teamwork with the protagonist in question, as it is not so much about entering the character himself, but rather helping him in his escape, guiding his movements within the pre-established paths represented by the circuits. However, Vektor is not an inexperienced person: his computer knowledge allows him to change his skills by bending the computer world thanks to hacking, which is a rather brilliant motivation for the various power-ups that we will have available during the game. The levels are made up of simple circuits made up of geometrically intertwining lines, along which we find ourselves moving, deciding the direction of movement but following the pre-set routes. The safety systems of the CPU also run along these lines, which behave according to different characteristics according to their ~class~. There are therefore simple cursors that run along the circuits according to pre-established patterns, hunters that chase Vektor and are able to change direction and interceptors that precisely follow the trajectories of the protagonist but can only perform a defined amount of direction changes before exploding , as well as fixed obstacles, switches and many other problematic presences that appear as you progress through the levels. Flowing on the circuits, Vektor colors the lines by filling the areas between them, in order to activate force fields capable of blowing up enemies until all the lines are colored and thus making the exit to the level appear next, obviously trying not to be touched by the security systems, on pain of the immediate explosion of the ~carrier~. What is hidden between the circuits escapeVektor is a game that must be experienced firsthand to be appreciated. An aseptic description of its gameplay doesn't do justice to the direct experience, formed by a harmonious composition of challenge and sensory stimulation. Reminiscences of Tron hover in the construction of the computer world and in the geometric movements imposed by the lines of the circuits, while the aesthetics rather closely recalls the Bit.Trip series by Gaijin (from which it also seems to draw the serial structure, considering that this is a ~ chapter 1~), less thrust on the spectacular factor in this case but counterbalanced by a greater depth of the play structure. From a first grade run along geometric lines, the game transforms into a complex arcade-puzzle in which timing, speed of execution and strategy contribute to the survival of Vektor, soon revealing itself as a high-intensity challenge, so much so that it is not satisfying for everyone. The variables increase as the levels progress and the greater the complexity of the scenarios, the abilities of the enemies and the quantity of traps correspond to the increase in the capabilities of the protagonist, who will gradually be able to blow up some sectors of the scenario, temporarily increase his speed or broaden the view in order to better keep the situation under control. In short, the basic idea is simple but is stratified exponentially becoming more and more complex yet remaining compact and coherent with the general design also thanks to a well-studied aesthetic aspect that recalls the classic iconography of the IT world (pixels, lights and aseptic lines) both in terms of graphics and in the audio sector, characterized by truly remarkable ~chiptune~ style music, although the levels of audio-visual satisfaction characteristic of the colleague Bit.Trip are probably not reached. Another positive aspect is the presence of unlockable objectives and alternative paths that open the way to secret levels, elements that increase the longevity of the game and stimulate progression despite the lack, also in this case, of online feedback with other players such as multiplayer modes and online rankings.", "date": "2011-10-06", "grade": "8.7"}
