This is now an established fact, accepted peacefully even by the most ardent supporters of the famous ~difference~. Anyone who buys a Wii does so to obtain an alternative gaming experience to the classic one, and the assumption applies as much to original products, specifically designed for the control system via Wii-mote and Nunchuck, as to multiplatform titles, which on Wii they should as a rule find a new dimension regardless of graphics and sound. Well, for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare - Reflex the speech is not so simple and the outlines of the question are somewhat jagged, given that never as in this case does everything revolve around the graphics. We all know that Infinity Ward's masterpiece makes the visual impact its strong point, the pivot thanks to which it is possible to make the single-player campaign so ~cinematic~ and spectacular. It is therefore clear that a conversion work without particular commitment, as was carried out this time, leads the ~modern~ episode of Call of Duty to lose much of its charm. While on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and PC we can count on scenarios that are splendid in breadth and detail, in which vehicles and characters move well, all at a very solid frame rate of sixty frames per second, on Wii we have to make do with dull environments and impoverished, which have had to accept heavy compromises to maintain the same size as the version for new generation systems. Graphics don't matter? The scenarios have not undergone a cut relative to size, we said, but the overall quality has paid the consequences. The first thing that catches the eye are the textures, very poorly defined, which negatively affect the level of detail and deprive the settings of the original realistic and convincing aspect. Even in one of the first stages it happens to move in water, and this is completely ~still~, a board on which a dull and repetitive texture has been applied. Color management, in a non-HD context, reveals all its limits and the shades used often don't do justice to the background. The polygonal models of the characters are too simple and angular, with just decent animation. The effects related to the explosions have also been simplified, taking away much of the spectacularity of certain situations. The biggest problem, however, is undoubtedly represented by the frame rate, which barely exceeds twenty frames per second and suffers from constant uncertainties. This is a factor that unfortunately also ends up heavily influencing the controls: the aiming system, based on the infrared signal of the Wii-mote, requires fluid graphics to give the movement of the viewfinder a certain precision. Despite the various options for customizing the commands in any way (increasing or decreasing the sensitivity thresholds of the various movements), in fact, the result is that hitting enemies with your weapon proves to be anything but simple, while using shooting sniper rifles really becomes a frustrating task, devoid of any correctives that can provide aiming support. The goal of this merciless analysis is not to get stuck on the implausible comparison between the Wii version of Modern Warfare and the one for Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3, but rather to point out that on the Nintendo console we have seen much better both in terms of mere graphics than of control precision, and the list is far from short: Metroid Prime: Corruption, The Conduit, Call of Duty: World at War itself and even Medal of Honor: Heroes 2, whose graphics practically it had no textures but guaranteed a frame rate of sixty frames per second, the realization of a clear message: if it is not possible to offer a high quality visual impact, at least we keep the fluidity so that we can optimize the controls. Because it's really true that, in certain situations, the graphics don't count. The controls The control system of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare - Reflex for Wii is based on the classic Wii-mote / Nunchuck combination, with the first that regulates the movement of the viewfinder (and therefore of the view) and the second that allows us to move the character, change his position (standing, crouching or lying down) and aim. Some choices appear to be spot on (for example the ~+~ and ~-~ buttons, used to launch the two different grenades available), others a little less so: pressing the A button is used to block the view and thus make it less chaoticthe firefights, but at the same time activates the run of the character. To run and ~steer~, therefore, you have to alternate pressing the button, which is at least problematic during the most agitated situations. At the same time, the use of the d-pad to change weapons, jump, attack with the dagger and finally open the inventory is not very immediate to assimilate and requires some practice. Find the differences The single-player campaign mode of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare - Reflex retains all the stages of the original Modern Warfare, for a relatively short experience but full of twists and epic battles. An ~arcade~ alternative has been added to it which allows us to replay all the levels (unfortunately individually and not in sequence) with a different setting, i.e. with the aim of totaling the greatest number of kills possible or reaching a certain degree of accuracy. As in the Wii version of Call of Duty: World at War, there is also a local multiplayer mode, where the second player simply controls an on-screen crosshair and thus contributes to the elimination of opponents. Obviously there is also online multiplayer, an element that in fact characterizes Modern Warfare and which has decreed its commercial success: all the original modes are present (therefore team deathmatch, veteran deathmatch, free-for-all, find and destroy, etc.), together with the possibility of creating classes (choosing the weapons and bonuses to be assigned to our character) and clearly the excellent scoring and challenge system that places Call of Duty's online multiplayer at the top for the first person genre has been maintained shooter. Unfortunately, the management of the invitations is not the best, however based on the ~friend code~ (which must be entered in the appropriate box), an important element is missing such as voice chat (which has not been replaced in any way, not even by entering of general communications) and the maximum number of players in matches has dropped to ten (still two more than in World at War). During our tests we found a good speed with regard to matchmaking. The presence of a territorial option allows us to play only with people belonging to our geographical area but despite this, unfortunately, it often happens that we run into problems due to lag.", "date": "2009-11-16", "grade": "7.0"}
