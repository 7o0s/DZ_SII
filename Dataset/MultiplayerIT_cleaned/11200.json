The same with which we, in the role of war veteran Rayton, will respond to their harassment towards the population. In fact, our anthropomorphic avatar will dispense justice by exploiting what remains of the exoskeleton used during the war, or rather a huge metal fist capable of responding to any threat placed against it. F.I.S.T.: Forged In Shadow Torch is an action metroidvania developed by TiGames and published by BiliBili, set in a dieselpunk universe whose society, decadent but still able to stand, tries in every way to counter the dictatorship imposed by the Legion. The last hope of the citizens, ~furtizens~ in English, is therefore placed in the protagonist Rayton: a war veteran rabbit who doesn't actually care about the fate of Torch City but who finds himself involved in the resistance when his best friend is arrested and sentenced to death. Taking advantage of his mechanical fist, but not only, Rayton will have to close the accounts with the past and help the city to be reborn from its ashes. Let's find out about F.I.S.T.: Forged In Shadow Torch in our PS5 review. Fast & Furry F.I.S.T.: Forged In Shadow Torch, Rayton grappling with a Legion soldier Given its more than proven metroidvania nature, describing the gameplay of F.I.S.T.: Forged In Shadow Torch would be almost redundant, because the game follows its canons so literally as to not actually bring anything innovative inside. Nonetheless, what it does it does very well, returning a genuine, fun and satisfying experience, with the right difficulty peaks especially in the exploration and completion of the individual areas. We'll move through an extensive series of 2.5D maps, from the decaying alleys of Torch City to its equally unreassuring depths, all finely recreated and sufficiently alive (especially the city, against which citizens, soldiers and vehicles move in the background). to leave their mark on the game world. Along our way, we will unlock weapons with a high destructive potential, which at the same time are useful for exploration, together with a series of skills and techniques that will come in handy when we have to fight against Legion soldiers - a very frequent situation. Rayton, the protagonist of F.I.S.T. All this, against the backdrop of a plot built around betrayal, redemption, friendship, class struggle but above all hope, without which no one in Shadow Torch would ever have found the courage to oppose the dictatorship of the Legion. If at first glance all this could have the flavor of already seen, unable to bring a pinch of originality to the formula, and there is little to discuss about this, F.I.S.T.: Forged In Shadow Torch, however, plays its best card when it comes to to return a lively and, as we wrote above, finely detailed imagery. If you are looking for true satisfaction, in the TiGames game, you will not find it in its undeniably successful gameplay but at the same time framed in the genre it belongs to, almost as if it were afraid of leaving the ranks and making a false step, but in the aesthetics: the attention for the details infused by the developers and the charm of the world design give the game the characterization it needs. Torch City is not only a miserable and decadent city purposely placed there but a setting of painstaking complexity that we can see reflected in each of its areas, be they prisons, military arsenals, sewers or whatever. Each new area is beautiful and immersive, full of atmosphere dictated above all by an excellent play of light and shadow which, despite its heavy stylization, contributes to making Torch City alive. F.I.S.T.: Forged In Shadow Torch, the settings are made with extreme care In terms of actual gameplay, F.I.S.T.: Forged In Shadow Torch provides us with three main weapons, some support and a series of secondary skills for exploration, as well as various combat techniques to be unlocked at the terminal by spending money and, Sometimes, data disks collected both by defeating bosses and by exploring the game world. The level design is increasingly based on the area explored, with some cases that reminded us, to a lesser extent, of the White Palace and the attached curses, but beyond this, all the maps have proved to be well built and satisfactory from explore, filled with secrets and hidden areas that will delight completionists. F.I.S.T.: Forged In Shadow Torch, the terminal to power up Rayton The only imperfection in an otherwise smooth combat system and voted to the use of the combos concerns the deflection: we are not talking about a real parry because the reference button must be pressed at the right moment for Rayton to repel the attack. There are two versions: the first, obtained in favor of the plot, is scored with a pair of electric batons which, however, consume points available. It is therefore a limited parry, which exacerbates the fight. The second version, on the other hand, is obtained by exploring and is unlimited, but to be successful it requires you to move the character in the direction of the attack and is therefore quite uncomfortable, above all because the combat in the game tends to be frenetic. It therefore happens to score one, in the heat, without having anticipated it and paradoxically be caught off guard by something designed to destabilize the enemies.", "date": "2021-09-12", "grade": "8.5"}
