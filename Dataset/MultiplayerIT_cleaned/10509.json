A fluctuating path that has been echoed by the video game transpositions of the franchise, which have become more intense in the last period in an attempt to ride the wave of newfound success. So here, after the questionable remake of the glorious Turtles in Time, Ubisoft returns to the fray with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Smash Up!, this time on Wii and with a videogame formula never before experienced by the four mutant brothers. Beat me up before you go go If it is true that the Turtles had already ventured into scrolling fighting games with products such as Tournament Fighters in the 16-bit era and with Battle Nexus and Mutant Melee in the past generation of consoles (really obtaining results that were not exactly exciting), on the other canto had never been put in a position to fight in fights of up to a maximum of four participants within two-dimensional free roaming arenas. The reference to Smash Bros is far from accidental, given that Ubisoft has turned to the developers responsible for the Nintendo title to take care of this Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Smash Up!. The final result, we say it immediately, does not live up to the original source of inspiration, basically because it fails to add significant innovative elements, resulting at the same time poorer in several respects. The fact is that, on a purely formal level, the Game Arts work slavishly follows in the footsteps left by Smash Bros: even the character selection screens are similar, even if in this case the choice offered to the user is much more limited in terms of numerical terms, perhaps even too much considering how the Turtles universe is certainly not poor in interesting figures. Even on the front of the control system, the situation is similar: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Smash Up! you can play using the Remote + Nunchuck combo, the Classic Controller or using only the Remote in a horizontal position. However, none of these options is 100% performing, considering how the first two cases are affected by the poor precision of the analog stick, while the third way forces you to deal with obvious compromises due to the lack of keys. On the battlefield, two types of attack are then relied upon, which combined with the various directions give rise to special moves: each fighter also has the possibility of collecting and using various power-ups, as well as turning the destruction of some elements that are part of the different dynamic scenarios. Compared to Smash Bros, therefore, there is something special, if we also consider how the killing of opponents can materialize both through their expulsion from the game arena, and through the more classic reset of the HP indicator: nuances which, however, are not sufficient to provide Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Smash Up! of an adequate personality rate. Carapaces at will In terms of the amount of game modes made available to the user, otherwise, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Smash Up! defends itself quite well: the main screen shows the Arcade options (in fact the single player adventure), Battle Royal (the multiplayer part), Survival, Tag Team (where it is possible to select a second character on the fly or perform moves in combination with it) Mission (consisting of scenarios with specific objectives) and Online, as well as a handful of mini-games and tests of various skills. By tackling each of these sections, it is possible to accumulate shells, useful for unlocking extra material such as statuettes, character biographies and so on. Here too, the inspiration to Smash Bros is evident, and again the Ubisoft product struggles to match it as regards the care placed in the individual aspects: just to name a couple, the Arcade mode is very short and interspersed with truly semi-static cutscenes in bad taste, the mini-games are more irritating than anything else and the process necessary to make the rewards available is far too burdensome in proportion to the value of the same. The technical front is a faithful mirror of the description made so far by Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Smash Up! in its entirety, and therefore alternates good solutions with other decidedly questionable ones. At a superficial glance, the game has a more than discreet cosmetics, with varied and detailed settings, bright colors and polygonal models of the characters that are not too complex but well animated. Too bad chand in motion the whole thing proves incredibly confusing, especially when the camera pulls back to view large portions of the scenery or when three or more wrestlers stand very close together: the Wii's proverbial poor definition reduces them in these cases to blotches of colour, making it virtually impossible to understand what is happening on screen.", "date": "2009-09-25", "grade": "6.5"}
