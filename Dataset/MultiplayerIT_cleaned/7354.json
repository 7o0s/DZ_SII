{"name": "Luigi", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/127608-dr-luigi-luigi-dai-fantasmi-alla-virologia.html", "text": "The Dr. Mario saga was born in the late 80s, from an idea of the great Gunpei Yokoi. All this took the form of a double publication on NES and Game Boy, a debut that enjoyed considerable success, to which the brand's great fame is still owed. Although not as well received, the episode that revived the saga on Nintendo 64 is still to be considered the most complete ever released, with a good story mode and excellent four-player offline multiplayer. From that moment on, and with discrete breaks between one release and another, the series has been entrusted to Arika, and has taken on a secondary role: digital publications only, and reduced in investment and methods. Perhaps precisely because of the ~great~ Dr. Mario 64, which did not respond to the required investments with sales, Nintendo decided to reduce the saga to its current dimensions, also relegating it to an external team, albeit a valid one such as Arika (in the curriculum they have the various Street Fighter EX, and the founder is a former Capcom employee). After landing on Nintendo DS and WiiWare, here is the doctor back on Wii U, now known more thanks to Smash Bros than his puzzle game. If you love Mario's pills, we recommend his brother's: they are bigger and easier to use Make way for the new doctor Because Dr. Mario, we specify it for those who don't know him, is Nintendo's answer to Tetris... more or less. It is a fixed screen puzzle game, with the game board occupied by various viruses of different colors. The player's goal is to eliminate them in the shortest time possible. How to do it? Arranging the two-colored pellets, which fall from the top and can be rotated exactly like the tetrominoes, so that with the virus they form a column (or row) of four units of the same shade. So much for Dr. Mario; but in this case we are talking about Luigi, and Nintendo, still celebrating the holiday that has just ended (quite fictitious to tell the truth, we are referring to the so-called ~year of Luigi~), has decided to turn him into a doctor as a last tribute. Apart from the now crystallized characterization, more fearful and uncertain than Mario even in spin-offs like these, to influence the mechanics, making them simpler, there are the new ~L~ shaped pads. Or rather: these are two pills of two units which, attached together, form a single ~L~ structure. It might seem like a small difference, but it's not: nothing changes if the piece is glued to another that fully supports it, but if the shorter part is glued to the top, the one below drops like a bomb, falling vertically ( automatically) until it hits an obstacle. It is a much more complex move to read than to understand while playing, and we assure you that it is original enough to refresh the bones of the game. As we said before, it is undeniable that the new tablets facilitate the doctor's task and make everything a little easier, but Nintendo has taken the necessary precautions so that the final result is not damaged. After all, it's better to be safe than sorry. Mario and Luigi Dr. Luigi mode itself, with the new pills just described, can be tackled in various ways. By themselves, altering the speed of falling pieces and the number of viruses on screen, thus changing the difficulty. Against the CPU or another player (maximum of two, not like in Dr. Mario 64 therefore), a phase in which the first to eliminate the viruses on screen wins. But, above all, within Dr. Luigi there is also the classic mode, the one dedicated to Mario: it is useless to reiterate how much more demanding it is, to the point that Luigi's most difficult stage is comparable to an average one in the traditional game. Whether it's even more fun remains to be seen, surely lovers of the challenge will continue to prefer it: the tablets in this case are two-colored (or mono, depending on the case) and made up of two units, but the rows and columns to compose must always be made up of at least four tiles. Technicalities and strategies aside, the main difference between the two modes lies in the fact that with Luigi it is possible to eliminate a virus with a single piece, with Mario you need at least two pills (but almost always three). This involves more layering of the game, and clearly postulates deeper action planning; add the fact that the more time passes the faster the pieces fall, and you will understand why the classic version is much more adrenaline-pumping than the new one. Just like for Luigi, you can vary the difficulty, the number of viruses and the speed at which the pills fall, and of course there are multiplayer and a clash with the CPU. Online virologists Online, oddly enough for a Nintendo game, works great. It's easy to findre other players, there are rankings both internal to the friends list and general, the lag is practically non-existent. The only limit perhaps lies in the random pairing, since the game does not bother to approach you with an opponent of your level: it is not very clear whether this depends on the few (still?) active users or is it an actual limit of Dr. Luigi, in any case at the moment it is a fairly frequent eventuality. The last mode is the one called Sterminavirus, focused on the use of the touch screen: the pills in this case are the classic ones, with two units, but can be moved freely around the screen if touched. It's a kind of minigame, but well done: as you progress, not only does the speed increase, but also the number of pills that rain down from the top. Just like in the traditional game, you are defeated if the pills - even just one, of course - touch the top of the stage. It is an amusing diversion from the core of the work, enriched among other things by the possibility of playing both with the Gamepad in a horizontal and vertical position. Dr. Luigi is therefore well cared for as regards the essence of the mechanics, but poor for everything else: visually it is weak, also in terms of style, and the music is a revival of the original ones. Also for this reason the price ( 14.99) has given rise to various controversies, considered excessive by most: it is true that Nintendo could have lowered it by a few euros, but it is equally self-evident that the problem concerns more the e-shop in general than Dr Luigi in particular.", "date": "2014-01-20", "grade": "7.0"}
