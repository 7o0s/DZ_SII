To most, these two Japanese gentlemen will probably say nothing; but we are sure that there is a fair number of players, perhaps a little older than average, who have already lit a light bulb, recalling the memories of afternoons spent together with a small masterpiece for Saturn by SEGA, Guardian Heroes. Treasure's bizarre 2D brawler has struggled to find an heir for the past sixteen years... except for its own high-def remake over a year ago. You will understand, therefore, that the expectations for this new effort by Agatsuma Entertainment were very high. Having long remained in the limbo of European localization, Code of Princess finally arrives digitally on the eShop... Merge of genres Defined as a kind of cross between a scrolling fighting game and a Japanese RPG, Code of Princess belongs above all to the first category. The adventure is divided into short levels or stages, appropriately called ~quests~ as in an RPG due to the objectives to be achieved: in reality, nothing ambitious given that generally it is always a matter of beating up a certain number of enemies, the boss on duty or... a certain number of enemies before they kill the occasional supporting character to save. In short, the structural variety is not the strong point of the game; on the other hand, there is another factor that brings Code of Princess closer to a jRPG, and that is the story. Proposed in a massive and incisive way through long dialogues entirely written and dubbed in English, the story of the game is so absurd that it borders on the purest nonsense. Augmented Princess Solange Blanchefleur de Lux is on the run after her kingdom of DeLuxia is overrun by monsters and the army of Distron. The maiden's goal is very simple: to find out who or what is behind the attack and keep the enemy away from her sacred sword, the DeLuxcalibur. She is soon joined by a clique of characters, one more bizarre than the other; there is the gentleman thief Ali, the necromancer that everyone mistakes for zombie Zozo, the bard Allegro, the cleric Hel and many others. The group will not only have to deal with nameless monsters and soldiers, but also with a whole series of bad guys who seem to come out of a Sunday morning cartoon. In reality, the caricatured exaggeration is completely desired since Code of Princess, right from the start, brazenly mocks all the clichs of the RPG genre, often and willingly breaking through the fourth wall and mentioning catchphrases such as grinding, level-up and leveling. 'inappropriate as gratuitous nudity of the protagonist. The irony, sometimes even a little forced, however, does not save the plot from being a mere pretext for a fight: in fact, the game allows you to select one of the four main characters to face the various and short levels that are unlocked progressing through the story. But what a nice pair of tactics Once a stage has been completed, we will be able to replay it using another main character in Campaign mode or any of the extra ones unlocked for Free Play: repeating the ~quests~ allows you to accumulate experience points and money; the former are used to level up and improve the statistics of the characters by distributing bonus points, while the money allows you to buy weapons and accessories with which to further influence the performance of our heroes. The jRPG features are basically only these, and there is no mission or boss that cannot be overcome with a little healthy grinding. In this sense, the managerial and strategic component of statistics and equipment almost immediately becomes an end in itself, also because the combat system is disarmingly simple and the artificial intelligence of the enemies is similar to that of a badger under sedation. Enemies walk around the area of combat waiting for the player to get close enough to hit them occasionally; the A.I. it is rarely aggressive and there is no real behavioral pattern to study and respond to. Between one very easy mission and another, from time to time you come across stages where the behavior of the enemies seems to have been programmed by completely different developers and at that point, taken aback, you just have to get around the difficulty peak by leveling up as much as I can in the previous internships. It's a somewhat underwhelming progression system that relies very little on player skill. The combat system itself is very simple: you can chain light and powerful attacks in various combos, also taking advantage of a handful of special movesthem by character. Except for the extra anonymous characters, such as the various enemies and soldiers, the roster is quite interesting and most of the cast differ in the type of attacks, weaknesses and advantages. However, all are united by a particular technique that allows you to focus attention on one enemy at a time, directing any ranged attacks towards him and inflicting more damage than on other enemies. The mechanic is interesting, but the inability to select a precise target when the enemy sprites are crowding one on top of the other often makes it superfluous. The same goes for the Burst, a temporary power-up with a duration too short to be reasonably exploited. On balance, it takes a few minutes to realize that Code of Princess can be completed by limiting yourself to using basic attacks and a few special moves. The 3D effect Barely mentioned, if not downright detrimental, the stereoscopic effect in Code of Princess is even better to turn it off. Not only do the sprites lose definition, but the network frame tends to collapse inexorably much more often, making some stages a real mess of graphics and gameplay. Nothing under the dress Upon its announcement, Code of Princess had attracted attention not only for the names that had signed the project, but also for the splendid cosmetics: a refined, colorful and impeccably animated 2D that transported the beautiful artwork by Kinu Nishimura. Game in hand, we can confirm the nostalgic beauty of two-dimensional graphics in a market now dominated by polygons... and its disastrous performance. We certainly can't complain about the attention paid to each individual sprite or the enchanting fluidity of their animations, but when you find yourself fighting more than two or three enemies at a time, that's where the problems begin. First, the dynamic zoom: designed to move the camera away, framing a wider area of the fight when you find yourself surrounded by too many enemies, the zoom only achieves the result of creating a great graphic mess. Sprites lose definition and tend to get confused with each other, and it gets to the point where you literally don't understand anything about what's going on as you just press the keys at random. Second, the slow-moving frame rate: in other words, Code of Princess drops too many frames too often, which certainly doesn't play in favor of a two-dimensional fighting game where the pace and frenzy should be constant. The sensation of playing in slow motion is also combined with the brevity of the micromissions which are completed in a couple of minutes without leaving any emotion. The multiplayer mode allows you to tackle them cooperatively or to engage in battle with other players like battle royale, but even there many problems arise when you realize that the online community is practically non-existent and that the waiting times are too long for levels that don't last so long: at that point, you might as well hole up in the single-player mode and complete the many missions available before monotony sets in.", "date": "2013-04-05", "grade": "6.2"}
