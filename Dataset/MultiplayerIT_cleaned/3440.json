{"name": "Valfaris", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/valfaris-recensione.html", "text": "There isn't enough metal in video games. Ok, metal isn't exactly music for all ears, and if you have delicate eardrums capable of tolerating only the Care Bears' opening theme (or the trap) we understand you... really... but we sometimes need of a bit of healthy, monolithic and very bad metal in our video games, because the powerful sounds of its guitars and the screamed lyrics that push to the violent mosh seem made especially for action games, even better if shooters. Ask the developers of the latest Doom if demons-slaying the Backstreet Boys in the background would have had the same effect, or try to imagine a Brutal Legend in the magical world of commercial pop: that kind of visual power just doesn't work if you don't accompany it with some glorious metal. The bearded Andrew Gilmore seems to have understood this golden rule, and after creating the passable Slain (and later significantly improving it with the Back From Hell edition) he decided to carry on with his universe, made up of thundering guitars, headbanging, monsters horrors and space travel with Valfaris, whose review you read, a scrolling shooter badass beyond reasonable justification. On the soundtrack of the game there is Curt Victor Bryant - ex Celtic Frost guitarist - and accompanied by his brutal riffs you will take on the role of Therion, a furious mix between a metalhead and a space marine, eager to eliminate his horrid father: a sort of galactic lord with unfriendly intent called Vroll. Interested? You are right, because this title is a real surprise. Shoot first, think about it later Valfaris is, curiously, just a sort of direct sequel to Slain, which relates directly to the events of that action, and more precisely outlines the world concocted by the Steel Mantis. This does not mean that it is appropriate to expect a particularly in-depth plot from Therion's raids: the game is a pure shooter to the core, where the dialogues are limited to some miserable text boxes, and the soul of the production is without a shadow of doubt the gameplay. However, we consider it sacrosanct to praise Gilmore and company as regards the background, because, although weak from a narrative point of view, their imagery is extremely suggestive, and the planet Valfaris (from which the game takes its name) contains an impressive quantity of biomes and environments that seem taken by weight from the worst nightmares of Frank Frazetta and his emulators. In all honesty we must admit that, at least initially, the strong connection with Slain had worried us a lot. Back From Hell undoubtedly improved Andrew's first work, but overall it was still a title with rather marked shortcomings, capable of standing out from the crowd more for its proximity to the musical genre so praised in the intro than for its actual qualities . However, Valfaris is a beast of a very different breed, and here the Steel Mantis (the other main member is Thomas Jenns, to whom we mainly owe the coding) have really given their best, perfectly using all the stylistic features of the great classics of the same kind, but avoiding a potentially dangerous subjection. Skill uber alles We believe it is appropriate to explain ourselves better: take for example the excellent Blazing Chrome, which has recently been able to bring Contra's gameplay back to homes, tracing the best features of that historic series with almost total fidelity. Here, Valfaris is certainly inspired by classics like those or like Turrican, but he does it by fielding his own pace, more refined mechanics, and an impressive variety level design, which leads the player to constantly change approaches, and does not abuse the his gimmicks long enough to tire. Here you will have to deal with deadly electric traps, hordes of enemies to eliminate as quickly as possible, paintings to travel attached to huge moving worms, platforming stages made difficult by soldiers targeting you and laser turrets, and even cutscenes on board of huge mechs armed to the teeth. It's really unlikely that the adrenaline drops between one phase and the next. If the fundamental mechanics were not solid, however, so much goodness would be thrown to the wind, and it is therefore with great joy that we reconfirm their granite resistance, linked to a precise shooting, responsive beyond all limits, and closely linked to a system of development that rewards courage. In the game, in fact, there is certainly no shortage of instruments of death, and Therion continually finds new trinkets, which can replace his service pistol, his flaming sword, or simply cover theheavy weapon role. However, all of these weapons can be upgraded with blood metal, which can be found by wandering through the levels or by sacrificing resurrection idols to special pillars. These idols, rightly so, also serve to save the game at specific checkpoints where Therion can upgrade, so to properly perfect all the guns (and also his statistics, since they increase with the number of idols obtained) one is forced to ignore most of the checkpoints and survive as long as possible. Predictably not an easy task. Valfaris is therefore all balanced around the capabilities of those who face it: relying on checkpoints allows you to more easily study battle phases that are mostly short, but extremely intense and full of aggressive enemies with variable patterns, where a player with particularly quick reflexes will run many more risks from fight to fight, obtaining significant benefits in the final stages of the campaign. It seems to us a sensible system (even if hardcore to the core, since it penalizes less skilled players) and capable of increasing the general tension even more, leading to re-taking the campaign several times and constantly improving from game to game. In short, it is with this gimmick that Valfaris tries to increase its replayability, because apart from a couple of uninspired bosses and some slight imbalance between weapons, the only real lack of this shooter lies in its limited longevity, which it stands between 4 and 6 hours (but a really skilled player can finish it even in less than two). Little to complain about anyway, because our lavish praises for the playability of this work are not written by chance, and while it is true that the title offers limited mobility and a shooting built around the enormous variety of range and power of the weapons available, on the other hand these mechanics are accompanied by an energy shield capable of performing perfect parries and repelling enemy projectiles, and the need to balance energy consumption between the use of heavy weapons (obviously more efficient than the available guns) and that of the barrier just mentioned. The fact that sword melee attacks allow you to recover energy is just the icing on a beautifully balanced cake, which in our opinion borders on perfection in this now sparsely populated sub-genre.", "date": "2019-10-09", "grade": "8.8"}
