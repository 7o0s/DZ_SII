{"name": "Universe at War: Earth Assault - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/universe-at-war-earth-assault-recensione.html", "text": "The three races When you first start Universe at War, you can only select the first campaign out of the three available, that of the Novus. In reality, as you grind levels, you soon discover that, despite the possibility of using all three alien races, the plot follows a single line and that the gap between one campaign and the next is not underlined, creating a continuum that is only interrupted once you get to the end of the game. But let's see the three factions in detail, following the order in which they will be used during the campaigns: the Novus are technologically very advanced but do not have a great resistance to enemy blows. This relative weakness is compensated by the incredible speed of movement allowed by the possibility of creating a real network of towers. Moving entire armies in a few moments is something new for RTS and makes this faction the most dynamic and suitable for rushes. The only way to stop the Novus is to destroy their towers or lead a massive attack into the heart of their base, trying to raze key infrastructure before the enemy has a chance to regroup. The Hierarchy, on the other hand, follows an entirely different philosophy. The armies are slow but extremely powerful, the infrastructures are limited but mobile, which allows them to generate troops directly in the place where the battle rages, and, above all, they can use the marchers, metal beasts bigger than the screen and capable of wipe out entire armies single-handedly. Lastly there are the Masari. Their way of fighting is really special. Everything is centered around their base, which has an automatic system for collecting resources from the surrounding world and which can be easily set up as needed. The Masari can also switch from Light materia to Dark materia, radically changing the abilities of the army. Untapped potential Why create three such well-characterized races if you then choose to create a campaign that doesn't allow you to use them to the fullest? If you are among those who do not play multiplayer, you will miss out on many of the potential of Universe at War, because it is only by playing online or participating in a skirmish that you can truly understand the peculiarities of the three factions which, instead, in single player are under exploited. The problem is that the missions are far too guided and it is difficult to make them deviate from the tracks set by the developers. Probably a narrative that is too invasive does not bind well with the RTS, but it is a pity to know that many will not enjoy the title 100% since they will not be aware of the depth that is hidden behind the scientific research system of the factions which allows for great customization. Indeed the single player campaign is the weakest part of the game, as it is quite boring despite some good intuition. The problem is that as soon as one realizes that the only strategy that pays off is to do what the developers have foreseen, enthusiasm dwindles and, if the story hasn't managed to involve us, we risk losing all interest in what happens on the screen . There are some more open missions, for heaven's sake, but the substance doesn't change much. In some levels it almost seems to be faced with a RPG with troops, since everything is focused on the hero of the moment (one for each faction). But the game doesn't just suffer from this problem, because otherwise we could solve the review by recommending it to all those who love online and fine. Despite the general goodness of the work done, unfortunately there are defects. The most obvious is the AI of the troops, which occasionally takes the initiative and does things that no one has ever ordered it, such as starting the attack with your head down despite having received the order to hold the position. It doesn't happen very often and, with practice, you learn to limit personal initiatives, but the problem remains and, especially by playing multiplayer, it becomes complicated to recover situations compromised by rash moves made independently of our will. Another flaw is represented by the camera. The amount of framed game world is very limited but the possibility of zooming out is also limited, which makes it cumbersome to move many troops from one point to another. The problem becomes annoying even in the presence of the largest troops, i.e. the marchers of the Hierarchy, which alone occupy a large part of the screen. Is it so difficult, in 2008, to make graphics engines that allow you to zoom out so that you can see a large portion of the battlefield? Universe at War: Earth Assault is available for PC and will be available soon for Xbox 360 Technically speaking From a technical point of viewUniverse at War is well done, with detailed and realistic maps and with well-modeled and fairly characterized troops. There is no shortage of special effects, especially during pitched battles and the work done in the design phase allows you to enjoy visual surprises until the final stages of the game. The game is able to run both under DirectX 9 and under DirectX 10 and, in the case of the latter, there will be no drops in framerate... but not even graphic improvements, now desirable by new games given that Vista has passed the year of life. From an auditory point of view, the excellent sound effects and discreet music should be noted which, despite the chronic lack of originality, are well linked with the game action. The last note deserves the Live! system, necessary to play online. Well, with the Silver subscription you can play safely but you will not have access to a kind of world ranking of the best players, available only for Gold users. In short, do you have to pay to have access to a ranking? Maybe we need to improve the offer to make some users decide to pay that money. Comment Universe at War angers the potential it has but which is wasted on the despicable design of the single player campaign. Fortunately, by playing online or setting up a skirmish, you have the opportunity to enjoy the excellent work done by the developers in the army design phase.
