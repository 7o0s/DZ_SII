{"name": "Moons of Madness", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/moons-of-madness-recensione.html", "text": "Produced by Funcom, Moon of Madness is a puzzle-solving horror adventure. The sci-fi atmospheres, dictated by the Martian setting, are combined with the darkness of some typical themes of the literature of H.P. Lovecraft. The work was conceived by Rock Pocket Games, a small independent reality based in Tonsberg, Norway. The studio began to devote itself to video games in 2008, first only on mobile and later also embracing home platforms. Their previous work is the platformer Shiftlings, which has been available for both PC and consoles since the beginning of last year. Moon of Madness was added to the Steam catalog on October 22nd, but from January 21st 2020 it will also arrive on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. So let's take a closer look at the structure and characteristics of the work with our review. In the footsteps of H.P. Lovecraft and cosmic horror Inside a space station that has mysteriously gone down the drain, a dark presence lurks menacingly nearby. After having poked his nose out of the cabin, one comes across an undoubtedly singular situation: the mysterious entity suggests blowing out the candles of a cake placed on a nearby table. Having become aware that it is a nightmare, we witness the stormy awakening of the character who takes on the role. The cabin is the same one we were in just a few moments before, but at least apparently inside the structure everything seems to be still normal, or almost. Yes, because in the meantime a strong seismic shock has devastated the area where the base is located, making it necessary to carry out monitoring operations to verify the effective integrity of the systems that power the structure. From the badge placed on a shelf it can be deduced that the technician in charge is the engineer Shane Newhart, currently in service on Invictus, a long-term station erected on the surface of Mars. A little further on we see a photo of him as a child, in the company of his father, while on the desk a letter addressed to the old man would like to inform him that the expedition is not actually taking place in Antarctica as he told him before departure. In fact, Shane works on behalf of a large corporation, the Manticore-Horochi, which has sent an expedition to Martian territory with the intention of carrying out investigations on a mysterious message picked up by space probes. The first tasks entrusted to the player are very standard, essentially based on the resolution of small puzzles related to the activity of restoring some systems of the base, waiting for the support ship Cyrano to arrive with the new crew sent on site by the Horochi. To carry out these operations it is necessary to use the so-called Biometer, an arm device that allows you to scan the surrounding area by identifying specific points of interest, but also to interact with the numerous electronic instruments that populate the buildings.The phases of play alternate between internal and external movements at the base, making it essential to use the Myrcat rover to reach the crucial areas where one's intervention is required. After equipping the helmet and having duly reserve oxygen, you can finally go out for a walk on the fascinating Martian surface. The useful information is provided by radio communications with the other members of the reconnaissance team, supported by the reading of paper and electronic documents which gradually give way to investigate what is actually happening in that apparently so aseptic place and devoid of concrete threats . As you have probably already guessed, Moons of Madness is an adventure with a staid rhythm, where the unease generated in the player happens little by little, hand in hand with the awareness that something terrifying lurks nearby. This is combined with the surreal situations that arise when nightmares begin to take over Shane's mind, making him fear he is on the precipice of madness. The interaction is based on the identification of objects to be included in one's inventory and with which it is possible to complete the operational tasks entrusted by the direct superiors. The gameplay is based precisely on the resolution of various puzzles, which include, for example, recovering energy cells to be placed in the correct places and with the correct parameters, or even activating or deactivating security systems, intervening on the settings of some computers, reset radio connections and so on. Shane's actions are reduced to the essentials, but it is precisely when the Lovecraftian suggestions begin to gain more weightthat Rocket Pocket Games' work changes gears, leading the player on an alternating current journey where the exploratory phases in the dimension of reality alternate with claustrophobic and distressing situations; conditions dictated by lucid dreams, mostly linked to the protagonist's past, pervaded by specific references to the cosmic horror so dear to Lovecraft. The escape from a tentacled creature, issues such as the corruption of the human mind, as well as the presence in the background of ancient entities with extraordinary powers, dangerous for the very existence of reality as we know it, are sublimated by direct references to the Necronomicon. After all, one cannot help but catch references to Lovecraft's stories in the very title of the work, an evident reference to the novel The Mountains of Madness, one of the most famous works of the controversial writer from Providence. Precisely because of this dichotomy between reality and nightmare, at first well separated and then increasingly inclined to overlap, some portions of the game take place in the recesses of Shane's mind. In these situations, for example, it becomes necessary to activate luminous spheres by interacting with them through specific supernatural powers to open a passage towards the more advanced phases of the level, while in other phases we witness constant changes of plan and situation dictated by the action of memories. The longevity of Moon of Madness is around 6-8 hours of total play, even if the duration depends a lot on the deductive speed of the user during the resolution of the puzzles proposed during the game. Worth noting is the presence of subtitles in Italian, which allow the narrative progression to be followed without problems even for those who are not familiar with English.", "date": "2019-10-31", "grade": "7.5"}
