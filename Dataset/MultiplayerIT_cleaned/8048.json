Considering the good debut with Captain Scarlett and the excellent Mr. Torgue, it was therefore more than reasonable to expect another exciting downloadable content, destined once again to renew interest in the world of Pandora in anticipation of the announced and - presumably - imminent patch aimed at raising the level cap still at 50. In reality this latest release marks a significant drop in quality compared to its predecessors and, although it is very far from being inadvisable or completely disappointing, it inevitably leaves a little bitterness in the mouth once completed in its entirety. Let's love them all! A lot can already be understood from the title of the DLC: Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt has Sir Hammerlock as its main character, a bizarre gentleman already often encountered during the main campaign who - as in a sort of exotic safari - focuses his attention and the quests to offer players around the concept of big-game hunting to a whole series of disturbing and fierce creatures that populate the new settings. The scientist Nakayama also slips into all this, hidden inside a sort of wreckage of a spaceship and determined to clone and therefore give life to the very bad Jack the Handsome. Although Claptrap also makes its sensational and hilarious appearance, more generally the narrative support, humor and goodness of the characters of this third content have not completely convinced us, placing themselves rather far from the more successful ones that it is possible to meet in the Gearbox title. Even the design of the quests themselves struggles to take flight, on some occasions indicating quite trivial and not always completely clear objectives and more generally offering a rather short and concise main quest that rests above all on secondary missions to reach 6-8 hours necessary for completion. However, if Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt does not excel from the point of view of the background, it becomes quite interesting as regards the overall difficulty, calibrated rather high and destined to guarantee a considerable level of challenge even for those who have a fully upgraded Vault Hunter maximum (in any case at least level 30). Above all, the frequency and quantity of firefights fragment the progression very often and consequently reduce the ~pleasure walks~ to a minimum; for this reason the expansion appears much denser than what can actually be deduced from the rather bare scenarios, almost always outdoors and without large structures and buildings to visit. Even the chromatic predominance chosen for most of the areas that make up the DLC, with soft tones on green, brown and yellow, doesn't help much in giving a particular visual variety to the game area. In this respect, again, we've seen better results with the previous two downloadable content. Less exploration and more combat, that might be the motto of Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt; to support this thesis, the presence, in addition to monsters and creatures of different types and sizes, also of humans perfectly themed with the ~African~ climate that permeates the product, should be underlined. In fact, they are savages, represented in a caricatured way with tribal masks, spears, shields and so on; if among them you can undoubtedly find a lot of simple cannon fodder to be filled with lead, the shamans should be taken less lightly instead. These, thanks to a whole series of magical powers, the ability to restore the energy of the companions and the great resistance to the blows received, will soon become the first cause of concern during the fights, making their elimination necessary and intelligent as an absolute priority . Also noteworthy is the presence of a new means of transport, an amphibious hovercraft (the airboat), for which the programmers had fun creating a lot - really - of different liveries to collect and unlock thanks to the enemies' loot; in reality we cannot imagine who could waste time and have so much interest in discovering all the variations of the bodywork of a vehicle, but this is certainly not the first bizarre present in Borderlands 2. Both the number and the quality of the bosses present are fair, with the presence of a new raid boss (Voracidous the Invincible) to be faced strictly with a well-prepared group, pplus another secret destined to appear at the cost of almost a hundred blocks of eridium. Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt is from our point of view ultimately the weakest DLC of the three released so far; the characters and the plot are not exceptional, the quests are almost never surprising and the settings a bit bare and generally characterized by monotonous and somewhat boring chromatic predominance. That said, it remains a download worth considering even for those who haven't purchased the Season Pass, in case you want to go back to Pandora by emptying your magazines and looking for some new loot. Surely it will become more attractive once the level cap is increased.", "date": "2013-01-21", "grade": null}
