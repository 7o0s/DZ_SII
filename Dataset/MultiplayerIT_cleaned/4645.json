Later converted for PlayStation 2 and Dreamcast, that first Gundam VS spawned a long series of sequels and spin-offs that we have rarely seen come out of Japan, where instead they always went very well regardless of their actual quality. In the meantime Gundam has become famous throughout the rest of the world and now, finally, Bandai Namco has decided to look to the West as well. Last year we had the opportunity to play the mediocre Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme VS Force for PlayStation Vita, an experiment designed to take the pulse of our market and decide whether to try a bolder localization. This brings us directly to Gundam VS: almost completely translated into Italian, Bandai Namco's new game will probably decide the future of the brand outside the Rising Sun. Is it worth giving it a chance? Interview with the producer Does the PlayStation 4 version have new modes from previous installments of the VS series? Gundam Versus has been out in Japan for a few months, so we have already implemented some modes in the European version such as the competitive multiplayer that we introduced after the launch. What prompted you, finally, to localize the Gundam games in our country as well? We have long wanted to show the world the delights of two-on-two battles. Also, by localizing the game for European countries, we hope to make it even more popular, so we can expand into that market as well. Do you have any new modes in mind to play online? Yes, and we will continue to update the software by offering new ones over time. Gandammuuu! Calling Gundam Versus a ~fighting game~ is not exactly accurate, even if in a certain sense it is always a question of choosing a character and beating the opponent aboard a Mobile Suit: however, the setting is that of combat video games that take place in three-dimensional arenas where you can move freely in any direction. The rules that determine the clashes of Gundam Versus appear more complex at first glance: it is also played in teams of three against three units and each team is represented by a numerical indicator that represents its ~life~. Each Mobile Suit has a certain value which depends on various factors and which in simple terms expresses its power: every time we defeat an opponent, we subtract the value of that Mobile Suit from the team indicator. The rest is easy to deduce. If the gauge reaches zero, the corresponding team is defeated. This means that you have to choose your Mobile Suits carefully, especially if you play against organized opponents who could target, together, the most fearsome but also the most ~prestigious~ targets. From this point of view, Gundam Versus appears from the first minutes to be a title designed also and above all for the online multiplayer mode that allows customized or classified games of different kinds. Played together with a friend, perhaps against other friends, Gundam Versus is a lot of fun, especially if you know the universe of Tomino. The combat system is in fact quite intuitive, even if initially you have to get a little carried away with the controls. Realistically, however, Gundam Versus revolves around the four front buttons: with some exceptions, each Mobile Suit can attack from a distance, attack in melee, jump and change target. What is the difference between Blazing Gear and Lightning Gear? Blazing Gear is an ability that allows you to easily defeat enemies with more powerful attacks and restores ammo to teammates' magazines. Lightning Gear, on the other hand, decreases the power of attacks but makes movements much faster and restores teammates' Boost. How important are Strikers in combat? Each Striker differs from the others in terms of their cooldown and the way they attack targets or assist the player who called them, so you can choose them to customize your play style. We'd like players to unlock them and try them all to figure out which ones work best for them. A question of controls The back buttons allow you to perform some special shots, while the left analog stick is delegated to Boost Dive, a key mechanic that, once mastered, clearly distinguishes the best players from the novices. In fact, it allows you to immediately fall to the ground, resetting the Boost indicator within a few moments. The latter is consumed every timewe jump and stay in mid-air, but also every time we use Boost Step and Boost Dash, the maneuvers that allow you to ~cancel~ almost every animation in progress to start a new one, thus leading to the concatenation of long combos based on feints that they can displace the opponent. The high consumption of the Boost therefore forces the player to carefully control his Mobile Suit, if he does not want to remain at the mercy of the opponent in the crucial moments of the battle. The Gundam Versus control system is sufficiently intuitive, but it must be assimilated well and unfortunately it slips on some bizarre decisions such as entrusting the parry to a sequential combination of keys: our Mobile Suit will raise the shield only by quickly pressing first on and then down, not exactly a very simple operation in the midst of the most frenetic battles. It's a questionable solution that has given us problems especially online, also because most of the games we tried to play suffered from an impressive lag that prevented us from fighting properly. Attempt after attempt, we concluded that this is a recurring problem linked in this case to the quality of the players' connection - and therefore that can be circumvented by manually searching for lobbies with at least acceptable connection quality - but unfortunately the number of challengers or allies has also turned out to be rather small and the queues, therefore, very long. The situation could change in the coming days but it is clear that over time the community will thin out further, affecting one of the most positive aspects of the game. Playstation 4 trophies The 34 Gundam Versus trophies are essentially unlockedjust by playing. By completing the various modes, winning matches and purchasing Strikers and other collectibles, the trophies accumulate almost automatically and are 18 bronze, 11 silver and 4 gold, to which finally the platinum trophy is added. The Gundam house rules Gundam Versus is obviously a title designed especially for fans who already know the universe of the popular Mobile Suit and will recognize most of their favorites in the roster. All the others, unfortunately, will not even have the benefit of a Story mode that summarizes even only in an essential way the series represented by the Mobile Suits: in this sense, in fact, the single player component of Gundam Versus is rather disappointing, divided between a species of ~campaign~ to missions, which is so reminiscent of the very normal Arcade mode that is found in practically every normal fighting game, and an equally classic Survival mode in which you simply have to defeat a certain number of waves of enemies without dying. The single player modes pay the player with a currency that allows you to buy titles, icons or announcers that replace the insufferable Haro, but first you have to level up the various Mobile Suits. Fortunately, the Strikers are easier to unlock and add a small strategic variant to the fights: they are in fact ~characters~ that we can recall by pressing a button to make them appear on the battlefield, where they will attack briefly before disappearing and triggering a short recharge period . The Strikers number more than one hundred and fifty and include most of the normally controllable Mobile Suits. The latter, on the other hand, are more than ninety: it's an impressive number, yet we can't say that we were satisfied with a roster that has many minor extras and a significant number of great absentees. In the face of the inclusion of some Reconguista Gundams in G and Iron Blooded Orphans - some of the most recent television series - we were perplexed when we discovered that Bandai Namco did not include some VIPs such as the Wing Zero Custom among the selectable Mobile Suits Endless Waltz or G-Gundam's God Gundam, not to mention the very popular 00. The explanation could translate into the most feared acronym in the world after BSOD, or DLC, but it is still early to understand how Japanese society wants to move. Having said that, the care taken in the creation of each individual Mobile Suit is truly impressive: the developer has faithfully reproduced every paneling or detail, animating the models with great attention. The same cannot be said for the scenarios in which you fight, all in all quite bland, although large and largely destructible. However, the fights appear very spectacular and engaging from the beginning, thanks also to a camera that throws a tantrum much more rarely than in the past. Finally, the sound accompaniment needs no introduction: Bandai Namco has simply re-proposed the most characteristic acronyms and melodies of eachi series, from the historic Tobe! Gundams! by Koh Ikeda at Man with a Mission's most recent Raise your flag.", "date": "2017-10-02", "grade": "6.8"}
