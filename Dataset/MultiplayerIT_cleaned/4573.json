Since the release of its first iteration, .Hack has been able to make itself heard and soon become a point of reference for a genre that was already beginning to lag behind all the great Western productions. Long before Sword Art Online, .Hack brought players into a world where the protagonists are players themselves. Lost in a virtual world that hides more pitfalls than you can ever imagine, The World (this is the name of the system) will be the testing ground for a long and compelling story of friendship and betrayal, of joys and disappointments, until its natural epilogue. I am a PKK The narrative arc of .Hack unfolds through an almost infinite series of multimedia products ranging from manga to videogames, from novels to the ever-present anime. What arrives on our market today is a remastered version of the second videogame trilogy: G.U.. Considered the best iteration of the franchise and thanks to its metagame nature, the CyberConnect 2 title tells the story of Haseo and a more or less substantial group of as many players grappling with a play system that goes far beyond the simple pastime. Let's get to know Haseo when he decides to enter The World R2 for the first time (the second revised and corrected version after the problems of the first series). The initial events: the deception by two players who will exploit him and then kill him and his consequent acquaintance with the world of PKs (player killers), the help from a mysterious man who seems to have seen more than what could be expected and the consequent exponential growth as a player, are all events told with the speed and light-heartedness of those who know they still have a lot of irons in the fire. Haseo, who after about eight months has become the point of reference for the PKK (i.e. those who kill player killers), intends to seek out and defeat Tri-Edge. In fact, the mysterious killer would seem to have the ability to kill in the game and put the corresponding user into a coma in real life. At the first useful meeting, Haseo is clearly defeated, experiencing in turn the ~Data Drain~, or the total cancellation of the game data and finding himself starting from scratch again. This is the incipit of a title that will be able to give you a good dose of feelings and heartbreaks, unfolding for almost a hundred hours while almost always remaining at an interesting and never banal narrative level (net of some ~Japanese~). . Without telling you anything else about the long narrative arc, know that .Hack remains, even today, a point of reference in the JRPG narrative, with a succession of twists and an identification that is difficult to find in any other situation. Playstation 4 trophies .Hack//OJ Last Recode can count on the beauty of 52 trophies divided among the various chapters. Acquiring the coveted platinum will not be as difficult as it will be extremely long, given the need to carry out a certain number of battles and even reach level 150 with Haseo (feasible only starting from vol.3.) Spam passing you Unfortunately the same fine words cannot be said for the gameplay. What the series has never been able to stand out on is the purely videogame aspect. Let me be clear: we are not talking about a bad title, characterized by extreme frustration and difficult to complete (the game has even been simplified); but we would be unfair if we didn't put on the plate the reality of a JRPG which often risks turning into a frantic repetition of the same key assigned to the attack until the adversary's death occurs. The game, in real time and without transitions between exploration and combat, brings into play a party made up of up to three characters, involved in a fight managed by an artificial intelligence that still manages to do its job discreetly. Where you can move the protagonist freely, all the supporting actors will therefore be maneuvered by predefined routines, or otherwise directed by some of your directives in battle and strategies set even before starting the fights. The commands available to you are simple: with the X you will attack, creating combos by chaining the attacks, while with the O you will make a parry that will often save you from death and give you the opportunity to counterattack as soon as possible.ible. The R1 key concludes the triptych of important actions: the latter will open a further menu that will give you the possibility to choose between four different skills to be used in combat to inflict increased damage. Where you will be able to weaken the opponent enough to leave him stunned, through the same back button you can perform Rengeki, which is an enhanced version of the basic ability. Most of the gameplay of .Hack is based on these three elements. Don't get us wrong, we're talking about the same studio capable of developing a wonderful series of fighting games on Naruto where the only attack key is the circle. CyberConnect 2 are masters in the art of simplifying mechanics and .Hack is no less, but we would be unfair if we told you that what in 2006 could already be repetitive, today could lead you to psychological torture, if you weren't a player almost entirely accustomed to the genre in question. The only additions of note can be found in the ~awakening~ attacks (a sort of special group attack) and in the battles between avatars: real fighting games between entities similar to JoJo's ~Stands~, simple and not so compelling. The differences between the three main volumes that make up the Collection are reduced to the bone, just as the times between the release of one title and another were extremely short (we are talking about a handful of months) precluding CyberConnect 2 the possibility of substantially modify the infrastructure and limiting itself to simple additions such as the possibility of dodging or managing the use of objects in battle more easily. To complete the package and, above all, the identification with the infrastructure of The World, we think about the possibility (which is unfortunately an obligation in some situations), to break the rhythm and make a real virtual disconnection from the game, so as to read the latest news from the network, receive and send emails, watch streaming television programs and participate in the forums assigned to The World players. This whole interface, masterfully rendered from an aesthetic and navigation point of view, leaks from all sides given its impossibility to be consulted in the game. Two extremely welcome extras were then inserted by the developers: the parody mode and the Terminal Disc. The first is nothing more than a series of scenes re-dubbed by the original performers, who create surreal situations inspired by the reactions of the various protagonists: being sequences extrapolated from all the chapters, we advise you to enjoy them after finishing the series. The second thing is the Terminal Disc, yet another meta-narrative element included in .Hack, originally present only in the Limited edition. It is a series of documents and recordings by Jun Bansyoya, an employee of CC Corporation, who tells some background dating back to the closure of the first The World and the birth of its R2 version. Less interesting is the Cheat Mode, which gives the possibility to start the title at the maximum level, with the best equipment and an infinite capital: the game has been greatly simplified compared to its original version, even inserting checkpoints and making this mode totally superfluous. A beautiful virtual worldsort of Let's talk about the technical aspect of this collection. It cannot be denied that the work done on the original is truly remarkable: almost all the textures that will appear on the screen will now be in high definition, showcasing dated but at the same time masterfully characterized polygonal models. Unfortunately, the lack of expressiveness remains in a good dose of interlude scenes, but the game knows how to defend itself and give some not indifferent glimpses. The real problem from a graphic point of view can be found in a continuous pop-up of the elements in the distance and in the extreme repetitiveness of the paths assigned to the dungeons. Almost all the settings are made up of recurring and not very detailed elements, to the point of making one believe they are procedurally generated. The interlude scenes, on the other hand, are beautiful and exciting, which are joined by a sound accompaniment of thunderous applause and also characterized by a totally new mix. Vol. 4 We leave a very small box to talk about what for some should have been the highlight of the meal. The writer has never believed that the new volume included in the collection could be valid as a canonical title released about ten years ago. At the same time we did not expect to find in our hands a sop dedicated to the most nostalgic, made with an engine almost close to that of the originals, with a substantially unchanged interface and a gameplay that does not offer any particular new joy. If you add the fact that the adventure will hardly last you more than a few hours, you understand that buying this collection with the aim of playing only vol.4 represents substantial madness. Positive note for the animated scenes, beautiful and extremely closer to the various anime iterations of the franchise.", "date": "2017-11-06", "grade": "7.5"}
