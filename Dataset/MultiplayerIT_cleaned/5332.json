Despite the fact that American football has never managed to gain a great hold in Italy, across the Atlantic this sport is instead the most followed in absolute terms in front of baseball and basketball, and it is therefore not surprising that EA Sports has founded part of its fortunes also on it. After celebrating the brand's quarter century with Madden NFL 25, the first title in the series to arrive on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in 2013, the historic EA Tiburon development team has continued with its work by making incremental changes, already obtaining the last year a game particularly appreciated after a few years of tiredness. With its arrival, Madden NFL 17 does not aim to revolutionize anything, but tries to plug all the holes that had remained open up to now, taking the opportunity to shore up some aspects of the game and introduce some useful elements for novices. In short, you don't just live on FIFA 17. Madden NFL 17 opens the doors of American football to everyone: experts and non-experts alike! Xbox One goals Madden NFL 17 features a total of 34 Goals, for 1,000 total points. The simplest ones cover the various aspects of the game, rewarding some basic successes linked above all to the two flagship modes Franchise and Ultimate Team, without forgetting Draft Champions. Goals placed at higher levels naturally reward deeds of particular importance, such as completing a Draft streak without defeat and accumulating an increasing amount of legacy points. Matter of time After the arrival of the Draft Champions mode, which took place last year, with Madden NFL 17 EA Tiburon has decided to continue working on what is already present, without introducing particular innovations. At the center of the gaming experience therefore remains the Franchise mode, now historic in the series as it has existed since the 90s. Thanks to it, the player can decide to immerse himself in several levels at the helm of one of the 32 teams that currently make up the NFL championship. In fact, you can choose to follow the management of the franchise directly in person as the owner, thus also covering all the management and bureaucratic aspects. Among the various possibilities, there is also that of transferring the franchise to a different city, a rather abstruse concept for us Italians used to football teams deeply linked to the territory, but not so rare in the case of American sports. However, the most important novelties of the Franchise mode of Madden NFL 17 arrive when it is time to take the field, given that the new Play the Moments appears among the menu options. This is a novelty intended above all for those who do not want to waste too much time playing every single game, while at the same time enjoying everything that the Franchise mode has to offer through the passing seasons. Depending on the settings, a virtual game in Madden NFL 17 can in fact last up to an hour, which multiplied by all the games in a season can create serious problems in carrying on more virtual years. What was hitherto reserved for the most diehard enthusiasts in collecting hours and hours in front of the console thus becomes possible for everyone else too, keeping statistics and other elements intact. The point where everything speeds up is linked to the less significant moments of each game, simulated by the CPU to allow the player to intervene only in the most important ones. The moments that we are called to play in first person include, for example, third down situations, everything that happens in the so-called Red Zone and field goal situations, both defensively and offensively. Using Play the Moments cuts the time it takes to complete a single game to around fifteen minutes, and brings with it other alternatives as well. In fact, the player can choose to devote himself only to defensive or offensive actions, that is, participating in those of one of the two types, making sure that the CPU simulates the other instead. If this series of ideas is designed for those who are now approaching the Madden NFL series, allowing them to dedicate a reasonable amount of time to the game, simulation lovers at all costs and the most passionate can continue playing as they did so far, also because there are still some considerations to make on the use of Play the Moments. In its simulation, the CPU obviously tends to favor the most skilled teams, leaving a small space for those who want to try to win by controlling a less strong team than the very first tier ones. To guide the steps of the newbies in the Franchise mode we also find the so-called Big Decisions:these are particularly delicate decision phases, linked for example to the seasonal objective, to the employment of an injured player or to the choice of new grafts for the team. A system designed also in this case to help those who are beginners, who could otherwise remain a little lost in front of all that the Franchise mode has to offer. The overview of the game modes of Madden NFL 17 passes through the aforementioned Draft Champions, with which to quickly create the team of your dreams to then use in a series of single or online challenges, while the card maniacs to collect and exchange this time they can also rely on the Ultimate Team mode, more or less similar to that seen in the FIFA series. In this case, you can choose to use microtransactions to build your team, or collect successes in some challenges to get virtual credits. Race to the goal In the collective imagination, the typical action of American football is the one in which the quarterback throws the ball towards his teammate, covering a series of yards with his pass calibrated to the millimetre. It is an undoubtedly spectacular phase of the game, flanked in reality by other situations in which the attacking team instead prefers running fencing. Statistics in hand, it is evident that pitches and runs occur at roughly the same percentage over an entire season, swinging up and down the 50% mark depending on individual team playbooks. For some players, one of the defects of Madden NFL 16 was precisely that of discouraging the use of running in favor of passing, thus moving towards more ~television~ dynamics but losing a little in terms of simulation. EA Tiburon has decided to tackle the matter head-on, focusing its efforts in terms of gameplay on racing. At lower difficulty levels, the player can, for example, count on the execution of some tackle avoidance moves automatically, without having to juggle with his own hands. At the same time, a trajectory suggestion system has been introduced to follow with the player in possession of the ball, which completes the excellent work done with the game tutorials even during a regular game. Incidentally, the latter have also been renovated, to give a welcoming landing place to those who play Madden NFL for the first time. Returning to the changes to the game mechanics, the measures mentioned above would have served rather little without adequate support from the animation sector, revised by the developers to improve the management of collisions between players in the tackle phase. When the latter are not particularly decisive, they can be tackled by pressing a special button to try to break free from the opponent's grip, or vice versa to throw the attacker to the ground. The balance towards the running phases also affects the defensive aspect, where players now more likely try to hit the ball rather than intercept it, thus obtaining a greater probability of success in trying to frustrate the opposing quarterback's pass. Also new for field goal shots, now entrusted to a classic system of triple pressure on the appropriate button: the first to start the kick, the second to choose its power and the third to orient the direction. Before closing, let's take a look at the technical sector, which has also improved compared to the previous edition. The Ignite engine used by EA Tiburon for Madden NFL 17 shows itself in what is probably the height of its maturity, waiting for maybe next year to switch to the use of Frostbite, as FIFA 17 will already do this year. Analyzing the visual sector in detail, the player models are now more evident in their diversity, also benefiting from the aforementioned additional animations to see their behavior on the field better defined. In some cases there are still some strange effects in which those who are on the ground struggle to get up, but it is definitely trivial stuff that only affects a more than good average presentation in a limited way. Thumbs up also for the work done by Brandon Gaudin and Charles Davis on the commentary: the couple successfully replaces the one made up of Jim Nantz and Cris Collinsworth, pointed by the index of critics in Madden NFL 16.", "date": "2016-08-26", "grade": "8.5"}
