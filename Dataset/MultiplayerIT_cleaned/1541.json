{"name": "World Racing", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/world-racing_a.html", "text": "The result of a work that lasted about two years, the numbers with which the game is presented to the public are respectable: 117 overall tracks, divided into 7 entirely practicable scenarios, each with an area of 6 square km! 48 different races to face in single and multiplayer modes. 109 original Mercedes-Benz car models (although many of these are the same models but with different engines), ranging from the small and slow-moving A-Class to the more powerful and sporty S-Class, passing through off-road vehicles , estate cars, vintage cars and prototypes. Each car has different characteristics thanks to the 150 original data parameters provided by Mercedes itself. But can simple numbers be enough to make a game great? Obviously not! And on balance World Racing, while presenting some decidedly innovative aspects in the field of racing games, did not fully convince us. But let's proceed in order and let's see together what the TDK Mediactive title offers to PlayStation 2 owners. The first impact with World Racing, once the DVD was inserted into the console, was certainly not the most encouraging. The game menu, in which we will be forced to extricate ourselves for the selection of races, cars, options and so on, is among the most complicated and confusing that we have ever experienced in many years of experience. Even after several days, you will continue to wander through the pages of the menu in search of the desired option and in a vain attempt to familiarize yourself with the graphical interface. When finally everything seems ready to start the first race and the loading screen appears, the second sore point of World Racing immediately arrives: the excessively long loading times at the start of each race in fact risk losing patience more than once . This defect is probably due to the loading of the immense areas, fully explorable and full of details, present in each track. In fact, the main novelty of World Racing lies in the very interesting and fun possibility of abandoning a race to devote oneself to exploring everything that surrounds the track. Anything visible on the horizon can in fact be reached with our car, complete with off-road and excursions on different types of terrain. Every track, whether in town or not, is also full of crossroads, crossroads and forks. Also for this reason, during each race, an indicator is always present on the monitor which, like a rally navigator, will show us the right direction for each curve and, based on the speed covered, will change color from green to red to allow us to deal with it better. If it is true that the exploratory aspect differentiates World Racing from any other driving game, it is also true that it fails to achieve the results which the developers perhaps aspired to. In fact, the feeling of freedom is totally missing, since the settings, although enriched by numerous details, are totally devoid of ~life~, and most of the time we will find ourselves wandering in thin air without all this having a purpose for the purpose of completing the game . In addition to the lack of people and moving cars (obviously excluding the five opposing cars), the handling of collisions with objects off the track also leaves a lot to be desired. For example, while poles, parked cars, walls and guardrails are tangible, trees, on the other hand, are only visible to the eye and, by heading towards them with our car, we will magically be able to pass through them. On the other hand, an extremely positive aspect of World Racing is the possibility of regulating, via a special bar in the options menu, the level of simulation / arcade in the control system and response to commands. Still in the game options, it is possible to set the skill level of the CPU, which can be fixed or dynamic based on the player's dexterity. In this way, the level of fun and challenge promises to always remain at a high level. Unfortunately, however, artificial intelligence has not fully convinced us. Even raising the level of difficulty, the opposing cars, albeit very fast and aggressive, all tend to follow a fixed trajectory and most of the time we will see them arranged in perfect single file. Graphics and sound Even technically World Racing is not convincing, due to numerous shortcomings. Resized a bit everywhere compared to the previous versions for PC and Xbox, graphically the game presents most of the defects that have gripped above allthe very first games that appeared on PlayStation 2. Dull textures, a pop-up effect even if not very evident but present in any case and a poor general image cleaning are only a small part of what is perhaps the main problem: the game runs at 30 fps, with noticeable drops in the most crowded situations. Is it tolerable that even today we start developing a driving game knowing right from the start that it will run at 30 fps? Shouldn't it be racing games that always run at a fixed 50/60 fps, perhaps giving up a handful of polygons, to ensure a good feeling of speed and better driving precision? To you the arduous sentence. The elimination of the internal view in the PlayStation 2 version remains inexplicable, which instead allowed you to admire the beautiful and different interiors of each car in the PC and Xbox versions. Despite the graphic defects listed above, it must also be said that the game has several advantages. The cars are beautifully modeled and closely resemble their real-life counterparts. Moreover, the game includes damage to the bodywork which, while not using perfect physics, is still always welcome. The visual horizon is also excellent, which allows you to observe objects very distant from our position. Finally, all the tracks are full of details and often animated details, even if not all are made with the same care. The last word on the technical aspect of World Racing concerns the sound, which unfortunately has the right to settle among the aspects least taken care of by the developers. The noise of the engines is not very real and poorly realized. Very often during a race, you cannot even hear the noise of your car and this can create particular problems if you have chosen to drive using the manual gearbox. Completely forget the music of the game. Our advice is to deactivate them completely from the audio menu. Comment To conclude, it certainly cannot be said that World Racing will leave its mark in the world of racing games, where there is certainly no lack of competition on the Sony console. It is however a pity that the development of the game, in many respects, has been blatantly neglected. With greater care and probably with a few more months of work we could have had a much better title in our hands. It is equally evident that the conversion for PlayStation 2 has not brought any benefit to the general technical aspect, given that on the other platforms World Racing is objectively superior. Despite this, TDK Mediactive's title as well as being fun to play, also shows some positive and innovative aspects, such as the possibility of varying the measure between arcade and simulation or the skill of the cars managed by the CPU, and the huge fully explorable environments. Pros: Ability to adjust various game parameters Many tracks and all the most prestigious Mercedes models Very vast and fully explorable environments Definitely long-lived Cons: Subdued graphics Sound to forget AI can be improved Long loading Good ideas but underdeveloped A historic brand Mercedes-Benz is undoubtedly one of the most famous and prestigious car brands in the world, everywhere it is in fact synonymous with class, elegance, charm and wealth. The glorious German company has been building cars from 1894 to today, if we exclude only a short period of about six years in which production has remained in stagnation due to the war. In all these years, the famous three-pointed star brand has not only always been a declared wish of every car enthusiast, but has often achieved excellent successes in the sports sector, becoming the pride of the German people. Just think of the supply of engines to McLarens in Formula 1, undertaken during the 1990s. It is therefore no wonder that one fine day, an all-German team of developers (Synetic the Funfactory), which has been dealing exclusively with racing games for years, decided to create a title entirely dedicated to Mercedes.", "date": "2003-09-22", "grade": null}
