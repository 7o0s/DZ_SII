For better or worse, in the world of pirates, respect was earned by the sweat of one's brow, inch after inch, boarding after boarding. After all, not many around Tortuga were in the mood for favors let alone gifts. Pixel Piracy is inspired by these assumptions to create a playful experience in which the player must build his own fortune in the role of an outlaw of the seas. The title developed by the guys at Quadro Delta in fact offers a 2D side scrolling experience that combines role-playing game mechanics with the strategic management of a crew, within a game world with very stylized outlines. After going through an Early Access period on Steam, the game has recently landed in its definitive guise on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and the time has therefore come to delve into its most characteristic sides and to frame whether or not you deserve attention. While putting a lot of irons in the fire, Pixel Piracy lends itself to many criticisms A captain and his rabble The first feature that catches the eye when starting Pixel Piracy is the wide choice that is offered to the player as regards the characteristics of the game, above all from the point of view of the challenge. Before taking the field, some questions are asked, for example the choice of the event that occurred most recently on land. By opting for the passage of a strange comet that has brought bad omens, the nocturnal sessions are activated, during which it will be more difficult to survive, while by deciding that a terrible war has upset the population, the result is the presence of many more ships from being able to engage during the crossings, with obvious repercussions on the opportunities for growth of the character. Through the same criterion are also assigned some additional objects or skills and the level of difficulty, by means of which some basic characteristics in the control of the troop are influenced. After completing these preliminary operations and having chosen the appearance of the unlikely outlaw leader, the time comes to start the climb to the elite of the pirate world, that is, you will have to face and defeat four fearsome legendary pirates who dominate unchallenged on the seven seas. The path promises to be tortuous as you find yourself in your hands little more than a barge and you have to aim to build or conquer a large galleon, while trying to enlist a fierce crew. Pixel Piracy features a randomly created game world where you can select various destinations marked on the nautical map. There are islands of refuge, where you can enter taverns, buy weapons and food and recruit new thugs to add to your group. The collection of resources present on the atolls and the assault on the unfortunate commercial boats allow not only to collect money, but above all to increase the level of the entire team, while the progressive increase of the members also allows the setting of a related hierarchical scale to skills. The high quantity of objects also provides for the selection of primary and secondary weapons, the application of perks, the use of combat accessories and the assignment of peculiar tasks or qualities that can play a managerial role while on board of the ship or provide new support abilities during combat phases. Playstation 4 trophies Trophies Box: Pixel Piracy offers only twelve Trophies, of which seven are bronze, four are silver and only one is gold, which is awarded only after defeating all the legendary pirate ships. Pirate life There are many activities on board the ship, it is in fact possible to assign tasks to the individual members of the group, such as keeping the ship clean, fishing or cooking. Members with more experience can be introduced into the assault formation, also because in case of death on the battlefield it is necessary to invest more money to enlist other recruits and bring them to the same level as the deceased colleague. There is also a morale gauge, which can fluctuate when the crew is low on food or hasn't received the agreed upon enlistment fee. The main problem that afflicts Pixel Piracy, however, is the inability to exploit the potential it has, since the game situations always repeat themselves identically and without those variations orthose changes of pace that would have added to the fun. Apart from the evolution of one's character and his team, the tasks to be carried out are always basic, the raids on the islands are all identical to each other, within flat and very small levels, in which there are never any variations on the theme or unexpected. In the same way, raids on sailing ships also change only based on the size of the hull being attacked but, once the first stages have been overcome, these activities too undergo an evident flattening. There is no story or even missions with original tasks to complete, as a result after the first few hours of the game a certain boredom begins to set in. The combat system is also unconvincing, which seemed confusing and excessively automated to us, offering only one type of attack and nothing more, given that dodging takes place automatically and it is not even possible to jump or roll. At the same time, the orders given to the rest of the team did not prove to be particularly responsive or integrated through a functional interface. And then there is the chapter concerning the construction and customization of the ship. While it is true that blocks can be added to change the appearance and size of the hull, introduce decorations and put food inside the pantry, it is equally undisputed that one is not stimulated at all in terms of inventiveness. It is in fact much easier to commandeer a vessel of considerable size, as soon as you have the opportunity to assault one, rather than just transforming and upgrading the barge on which you are at the beginning of the game. The incentives to build the boat from scratch disappear, and that's a shame.", "date": "2016-02-26", "grade": "5.5"}
