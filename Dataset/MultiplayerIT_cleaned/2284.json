Unfortunately, the high quantity of titles produced has not led to anything interesting from a simulation point of view, while only the excellent NBA Street by EA Sports BIG has managed to stand out for its arcade playability to the extreme. Just from the famous Electronic Arts comes the 2002 edition of the famous NBA Live that has been delighting the owners of almost all consoles for almost 10 years. For the Sony console it is the second appointment with a game that a year ago had not been able to fully convince us. In fact, the high graphic detail had not been sufficient to make an unrealistic gaming experience engaging and too similar to that of its predecessors. Unfortunately, things don't seem to have changed this year either and, despite some appreciable improvements, we are faced with yet another well-packaged but poor in content NBA Live. MJ is back! The biggest news of this NBA Live 2002 is the return of the legendary Michael Jordan, who returned to competitive activity at the ripe old age of 38 in the ranks of the Washington Wizards, a team of which he is also co-owner. This year you will therefore have the opportunity to also control ~Air~ Jordan and try to go to the basket with the countless dunks of his formidable repertoire. That said, there's not much news. You find the same options as last year and the same game modes: single game, season, franchise, one-on-one, practice. There is therefore something for all tastes and longevity is ensured by the usual incredible number of games available. The rosters are those of last season but you will still have the possibility to make transactions between the 29 NBA teams, to change the formations and to create your own players (irresistible temptation :) ). The completeness of the options of the sports titles of Electronic Arts has made school and this NBA Live 2002 is no less thanks above all to the usual incredible number of statistics and information on the teams. Zone defense in the NBA? From a playability point of view, not much has changed and this is unfortunately not a good thing. The actions develop with a certain cumbersomeness above all due to the limited offensive movements available to the players and the phenomenal reflexes with which the opposing defenders are equipped. Unfortunately the same cannot be said of our defense, often badly placed and almost never able to stop the devastating actions of the opposing pivots. Not even the zone defense, new this year for the NBA, manages to improve things beyond the doubling of marking that you can call with a specific key. The feeling of not being able to defend is always alive more than ever but in the end it almost never proves to be decisive. In fact, I found it all too easy to win games even on the hardest level or using the least competitive teams. Fortunately there are not only defects even if the improvements concern only the offensive phase of our actions which, especially near the basket, can be resolved in a series of situations recreated with greater realism than in the past. Dunks, jump shots, layups, alley-hoops give the game an undoubtedly very pleasant spectacle. Guido Bagata live from the Staples Center Technically NBA Live 2002 is a mix of positives and negatives. The polygonal models of the players have reached a rather impressive level of realism, above all thanks to highly detailed facial textures and more ~alive~ skin than in the past. The stadiums, on the other hand, don't make us cry out for a miracle and frankly we will expect something more from the usual 2D stickers of which the spectators in the stands are made up. I wasn't even convinced by the game's graphics engine which, although it doesn't have the showy slowdowns seen in the past version, moves at a certainly not exciting framerate, especially in light of the current PS2 standards. Things are definitely better as regards the sound of the game, always very nice and strong with convincing sound effects, the discreet commentary by Guido Bagatta and a selection of catchy music. Overtime! NBA Live 2002 is not a bad game at all but, as happens almost every year, it fails to get rid of those flaws that would make it a must-have titlethe. Unfortunately these shortcomings are quite important and in any case decisive when it comes to evaluating the game globally. With the eagerly awaited conversion of Sega's NBA 2K2 arriving on PS2, this NBA Live 2002 should be considered only a starter in view of something that promises to be much more satisfying. For basketball fans, and the NBA in particular, it can still be a good buy. See you in a year with the review of the next NBA Live which I doubt will miss the appointment with the PlayStation 2. Pros: There's Michael Jordan! Discreet graphics Some gameplay improvements... Cons: ...but sadly marginal Usual control issues Frame rate not great Not just football... While our beautiful country lives on football alone, on the other side of the ocean the passion for the sport of basketball does not seem to diminish. It was 1891 when Dr. James Naismith established the first rules of a new game created to allow students of a Springfield high school to practice physical activity even during the winter. A lot of time has passed since then and that ~game of baskets~ has managed to spread like wildfire all over the planet so as to become the best known and loved indoor sport. Basketball, initially only an American phenomenon, soon became a mass phenomenon, thanks also to the birth of the American professional league. The National Basket Association is considered the very symbol of basketball and the greatest vehicle for promotion among kids who approach the sport for the first time. The elegance, the power of the actions of Michael Jordan, Shaquille O'Neal, Vince Carter are probably the most spectacular ever seen on parquet. Unfortunately in Europe, and in Italy in particular, another type of basketball is played that has nothing to do with the American one. If you are tired of the low scores and excessive tactics of our local basketball, this could be the right time to pay a visit to the NBA planet thanks to yet another basketball simulation that has landed on consoles.", "date": "2002-01-09", "grade": null}
