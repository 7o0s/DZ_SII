The care for the atmosphere of the Spanish team has fortunately remained intact and the attention to strategy, despite the action genre, remains a fundamental element also in Strike Force. To overcome the 14 missions of the campaign it is essential to make the best use of the three characters available, each equipped with specific skills essential for overcoming certain obstacles. In some missions it is possible to use two characters that we can play as we like by simply pressing a button. Once you take on the role of one character, the other will be used by artificial intelligence which allows us to combine the skills of the two soldiers to achieve the most difficult objectives. The green beret represents the team's point man, capable of using heavy weapons and covering another character during a firefight Commandos in first person The Green Beret represents the team's point man, capable of using heavy weapons and covering another character during a particularly crowded firefight. The sniper, for example, with adequate cover can clear hills and buildings cleanly and effectively, can obviously neutralize enemies at extremely high distances and hold his breath to increase accuracy in case of particularly difficult shots. The spy, on the other hand, is the most independent of the three characters, he can disguise himself and eliminate enemies in absolute silence and pass through checkpoints without arousing suspicion. The higher the rank of the stolen uniform, the lower the risk of being discovered but to escape the careful control of an officer the only way is to get the dress of a Gestapo agent. Obviously he is the character that most resembles the Commandos style of play and the game sections that concern him are the most articulated, varied and studied. The spy has the possibility to face each mission in a different way, he can spy from the lock of the doors, launch a gas grenade in a closed room and protect himself using a gas mask, he can distract the enemies and cut their throats or after creating a diversion he can decide to eliminate the opposing soldiers with the canonical but very effective firearms. Pros and cons Artificial intelligence and difficulty, elements that are extremely important in a first person shooter, represent the two weak points of the game and in the first case, in the middle of 2006, the lack is quite serious. The general balance of the difficulty respects the canons of the strategic series and rises as one progresses along the plot of the campaign, but the increase in difficulty is dictated more by the increase in German soldiers arriving from each side rather than by the difficulty of the objectives or by a greater articulation of the missions. In some cases we will have to defend the allied troops and in this case the challenge rises a bit even though using an expedient now abused in this kind of titles. Despite this, the combat is quite fun and frenetic, the German soldiers, who are satisfied with a couple of bullets at most before abandoning their mortal coil, appear in droves in front of our viewfinder and the possibility of changing characters in real time gives us allows you to perform heroic deeds in profusion. In addition, the maps that are offered to us are quite large and moving around in an occupied French town, with the right atmosphere as a side dish, is always a pleasure for fans of this genre and the possibility of tackling a mission in multiple ways mitigates the drop in adrenaline caused by the ease of the fights. The multiplayer puts 16 contenders in competition and ranges from the canonical deathmatch to sabotage, a mode born with counterstrike, where players must arm a bomb obviously avoiding being eliminated by their opponents. But the game engine, and this is evident, is certainly not designed for multiplayer which, among other things, does not offer any innovation compared to other titles of the genre and loses several elements that instead characterize the single player mode. War images Strike Force offers large, well-designed maps, full of details and buildings and everything is shown with an enviable viewing distance. The characters are voluminous, rich in polygons and above all animated in a convincing way. Also in this case the character who most enjoys the commitment of the guys from Pyro Studios is the spy and particular prominence is given to the act of strangling the unsuspecting German soldiers condemned to die in always different and picturesque ways. Appreciable some tocsome classy like the deformation of the sniper rifle lens and the comments of our characters that enrich the action from time to time. The physics is not particularly exciting and mostly involves barrels and crates, leaving the other contour elements inextricably nailed to the scenography War images The physics is not particularly exciting and mostly involves barrels and crates leaving the other contour elements inextricably nailed to the scenography while the characters are linked to the canonical ragdoll whose unrealism now immediately catches the eye of the most savvy gamers. Technically, the PC version differs from the console version by offering polygons and detail in quantity and, for once, it is not subject to the now widespread habits that afflict cross-platform titles. The XBox version thanks to glow and antialiasing still manages to maintain the cinematic atmosphere of the title. The sampling of the sound effects is not particularly vast, the moans of the wounded comrade are all too reminiscent of a short sound file that repeats itself continuously; shots, deadly sobs and the accompanying sounds instead carry out their task without infamy wrapped up in the military symphonies of the series that are spot on and always of excellent quality. Comment Giving a definitive judgment on Strike Force is a rather difficult task even if it seems easy to say that Pyro Studios have not won their bet in an attempt to enrich the Commandos saga. Yet despite the lack of stimulating artificial intelligence and despite the almost total lack of innovation we are faced with a title that can be entertaining if only for a few hours and which from some points of view, first of all the atmosphere, shows some care. The title of the Spanish team certainly deserves a try, especially if you don't have particular pretensions from a first-person shooter and are passionate about titles set during the Second World War. Pros: good atmosphere good visual impact on consoles (especially on XBox thanks to the filters) three peculiar characters Cons: almost no artificial intelligence linear action and devoid of any innovation Cross-platform As mentioned in the technical analysis, the game is substantially identical in the three versions with the PC one which stands out for its detail and care and the Xbox one better than the PS2 one. In the end, the choice depends on your gaming habits and the level of your PC. Some time ago, while the world of strategy languished, Pyro Studios pulled out of the cylinder an innovative RTS centered on a team of a few, talented elements engaged in the most delicate missions necessary to turn the tide of war in favor of the heroic allies. The first elements to strike audiences and critics were undoubtedly the great commitment of the Pyro Studios guys used in the technical realization and in the exaltation of the atmosphere of the game's complex missions. Commandos then emerged as an extremely elaborate strategic title, so much so that it was almost an extremely varied puzzle game and at the same time a cinematic title, a unique title at the time capable of launching a software house and its series on its own at the top of the sales rankings. In 8 long years the series has seen several ~dirty dozens~ of elements equipped with peculiar abilities that have made each chapter unique from time to time, but as with UFO and Command & Conquer the time has come to turn around to ensure the health and survival of the Commandos brand. And as for uFO and Command & Conquer, named anything but casually, the path taken is that of action and in this specific case of the first person shooter, hoping that the fate of Strike Force is more rosy than that of its predecessors .", "date": "2006-03-11", "grade": null}
