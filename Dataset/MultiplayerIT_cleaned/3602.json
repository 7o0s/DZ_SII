{"name": "Chess Rush", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/chess-rush-recensione.html", "text": "Chess Rush is just the umpteenth demonstration of how trends substantially influence the strategies of the major publishers, also and above all in the mobile sector, and Tencent is obviously no exception. As we will explain to you in this review, the Chinese giant's new autobattler looks at first glance like a simple clone of the various Dota Underlords and Auto Chess: the gameplay is the same, as are the rules of engagement; the arena is characterized by an eight by eight grid on which the units move according to their type, dispensing attacks automatically; and the characters come from a consolidated fantasy imagery, with the same characteristics that fans of the genre are now very familiar with. However, there is an important difference: alongside the standard game mode we find two variants, namely a cooperative that emphasizes the social aspect of the experience, allowing us to possibly share our battles with a friend; and above all a turbo mode, which reduces the duration of the matches from the usual 35-40 minutes to about 10. We are naturally talking about a feature of great importance from a mobile point of view, given that often you don't have the time necessary to complete the long tournaments of eight players and therefore get to the end of the challenge to be able to reap the rewards. How exactly does it work? It's simple: the system decreases the health of each participant and speeds up the gain of mana, the spiritual energy needed to obtain new slots on the battlefield and therefore fortify your team in view of each single fight. Freemium gameplay and mechanics Let's make one thing clear right away: Chess Rush is available on the App Store and Google Play in the traditional freemium format and can therefore be downloaded for free on iOS and Android devices, but it does not include pay-to-win style elements. The even present (and sometimes a little intrusive) calls for monetization in fact revolve around purely aesthetic aspects and do not affect our effectiveness in battle, which means that you will never end up incurring a defeat that is not actually undeserved. For the rest, the gameplay is practically identical to that of the aforementioned Dota Underlords and Auto Chess: from the point of view of a tournament of eight participants, divided into as many rounds as are necessary for a single player to remain alive, we will have the task of compose an ever stronger team by drawing from a roster made up of fifty-two characters, divided between twelve races and nine classes. There are the traditional strong and resilient tanks, the units specialized in ranged attacks but weak in close combat, the balanced warriors who move agilely and dispense blows with great skill, a whole series of knights complete with mounts, goblins and elves of various kinds, wizards and sorcerers capable of casting powerful spells, and so on. The strategic key, regulated by a pinch of luck, lies in the random appearance of five characters at a time to choose from, with a refresh regulated by our availability of precious stones. Placing three equal units on the board gives life to a second level warrior, and three second level warriors can form a third level one: in this case the attack and defense characteristics increase exponentially, providing us with a clear advantage. Considering the automatisms once the battle has begun, it is clear how the fulcrum of the gameplay is all there, in a careful selection of fighters, also regulated by bonuses and by the possibility of equipping objects that are progressively unlocked. A very well tested system, which in the case of Chess Rush is supported by an excellent technical realization, a good number of options for scaling the graphics on less performing devices (but if the game runs lousy at its best on the iPhone X there frankly surprised) and an excellent design for each single unit, which however ends up being little valued due to the view from above and the lack of alternative sequences: a bullet time dedicated to the finishers, for example, would have helped to make justice to the great work done by the developers.", "date": "2019-07-08", "grade": "8.0"}
