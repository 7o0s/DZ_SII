{"name": "Actionloop", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/actionloop.html", "text": "In the Year of Grace 1995, Taito dusted off his unforgettable mascots, the bubble-shooting dragons Bub & Bob, protagonists centuries before Bubble Bobble, a platform game in which each of us in our youth probably invested several weekly allowances, and inserted them in a context of the all new, that of puzzle games. This time the two brothers had to prevent a mass of bubbles from crushing them by falling slowly from the top of the screen, shooting the same bubbles from below with the aim of associating three or more of the same color so that they would disappear. Puzzle Bobble, as it was known here (overseas they know it as Bust A Move), had the best characteristics of a puzzle game, that is, it was very simple to understand but difficult to face at its best, and it was tremendously addictive and addictive: the success did not reach the levels of Tetris, but we were close, the title was (and continues to be) converted into every imaginable sauce and gave way to an infinite sequence of more or less original clones and reinterpretations. Among these, in 1998, we mention Mitchell's Puzzloop, which hit the mark in various points and enjoyed great success so much as to give life to that phenomenon of free gaming on the Net, and then cheaply on Xbox Live, which is Zuma, a most basic version of the original concept. Well, today Mitchell decides to put everything back on track and sort out this complex genealogy with the title that should say the final word on this particular sub-genre of puzzles. Don't break my marbles! In a self-respecting puzzle game, multiplayer certainly cannot be missing, and Actionloop doesn't ask for it by presenting an excellent one, to be played even with a single cartridge, but unfortunately limited to only two competitors. The concept remains the same, however various parameters can be chosen including the shape of the course and the handicap, and obviously the more chains a player makes, the more annoying balls are catapulted onto the other's screen. There will also be various bonuses to be hit in two-player games to turn them into malus for your friend: among these we mention the evil fog, to be blown away into the microphone! The picture of the modes accessible from the main screen is completed by the possibility of interfacing with Polarium Advance, another puzzle, this time for GBA, from the same house: inserting a copy into the GBA slot of your DS will add two new types of boxes and ten original levels. Technically, due precedence must be given to tactile control, which is truly flawless: it has never happened to us that the ball went in the wrong direction for faults that were not ours, and therefore hats off to the programmers. Then a quick mention of the Rumble Pak included in the package, to be inserted in the GBA slot: the effect is moderately good, it won't exalt you but it won't push you to eliminate it either. On graphics and sound, what can be said in a game like Actionloop which is practically the quintessence of Puzzle Games? The visual department performs its task very well, and we would be wanting more given the simplicity and abstractness of the elements it is called upon to represent, and the same goes for the sound, with effects that don't make one cry for a miracle and that don't disgust, and with music that knows how to underline the reflective moments as well as the more frenetic ones, whose daring alternation (apart from the Checkmate mode) is ultimately the most successful element of Actionloop, the one that elevates it among the highest peaks of the genre and makes a game with great addictive qualities. The concept is simple and not so new, the realization is that of any puzzle game and therefore nothing amazing, the story simply doesn't exist... And it is precisely for these reasons that Actionloop fully achieves its objectives, which are those of every puzzle game: lend yourself to the quick game from time to time as well as those very long score-devouring marathons, sneaking discreetly but forcefully into a corner of your brain and residing there for a long time. The best feature is certainly the presence of two different souls, the frenetic and pressing action and the exquisitely puzzle one, to be appreciated above all in Checkmate, which alternate with great wisdom on the part of the programmers and amusement for the players. The multiplayer mode is not epochal this time, but still fun. We can't think of particularly negative sides to report, apart from the fact that a basic version without a nib can be easily found on the Net; clearly if you hate puzzles and you want pumped-up graphics from a game, Actionloop is not for you, but if not, take a seat! Pros It is both puzzle and action  and the game modes prove it! Excellent implementation of the Touch Screen Contro Multiplayer for up to two players Zuma is free on the Net, but it's not the same thing! The thousand blue bubbles (and yellow, and red, and blue) Imagine a track of marbles, not closed, with a spiral trend: it is on this very simple path that most of your experience with Actionloop will take place. On the ~track~ balls of different colors will gradually be introduced, while in another point of the screen, preferably the central one, the marbles will appear which you can shoot with the stylus taking into due consideration speed and direction. Your aim is to prevent the balls from filling all the way by shooting the balls of a certain color towards a group of at least two of the same hue, so that they destroy each other and free up space. The marbles also have magnetic properties (the US title of the game is Magnetica), which means that two of the same color will attract each other if you manage to eliminate the obstacles between them, starting, if you know how to play well, chains of dimensions also considerable and consequent, satisfying bonus points. This is the basic concept, which is then interpreted in three different variations which are the three single player game modes, and to which variations on the theme must be added such as ~neutral~ balls that are destroyed only when the colored ones adjacent to them do, clocks that from time to time they arrive on the course and that if hit stop the incessant insertion of new balls to give you a breather, missiles that push the balls to higher speeds and the very classic ~smart bombs~ that eliminate all the balls from the screen color of the affected one. Returning to the game modes, in detail we include Marathon, where all you have to do is eliminate marbles after marbles along 99 levels made increasingly difficult by the arrival of new colors; Missions, 60 levels to be played separately where a few things change, first of all the conformation of the path and the presence of even more centers from which to shoot the marbles (for these characteristics it is certainly the most difficult mode); and Checkmate, where things change even more: in this mode the ~Action~ component of the title is completely missing, you will have a specific set of balls to eliminate and shoot, and completing the various levels will only be possible using all the resources at your disposal. A real challenge to your logic and planning skills.", "date": "2007-02-09", "grade": null}
