Legend has it that they had never seen each other before, but that at the end of the Global Game Jam weekend the platformer that would later become Life Goes On was already playable, even if only in prototype form: although there were several bugs, the liking of the community of developers and players present had already reached such a point as to let one foresee what the future of this title would have been. In fact, the development of Life Goes On went ahead quickly, and the game then returned to show itself during 2013 through two different demos, with which Infinite Monkey kept the appreciations of the first hour, clearly useful for getting to see the publication on Steam took place in these hours. For those who don't know what we're talking about, let's take a step back to describe Life Goes On as a fairly classic platform-puzzle, with decidedly immediate controls and with a rather particular main feature: that of having a series of puzzles that can be solved mainly ... dying. Certainly an original idea, which the developers have decided to implement in the way we are about to see in this review. Life goes on, especially if dying is as useful as in Life Goes On! For the greater good Life Goes On is presented naked and raw, without any kind of plot, immediately putting the player in the situation of having to go from point A to point B, where the level ends. On the screen, this point is represented by the so-called Cup of Life whose features closely resemble those of the Holy Grail: in fact, it is no coincidence that as protagonists of the game we find a series of knights, which the player must control to reach the destination. The most particular element, as already mentioned, concerns the possibility of sacrificing one's character to overcome the puzzles: more than a choice, it is actually a real necessity, to be used with due care to get the better of the obstacles proposed by the game. Like other similar titles, Life Goes On offers a ranking system that is essentially based on two different parameters: the time taken to complete the level and the sum of knights used for the cause. If there is little to add on the first, the second could be defined as a sort of golf par, corresponding to the maximum number of characters to be sacrificed - as determined by the developers. A third parameter rewards our performance in the various levels and concerns different elements, connected to the setting in which we find ourselves moving the brave knights. The controls give the possibility to move the characters also with the use of the joypad, but contrary to other occasions the use of this peripheral is not essential: the movements are in fact reduced to the directional arrows to go forward and backward, together with a additional key to jump. The same button is used to summon a new knight when the previous one dies. Spotless knights The Life Goes On schemes have been created with an increasing level of difficulty, initially guiding the player through a sort of mini-tutorial in which to become familiar with the game environment. In particular, the puzzles are presented at first easy to solve and then gradually enriched with further elements, such as platforms that behave differently depending on the pressed button and knight-shooting cannons to be used to reach certain places. The key to each level is, as repeatedly repeated, the possibility of sacrificing even more than one character to achieve one's goal: for example, one can choose to ~suicide~ a knight on a rotating blade, so that when he falls he ends up on a platform and keep it activated, in order to allow us a passage that was previously closed to us. The game takes all this jokingly, offering us a different name at the bottom of the screen for each activated knight and crossing his name off the list when he is sacrificed. If initially you manage to have an easy life, going forward the title begins to require an ever higher amount of reasoning, prompting the player to think and act quickly to complete everything according to the parameters imposed by Life Goes On. A feature that favorsalso the replay value of each single level, in case you didn't manage to get all the rewards in the first occasion. The technical aspect of Life Goes On is not central, but in any case Monkey Entertainment's effort defends itself properly: the levels and their settings are also well designed from a graphic point of view, as are the animations of the characters. The presence of a good physical model is also fundamental, to allow the knights not to sacrifice themselves in vain, thus managing to reach the places chosen by the player without particular worries. The sound is even above the average of the genre, thanks to the excellent soundtrack written by Kevin Greenlee. Too bad for what is, at least for the moment, the absence of a level editor, which could have further increased the longevity of Life Goes On: the request from the players actually already exists, so nothing prevents developers to release this update at a later time, especially if the success of the game should justify it. We hope so.", "date": "2014-04-18", "grade": "8.0"}
