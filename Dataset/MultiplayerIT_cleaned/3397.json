After the equally recent Nelke & the Legendary Alchemists: Ateliers of the New World and Atelier Lulua: The Scion of Arland, in fact, the Atelier saga had to prepare for the big leap in the dark: a title capable of refreshing and updating the entire franchise, trying to meet both long-standing players who have supported it over the years, and all newcomers, who, not surprisingly, could discover an extremely valid series for the first time in this production. We spent several hours in the company of Ryza, Lent, Tao and company: it's time for the verdict. The plot Let's admit it openly: the narratives of the various Ateliers have certainly never shone for originality, courage or particularly in-depth themes, contenting themselves with mixing classic Japanese clichs with pleasant contexts after all. The same happens once again with Atelier Ryza - Ever Darkness & The Secret Hideout: don't expect an Oscar-winning plot, nor one that meshes from the first minutes. In fact, it will take a few hours, as well as a full-bodied prologue-tutorial before getting to the heart of the action: all in all, however, the story of the enterprising and enthusiastic protagonist is pleasant, even captivating in some moments, and accompanies, among other things, to the personal stories of the various co-stars, sufficiently characterized. Ryza, the young girl of a coastal village, is the daughter of farmers: needless to say, she immediately proves intolerant of island life, and takes advantage of every available opportunity to go on an adventure in the company of the robust Lent, a red-haired swordsman, and the shy and intellectual Tao. The unlikely trio are incredibly skilled at getting themselves into trouble, but one fine day their mishap in the woods still proves extremely propitious: in fact they save the life of Klaudia, daughter of a merchant currently in the area. From there on, they get to know other important characters for the narrative, such as Empel the alchemist and Lila, who embodies all the fanservice of the production in a single point, for reasons that you will understand at first glance. The growing climax is what you might imagine: each of the protagonists discovers his particular talent, they are made aware of an imminent threat to the whole world, they set out to save it in the company of the newcomers. Thirty hours is enough and more to get to the credits, but paying attention to everything and everyone could easily take twice as long. And if you really want to explore all the possibilities of production, even triple. Gameplay: novelty at a glance Atelier Ryza - Ever Darkness & The Secret Hideout presents extremely revealing innovations within the series: it updates two fundamental aspects, respectively the gameplay and the technical sector, trying to bring it to new levels (curiously, right at the end of the console generation in progress). All fans could easily find themselves lost when taking a quick look at the new alchemy menu, as well as when taking part in the first fight. Let's start with the latter, also ideally following the way in which the title offers its contents, that is, slowly, over the first three hours, and accompanying them with minimal tutorials that are more confusing than clear. Now the fights of the Ateliers are no longer turn-based, but in real time, which in any case does not exclude the basic tactics at all, but simply blurs it to other levels. At all times, the player controls only one of the three characters of the party in action, while the other two act autonomously (but their behavior can be set between passive and aggressive, so as to consume or not the precious resources available). Each offensive action grants Action Points, filling a circular meter on the right: once the entire circle is filled, an upgrade can be made for the current battle. From that moment on, by resetting all the AP, the attacks become stronger, and special actions are unlocked. The player's task is therefore to balance the attacks of those present at the same time, those of the protagonist in particular, keeping an eye on the Action Points and understanding when it is time to sacrifice them to raise the enhancer. The longer the battle lasts, the more obviously you can make upgrades. On the left, and verticallyand, portraits of everyone present at the battle, friend and foe alike, are shown: when their face drops to the action bar, the latter can launch their attack. So it is possible to predict who will attack first and who will follow our attacks, in order to carefully calculate every moment of the clash; obviously it will be necessary to act quickly, sometimes instinctively, to keep up, especially in the first moments. It should be noted that, catching an enemy in the game world by surprise, each fight begins with 10 Action Points assigned immediately: therefore the first party upgrade is free. The other important novelty consists in Alchemy, a mechanic already present in previous games but in Atelier Ryza - Ever Darkness & The Secret Hideout completely revised and adapted. At first glance it all seems extremely complex, and in fact it really is, but it is a complication that once mastered allows you to reach very different levels of satisfaction and potential in your creations. Our advice is to experiment, because the tutorials from this point of view simply become useless and frustrating: following composition schemes, Ryza can mix, combine and aggregate an infinite number of different materials together, to create bombs out of nothing, healing potions, tools, armor and so on. The basic materials can be purchased from merchants or collected during careful explorations of the game world: you will find yourself wandering around the island in search of the last component that is missing from your blend, often without guides of any kind. In this case that's okay, because it encourages exploration in the surrounding environment. Playstation 4 trophies The Platinum Trophy of Atelier Ryza - Ever Darkness & The Secret Hideout will take you a lot of time, but does not present particular difficulty peaks: you will simply have to complete the main narrative, dedicate yourself to all the secondary bosses, and collect the chests / collectibles scattered a just about everywhere in the game world. Technical compartment Atelier Ryza - Ever Darkness & The Secret Hideout aims for a completely renewed graphic design, with the enhancement of its game engine and the entire technical sector, and apart from some minimal imperfections that can be easily reviewed, it succeeds successfully. The external and external environments are treated in a remarkable way, both from the point of view of lighting and in the physics of the objects present: the latter are not actually very numerous, but in any case dosed in an intelligent way and positioned in such a way as to generate a perspective effect intelligent; on balance, even though you never move in anything other than narrow areas linked together by checkpoints, you always get the impression of a vast and spacious world. The enemies are obviously housed only in some specific places, which you will need to overcome to continue in the main and secondary quests. The artistic direction is clearly derived from the other chapters of the series, but the graphics sector is now able to compete with the other most famous exponents of the JRPG genre. However, two aspects in particular excel: the sound sector, with catchy, inspired and never annoying melodies; and then the Japanese language dubbing, really memorable. On the other hand, for Italian players, the approach could be complicated by the audio option in Japanese and texts in English alone, without further customization possibilities. In some moments (not all, fortunately) the English lexicon becomes technical, and when not technical certainly not scholastic.", "date": "2019-10-31", "grade": "8.2"}
