The arcade developed by Technos (the same as Double Dragon, to be clear) had the merit of being able to convey an excellent sensation of impact, inside and outside the ring, and of keeping the game dynamics simple and intuitive. Working on that type of structure and content over the years would perhaps have benefited current wrestling simulations, however we don't know for sure. What is certain is that Yuke's work, which started off great on PSone (with more than three million copies sold on the Sony platform alone), has been lost in the maze of faithful reproduction of WWE shows and options for customizing wrestlers and events, while leaving out fundamentals such as speed and fun. In its Wii version, moreover, WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2011 also renounces the even timid implementation of motion detection controls, which at first had given hope for the realization of a ~live~ wrestling (and if the operation had succeeded at least discreetly, to hell with the concessions to casual gamers!) , instead presenting itself as a mere transposition of what is available on PlayStation 2. To play, therefore, you need to use the Wii-mote / Nunchuk pair, the GameCube controller or the Classic Controller, with a standard command configuration. If you smell what the Rock is cookin'... In the game there are about seventy wrestlers available (most to be unlocked), an infinity of stipulations for the matches and the ~WWE Universe~ and ~Road to WrestleMania~ modes to constitute the most substantial part of the experience: the first one allows you to play endlessly by following the various weekly WWE shows, participating in the matches that interest us and simulating the others, with a series of random events that can mix the cards on the table from time to time; the second offers us a series of storylines (five, to be precise, one of which is open to numerous variables) based precisely on the path that the WWE superstars undertake every year with the aim of building an important rivalry in view of the ~grandaddy of them all~, WrestleMania, the symbolic event for McMahon's home federation. The multiplayer modes are limited to local games, unfortunately there is no online. Instead, as usual, there are numerous customization options, through rather complete editors that allow us to create a wrestler, a set of moves, an entrance, a stipulation or an entire event from scratch. Seen through the eyes of an enthusiast, including on Wii WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2011 offers an experience as close as possible to that of television broadcasts: each superstar has his own characteristic entrance complete with personal music, the commentary team (consisting of Michael Cole and Jerry ~The King~ Lawler) introduces each ~episode ~ in a plausible way, even indicating the city where the show takes place, and at the end of the evening the WWE logo even appears to indicate the end of filming. Furthermore, the ~Road to WrestleMania~ mode sees the presence of some elements typical of RPGs (gaining experience points to upgrade one's character) which accompany a ~free roaming~ phase which takes place inside the backstage before each match. Very static and boring, but at the same time rich in content for those who may be interested: in the corridors and dressing rooms it is possible to dialogue with other fighters, give birth to rivalries and possibly resolve them with a ~street fight~ (very limited, but anyhow ). And that's the bottom line, 'cause Stone Cold said so In short, those who follow the WWE diligently but perhaps are fasting from themed video games could find many strengths in this incredible abundance of situations, modalities and events. The situation is different for those who have already given, or for players who have found themselves in the past in front of an episode of the series Smackdown vs. Raw and have literally devoured it, assimilating both its merits and its defects ad nauseam. These people will not find practically anything new in the 2011 edition of the product developed by Yuke's, and indeed specifically in the Wii version they will end up colliding with some edges that on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 seem to have been at least smoothed: the almost eternal time that it takes a character to get up after being knocked down, showing his side to endless further attacks from the opponent; the questionable mo way of executing moves and countermoves, which at the highest difficulty levels (or against human players) reveal the fallibility of the solutions adopted, with attempts to carry out a maneuver that are nipped in the bud; the absurd slowness and woodiness of the action in general, an element that most of all dampens enthusiasm and the desire to play, and which actually afflicts the product in all its current incarnations. Finally, on the Nintendo console, one cannot even speak of high-level technical realization: the animations are excellent, but they have been the same for years and in any case they are shared on all platforms, and in the same way most of the polygonal models are made Very good. The realization of the heaviest wrestlers (Big Show, Mark Henry, etc.) continues to be mediocre, given that they look fat without a muscle, and at the same time some characters have a characterization that is now very old (see John Cena, who in reality, compared to he started out, he got a lot bigger). The antialiasing seems to be completely absent, and in fact you notice ~jaggies~ at all times, but on the other hand the polygonal count does not make you cry for a miracle and in fact we have the usual just decent audience. The sound sector is very rich in original dialogues, the effects are of moderate quality and the ~entrance themes~ of each superstar cheer the navigation in the various options screens.", "date": "2010-12-15", "grade": "6.0"}
