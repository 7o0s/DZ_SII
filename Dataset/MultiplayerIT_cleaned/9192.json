Describing it in every detail would require a themed conference, so we'll avoid going into too much detail so as not to get lost in the menus that make it up. Just know that it is a product of great complexity that allows you to impersonate one of the great world powers of the period from 1850 to 1920, or the Victorian age. Once you have chosen one of the eight governable nations (USA, Great Britain, Germany, France, Japan, Russia, the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Italy), you will immediately find yourself grappling with a series of choices to make that involve all fields of good governance. As tradition of these games has it, the most important decisions are reflected in the entire politics of a nation. So expect a wide range of economic choices, which strongly affect the livelihoods of the troops in the colonies, the latter necessary to maintain the prestige of their nation and to supply the motherland with raw materials to be exchanged on the markets. Everything is interconnected. But this was just a trivial example of one of the possible chains of management departments. In reality there are so many decisions to make and aspects to consider, the latter well represented by tables, graphs and the like, of which the latest effort of Paradox is very rich, that it is simplistic to limit oneself to considering one or two. Do you think that a game played at maximum intensity, i.e. pondering every move after having carefully studied all the available reports, can spread over several dozen hours of play. Nothing that scares those who eat bread and strategy every day, of course. Artificial intelligence and interface From the point of view of artificial intelligence, another key aspect for the success of such a product, Pride of Nations offers a CPU capable of causing problems and making decisions that are always consistent. She's not unbeatable, but neither is she one to make blunders or have to cheat to get an edge (hey Sid Meier, we're talking to you). Moreover, he is capable of juggling all four areas (economic management, colony management, army management and political management) without making a human player regret too much. The game interface can appear slightly confusing, at least at the beginning, and the player is certainly not helped by the bad tutorial that only explains the most superficial elements (often only the most obvious ones). In reality, in such titles the interface is always rather problematic, because it must still give the player the opportunity to juggle dozens of different screens. In this sense, the developers of Pride of Nations have managed to compose the menus in a functional and rational way; in short, learning to play requires only a minimum of practice. Practice which, compared to the genre, means several hours of study. Problems and applause Having to talk about the flaws of Pride of Nations, the names of at least two other Paradox titles immediately come to mind: Europa Universalis III and Victoria II. The sense of what we mean is clearer than it seems: Pride of Nations is a strategically very deep title, but it does not reach the heights of the two titles mentioned above, sacrificing some aspects, apparently secondary, to offer a less multifaceted. Not that strategists won't find bread for their sharp teeth, just that the comparison is a bit penalizing. Of course, you also have to think that Pride of Nations is sold at a budget price and that it is worth all the money it costs. Less justifiable are some display issues we encountered. Sometimes the text boxes appeared completely wrong, making it difficult to read their contents. Other times we encountered a few too many graphic glitches, although the technical aspects certainly don't make the game. Finally, we would like to underline what we absolutely do not consider a defect, namely the very steep learning curve. True, newcomers to the genre may find it too complex (also by virtue of a poor and quite useless tutorial), but when would a non-strategy enthusiast ever buy a title like this? Obviously this is a product intended for a specific and extremely passionate target, so we don't think it's appropriate to penalize it because the gamer's housewife from Voghera could find it difficult. Every video game chooses its audience, Paradox Interactive knows this well and, also in this case, has decided to address a precise niche of gamers. We must really blame her for not havingr aimed at the mass?", "date": "2011-07-06", "grade": "8.2"}
