{"name": "Dark Summit", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dark-summit_b.html", "text": "Crossroads and crossroads As already mentioned, you start by playing Naya, but as you progress through the game you will play different characters, each with its own unique characteristics. You will race on different tracks characterized by intersections and crossroads, which will lead to areas of the track that will only be visited after passing certain missions. The gist of the game is this: the non-linearity of the tracks serves to differentiate the different tasks that will be assigned to us. Tasks that vary a lot and that will be unlocked slowly, but which see us forced to retrace the same track many times, giving rise to feelings that are certainly not candid and pure towards the creators of the game. In addition, even the control method does not help us. In addition to the secrets of Mount Garrick, the THQ title also hides some serious flaws. The most important is the imprecision of the control method and of the physics that implies the aerial numbers that we are going to perform during the game. In fact, the very high leaps and the following fall to the ground in the style of the walk on the moon immediately catch the eye: it floats and the more falling it glides to the ground at the mercy of the updrafts I would say. It's good if you jump from a platform and there's an overhang below you where you can give us tricks and tricks, but if you have to fall back onto handrails or well-defined places, it's certainly not the best. In other words, in certain situations the title becomes frustrating and not very funny Graphics and sound Graphically you don't have a picture of absolute excellence. D.S. it is not the paradigm of the sector, but it has some good qualities on its side, such as the excellent design of the slopes and the extreme interaction with the seabed. In fact, there are many objects on the track just waiting to be smashed as we pass, from barrels to assorted tables, from fences to sculptures made with snow, disintegrating into a thousand pieces. The polygonal models and animations, as already mentioned, certainly do not represent the current state of the art: the textures applied to the characters (rather angular) are well made and above all very varied, while those relating to the track and the seabed denounce flatness and sometimes lack of attention to the detail. Completely negative is the frame rate which loses shots very often, and to make matters worse the uploads are long and very annoying. Summing up, we are dealing with a sufficient graphic sector, with some light and many shadows in short. Musically speaking, the title deviates a lot from the tradition of extreme sports titles: there isn't that ~wall of sound~ typical of this genre of games, on the contrary it sounds very little, an unusual choice given that these games are normally an excellent compilation of full blast punk rock. The end? In the end what remains of this game? The impression is that they wanted to look for a different approach to the sporting genre, focusing a lot on the idea but not on its practical implementation. The game has an atmosphere, you don't just run on tracks trying to make ever more spectacular jumps and evolutions, but in a certain way you are taken by the story, a pity that then the lack of attention to the control method suddenly awakens us. The best intentions weren't enough, probably a second episode will have a good game to make a series of changes to the basic structure of the title. At this point, given the goodness of the basic idea, we will certainly be dealing with a game of absolute value. Pros: non-invasive sound texture high interaction with the backdrops Cons: frustrating fluctuating graphic sector control method Dark Summit, or when Tony Hawk meets The X Files..... Dark Summit represents a more unique than rare case of its kind: a sportsman with a real plot to support the ranks of the game. Unfortunately this is the only novelty of the THQ title, which under the guise of a ~sporting adventure~ turns out to be an all in all ordinary extreme snowboard title without any outstanding quality that makes it rise to higher qualitative peaks. But let's go in order, let's talk about the story first. Naya, the heroine of the game will already have to deal with the tyrannical Chief O'Leary and his henchmen who have the task of keeping you away from Mount Garrick. Why? What will the mountain hide so secret? What does the army have to do with a pleasant vacation spot? But above all because you have to jump over the stinking patches of green slime that make a lot of nuclear landfill? So the player through tricks, jumps and various evolutions will have to unravel the mystery of the ~Picco Oscuro, going through the coils of a plot full of twists and turns.", "date": "2002-08-28", "grade": null}
