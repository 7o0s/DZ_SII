{"name": "Top Spin 3 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/top-spin-3-recensione_a.html", "text": "If it is true that tennis simulations have never been able to count on a vast audience, it is also true that a tennis arcade (however simple and limited) like Wii Sports Tennis has contributed in a concrete way to selling tens of millions of Wiis worldwide. Worldwide. Naturally this is a limit situation, with a console that has based its appeal also and above all on sports simulations, relying on the strength of an innovative control system, which promised to faithfully replicate the player's movements on the screen . Finding yourself a year and a half after the launch of Wii still waiting for titles that can expand (or at least replicate!) the discourse started with Wii Sports can be quite a bit annoying. It is also for this reason that the owners of the Nintendo console eagerly awaited the release of Top Spin 3, the third episode of a tennis series that has always been characterized by a certain quality. Top Spin 3 or Top Spin Wii? The start screen allows us to try our hand at a friendly (also in multiplayer, up to four players), access the ~group games~, take a tour of the tutorial or dedicate ourselves to the tournament mode. The tutorial is immediately necessary to understand how the control system works, which clearly has been redesigned for the Wii version, while the ~group games~ consist of three simple minigames: the first two revolve around the conquest of the ~keys ~, assigned on the basis of our abilities in the various situations, the third is a sort of ~survival~ in which we must face a large number of opponents in sequence. It is the tournament mode that represents the most substantial part of the game, with a series of events that you can participate in and that are unlocked as you go. Anyone who has tried Top Spin 3 on Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3, however, cannot fail to notice the lack of career mode, which guaranteed much more lasting and thick entertainment. Unfortunately, this defection is accompanied by others: the number of tennis players on the Wii is lower than in the other versions (we are about fifteen real players, ten males and five females), but above all, online multiplayer has not been implemented, which would certainly increased longevity. The interface relies on the Wii-mote's pointing system for mode selection and character selection, which must be ~drag~ from its card to the left side of the screen. As usual, each tennis player is endowed with peculiar skills which on paper should change our approach to matches, but which in reality do not translate into who knows what differences during the exchanges, thanks to the exaggerated slowness of the action. But let's go in order... Each tennis player is endowed with peculiar skills which on paper should change our approach to matches, but which in reality do not translate into who knows what differences during the exchanges, thanks to the exaggerated slowness of the action. The control system As mentioned above, this version of Top Spin 3 features a redesigned control system for Wii-Mote and Nunchuck operation. Everyone understands how tennis works in Wii Sports (and how it should work on Wii, in general) so let's break the bad news first: racket movement doesn't happen in real time to controller movement. Let's also say that the developers have reached a sort of compromise with respect to the ~standard~ controls of Top Spin, a compromise that unfortunately looks a lot like what usually happens for multiplatform products that also arrive on the Nintendo console. We can control the character by moving the Nunchuck's analog stick, and the same stick is tilted to determine the angle of the shot, which therefore has nothing to do with motion detection. The Wii-mote (to be grasped ~sideways~, who knows why...) is shaken to hit the ball, with a maneuver divided into two phases: an initial shake (followed by a ~confirmation~ vibration) to set the shot, a second shake to execute it. It is possible to apply more or less power to the swing depending on whether you move the controller together with the character, but unfortunately this procedure is easier said than done, unless you are in a very quiet phase of the exchange. In theory, ~swiping~ the Wii-Mote from right to left or vice versa should translate into a difference on the screen, but in practice the poor precision of the controls, in this sense, allows us to do what we want. It is also appropriate to point out the joke, which can be performed completely automatically (by pressing the Z button on the Nunchuck) or in mmanual, by holding down the C button and then ~tapping~ with the Wii-mote (stopping a visual indicator at the right moment), but always deciding the trajectory using the analog stick. Technical realization The graphics in Top Spin 3 for Wii are pretty much as to be expected. The polygonal models of the players are of decent quality, but betray their ~old gen~ nature during close-up shots. The problem, more than anything else, is that the tennis players all have the same physique, with few variations, and the traits that should make them faithful to their real counterparts are possibly limited to the height and details of the face. The best thing to see are the animations, obtained with the usual motion capture technique: the movements are numerous, realistic and convincing. Bearing in mind that the players on the field are the only things that move on the screen, something more could have been done, it is clear, but the result achieved by 2K Games in this sense is still decent. Definitely less has been done for the sound, which on the one hand offers a couple of ~signature~ songs for the soundtrack, reproduced with a quality that leaves much to be desired, on the other hand the typical effects of the series, which mix with the phases ~silent~ creating a certain atmosphere, but without adding anything new to a now worn-out script. The Nintendo DS version The only portable version of Top Spin 3 (which is not available for PSP, in fact) boasts the same modes present on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, so it is possible to try your hand at the quick game, the tournament, the career and the minigames. The latter are eight (to be unlocked gradually, each with three difficulty levels), and they see us involved in skill tests of various types. As for the career mode, we will have to create a character from scratch by choosing the color of the skin, the clothing, the nationality, the style of play and the ~noisiness~ during the exchanges. Once ready, we'll take the field to face a sequence of matches, with the aim of becoming champions in the shortest possible time. Once on the pitch, we will be able to easily become familiar with a simple and immediate control system, which does not exploit the specific characteristics of the Nintendo DS in any way and which uses the d-pad and buttons to hit the ball and determine the trajectory of the shots. The default view is from behind the player, but from the pause screen we can decide to change it in favor of a shot from above, less original but certainly more practical. Playability is the classic one of Top Spin, with shots that must be ~prepared~ before impact, and the degree of difficulty is revealed to be quite high right from the start: it is better to start at an easy level and gradually increase, if you don't want to run into in frustrating episodes... Technically, huge strides have been made since the conversion of Top Spin 2, especially with regard to frame rate stability (which shows some uncertainty only in predetermined scenes), while the sound sector remains essential. Unfortunately, online multiplayer is missing, but in general this conversion for the dual-screen console is more than discreet, certainly recommended for those looking for a tennis simulation rich in substance. SCORE: 7.5 Comment Unfortunately, the appointment with tennis on Wii has once again been postponed: Top Spin 3 is not the game that many people were waiting for, and this for a whole series of reasons. Firstly, the control system is typical of cross-platform products, that is, it uses the shake of the Wii-mote for certain actions but without boasting a correspondence between the movements between player and character. It's something that Nintendo has implemented in a title as simple as Wii Sports, why are we still waiting for third parties to do the same? Secondly, we are faced with an evidently ~reduced~ version compared to the others, which lacks the career mode as well as online multiplayer. Finally, the action is too, too slow to engage in the way a tennis game should. Ultimately, Top Spin 3 for Wii is just a decent title, to buy only if you are really passionate about the genre and you are bored with Wii Sports games. Pros Good animations Decent number of modes Simple control system... Cons ...but not what was expected Lack of career and online multiplayer Action too slow", "date": "2008-07-22", "grade": null}
