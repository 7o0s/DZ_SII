Among others, titles that take a famous setting and use it as a setting to create alternative derivatives of well-loved and well-known universes come to light, this for example is the genesis of RedFaction: Battlegrounds. Twin Stick Lovers The new THQ title, available via Xbox Live at the price of 800 MP, doesn't have much to do with the progenitor of the Red Faction series other than the universe in which it is set. We are therefore not in the presence of a third-person shooter but quite another. Set in the boundless lands of Mars we are faced with a combat game between heavy vehicles in closed arenas full of details. Red Faction: Battlegrounds responds to the classic canons of the Twin Stick Shooter (the control system already seen in Geometry Wars) by putting us at the wheel of heavy means of destruction, whether they are dune buggies or exploration trucks up to devastating tanks and fast vehicles robotics. The THQ game is mainly oriented towards online and local multiplayer since the single player is limited to only 15 missions which also serve as a long tutorial, perfect for fully understanding the characteristics of the challenges that it will be possible to face against one's friends. In the 15 schemes, which it is necessary to overcome, among other things, to unlock a few points for our gamertag, the offer that the title proposes is fully re-proposed, in essence it is a question of three different challenge modes and a fourth alternative . They range from the classic capture the flag, in which speed is evidently the master, to the survival mode, to the attack against both inanimate opponents and vehicles guided by the AI. Each mission has a time limit that indicates whether or not the challenge will be passed, the more we resist or the faster we will be, the better our placement in the world rankings and against our online friends will be. To underline the quality of our placement will be the bronze, silver and gold medals awarded after the completion of the level. As we progress and as our skill increases we will have the possibility to unlock new vehicles and upgrades for the cars, capable of making them even more destructive. Xbox 360 goals The 200 points available are divided into 12 objectives divided between single player, online and local multiplayer games. It will be necessary to complete all 15 proposed challenges, obtain a high rank as fighters on the field and slaughter players on Xbox Live. Single and Multiplayer A detail that we haven't dealt with yet is that of the visual setting that has been given to the game; the clashes, as anticipated, always take place within arenas, rich in detail and destructible elements, framed from a bird's eye view. The real problem is precisely the type of view or rather the way in which the camera unintelligently often zooms in on some vehicles, making the scene lose the general shot. The THQ title is already particularly chaotic due to last-gasp fights and incredible explosions of the scenario, but if the camera also skips, the clashes become impossible to manage. The control system works quite well even if we would have preferred a slightly more precise response from the vehicles and better management of the fire, it is almost useless in fact to change the method to direct the shots, from the simple pressure of the stick to the combination with the trigger, unfortunately it does not serve to make it more precise. As for the vehicles, such as mining ATVs, rovers or robots, each one has its own specific characteristics with strengths and weaknesses that make the clashes fairly balanced even if we have noticed a prevalence of strength in all vehicles that mount long-range weapons . To make the challenge and the entire gameplay less monotonous, there are secondary weapons, such as pressure mines and radio-controlled mines capable of devastating the unfortunate opponent in one fell swoop. A separate mention deserves the Gravitational Bomb capable of attracting any vehicle in the vicinity (even ours!) and disintegrating it. If from this description you have got a good idea of the THQ title, we can only confirm it, too bad that all the positive intentions are then thwarted by the online sector in which the matches become decidedly frustrating and too chaotic due evidentlyand of arenas that are too small and weapons that are too strong. There is no room for strategy, online it's just a continuous and random free-for-all with the sole aim of total devastation.", "date": "2011-04-27", "grade": "5.0"}
