Tricky topics The protagonist of the game is called... what's the name of the protagonist? Raelin. Excuse us, but in our bad memory her name ended up buried among all those boobs (current rating: 2). No, really, Sakura Fantasy Chapter 1 is the story of this girl who trains to become a knight and who happens to be a seer as well. What does he use his power for? To see her friends getting naked. Too bad that at one point he discovers that a terrible threat hangs over the city. Will the underpantsed champion be able to save everyone? Obviously yes, but not before having pleased a half-nymphomaniac empress and a commander in a uniform designed by Wicked Weasel (current vote: 3)? And will we be able to survive in this world of busty women who can't keep cleavage at bay? Hard to tell. Let's be clear: the problem here is not eroticism. Indeed, we are perfectly aware that sex, explicit or suggested, is almost fundamental for visual novels. It is not obligatory, but there is no doubt that it is often present, sometimes even in the most demanding and profound works. Honestly, we are also a little tired of seeing the nakedness of the human body demonized by people who then get excited by watching rivers of blood flow, but that's not the point. The point is that in a certain scene the commander and the protagonist undress and take a bath in chocolate (current rating: 4.5). Do you understand that it seems to be faced with the Japanese equivalent of a film by Boldi and De Sica, with continuous winks and unlikely situations, unfortunately very poorly written? Is there something more than boobs in Sakura Fantasy Chapter 1? Fifth cup C The story told by Sakura Fantasy Chapter 1 is so thin, despite the many requests to the player to make choices, that often the texts seem stretched so as to make everything last a certain time, in order to justify the price paid. The local stylist must be a very interesting person No, we are not dealing with a verbose work in pure Japanese style, but with a dodgy writing, in which some situations are re-proposed several times to lengthen the broth, so as to accompany the gaze towards the next nude image and the hand down belly (current grade: 5.5). We were saying a few lines above that there are also choices to be made. Let's clarify the matter. Sakura Fantasy Chapter 1 is a pure visual novel in which you spend the handful of hours that last above all reading and looking at the drawings, the latter technically well done (if you like the genre, of course). Every now and then you are asked to decide what to do to move the story forward. For example, should one be indifferent or interested in the dramas of a friend? Who can tell. The important thing is that you understand that in any case you won't change an iota of the plot and at most you will get a few more or less jokes or a different erotic aspect. For example, if you help a noblewoman find her kitten then you'll see her smear it on her udders (current rating: 6.5), while if you go back to the barracks you'll live in sadness for the rest of your days. In one case you have to choose quite explicitly with whom to have Raelin slang (current grade: 8), but that's really all. Sure, this time Winged Cloud has abounded with drawings and the price of Sakura Fantasy Chapter 1 is honest for the quantity... let's say better, for the greatness of the contents. It is definitely better than the previous Sakuras. The important thing is to understand what a similar product aims at, to decide whether or not it makes sense to think about buying it. Maybe avoid making comparisons with much more noble visual novels, which Raelin is not even worthy of tying her shoes... also because she wouldn't be able to see them, given the windowsills she drags around all day.", "date": "2015-06-12", "grade": "4.5"}
