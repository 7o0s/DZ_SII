Titanfall behaves in the exact opposite way: if you have seen trailers or gameplay of Respawn Entertainment's debut title, you should already know everything you need to understand if this multiplayer competitive shooter is suitable for your taste buds or not. Direct as a bullet to the head, it has the rare ability to conquer in five seconds by mixing thrilling runs, those on the walls and roofs of maps designed to be navigated even vertically, with more tactical moments, when you control the devastating but all in all fragile war machines summoned from the sky when needed. Fun is the adjective that does justice to this experience, recommended to all those who want an adrenaline rush straight into their chest. Unfinished, perhaps with a pinch of pique, is the adjective that justifies why at the bottom of the page the vote does not reach other peaks. We played it for about fifteen hours at an event that Electronic Arts organized in London in view of the reviews. Titanfall is the multiplayer shooter you (probably) want to play in 2014 Breathless Pad in hand, the revelation is almost immediate: running towards the enemy is the most trivial option that Titanfall offers the player; instead, it invites him to sprint to a wall, jump, use the jetpack to conquer even higher peaks and then reach another surface on which to start vaulting again. In between there are enemies to be killed, to be surprised by coming from the most unexpected directions, and bases or flags to be conquered. But in between, above all, there are the huge Titans who at the right time, if called and used carefully, can break the mold and change the fate of a match. Climbing aboard the narrow cockpit of these mechs puts you in an interesting but awkward position: the weapons used are powerful, the possible objectives are many, but at the same time all attention converges on you and although the side shot is a one of the most formidable weapons at your disposal while aboard, it only takes a couple of turns in the wrong direction to find yourself being blasted to death by groups of adversaries or, even more humiliating, getting caught by an enemy clinging to the cockpit. A situation from which you can only get out with the right readiness. The balance between flying in mid-air and walking in his metal armor was a tricky one to strike, but Infinity Ward's team of veterans have nailed it. Each of the three possible encounters - on the ground, between Titans or mixing the two - has a different kind of depth and required skills that must be mastered. On foot, speed and reflexes count, but knowledge of the map is also essential because with each new passage you realize that there is an even higher ceiling to reach and more complex evolutions to perform. The head-to-head between the giant robots is another story altogether, they go on longer but tend to speed up, for the worse, when things start to go wrong. After a few games, for example, you realize that often if you have the repelling shield equipped, the best option is not to shoot first; the same goes for the use of melee shots, devastating but cause trouble when they miss the target leaving us uncovered. The encounter-clash between pilots and those on foot combines the best of both approaches, with often unexpected results. The mechanics that form the basis of Titanfall are not new in an absolute sense, so much so that they are immediate, but all together they are an invitation to get back into the game after a few too many first-person shooters that aspire to very similar results. A bit like in Halo, here the jumping mechanic is well combined with the pad - we tried it on Xbox One - and we feel that a really good job has been done on the controls to ensure that the game is accessible but maintained a very good degree of depth. The lack of environmental interaction is not a problem precisely because one of the tastiest aspects is to learn to know every secret of the arenas, to move lightly and strike suddenly before disappearing, or join a couple of allies equipped with Titans to take by surprise the enemy team and route them. A whole other story That Titanfall was a title devoted body and soul to multiplayer we knew it from the time of the announcement. That's why we were amazed when we were given a substantial ~review guide~ with all the useful references and almost six pages dedicated to the narrative background written to support the futuristic babattles between factions. A lot of effort tells of distant worlds, showdowns and heroic characters, but above all it puts itself at the service of two short campaigns to be crossed also in multiplayer facing another team made up of flesh and blood players. It is, to get to the point, two playlists made up of nine predefined games and punctuated by dialogues and a few cutscenes, which entertain for about three hours in total and should serve to introduce the gaming experience as well as the universe narrative of the series. The problem, in addition to the almost total absence of distinctive elements compared to normal classified challenges, is that it is a skeleton that is really too thin to rise from the status of a simple filler. Furthermore, they do nothing to teach how to play - a task delegated to a tutorial, the same as in the beta - and end up being only preparatory to the acquisition of the last two Titan models, the Strider and the Ogre. A pity because there was the potential to create something original and better orchestrated, or more resources could have been concentrated to enrich the true beating heart of the offer: traditional competitive matches. Respawn Entertainment has chosen a package of rather standard modes, certain of being able to add a new nuance to each of them thanks to a gameplay that is objectively different from the usual. Hence, the revised and corrected versions of absolute classics such as Capture the Flag and Territories, the latter called Hardpoint Domination, acquire a different dimension from the usual and ask to relearn the rules and tactics that have accompanied us throughout the history of shooters in first person. In Last Titan Standing all the pilots instead start aboard their own vehicle, contrary to what usually happens, and each round ends when the last Titan of a team is shot down. Without respawn, things become more delicate, but the possibility of continuing to play on foot once your tank is destroyed, provided you obviously survive, makes this kind of game less frustrating and obvious. Finally, Pilot Hunter and Attrition are two variants of the immortal deathmatch but where in the first case only the killings of the pilots are taken into account, as per the title, in the second the destruction of the Titans and the elimination of non-player characters who are join each of the two teams. In this regard, their addition helps to keep the pace sustained and fill maps crossed by a relatively low total of users, twelve, but they rarely really affect the progress of the matches. The set of modalities entertained us properly but we cannot help but admit a slight disappointment for not having seen some more, but above all for the absence of completely original ideas: these are variations on the theme, however well done , and Respawn Entertainment should have come up with at least one completely new idea out of the hat. Not an impossible task given the very valid starting point. On the other hand, one cannot complain about the quantity of maps created by American designers, fourteen in total, ranging from futuristic military bases to planets populated by gigantic prehistoric animals, from the gray urban area of Angel City to centers made up of shacks and dilapidated buildings . Each arena has a precise alternation of internal and external spaces, to allow both pilots and their Titans to move and have sufficient room to maneuver, but no two are alike and it will take a long time to master them all. Something is still missing as regards the options: Titanfall is not currently a game ready to open up to the audience of e-sports enthusiasts (the spectator mode is lacking, for example) but the choices to create private matches and to rebalance the team when multiple members of the same team leave the lobby. Some of these improvements, it has been announced, will arrive after the launch but for now it will happen to play and notice certain absences that occasionally make you turn up your nose. Power under control An inevitable aspect for modern shooters is that linked to the personalization of one's gaming experience. Also in Titanfall you acquire points and climb levels, a preparatory path to unlocking weapons and skills with which to customize your loadouts. Pilots can count on primary and secondary guns, as well as anti-Titan guns and explosives, but above all they acquire over time a series of possibilities that drastically increase the quality of their interaction with the scenario and other players. Power ups are hidden among the Tactical Abilitiesable to make us faster, invisible or to observe other players through walls for short amounts of time. The Kits have less overturning effects on the strategies adopted, improving movement statistics, damage and life points or activating extra secondary powers, but all together they offer a considerable margin of choice. Being quieter and sticking to the walls longer are ideal qualities for games like Capture the Flag, where approaching the opponent's base and a quick escape are essential. On the contrary, the ability to explode when killed or the greater explosive power of grenades and mines gives precious extra kills if necessary. In short, there is something for each approach, and if it can be said that the equipment is not the most extensive ever, it must be admitted that there are plenty of options plus some nice ideas, such as the Smart Pistol with its remote-controlled shots. A decidedly not simple contraption to use at its best. Among other things, this speech must be repeated for the Titans: the three basic exoskeletons, ie Atlas, Ogre and Strider respond to as many different settings, from the medium armored and fast one up to the two extremes of resistance and speed, but they only represent the 'start. Plasma rifles, missile launchers and machine guns, smoke screens crossed by energy discharges, shields that can be configured at will on the pitch and protective barriers capable of trapping and re-throwing other people's shots back to the sender give enough variety in themselves to keep busy long before finding the solutions that best suit your style. Finally, by winning the games, positioning yourself high in the end-of-match rankings and completing the objectives, you get special cards that can be equipped - up to a maximum of three - and used during the challenges. Whether it's acquiring the version of a weapon on steroids, taking on the appearance of a non-player character, guaranteeing an instant respawn or having unlimited grenades, just to name a few, cards must be used with care because they last the time of a life and once spent are lost forever, forcing us to wait to draw them again to have them available again. A very interesting system that inevitably ends up rewarding experience and the ability to read each situation in advance. Xbox One goals A total of 35 goals offers the usual 1000 points for the most consistent and capable players. The requests range from winning a given number of matches for each mode to completing the two campaigns, from performing certain maneuvers up to reaching the level cap, set at 50. In short, it will take some time to unlock them all and the internal objective system, not unlike that of many other competitive shooters, will give a hard time to those who want to continue to test themselves. A vintage engine As anyone who has followed the development of Titanfall will know, the game uses the Source engine developed by Valve to stage the clashes between the forces of the Militia and the IMC. This is not a project of enormous technical complexity, but the artists have done a good job in defining the environments, the characters and above all the Titans. These are modeled with excellent attention to detail, referring to the typical stylistic paradigms of mechs but managing to have a personal touch that should remain engraved in the minds of the players. Details such as the animations created to get the pilot on board, contextual to the direction from which he comes, or to stage the destruction of the enemy vehicle, are really well done and satisfy the eye by rewarding the effort made to make evolutions worthy of the name . However, it must be said that on Xbox One there are some drops in fluidity and a certainly not stratospheric resolution is observed which especially impacts the scenarios, even if in general the experience runs smoothly and without major problems. A few minor flaws show that some time for further polishing wouldn't have hurt, but there aren't any issues too nagging or urgent to report.", "date": "2014-03-10", "grade": "8.5"}
