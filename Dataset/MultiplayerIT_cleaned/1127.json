{"name": "La Recensione di Martin Mystre: Operazione Dorian Gray", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/la-recensione-di-martin-mystere-operazione-dorian-gray.html", "text": "Inspired by the book of the same name (which for many is one of the best ever released), Operazione Dorian Gray is the new product of Artematica, the Italian software house, known to the general public above all thanks to the success achieved by Druuna - Morbus Gravis under the Microids label. With the latter title, Martin Mystre's game shares two decidedly important things: in fact, both protagonists are originally comic book characters, and both productions should be classified as typical graphic adventures (or, if you prefer, with the wording ~point and click~). . It all began in Martin's residence (in Washington News 3/A, Greenwich Village area, New York City. MM is one of the few comic book characters of whom everything is truly known: in addition to his address, also his year of birth which it's 1942... so he's a splendid fifty years old!) when the home phone rings in the early morning: it's Inspector Travis who informs him of a somewhat mysterious murder. The rather illustrious victim is Professor Eulemberg, a researcher at MIT (the really existing Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and our detective immediately understands that there is more than one strange and mysterious thing to understand in this story. Without revealing anything so as not to spoil any surprises, I only say that practically none of the best-known characters of the series will be missing and that there will be a good number of rather unexpected twists and decidedly intriguing paranormal situations. So get ready to enter into perfect empathy with your digital alter ego and with the situations in which you go from register to register. It should be noted that various meta-referential elements of the Mystre universe have been inserted within the adventure, starting from the possible calls to its ~creator~ Alfredo Castelli or to Dylan Dog (but unfortunately for us he will not be the one to answer us) and to other situations that we don't want to reveal them so as not to take away the pleasure of finding them... Operation Dorian Gray is a typical point and click graphic adventure that comes with a very simple and manageable interface As I wrote previously, Operation Dorian Gray is a typical point-and-click graphic adventure (therefore deny the rumors that spoke of possible action variants) which comes with a really simple and manageable interface: with a single term, decidedly user friendly ! In practice, for each interactive element (whether people, objects or environments) we will be able to choose the action (there are 4 in all: examine, use, speak and combine) that we want to perform with the right mouse button and then confirm our resolutions with the left button: nothing could be simpler! The inventory will always be recallable from the screen thanks to the small ~i~ at the bottom left, thus making it possible to complete the entire adventure without ever hitting the keyboard (except to recall the save menu). Without giving you any ~spoileta~ on the puzzles (for those who want the solution it is already online), we believe that the work done by the Artematica programmers is decidedly good: Martin Mystere, as tradition of the genre dictates, in some situations will prove to be rather difficult but we will never be faced with a total illogicality (or the hateful ~pixel searching~) in the resolution of the bottlenecks that the plot will put in front of us. The choice and variety of dialogues was also good: however, we were not convinced by the fact that only later will it be possible to understand that when all the possibilities for speaking will always remain active, it means that the conversation is not strictly necessary for the purposes of the plot. Initially this leaves a little surprised and only later will this difference become clear. But we're certainly not talking about a cardinal sin, far from it Another thumbs up is for the fine humorous component that Martin and others will give in various moments of the game: don't think you're laughing out loud but that touch of humor between a mystery and the other makes the pace decidedly pleasant. Multimedia Martin Moving on to the audiovisual aspect, the porting of Mystre to the world of videogames (actually some distant attempts were also made on 8 bits geological eras ago) happened decidedly well even though the fact of being a self-production restricted the possibilities to raise it to the status of ~blockbuster~ as the Syberia saga can be considered (just to stay in the same genre). The resolutely cartoonish scenarios recreate the universe of Mr Mystere in the best possible way Multimedia Martin Leaving aside therefore improbable comparisons, we can say that the decidedly ~cartoony~ scenarios manage to recreate the imaginative universe of Mr Mystre in the best possible way and that the animations and features (including the mascellona of MM even more accentuated) of the completely three-dimensional characters are decidedly well done. The sound component is even more excellent, both as regards the musical part with excellent background loops that are decidedly spot on, and for the reading of the dialogues with all the voice actors who have entered the part in a composed and successful way. Multimedia Martin Before leaving the comment, just an aside regarding longevity: I don't think anyone will be able to complete Operation Dorian Gray before 15 hours of play, not even the greatest instant puzzle solver in a graphic adventure . Then, as you know, it's quick to be proven wrong... The fact remains that for a title sold for the very low price of 19.99, we are dealing with a decidedly honest product also in terms of duration. Comment You will quickly understand that Martin Mistre is not a blockbuster full of breath-taking computer graphics sequences (like Syberia) or full of who knows what innovations in the field of graphic adventures, but the self-production of Artematica in its small she definitely managed to win us over. It may have been the glamor of an authentic legend such as Mistre, or the very ~cartoony~ aesthetic appeal, the decidedly user-friendly game interface, the logic of the puzzles (fortunately no obnoxious ~pixel searching~), a refined touch of humor , the plot full of twists and intriguing paranormal situations or the sensuality of the female protagonists present. For all these reasons, the fifteen hours spent in front of the monitor in the company of Martin, Java, Diana and company were really pleasant and fun, so much so that I was almost sorry at the time of the coveted conclusion. A title to be taken into decisive consideration (provided you have even the slightest positive attitude towards graphic adventures) then marketed at a price, 19.99, really low for a completely new game. Without overdoing it or trying to achieve impossible goals, we can only congratulate Artematica for having transported Martin Mistre on our PCs in the best possible way (always under the supervision of father Castelli). We hope that in the near future, the software house will also consider other Bonelli comics for the creation of new productions. I ~shoot~ two names: Nathan Never and Dylan Dog after appearing on the Amiga, many years ago... why not think about getting them back on our PCs? In the meantime, for the moment, let's enjoy the Detective of the Impossible Pros: Intriguing plot and user friendly game interface All the charm of the Martyn Mystere universe faithfully reproduced Very low price Remarkable game length Cons: No news and innovation of any kind Sequences in stripped-down computer graphics Point-and-click adventure games aren't for everyone BVZM! Born in the now distant 1982 from that beautiful head of Alfredo Castelli (perhaps one of the most important ~authorities~ for the world of comics in Italy and who personally supervised the videogame transposition of his ~creature~) and graphically created by Giancarlo Alessandrini, Martin Mystere is, immediately after the unattainable Dylan Dog and Tex Willer, the most famous and important character of the Bonelli house. UFO sightings, extrasensory powers, enigmas of history, archeology, science: the ~Detective of the Impossible~ investigates the many unsolved mysterious mysteries that populate Our Dear Old Earth in the company of his faithful assistant Java (unequivocal Neanderthal man , found by Martin in the cities of Diaphanous Shadows hidden among the inaccessible Hangar mountains in Mongolia) and of the splendid Diana, MM's eternal girlfriend. November 2004 will definitely be remembered as the month of the mysterious multimedia invasion given that in addition to the game I am about to present to you, Rai 2 simultaneously began programming a cartoon dedicated to our detective made in NY. And the fans can only welcome this news But now let's start talking about the video game", "date": "2004-11-25", "grade": null}
