Slaves to heavy technical limitations, until a few years ago developers had to make compromises and could not in any way claim to create a quality portable racer. Now things have changed: even mid-range mobile phones can handle increasingly complex polygonal graphics, as demonstrated by the 3D version of the spectacular Need for Speed Undercover created by EA Mobile. The same publisher has entrusted the development of Dakar Rally 2009 to Spiced Bits, and the team found itself having to redesign the product from scratch to make it more modern in a now rather competitive context. As often happens in these cases, the result may not be perfect but it still represents a starting point for the future... The game's start menu offers us three different modes: ~quick challenge~, ~time trial~ and ~championship~. In the first case we will find ourselves choosing one of the available tracks and we will be able to launch ourselves into a single race against three opponents controlled by the AI, while the ~stopwatch~ will see us repeat the same race several times in search of the ideal trajectories, to mark the fastest time. low as possible. Finally, the ~championship~ represents the fulcrum of Dakar Rally 2009 and is also the way in which we will be able to unlock new locations, through a now widely tested ~rewards~ system: when we unlock a track, it will also become available in the other mode. The control system is of the classic type, with automatic accelerator (thankfully) and without particular variations on the theme: there are no boosts or bullet times, it will be only us and our guide who will make the difference in the race. Unfortunately, the feeling is not the best as regards the handling of the car: the inputs are received by the game with guilty delay, therefore you have to anticipate the curves a lot and there is always the risk of acting too much on the buttons, obtaining an opposite effect to the desired one (steering too much instead of just). To this we must also add that the opponents appear really motivated and rarely miss the trajectories: we must prepare ourselves for a very demanding challenge. As mentioned at the beginning, mobile racing games can now boast truly spectacular graphics and Dakar Rally 2009 does everything possible to achieve a good visual impact, with mixed results. You can select your preferred view at any time (third-person or first-person), via the press of a button, and the tracks are quite rich and ~crowded~ in terms of background. To avoid any pop-up phenomena, the developers have designed the tracks to put the curves one after the other: a trick that worked in the days of Ridge Racer for PSone and which still proves useful today. The level of detail is good, the use of colors discreet. Our car is well made, even if we've seen it better, while unfortunately we notice an annoying ~chasm effect~ when the graphics scroll towards the screen, distorting badly. The sound is mediocre, without appeal, and is therefore largely deactivated.
