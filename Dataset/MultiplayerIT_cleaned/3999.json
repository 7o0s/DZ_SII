{"name": "Badland Brawl", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/badland-brawl-recensione.html", "text": "Badland Brawl offers a fascinating strategic experience, obtained by intelligently mixing elements taken from some of the most successful productions in the mobile sector. In the new Frogmind title we find the slingshot mechanism for launching units, inspired by the gameplay of Angry Birds, but also the progression based on collectible cards and the towers to be destroyed by Clash Royale; all in a two-dimensional context that often recalls the atmospheres and reversals in the face of the most famous brawlers. The formula is simple and immediate, and is illustrated through a quick and painless tutorial that takes us by the hand during the first few games. On the screen there are two opposing towers that launch themselves against a bit of everything, and the one who manages to destroy the opponent first wins. This, of course, is only an extreme synthesis of what happens in Badland Brawl, because behind these dynamics lies a considerable strategic depth, which starts from the deck in our possession and from the related units, all different and upgradeable on the basis of the loot obtained with every win. We will have small fast warriors or giant monsters, bombs of various sizes, devices that are used to project them quickly into the opponent's area, real meteors, spaceships loaded with TNT, arrows and even flying houses that guard the position by launching projectiles against those approaches. Putting units on the field consumes one or more portions of the energy bar at the bottom of the screen, which recharges over time. However, we will have to arrange the pieces manually, by throwing them using a slingshot that will place them in a different position on the battlefield. Gameplay and structure In short, after the success of Badland and Badland 2, the guys from Frogmind wanted to experience something very different, while recalling their most famous franchise in some situations. The combination of so many strategic mechanics works amazingly, and although the action seems a little slow at first, there is no doubt that the satisfaction of being able to push everything on the screen towards the enemy tower has a lot to do with the sensational comebacks of the best known brawlers. The fact that all this works in multiplayer, thanks to a real-time competitive online sector characterized by solid and very fast matchmaking, also says a lot about how many people have become attached to this new MOBA variant. The freemium aspects of the experience are limited to the nature and speed of unlocking the loot, without limiting in any way the number of matches or the general accessibility of the game, and this represents a huge advantage for those who want to try their hand at Badland Brawl without breaking the bank. money. The balancing of the matches, which at a certain point also open up to frenetic two-against-two confrontations, in fact seemed almost perfect to us, going to draw users of our same level within a path that will lead us to gradually discover new scenarios and to obtain new units, possibly organizing different decks to develop strategies based on speed and promptness or on patience and power. The facets of the gameplay are actually many and are only slightly soiled by a physical system which in its dynamics reveals the basic nature of the attack and movement routines of the units. From an artistic point of view, the references to the aforementioned Angry Birds are evident, but we are faced with a game with its own personality, strong in a comic and colorful style, with splendid scenarios as a backdrop to the action and a large number of different pawns, some with a very inspired design.", "date": "2018-10-19", "grade": "8.0"}
