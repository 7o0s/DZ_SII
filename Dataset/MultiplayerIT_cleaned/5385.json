Warner Bros. has seen fit to capitalize on this criminal undergrowth with the film Suicide Squad, and in the same way the mobile division of the multinational has taken advantage of the situation to launch a new title based on the Batman franchise on the App Store (and soon Google Play): Arkham, namely Batman: Arkham Underworld. The peculiarity of the game lies precisely in the fact that for once we do not control the Dark Knight, but his most bitter opponents, determined to conquer Gotham City neighborhood by neighborhood, fueling a furious struggle between clans for control of the territory and aiming to become the criminal gang of reference for the city. For the gameplay of Arkham Underworld, Turbine has drawn from different videogame genres: the control system refers to real-time strategy, the arrangement of the units instead follows the dictates of productions along the lines of Clash of Clans, but the fact of being able to control directly the villain of reference and to use a group of henchmen as ~minions~ brings to mind the MOBA. To this system for missions is added the usual care of the headquarters, which must be strengthened to prevent other users from attacking and plundering it while we are ~out and about~. Batman: Arkham Underworld is a solid and interesting strategy, albeit with some controversial aspects Suicide Squad Is our control center up to date? Does the lab allow you to upgrade characters? Have we ~beautified~ the lair enough to generate points-value? Or, more importantly, have we extended the vault to hold more cash? All these aspects must be carefully considered, trying to balance the resources earned on the field to obtain an effective team, made up of soldiers who are gradually unlocked and who have increasingly refined skills: we start with the minions who attack any opponent without distinction, for then move on to those that favor certain targets or to armored units that attract enemy fire to allow us to strike without suffering damage. After a few missions, a function is also added that is missing from casual strategic ones, namely the possibility of signaling a new objective for our minions on the map and therefore directing their movements, perhaps avoiding that they go to activate an alarm (thus leading to the arrival of the police) or to face prematurely a gathering that we intended to avoid. The missions must be selected on the Gotham map, which is progressively enriched with available areas, just as the list of super villains that are part of our roster becomes gradually richer: having a certain amount of them guarantees being able to play without waiting, given that at game over the character ends up in prison and you have to wait a while for it to become available again. As far as gameplay is concerned, the ~touch and go~ mechanics are the traditional ones, there are many ambushes behind which the enemies take cover to shoot at us and the special abilities of each villain are therefore fundamental, which can be upgraded together with passive abilities. Certainly the basic artificial intelligence of our companions often and willingly leads to facing the bulk of the levels in solitude, perhaps using certain tricks to distract the objectives before hitting them; even if the further you go, the more multifaceted the experience becomes, although this progression goes hand in hand with an emphasis on grinding and monetization dynamics. Graphically, the developers have done a fairly good job, the characters are recognizable but the maps tend to be quite anonymous and repetitive, while on the sound front the music from the Batman: Arkham series and a set of good English dialogues stand out.", "date": "2016-07-27", "grade": "7.5"}
