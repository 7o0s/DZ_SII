{"name": "NBA Live 08", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nba-live-08.html", "text": "Making sports games for mobile is far from easy. Indeed, to be honest, it is probably the most difficult genre to render well in the mobile sector, not so much for the technical difficulties (by now mobile phones are able to manage the movement of the various members of a team on the screen), but for the practices, linked to a control system that inevitably becomes cumbersome. Many development teams have been faced with this problem, sometimes finding solutions to circumvent it or failing miserably in the attempt. In this case, the enormous experience of a manufacturer like EA Sports has provided an effective solution to the age-old question of controls: is it difficult to control players at speed? Ok, so let's slow down the action! Mind you, NBA Live 08 is not a basketball game that takes place in slow motion, far from it. It just slows down, intelligently, when you need to make quick decisions. In this case, when we have to pass the ball to a teammate, a sort of ~bullet time~ starts, with visual indicators that appear on the screen and show us which direction of the joystick to press to pass to one of the other four team members. An approach of this type puts us in a position to use the cellphone input system at will: we can base our actions on the individual, moving the player in possession of the ball as far as we can, or we can opt for a strategy based on the number, aimed at take advantage of gaps in the opposing defense. Shooting is based on a loading system: you have to hold down button 5, fill the power bar as much as desired and finally release for the shot to start. As regards the defensive phase, things take place in the same way: a direction of the joystick to select the player in the best position, then the 5 button to block or try to steal the ball. The game allows us to organize the matches in the way we want, modifying their duration and level of difficulty within three different modes, which cover any need a fan of the genre may have. At the end of each match, personal statistics are also displayed, in addition to any rankings. The game, as mentioned, is available in both a 3D and a 2D version, with purely aesthetic differences: the first boasts polygonal graphics, more or less fluid depending on the power of the mobile phone, and a third person view; the second has a more classic setting, with a side view of the field. In both cases, the developers have done a great job: the players are not faithful to their real-life counterparts, it is clear, but they move convincingly and boast a good level of detail. The same can be said for the field, while the sound sector suffers not only from a general poverty of sounds, but also from an approximate realization of the same. PRO Playable and fun Rich game modes Technically excellent AGAINST The 3D version requires a high-end mobile phone Poor sound Improveable AI", "date": "2008-03-13", "grade": "S.V."}
