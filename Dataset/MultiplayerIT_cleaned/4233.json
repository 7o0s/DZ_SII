The guys from Another Place, under the aegis of Kongregate, have however thought of creating a variation on the theme, not taking themselves too seriously, and the result is a title that follows the irreverent atmospheres of The Incredibles, while providing us with a team of heroes, The Sentinels, with whom there is little to joke. The team members are in fact superhuman beings, endowed with deadly powers based on strength, the ability to fly, psychic abilities, energy control and more. From this point of view, the work done by the development team appears impeccable: the bright colors of the scenarios, the excellent polygonal models of the characters (with the exaggerated proportions that we know well, huge chests and small legs), the set of animations at their disposal , the spectacular moves that make up its repertoire and even the variety of enemies in the many campaign missions draw the picture of a truly rich and well-crafted product, which succeeds in the arduous task of sensibly balancing the needs of a freemium model that allows you to play for several minutes before the ~tickets~ run out, reloading them in a short time, and to unlock new content and characters even without putting a hand in your wallet. It's my turn! The BattleHand Heroes formula, as mentioned, is the one that mobile RPG enthusiasts know well, with group battles governed by a turn-based system. Within different locations, with an increasing degree of difficulty, our team will have to deal with the most disparate enemies, whether they are human criminals or androids, and put them out of the game using the cards that are randomly draw from each hero's deck. Mr. Sunshine, the Superman of the situation, can, for example, deliver flying punches, but also instantly obtain steel beams, sofas or road signs to slam into the opponents' faces, while for example Kitty Karma uses martial arts and some light tools to win fights. In all cases there is an indicator which, once filled, allows the hero of the moment to perform a spectacular special and inflict massive damage on his targets. The mechanics of the gameplay are regulated by the inevitable system of prevalence, which refers to five elements, one more effective than the other, but in the end it is strategic shrewdness that determines victory in the more advanced and complex stages of the campaign , which manages not to become repetitive in a short time despite the fact that the duels are very similar to each other. Between one mission and another, it is possible to use the varied loot obtained to upgrade the cards in the deck, equip new ones, level up the heroes, obtain others and so on, within a very well thought-out structure, which includes also an arena for asynchronous multiplayer battles and the inevitable guilds to join for extra rewards.", "date": "2018-05-29", "grade": "8.2"}
