The popularity of various Lightning McQueen, Carl Tools, Sally Carrera, etc. however, it has not been exploited properly in the videogame field, given that there are few tie-ins and of poor quality, as unfortunately often happens. Cars: Veloci come Saetta does not constitute a real change of course from this point of view, in the sense that we are not dealing with an extraordinary title in terms of gameplay and structure, but the curious union between casual simulation and ~electric track~ has its own because, the technical realization is excellent and the freemium mechanisms that regulate the offer seemed to us to be fairly permissive; with the now usual exception of ~action points~, which limit the duration of the matches and force you to wait a few minutes before being able to try your hand at a new match. The first stages of the game see us familiarize ourselves with the course phase, which works as a sort of ~electric track~ in which you have to act on the accelerator only, keeping it pressed on the straights and releasing it on the tightest bends, pressing again where indicated for get an extra boost. When there are alternative sections on the track, such as loops, banked corners, bumps and so on, we are asked to make quick slides on the screen to successfully complete the acrobatic maneuvers and remain competitive in terms of speed. Interesting solutions, which are developed with a view to a single player campaign based on the release of new characters, a campaign in which, however, the challenge factor is managed in a very ... casual way. Cars: Lightning Fast offers a nice mix of casual simulation and ~electric track~ style racing The city of cars The structure of Cars: Fast as Lightning is composed of two ~souls~. The first is that of racing, which takes place on different circuits depending on the character we use, following the traditional increase in difficulty based on power-ups (it is indicated when a challenge is ~impossible~, for example, by sending us back to the garage for an upgrade) and introducing the possibility of modifying the track by inserting not only embellishments such as marquees, loudspeakers and giant screens, but also personally managing the placement of the alternative sections that we have just talked about. The second part is that of the casual simulation, which takes place within the city of machines, a place that we have the task of growing by building new businesses and then collecting the money they produce each tot, as well as by completing simple missions that involve the use of certain buildings or the expansion of the territory itself. Operations that require money in order to be performed, but which fortunately are satisfied with the virtual one: just run a few more races or wait for the production of extra money so that you can afford that new shop or that particular object and move forward in the story. even if the most hasty will still be able to spend their real money through the inevitable in-app purchases. The course part is certainly the most successful of Cars: Veloci come Saetta, even if it lacks a real degree of challenge and winks a little too much at a very young audience. Beyond this, it is the excellent technical sector that really keeps the Gameloft product afloat, which offers graphics and sound perfectly adhering to Disney Pixar animated films as regards the rendering of the characters, the bright colors, the fluidity and comic atmospheres. All things that fans of the saga will appreciate.", "date": "2014-10-13", "grade": "7.0"}
