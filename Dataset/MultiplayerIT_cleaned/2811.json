It was one of those cases in which public success is generated almost exclusively by word of mouth: more and more people have thought of giving it a chance and there is no doubt that the Bend Studio guys have been very good at reaching the hearts of fans. That the team is working on a second chapter seems almost obvious to us, but in the meantime they have not been idle and, in view of PS5, Days Gone is updated and brings with it a whole series of interesting improvements, along the lines of what Sucker Punch did with Ghost of Tsushima. Let's see how it performs in our PS5 review. The hinterland and the zombies Days Gone tells a gritty story. It does not always splendidly and perhaps even dwells too much with a campaign that racks its brains over itself and arrives at the most interesting phases after a not inconsiderable period of slack. Despite this, it is also a huge game: a boundless open world, characterized by the reproduction of a rural and dirty America as few other times it has been represented. The ~stories~, as the Days Gone missions are called, explicitly tell the reality of a life made of hardship, of the return of something very close to a state of nature where a zombie apocalypse has ruined everything and lowered the minimum value of life. Although we are not talking about a timeless masterpiece, probably also plagued by a market now full of titles that exploit the zombie apocalypse to tell a story of pain and survival, Days Gone nonetheless represents an extraordinary return by Bend Studio to triple A productions and we can only be happy about it. The PS5 patch Bend Studio was the first of the teams to launch its patch dedicated to PlayStation 5 these days. We know well how the amount of zombies on the screen and the excited situations didn't help the game to give its best on PS4: not case even a postponement of almost a year on the roadmap had highlighted some problems in better managing the technical mass on a console squeezed to its limit. This patch finally allows you to give breathing space to an experience that really needed a revision from the point in terms of performance, finally bringing the frame rate to 60fps and introducing a dynamic resolution that reaches up to 4K and which, in our experience in recent hours, seemed to us to be sufficiently stable. These changes are so evident in the moto stages that it's really hard to believe you've digested those sections on PS4. In fact, the parts riding their own racing car were the ones most tormented by a non-constant fluidity and often below the bearable. All these problems now seem a very distant memory and to make everything even more interesting there are also the loads, damned reduced compared to the first release. Days Gone has never shone from this point of view and, especially when it comes to the first start, expectations easily reached the minute. It is true that, as is increasingly the case for open worlds, it was a single loading capable of avoiding making the players wait further during the sessions, but finding yourself halving it thanks to the Sony SSD is a pleasure which is still worth living. As with Ghost of Tsushima, this change is not radical and highlights how the real revolution exists only and exclusively on those titles already designed for the new technology. Nonetheless, it remains a not negligible positive detail that helps make the PS5 version of Days Gone the best on the market. Plus Collection And if all this weren't enough, we could have fun talking to you about how this title has been present since the launch day of the console also for all those who are subscribed to PlayStation Plus. It is no coincidence, in fact, that Sony has decided to insert the work of Bend Studio among the twenty games available on day one, redeemable and playable without any type of limit as long as you remain subscribed to the service. A further added value for a title that, after some time, could still give some joy and healthy entertainment, also given the longevity and the amount of possible situations to experience.", "date": "2020-11-08", "grade": "8.0"}
