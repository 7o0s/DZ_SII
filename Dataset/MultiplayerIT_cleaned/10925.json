{"name": "Galactic Civilizations II: Endless Universe - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/galactic-civilizations-ii-endless-universe-recensione.html", "text": "Two and a half years have passed since Galactic Civilizations II: Dread Lords landed on PC screens, enjoying considerable critical and, in part, public success. It's been a triumphal ride for indie developer/publisher Stardock since then, culminating in the strategy of the year Sins of a Solar Empire, made ~the old-fashioned way~ in collaboration with Ironclad. However, work on the second chapter of GalCiv also continued, limited however to the overseas market only: Dark Avatar was released in February 2007, while last April it was the turn of the latest expansion Twilight of the Arnor. Both, together with the original title necessary to play them, have been enclosed in this complete edition which has also arrived on the Italian market thanks to the Halifax distributor and rightly called Endless Universe. Dark Avatars The first expansion pack represented an important turning point in the evolution of GalCiv: for the admission of Brad Wardell, president of Stardock, the programmers wanted to implement the suggestions received from the community right away rather than waiting for the third episode of the saga. In fact, the amount of improvements present was such as to involve every aspect of the game. Let's start immediately with the revision of artificial intelligence, one of the flagships of Dread Lords: it seemed impossible to make it even more realistic but you have to take your hat off to such acuity. On more than one occasion we happened to be amazed by noting the decisions made by the CPU: a level of perfection such as to make the lack of multiplayer implementation invoked by various users less bitter. Even the graphics have been subject to a heavy facelift, although certainly less radical than the care of polygons made by subsequent revisions. The other features enrich the overall gaming experience, making it more complete without naturally distorting the perfect alchemy obtained right away. First of all the impossibility of colonizing any planet from the beginning: in this way the typical modus operandi of the original title was eliminated at the root, in which one of the tactics most adopted by the players was to conquer during the first rounds as many territories to ensure an excellent economic basis. Furthermore, the superskills with which each race has been endowed deserve to be remembered (some receive bonuses in economic fields, others in diplomacy and so on). Other novelties inherent in Dark Avatar are the mega-events, the random events of Civilization (epidemics, civil wars, and the like), capable of reshuffling the cards on the table by adding a touch of unpredictability to each game and espionage, a practice vault borrowed from Sid Meier's opera magna. The possibility of stealing secrets from opponents was also present in Dread Lords, but free and much more limited: in this first expansion, however, secret agents are very expensive, even if unfortunately their failure will not negatively affect diplomatic relations between the various populations. The campaign tells of an interesting internal conflict within the Drengin race: within it a clan has developed, that of the Korath, which represents the quintessence of wickedness and whose sole purpose is to make the universe more peaceful by exterminating all living forms able to breathe. As the leader of the Drengin army, the player must ensure that so much potential slavery is not wasted. Twilight of the Arnor With this second expansion Stardock has succeeded in the difficult task of completing in all respects a series that had already bordered on perfection in the universe of turn-based strategy, or, to put it in a term very dear to colleagues across the Channel, 4X games . However, the starting points were of the highest level: in this sense Dark Avatar had done almost everything possible to make the game experience of the original Dread Lords total and - in this sense - the impact of Twilight of the Arnor on Galactic Civilizations is less strong than the previous expansion was. The efforts of the programmers have focused, once again, on the customization of the twelve races present: now each of them has its own technological tree, which is really impressive if you think about which branches the initial single one reached. In this way, other factions besides that of the Terrans, which appeared to be the most used by the players, also became much more attractive. This is the only really important change to report regarding the game system; Of secondary note is the introduction of a new victory condition called Ascension. In this modeity you have to conquer and control for a certain number of rounds of the strange crystals hidden in the universe. Paradoxically, this simple task seems to be one of the few to put the otherwise impeccable AI, further refined in the 2008 edition, on the ropes: rarely will PC-controlled opponents deign to look for such crystals and even less will they have the desire and time to exploit their characteristics. The pre-packaged campaign tells of the discovery, by the earthlings, of the last survivor of the ancient Arnor civilization, whose dictates will be essential to prevent the bad guys from taking over the galaxy. The graphic apparatus has undergone a real work of restoration, so as to make Twilight of the Arnor look like the third chapter of the Galactic Civilizations saga: a remarkable work that represents the real added value of this expansion. Finally, a treat for the hard core of the Stardock community: for the most extreme explorers, in fact, galaxies have been added so large that they can take up to 2,000(!) turns just to be crossed. Closing Generally it is not an easy task to judge packaged products, but in the case of Galactic Civilizations 2: Endless Universe the choice of vote was really easy. It is a collection that should not be missing in the collection of fans of strategic games, who will find bread for their teeth at least throughout the winter. The strengths of the original Dread Lords have been improved to the nth degree, with a perfect balance between the different races and an almost embarrassing possibility of customization. Stardock's motto ~play it how you want~ is respected to the letter in this edition of GalCiv2: the player can create maps, races, artificial intelligence and even ad hoc units. The only two flaws that we would like to point out are the lack of multiplayer mode and the fact that all the technical improvements can only be enjoyed by taking advantage of Twilight of the Arnor: it would have been nice if the programmers had updated the entire epic ~tout court~. But which version? The agreement with Kalypso, European publisher of Galactic Civilizations, has led to the creation of two compilations that could create confusion also because Stardock has in turn created as many for the North American market. Here is our guide to distinguish them (in brackets manufacturer and target market) - Gold Edition: The first collection, released in 2007, included Dread Lords and the Dark Avatar expansion (Stardock, North America) - Expansion Bundle: Includes only two expansions and requires the original game (Stardock, North America) - Endless Universe: Reviewed in this article, features the single player campaigns of Dark Avatar and Twilight of Arnor; the original Dread Lords campaign is still accessible, but the rules and AI from later versions are used (Kalypso, Europa) - Ultimate Edition: This DVD contains all three chapters separately and therefore the Dread Lords campaign can be played with the old rules (Kalypso, Europa) - Ultimate Bundle Pack: an all-inclusive version, comparable to the Ultimate Edition (Stardock, digital delivery) Comment It's not a game for everyone, we could say, paraphrasing the famous film by the Cohen brothers. Galactic Civilizations 2: Endless Universe is really a tough nut to crack for all lovers of the genre, from which, however, it is difficult to break away. With ~last shift~ syndrome elevated to the highest level we are sure that cold winter days will pass more quickly in the company of this collection, even if it will leave action lovers indifferent.Pro Challenging and long-lasting challenge All the GalCiv2 saga in one DVD Against Very long learning curve Lack of multiplayer PC - System Requirements Minimum requirements Operating System: Windows XP SP2 or Vista (32/64 bit) CPU: Intel Pentium or AMD Athlon 1GHz DirectX 9 compatible video card 256MB of RAM 1.5 GB of free disk space Test configuration CPU: Intel Core 2 Quad Q9450 (2.6GHz) 4GB of RAM Video Card: Radeon HD4850 Crossfire", "date": "2009-01-13", "grade": null}
