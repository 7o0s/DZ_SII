{"name": "Dark Messiah of Might and Magic: Elements - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dark-messiah-of-might-and-magic-elements-recensione.html", "text": "Structure Already simple in itself, Dark Messiah Elements is further simplified compared to the PC precursor. In fact, the main change concerns the need to select a class for one's character which delimits, on the basis of the choice, powers and possibilities during the course of the adventure. Eire, what in theory should be an addition, becomes a simplification since we see the little freedom granted to us sacrificed in the PC version where we had at least the possibility of shaping the character gradually, determining characteristics and choosing skills. This choice, being an already extremely linear title and certainly not a complex title, further mortifies a game structure that is certainly not rich. Therefore, bound to a class we should play a title whose replayability is almost nil, and this represents a serious obstacle for those who intend to experience the facets of the gameplay of magician, warrior, archer or priest. Not to mention that these facets are very limited since, as anticipated, these are not real classes but schematized shreds of the gaming experience granted in the original version of Dark Messiah. As in the original version, an alternative form of combat intervenes that gives us the possibility of fighting in close combat like furies. Unfortunately, tied to the pad and a combat system that does not exploit it at all, we find ourselves in the same situation in which a player who has chosen to face Elements with a warrior can find himself, and it all ends in the mechanical pressure of a key. Although some skills and weapons can be used by multiple classes, the combat remains anchored to the specific abilities of the chosen character. We are faced with a first-person Hack & Slash whose effectiveness is based on the use of the right skill at the right time. In short, the most classic. Weapons blessed against the undead, ice to freeze fast-moving enemies, and lightning to knock down fire-resistant enemies. A tested scheme but which, just to give a clear example, in Diablo is based on dozens of skills and dozens of enemies, while in Elements it has to be satisfied with a few real skills and four actual types of enemies. To worsen the gameplay sector, factors such as the poor adaptation to the pad, accompanied by a hint of automatic aiming that click and make the character seem in the grip of a Fever, intervene. As if that weren't enough, the distortion of the image has been accentuated, which emphasizes combat and jumps and which should give dynamism to the action. Unfortunately, the realization is approximate and causes the deformed image to end up causing the player only confusion and difficulty in understanding his position. These elements also invalidate the multiplayer which is then limited by the inadequate control system, killed by excessive slowness, and by modes that are now as old as the sun and by a series of bugs that cause crashes, white screens, textures that appear unexpectedly and whatnot. Form There are few doubts about the technical sector. We are faced with an average product that certainly cannot reach the average of the products currently available for Xbox 360. Unfortunately, the question goes beyond the use of an engine that is not new in any case, nor in its inadequate use, and touches choices like managing darkness and light sources in a dark area. It becomes difficult to distinguish any particular, and this effect can be sought, but it becomes difficult to think of a reasoned choice when you realize that there is no possibility to correct the gamma to ensure that the image does not cause problems for the poor gamer . To top it all off, washed out textures, objects that disappear and bugs that nail the character in unlikely positions. The management of the lights is saved, which does not eliminate the bad management of darkness, but at least it gives us some pleasant visuals and some textures, especially in city areas, manage to give a convincing look to the surface they represent. What we can't believe is that it's the same engine as Half Life 2 and, although Dark Messiah's environments are fairly populated by sensitive objects, a use of such a good engine at this level can only leave us perplexed. Comment Elements left us with a lot of doubts. It is certainly possible that a title gets worse during a conversion and it is plausible that a too dated title will not be retouched too much with the risk of spending too much to get too little. What does not seem possible is instead to take a series of paths that go in the opposite direction to the genesis itselfof this title. Elements does offer four classes but is impoverished on a structural level and the original title remains just the plot, identical, and the possibility of pushing the opponents by planting them against objects, throwing them under avalanches or hurling them into the void. Certainly this last part remains quite entertaining and during the course of the game some more vivid and lively moments emerge but it is too little to recommend Elements to those who are not abstinent from Fantasy and are not willing to turn a blind eye and sometimes even both in front of to the numerous defects of the title. Pros today fantasy pulls a lot you can kick opponents easy but almost funny bosses Cons poor and linear technically worse combat mortified and simplified compared to the PC version Goals Classic goals for a classic title. The canonical points for completing the game are divided according to checkpoints while a series of objectives depends on the number of opponents shot down using a particular skill branch. There are also some unlockable objectives by collecting well-hidden objects and recovering all, and by all I mean all, the weapons in the game. Unfortunately, a large number of points are hidden in the difficult pvp and the most painful detail concerns the fact that to obtain them it is necessary to play in ranked games with more than eight players. Apparently the objectives are easy but achieving them is a matter of rare patience.", "date": "2008-02-28", "grade": null}
