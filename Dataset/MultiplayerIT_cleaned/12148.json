Junior: Robotmania is not the first digression on the theme of the famous quiz-game: the previous Jungle Party had already thought about breaking the ice (indeed, not with great luck), proposing a series of skill tests to be faced in the role of some cute little monkeys. The Sony Australia title present here is therefore a new compendium of minigames aimed at a young audience, which make simplicity and immediacy their cornerstones, without forgetting that cartoonish touch useful for bringing this particular audience segment closer. The protagonists of the game are therefore four extremely cute colored robots, who compete amicably to earn the title of ~Robot of the Month~: in addition to the name, each user has the ability to customize their mechanical alter-ego by changing the look of the head and torso as you prefer. However, the variables in this sense are not very many, and the same can be said about the game options: unlike similar products, Robotmania does not offer a wide range of play modes, only allowing you to face sessions whose only variables are the number of players, the duration and (in a separate section) the mini-games to play. There are no tournaments or amenities of any kind, but only a single mode that can be customized under the aspects previously described. Not bad anyway, considering the target audience of the product, to which 25 minigames with basic dynamics are dedicated: more often than not, just press the big red buzzer at the right moment (for example to jump a laser beam or to stop a viewfinder on an exact point), while other minigames require you to use the four colored keys appropriately (often to hit or interact with the robot of the same shade). Nothing complicated, on the contrary: each stage is however introduced with precision by a voice-over that illustrates its progress, even if many times it would not even be necessary, given the truly minimal level of complexity that distinguishes them. We are the robots All in all, the various mini-games are fun - albeit occasionally cloying - while the waiting times between one stage and another are much less so, occupied by uploads, video tutorials and truly redundant and excessively long victory and scoring screens. Not only the user's patience suffers, but above all the pace of the game, already penalized by a minimum level of challenge. Although it is evidently oriented towards a childish audience, Robotmania is far too simplistic, the victim of minigames for the most part lacking in great impact: of course, there are particularly inspired or brilliant internships, but on average the title is rather bland and derivative, unable to propose something really new or exciting. At this point, even longevity is called into question, drastically shortened by that constant sensation of ~already seen~ that permeates the entire production. Put simply, Robotmania does its homework, but without trying too hard to get a better grade. This can also be understood from the technical realization, certainly not unforgettable: the graphics, despite the nice look of the protagonists, are only sufficient, penalized by somewhat dull colors and a predominant aliasing, not to mention that its quality level fluctuates greatly depending on the stage analysed. The sound certainly doesn't have better news, as the effects and the music are rather repetitive, while the speech often ends up being intrusive, as long as it is not lost in the soundtrack due to a recording level that is too low... Comment Buzz! Junior: Robotmania is a party game with a pre-adolescent target, and it shows: the Sony Australia title is extremely simple, direct and didactic, to the point of appearing immediately trivial and superficial to a more mature observer. The limited options, the deliberately sparse control system and the elementary and somewhat repetitive nature of the various mini-games are certainly elements designed to meet young audiences, but are we sure that children are really satisfied with so little? Pros Nice and cute look 25 different mini-games Cons Fluctuating quality level Dead time between one stage and another Perhaps too simple even for the little ones Ever since the world began, every successful videogame peripheral has been squeezed in all possible ways, in order to maximize its longevity and use by users. The most basic method is to create sequels to the game associated with it, but it is by no means the only one: more often than not, developers go further, trying to give new perspectives to pehe reports. This is the case with Buzz! Junior: Robotmania, which uses the controllers of the original ~quiz simulator~ for a completely different purpose...", "date": "2007-07-04", "grade": null}
