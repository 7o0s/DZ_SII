{"name": "Ritorno a Zenonia", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/76299-zenonia-2-ritorno-a-zenonia.html", "text": "Released last year, Zenonia represented one of the most convincing arguments in support of the thesis that ~serious~ games on the iPhone can exist: action-RPG with all the trappings, inspired by the glorious tradition of the 16-bit era, the product GamEvil showed off a full-bodied gameplay and a longevity unknown to much of the amusement park available for the Apple device. An exploit that certainly could not go unnoticed: therefore, the Korean developers offer us a sequel that - on paper - should easily repeat the success of its predecessor. Respect for traditions Right from the start, it is evident that the intent of Zenonia2 is to offer an experience similar to that of the prequel, without distorting things too much: however, there is a first difference, represented by the possibility of choosing one's own character among the four available (a paladin, a warrior, a wizard and a gunslinger), even if it must be said that the repercussions on the gameplay and on the storyline are very minimal. Therefore, we cannot speak of something capable of increasing the replay value or the depth of the game in and of itself, but at least it guarantees a minimum of more variety. The main menu then showcases the new online PVP mode, thanks to which you can challenge other users in a duel and climb the world leaderboards. Returning however to the single player component, the GamEvil product does not deviate from the path traced by the original: we are therefore talking about an action rpg that from a playful point of view can recall the classic Secret of Mana for SNES, with the user directly controlling the hero of the moment and must make him face the fights in real time with the enemies that appear on the screen. Everything is controlled via a virtual D-pad placed in the lower left corner, a key assigned to the attack and a series of customizable hotkeys with which to launch various spells and special abilities. The functionality is discreet, even if the directional keys sometimes lack precision, a defect that is minimally mitigated by the possibility of changing the position and size of the D-pad. Beyond this, Zenonia2 sports all the features that any RPG lover would want to find in a portable title: therefore, there are cities to explore, NPCs to talk to, shops to stock up on, primary and secondary quests, items to collect and combine between them and a renewed character progression system, including experience points to distribute and new techniques to learn. To tell the truth, Zenonia2 rests perhaps a little too excessively on the aspect of grinding, leaving everything else in the background: most of the time will therefore be spent in fights aimed at reaching the next level-up, while the component more exploratory it is almost sketchy, with repetitive quests and uninteresting dialogues (the English localization is not the best, however). Being a video game that is sold at the laughable price of 3.99 Euros, one certainly cannot expect the attention to detail of a Final Fantasy, but there is no doubt that less hardcore users could get bored prematurely, given the substantial lack of large side elements . On the other hand, the technical sector is decidedly good, in which a pleasant 16-bit style cosmetics stands out which, although not exactly representative of the brute force of the iPhone, proves to be absolutely suitable for the purpose.
