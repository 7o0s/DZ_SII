Hadrian is a wizard, a Pendragon is still the protagonist, but there is also Septimus Sulla, a Roman hero who does not know surrender. Between alliances, treasures and battles, the fate of England is at stake, an increasingly dark land, devoid of its wounded leader, and invaded by forces that have been able to overcome even the immense Hadrian's Wall. England of legends Suggestive drawings and engaging songs immediately drag us into the magical atmosphere of King Arthur II. From a design point of view, the title already captures us from the main menu and then hits the mark once we get on the battlefield. Hundreds of detailed infantry units hurl themselves against giants and squadrons of Picts while archers target flocks of monstrous flying creatures in the foe's pay. Although the engine hasn't changed much, the level of detail has increased from the previous chapter and the technical distance from Total War, with which the title shares several aspects, is further shortened but does so by following a different path with the battles that in certain fringes reminiscent of those of the lord of the rings between tianic monsters and fireballs capable of setting fire to and throwing dozens of men. A large part of the structure is that of the first chapter, with role-playing quests playing an even more important role, but the vegetation is more luxuriant, the effects are more accurate and the new map offers a completely different glance by increasing, thanks to the details, the aura of magic that embraces the British lands. However, there is no shortage of various novelties from the point of view of gameplay with refinements to battles, spells, resistances, a different management of key structures and a clear increase in management depth. All, however, without sacrificing the adventurous soul of the series and without forcing the player to navigate between stats and incomprehensible menus. Diplomacy, like research, is managed through clear and simple icons, everything is contextual, each element is brought to attention in an evident way and with simple and clear interfaces. The result is a complex experience, complete with marriage and its consequences, but always accessible and does not distract from the plot, while still giving the title an enviable wealth of possibilities. Hero, leader and diplomat The title mixes an adventurous, managerial and role-playing component through the main map with the important events that are indicated to us by evident and inescapable icons. The banner of the quests, ranging from diplomacy to simple bets on fighting, immediately clarifies whether it will be possible to run into a battle to prevent the player from being unprepared and perhaps forced to lose for having undertaken the mission with a small number of soldiers. The quests are always structured at crossroads but are characterized with care and no longer mere reductions of a gamebook. The complex system of morale and reputation with the factions then guarantees important effects for each choice, with well-dubbed dialogues and contextual choices to enrich the whole. The crossroads are essentially more than relevant. The main missions, map and storylines all allow for multiple avenues giving the player the feeling that they are in control of their own destiny. A destiny made up of favors, political support and battles that require soldiers and funds. Resources that can be obtained by influencing the various councils that our heroes will face. For example, heroic behavior will annoy politicians but will allow us to gain the favor of warriors. In short, some dialogues are fundamental and it is not advisable to take them lightly since the goal is to have a large and well-equipped army. A resource that becomes essential in case you want to leave some battles in the hands of artificial intelligence, perhaps because they are not very interesting or too simple. In fact, a large and well-structured army suffers fewer losses in automatic mode, but in the case of a desperate battle it is always better to check everything in person using spells to deceive the odds. Among the novelties we find the possibility of buying artifacts, obviously also available as loot, which among other things can be recovered almost everywhere thanks to the trading stations. In short, a sort of steamcloud of magical objects, which eliminates the need to go back to the base to buy and change equipment and at the same time does not force us to carry everything in our pocket in an unlikely way. The same goes for thealready trained troops that are always available in any stronghold. A system that is not too realistic to tell the truth, but a solution of this type is undoubtedly better than forcing the player to carry out endless marathons with dozens of troops to move around the map. On the other hand, King Arthur II does not need tricks to extend longevity. The number of quests, sub-quests, battles and plots is more than generous and the presence of crossroads and dynamic missions guarantees the title good replayability. Furthermore, the narrative background which is composed of thousands of lines of text takes care of enriching the whole. In fact, there is no shortage of information on important characters, creatures and influential families. Information that guarantees significant advantages both in battle and during diplomatic quests where knowing the opponent helps to make well-considered decisions. Not to be underestimated then the hero's personality which is shaped with a moral system through the decisions made. Our character can in fact be a generous commander or tyrant and follow the ancient faith or Christianity. All factors that have direct consequences by giving us foreign talents and influencing the reactions of allies, subjects and adversaries according to their beliefs and ideas. When the metal of swords sings From the first skirmish King Arthur II makes it clear that the road to victory will be uphill. Fortunately, the insurmountable obstacles of the first chapter seem to be a thing of the past but the battlefield can become a real hell between spells capable of decimating an entire unit and enemies hidden everywhere. Obviously a fundamental element to dominate a map is the combat strategy which in the Neocore title is basic and simple with the archers who must be defended and must take care of the flying creatures, the cavalry which is essential to wipe out the opposing shooters and the armored units which are essential to stem the charge of the opposing special troops often made up of fearsome giants. Difficult to evaluate the balance as a whole. The combat mechanics work well but sometimes the spells, despite the title allowing you to raise the magical resistance of your army, seem to unbalance the clashes too much. However, albeit in the guise of a destabilizing factor, magic is also the most distinctive element of the title together with the titanic boss fights that completely change the rules of the battlefield. In fact, King Arthur II does not push on extreme strategy but acquires his own strategic identity, after having already confirmed and improved the peculiar role-playing component, thanks to the gigantic monsters, the chains of lightning and the poisonous mists that crush, sweep away and terrorize entire armies . On the battlefield the player, with up to 18 platoons to manage, must get by in all kinds of situations between ambushes, titanic monsters and devastating spells. Triumphing means avoiding direct impact with giants and titanic creatures and also means making the best use of spells and shrines, or sacred places that guarantee bonuses and powers of all kinds. Some of these buildings increase defense. Others the attack. Still others grant additional powers. All of them are key to achieving landslide victories. It will not always be possible to get all the bonuses available on a map and we will therefore have to decide which ones to grab depending on the situation. In fact, sometimes we will find ourselves attacking, sometimes defending and often we will be able to directly choose the approach to battle if the context allows it. The title also includes a menu specifically dedicated to strategic options with the possibility to decide the general behavior of the troops. Among the peculiarities of the strategic also stands out the possibility of manually selecting the increases in the characteristics of the units that level up by winning on the battlefield. But the upgrades also pass through research that allows you to better arm the troops by increasing the specialized workers in the settlements. Finally, the units can obviously recover their losses by paying a price commensurate with the number of men lost. Everything works quite well and despite the preponderance of spells, made even greater by the slowness of the troops, the strategic component remains important however simple given the relatively small number of unit types available. Dark clouds on the horizon While not reaching the heights of Total War, King Arthur II fields hundreds of detailed units with asynchronous and believable animations. The engine is the same as in the first chapter and is not missingno defects typical of the genre such as interpenetrations and flashy graphic glitches, but the combat is convincing and is immersed in rather detailed maps that show off marked hills and valleys capable of heavily influencing movement and gameplay. The vegetation on the field as in the main map, is believable, gloomy and damn green. There is no shortage of villages and dense towns and the special buildings are well modeled even if those huge disproportionate structures that stand out in the middle of the battlefield are not one of the strengths of the game, at least from a visual point of view. The graphic effects, on the other hand, are fluctuating. The deformation of the air generated by the blows of powerful creatures is very bad while the impact of the spells is spectacular, with the fireball that throws and inflames the enemies, transforming an entire unit into a mass of burnt flesh. The interface, as we anticipated, is quite intuitive with light effects that signal important elements, enemy armies and messages. Unfortunately, from an optimization point of view, there is still a lot of work to do. The performances have improved slightly after the first patch but the title continues to struggle even on fairly powerful hardware like ours, with an evident input lag that affects the responsiveness of the units both in battle and on the strategic map. Obviously with a few tweaks it is possible to achieve acceptable fluidity but it is a pity to give up the effects which, between glitters and suggestive mists, are essential to contribute to the magical atmosphere of King Arthur II. Among the defects we have already mentioned the various glitches, capable of deforming the units and conspicuously deteriorating the aesthetic performance, and the optimization, but the potentially heaviest one, especially for those who do not have a latest generation PC, concerns the excessive deterioration of image rendering at intermediate resolutions. At 1280x720 resolution the title is almost unrecognizable with the image shown on the screen often becoming an incomprehensible mix of pixels and colors. We must also underline a small design error or the little graphic space granted to the RPG quests which are relegated to a small parchment in which we often find ourselves scrolling through various submenus with a cumbersome and not very immersive overall effect. The audio sector is less problematic which is one of the cornerstones of the title between evocative symphonies and beautifully narrated dialogues. The volumes need to be finished in the appropriate menu, given the excessive preponderance of sound effects. Unfortunately the whole title is in English but in the case of King Arthur II it can be said that the British language is undoubtedly suitable for fully enjoying the atmosphere of the title.", "date": "2012-02-07", "grade": "8.0"}
