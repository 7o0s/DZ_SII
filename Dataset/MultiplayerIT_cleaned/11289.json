This uncommon design choice was primarily dictated by the structure of the game itself, which is non-linear, with patterns that develop in every direction, especially in depth. Ninja Gaiden for Nintendo DS, however, is also characterized by another particular intuition: the movements of the character, the fights, the jumps and the combos are all carried out through the use of the stylus on the touch screen. The only move that needs traditional controls is parrying, which is done by pressing any key at random, even the d-pad. It has something in common with the popular Nintendo brain training game Brain Training: It is played with the console held upright A sword pen This last solution, inevitable, is initially uncomfortable as it must necessarily be done with the thumb of the hand that supports the console. After a while, however, the hand naturally lightens and the thumb relaxes, so that blocking becomes as comfortable and fast as the rest of the commands. The challenge launched by Tecmo of relying almost exclusively on touch controls has been fully won: the inputs are always very precise, apart from when the character is far away and reduced to a few pixels, but above all the game is always fun; the identification given by the pen-sword dichotomy becomes total after a few minutes of play. Comment Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword is the best chapter of the series ever to appear on a portable console and represents a new way to play with Ryu Hayabusa, thanks to the intelligent and functional use that Tecmo has been able to give to the Nintendo DS touch screen. The game is so fun, frenetic but not complicated; perhaps the bosses are too simple, and the general difficulty level that seems calibrated downwards, compared to the previous chapters. Some problems when the camera moves back a lot, making us a small patch of unmanageable pixels, but these are rare moments. The evaluation is enhanced by a superb technical compartment and an online option that increases its longevity and challenge. Pros Fully captures the spirit of the series Brilliant use of the touch screen Excellent technical compartment Cons Some movement problems Easier than previous installments News and canonical aspects of the series Even for old fans of the series accustomed to the classic joypad there will be no problems in handling the new control system formed by the touch-pen combination. All actions are performed intuitively; for example, to run in a point just touch the direction, to jump you have to make a vertical line on the screen, the attack with the shuriken stars is done simply by touching the opponent with the tip of the stylus, while to hit lunge with the katana the blow is simulated with diagonal movements. There are numerous combos that are learned as the game progresses, gradually, so as not to add too much meat to the fire at the same time and not displace the player's sense of direction. Ryu can also perform power shots by simply flicking the stylus left and right on the screen. for old fans of the series accustomed to the classic joypad there will be no problem handling the new control system News and canonical aspects of the series The fights are very reasoned and must be faced with precision and dedication: button-smashing doesn't pay here. Compared to the other chapters of the series, this chapter for Nintendo DS is relatively simpler, with a smooth learning curve and end-of-level bosses that are very affordable for everyone. The average difficulty level has been lowered, certainly to meet the needs of a younger audience, the one that characterizes console users. The bosses, notoriously very challenging in the other Ninja Gaiden, are now very simple, but above all the way to defeat them is too many times the same, with the result that we can beat almost all of them on the first try, without too much effort. Dragon Sword maintains many canonical aspects of the series, such as the use of spells, which this time are activated by pressing a key on the touch screen: once pressed, an ideographic character appears on the screen which must be drawn in the pre-established time to activate the magic. The system itself is a different and new way to use these special attacks, as a sort of mini-game. Dragon Sword has a good storyline, set six months after the first of the new chapters andnarrated through finely crafted cut-scenes, in anime style, all well drawn and with excellent character design. The game also introduces a new character, Momiji. The beautiful scenography of this new Ninja Gaiden is supported by a first-rate audio sector, with well-studied music, created with a style appropriate to the series and with lots of sound effects. Ryu moves on the screen with agility, with alternating zoom and panoramic screens, but always animated in a very fluid and convincing way. Even the enemies are made with great detail, good textures but above all numerous animations. Dragon Sword is one of the most artistically beautiful titles to have appeared on the Nintendo DS, a console that finally makes its hardware count. To complete the story it takes about eight hours, not very many, but longevity is guaranteed by further unlockable difficulty levels after game over. There is also an option for the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, which allows you to submit your data to a global leaderboard. These are karma points, accumulated by carrying out the most difficult attacks. Dragon Sword is ultimately the best way to bring the series to a portable console.", "date": "2008-07-23", "grade": null}
