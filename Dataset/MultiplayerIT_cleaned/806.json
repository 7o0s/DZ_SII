The very first sensation is positive: for the cut scenes it was decided to use a technique that is certainly cheap but also very ~glamorous~. Do you remember those comics-cartoons of various superheroes (Thor, Hulk, Submarine...) broadcast on TV during the 80s? The aesthetics are practically the same and the visual impact is decidedly pleasing to the eye. Thus begins the adventure of our digital alter ego, an American Air Force soldier fleeing on German territory following the shooting down of his own plane. A good start As happens more and more frequently, the first level turns out to be in practice a ~learn & play~ tutorial with which we will become familiar with the control system, the playful and interactive dynamics. The man-user interface turns out to be one of the best elements of Pilot Down: with the joypad or with the mouse+keyboard combo, in any case performing the operations will be quite simple and intuitive and also the inventory (visually represented by the backpack of the military) is absolutely user friendly in all its functions. The man-user interface, whether via joypad or mouse + keyboard, proves to be one of the best elements of Pilot Down A good start Undoubtedly the programmers will have played many titles of the genre since they have taken over here and there various elements already seen in other reference games such as the somewhat ~role~ management of the character (at the end of the level we will be able to advance the 8 parameters that distinguish the ability of our alter ego), or the presence of an indicator of our character's resistance (in which even the cold will have its importance). A mediocre continuation If up to now we have drawn a positive or at least neutral picture of Pilot Down, the time has come to make you aware of the obvious limits of the production of Oxygen and we only have difficulty choosing what to start with. A truly embarrassing artificial intelligence is immediately manifested with the behavior of German soldiers far beyond the limits of the most elementary reason. As if that weren't enough then, for a game representing stealth games, it is really disheartening to note a rather basic interaction which, in addition to the stealth element, does not include much else than hiding corpses, choking enemies or facing them in firefights (however far from a great playful pathos). Already titles such as Metal Gear or Splinter Cell sometimes risk falling into excessive recurrence, so you can easily guess how much this sensation is repeated and intense in Pilot Down. A truly embarrassing artificial intelligence is immediately manifested with the behavior of the German soldiers far beyond the limits of the most elementary reason Cel Shading is not the same for everyone Pilot Down is proof that the cel shading technique is not the panacea for programmers with which to hide the limitations of graphics engines. Just comparing PD to XIII, one of the most underrated titles ever to appear on PC (at least according to whoever is writing this review), would be somewhat out of place: Oxygen's game comes with an excessively limited color palette and which tends in some levels to a almost absolute monochrome. Furthermore, the settings are truly bare and absent of any detail worthy of mention. Things are no better for the animations and character creation, comparable to what was seen on PC about 3 years ago or so. In this not exactly idyllic picture, the sound, while not presenting exciting qualitative peaks, does its background work well and even the (few) voices present are characterized appropriately. To underline the ~amusing~ subtitles that mix Italian and Spanish, a bit like the Inter player Luis Figo does during his interviews... Pilot Down is proof that the cel shading technique is not the panacea for programmers with which to hide the limitations of graphics engines Pilot Down: Behind Enemy Lines continues in the wake of previous Oxygen productions and fails to go beyond mediocrity. The title tried to exploit together two very strong trends such as that of stealth games and the setting of the Second World War. Unfortunately, however, the game has obvious limitations in elements of primary importance such as the artificial intelligence of the German soldiers, environmental interactivity, and an absolutely exaggerated reiteration inthe game dynamics. As if that weren't enough, the cel shading technical realization is proof that this technique is not the panacea for programmers with which to hide the limits of the graphics engines, limits that Pilot Down clearly shows both in the chromatic choices and in the realization of environments and characters. A good control system and a discreet soundtrack are not enough to save Behind Enemy Lines from an undoubtedly insufficient judgment, even more clear due to its non-budget price (the recommended one is around 40). Pros Good control system Pleasant soundtrack Two trends (stealth and WW2) in one game Cons: Repetitive throughout Technically modest Awkward AI Cross-platform Regarding the console versions there are (unfortunately) not many differences to report. That Xbox is virtually identical to the PC version, except for the screen resolution and a slightly lower detail. The PS2 version, as usually happens, is characterized by a minor visual cleaning and by the graphics engine that jams in some slowdown more than the other versions. Immortal stealthmania While Konami and Ubisoft have already announced the fourth episodes of their standard-bearers (respectively Solid Snake and Sam Fisher), even in the undergrowth of small independent software houses there is someone who thinks it well to exploit the immortal ~stealthmania~ to their own advantage. So here is Oxygen, a European publisher who hasn't shined too much for its productions to date, launches Pilot Down: Behind Enemy Lines on the market. The title does not try to exploit only the stealth trend but also the scenario: the programmers have chosen a rather popular one or the Second World War complete with an episode that really happened on which the plot of the game would be based.", "date": "2005-10-16", "grade": null}
