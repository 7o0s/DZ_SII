{"name": "Control Ultimate Edition", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/control-ultimate-edition-recensione.html", "text": "The Control Ultimate Edition review cannot ignore the controversies that accompanied the announcement of the game, which presents itself as the classic complete edition of the title developed by Remedy Entertainment, including not only the two DLCs but also and above all a technical upgrade that aims to exploit the capabilities of PS5 and Xbox Series X | S. In fact, when the publisher 505 Games declared that the Ultimate Edition would be the only one to enjoy the graphic improvements intended for next-gen platforms, the owners of the standard version necessarily resentful. Those who decided to make a double purchase despite everything, perhaps taking advantage of a discount to switch to the definitive edition, then found themselves faced with the surprise announcement that the product would be free for PlayStation Plus subscribers in the month of February. , it is difficult to say that this whole matter has been handled well and we are really curious to understand how Microsoft will move to avoid that Xbox Series X|S owners are the only ones who have to pay full price for this update (moreover with the standard version of Control currently available in the Xbox Game Pass catalog), but for the moment things are exactly like this and they only confirm how complicated and cumbersome the transition to the new generation can become when you don't have clear ideas. History The story is undoubtedly one of the most interesting elements of Control, not so much for the events themselves but for how they are represented, through the use of fascinating narrative solutions and the creation of truly peculiar atmospheres. The whole campaign seems to take place within a dream that deliberately leaves gaps, and when it ends, not all of them are filled. In short, an excellent reason to replay it in the Ultimate Edition. In the role of the protagonist of the adventure, Jesse Faden, we find ourselves in the headquarters of the Federal Bureau of Control, an agency that deals with identifying, studying and cataloging supernatural events and the apparently trivial objects that caused them: an old floppy disk, a rocking horse, a safe or an X-ray can hide the power to interface with another world. Just from the other world, however, a terrible threat has arrived: the Hiss, a mysterious entity that has managed to overcome the barrier that separates the dimensions and has breached the Oldest House, the building that houses the FBC, making plunging its agents into stasis or turning them into dangerous puppets, ready to attack us. Appointed new Director of the agency, Jesse seems to be the only one capable of resolving the situation, thanks to her telekinetic powers and the powerful Service Weapon: a supernatural instrument that can take on five different configurations and fire modes, to be unlocked and upgraded in course of the campaign. Solid and exciting gameplay Control takes the best of the previous Remedy Entertainment productions, from Alan Wake to Quantum Break, to deliver us a very solid and exciting gameplay, which is gradually enriched with new mechanics and possibilities; also on the structural front, with a metroidvania-style setting that allows access to new areas as we obtain powers and permits, creating checkpoints from which to restart in the event of a game over. While we explore the huge Oldest House, collecting along the way documents that are used to unlock an abundant amount of side missions (some of which include boss fights that are also quite spectacular), we will face swarms of opponents divided into various types, from simple soldiers to those equipped with an energy shield, from snipers to agents with the rocket launcher, from flying creatures to ~spheres~ that are projected rapidly from one point of the scenario to another, passing through numerous mini-bosses that must be faced with a minimum of strategy. To fight them we will be able to resort, as mentioned, to the Service Weapon in its various fire modes and to Jesse's telekinetic powers, which allow her to grab and throw any object or debris, project herself rapidly forward or create a wall of rubble. The combinations multiply as the protagonist acquires new skills and new upgrades, transforming herself into a real war machine capable of even flying, even for short stretches. On PlayStation 5 the Control Ultimate Edition combat system can also count on the peculiarities of the DualSense controller, in this case the haptic feedback that communicates with its vibrations what is happening on the screen and the adaptive triggers, which oppose a different degree of resistance depending on the weapon used. On the first si remain a bit dumbfounded by the hardness of the trigger, however it takes little to get used to and appreciate these small but significant extras. The next gen version The PS5 version of Control Ultimate Edition, subject of this review, includes two different graphics options that you can activate at any time, without having to go back to the home screen: the first uses a resolution of 1440p and 30 fps with active ray tracing, the second instead it runs at 1440p and 60 fps without ray tracing. The same feature is also present on Xbox Series X, while on Xbox Series S it is possible to opt only for the performance mode. The instant switch from one option to the other allows you to try the game in both modes for a few minutes and decide which is the best one for your needs. In reality, however, there is not much to discuss: the active ray tracing mode does not add enough visual quality to justify the lower frame rate, which despite being masked by motion blur on many occasions gave us the impression of losing some piece on the street. By opting for 60 frames per second, on the other hand, the game runs very solidly, without uncertainties. The improvement is clear and involves the experience in its entirety, given that the greater fluidity allows you to manage the aim in a much more precise way during firefights. In short, even the gameplay gains a lot and on the purely visual front only the reflections that go beyond those well represented thanks to the screen space reflection are lost. In the images accompanying this paragraph you can see the difference between the two modes: the first shot was captured in ray traced mode, the second without. We note the presence of greater details in the reflections and a more realistic rendering of the lights, but as underlined by the technical analysis of Digital Foundry, and as admitted by Remedy Entertainment itself, we are talking about a light implementation of the effects, not comparable to as seen on PC. Juxtaposing the technical results of Control Ultimate Edition with the extraordinary work done by Insomniac Games with Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales naturally makes little sense: they are two very different realities, with equally different resources available. Furthermore, the Northlight Engine is known to be powerful but heavy, as evidenced by the countless talks about the real resolution of Quantum Break, a few years ago. At the same time, however, it was legitimate to expect something more from the next-gen version of the game, presented below form of paid upgrade. The reference is naturally to general effects, rather than ray tracing in particular: the aforementioned Digital Foundry analysis highlights the use of modest presets compared to what the PS5 and Xbox Series X capabilities should be. Nothing to say, instead, on uploads: compared to PS4 and Xbox One they are very fast.", "date": "2021-02-02", "grade": "8.7"}
