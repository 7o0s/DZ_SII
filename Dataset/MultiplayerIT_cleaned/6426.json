The image of a long, completely dark corridor, from which eerie sounds of an unknown nature come, should be familiar to all fans of the genre. What is really scary is contact with the indefinable. Horror places par excellence are those where metaphysical chaos has broken into reality, overturning all order and dragging it towards the formless. The player finds himself lost and frightened in a place he cannot understand and where he recognizes the action of unimaginable and lethal forces. The horror ends not when its root is identified, but when we begin to recognize the patterns that regulate it. A pattern is something repeatable, therefore dead by definition. It is something that has already been, a subtle source of a certainty that comes from not expecting any surprises, that is, from being able to predict events. From the point of view of horror, Hektor is an ambivalent title, which on the one hand manages to remain disturbing throughout its development, but on the other it fails at the very moment in which it would like to scare the most. But let's proceed in order and try to understand what works and what doesn't. Hektor is the classic title with strengths and weaknesses: find out in our review Procedural horror The title of Rubycone is a classic first-person horror adventure in the style of Amnesia, which puts you in the role of a man with no identity who wakes up in the dark basement of what appears to be a military prison called Hektor (this can be seen from the uniforms are around). Taking a lighter, the only source of light until the discovery of a more powerful flashlight, we begin to explore in search of clues that can explain what we are doing there and why we hear voices communicating strange messages (we will decipher them as we progress in the game ). Moreover, the protagonist has vision problems, which he can only control by regularly taking psychotropic drugs, and which cause strong distortions of the images (excellent if you suffer from motion sickness). After passing a series of corridors we come to the first room, and then to the first closed door. Did we go the wrong way? We go back and find with horror that the map has changed. The corridors are no longer what they used to be. What happened? Continuing the exploration we will discover that we were not wrong: the map is constantly changing. This is one of the best features of Hektor: the procedural generation of levels, which change in real time without ever showing the trick. The effect is incredibly effective, given that the player soon finds himself lost, completely lacking precise reference points to rely on. At the same time the developers have managed not to escalate the effects of the case, ie it is the system itself that makes sure that you always find the way to the goal. Thus we find ourselves immersed in a constantly changing space, a spiral that seems to have no return but which actually guides us holding hands. The military base soon becomes a dreamlike place even if it doesn't look like one, given the crudeness of the rooms made of reinforced concrete corridors, very bare cells, offices and small laboratories. It is a perfect representation of the circularity of the nightmare, which gives the idea of going nowhere, while always taking us to our destination. Here come the monsters Then unfortunately the monsters arrive. That is, the monster. In reality the creatures are different, but a couple have mostly decorative functions and only one really chases the protagonist. Do you remember what we said in the introduction of the article? Here, both the random generation of the map works well, as the real danger ends up being only a predictable annoyance. The first time it appears it takes its toll and kills us relentlessly as we try to escape. So we figured out the trick, which is that as long as you don't hear a scream, the area is sure to be clear. The result was that the introduction of the hunter, instead of frightening us and slowing us down in our movements, gave us a certainty that we didn't have before, i.e. his absence. The fact then that when you are killed you don't really die, but you are transported to a room of the base from which to resume exploration has transformed Hektor into a wild ride towards the conclusion, favored by the random map generation system which, as already said, always puts you on the right track. We even realized that it's not worth avoiding being killed, because you waste much less time getting sliced and then literally running towards the goal, pbefore a new appearance. So we finished the game without even bothering to study effective evasion techniques: we were the ones who gave ourselves to death. Documents and batteries Otherwise Hektor doesn't have much more to say. The adventure lasts a total of two hours, but the best ones could take even less to reach the conclusion. Technically it's not great, even if the prevalence of very dark environments makes this aspect secondary. The story is told through documents, found around the game areas, which once collected and opened are read by the voices of real actors. Fortunately they are very well written and the various narrative threads are interesting to follow. We won't tell you anything because the plot is really one of the most interesting aspects of the entire game, as well as the real reason not to abandon it when the first flaws begin to emerge heavily. In addition to the documents, the protagonist will find the aforementioned psychiatric drugs and batteries for the flashlight, which will need to be replaced from time to time. All other items will be tied to some puzzle. In reality, don't expect complicated puzzles, since almost all of them are solved by finding some object, an object that is used automatically when needed. Only in one case is it necessary to study the environment to understand how to proceed, but in reality it is really a trifle; nothing that can't be digested in a few moments. We would have liked a few more complications, but we imagine that the procedural generation of the maps has not made it possible to complicate life too much for the player.", "date": "2015-04-10", "grade": "6.5"}
