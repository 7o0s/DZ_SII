{"name": "Scrolls", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/143543-scrolls-caselle-e-pergamene.html", "text": "After being announced almost four years ago, Scrolls finally arrived on PCs and tablets last December, at the end of two very long testing phases that radically transformed it, especially in terms of content. After all, a lot of things have happened in Mojang since 2011 and dealing with the numerous portings and adaptations of Minecraft for practically every system on the market has inevitably taken away time and resources from the Swedish software house, which has left only a handful of fearless developers on the project . Furthermore, the abandonment of ship by Markus ~Notch~ Persson (one of the creators of the title) and the time spent in court with Bethesda (for the debate regarding the franchise The Elder Scrolls) could have made the publisher give up working on the project , which arrived in its final version amazed us from many points of view. All that glitters is not gold, mind you, but we have to give Scrolls credit for having succeeded in demonstrating that even in a panorama that by its nature is anchored to precise and rooted mechanics such as that of collectible card games, there is still room for maneuver to refresh the formula, perhaps by mixing different genres in a creative and original way. Scrolls mixes trading card games and board games: a successful experiment? Defend your idol With all those scrolls and decks, Scrolls may seem like a classic trading card game, but in reality, behind this facade there is a rather deep turn-based strategy soul. The playing field consists of five lanes, at the end of which small idols are positioned to be defended to the limit to avoid losing the game. It is enough for them to be destroyed to capitulate, and it is this simple mechanic that adds an important strategic component to the classic card game. Having a maximum of three boxes for each lane to fill with beasts and minions, we are unable to keep all the idols intact and forced to decide which ones to adequately reinforce and which ones to sacrifice for the final victory. The really interesting aspects are the possibility of moving each pawn on one's side of the board by only one position in each turn and the presence of a cooldown which forces one to wait one or more turns before carrying out the attack. All this gives substance to the strategic profile of Scrolls, which takes shape as a complex board game in which you plan in your head the possible scenarios of the upcoming rounds based on when our creatures and those of your opponent will attack, trying to better manage the cards you have in your hand and the resources needed for each summon. In this sense, Mojang's game introduces an unusual system which at the beginning of each turn allows the player to sacrifice a parchment with a dual objective: gain a unit of mana or draw two more. Obviously at the beginning of the match you are almost forced to increase the points to spend in order to play the most expensive cards, but as the rounds continue, decide whether it is better to continue gaining mana, draw two cards by sacrificing one or keep what you already has in hand, represents a dilemma that could mean the difference between victory and defeat. Furthermore, the suit of the cards must be taken into consideration, because, as in Magic, also in Scrolls it is possible to build mixed decks that require even more accurate management of resources and a good experience of the player with collectible card games to avoid running into unbalanced decks with no chance of winning. There's always something to sweat about With all these options available, finding the right balance between three spells, artifacts and minions with specific abilities is not a simple job, and it requires a certain dedication to understand the more than 350 scrolls available and be able to create effective combos and synergies to make us win some online matches. In fact, on the PvP front the situation is not the most rosy. Beyond a general lack of players which in some situations of the day forced us to wait even more than five minutes before being able to enter the game, the difficulty level is the real problem of Scrolls. On the one hand there are the artificial intelligence and the most savvy players with whom to clash in tight but exciting matches until the last round, while on the other there are those who do not have much experience with the title, but still try their luck in the hope to learn what the sloppy tutorial failed to teach him. This leads to a consistent lowering of the pace and long-winded matches that go against the trendza with the typical dynamism of online card games. On the other hand, it is also possible to meet players who have followed the title since its entry into alpha and are now real monsters of skill, capable of wiping out our miserable deck in just a few turns or giving us the illusion of controlling the game before cleaning the board in an instant, leaving us helpless and without a backup plan. In case PvP gets too frustrating on one side or the other, it is possible to play random matches against the artificial intelligence by choosing the level of difficulty, or face the Judgment option, an arena-style mode that allows you to build a deck choosing from random cards and continuing to play until three games are lost. Contrary to expectations, the prizes are quite generous and allow us to buy packs at a good pace, also because Scrolls is not a completely free to play game but a paid title for which a substantial demo is available on the official website which gives access to the tutorial ( rather poor and not very explanatory of some mechanics), some challenges, the Skirmish mode against artificial intelligence and multiplayer. If you want to compete in ranked matches, or have access to the arena or some secondary functions, such as crafting and in-game purchases, it is mandatory to shell out the 4.50 ticket which, however, in the end, is not we would like to recommend to anyone. If you have some experience with the genre and the drift board game appeals to you, give it a chance, but if you are a beginner, don't be fooled by its delightful graphic style characterized by soft lines and warm pastel shades: Scrolls does not forgive, it teaches you little and it requires a considerable effort to be understood in all its facets, but once the right gear is in gear, the satisfactions will not be long in coming.", "date": "2015-01-15", "grade": "7.5"}
