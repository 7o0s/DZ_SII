Beyond the more or less summary judgments, even in our review we have never hidden the goodness of Sucker Punch's work, net of some deficiencies and a sense of dissatisfaction and wasted opportunity that no one can ever take away from us. A few months after its release and in view of the arrival of PS5 in a few days, the team has seen fit to release a substantial update capable of substantially changing the experience. We had the opportunity to test the technical improvements and, as often happens in these cases, we came away enthusiastic. We tell you about it in the review of Ghost of Tsushima for PS5. Context It is useless to use this space to repeat what we have said to each other in so many situations, but we still try to give a bit of context to those who don't know Tsushima and don't even know what we are talking about. The latest work by Sucker Punch, the studio behind the good old Sly Cooper and the Infamous series, attempted a coup a few months ago with a new IP with a strong character and personality: Ghost of Tsushima. With a particularly tempting setting for the current market, the game put us in the role of Jin: a samurai reluctantly invested by the first Mongol invasion. Despite his training aimed at honor and respect, circumstances also lead him to know the way of ghosts, of those who move in the shadows and strike from behind, putting him in the position of often having to decide if his path is really the one of the samurai. Against this background, a bloody and devastating war is fought, which grips the whole island of Tsushima and which sets in motion events and situations capable of accompanying the player far and wide across the territory of feudal Japan. Moving around Tsushima Based on what has just been said, the guys from Sucker Punch have created a particular open world that makes its strong point stylistic. Anyone who is fascinated by the Japanese territory cannot help but try to get lost in the expanses of Tsushima, made up of large woods, prairies, fields in bloom and an aesthetic impact that damnably winks at all Japanese cinematographic culture. The introduction of the dynamic wind that takes the place of the more classic open world GPS, the need to follow different types of guide animals to unlock sanctuaries and upgrades. The very existence of some type of side stories all dedicated to the deepening of legendary figures of Japan, all together represent the ability and will of Sucker Punch to make a very strong declaration of love to a magical and fascinating country, making as much their willingness to romance is clear, even exaggerating in some situations. The importance of frame rate It certainly cannot be said that Ghost of Tsushima is not splendid in itself. Already in the summer, when it landed on our PlayStation 4, it was able to put an important aesthetic component on the plate. Certainly smart in some respects, but intelligent in disguising the limits with a crazy stylistic code. The Sucker Punch game still has some of the most beautiful glimpses of the history of the medium today, net of some elements made in a non-exceptional way, such as snow. In this particular but certainly impactful panorama, an update for PS5 is placed which takes the good things already present and raises it to its maximum level, finally bringing Ghost of Tsushima to 60fps and with a dynamic resolution which, to tell the truth , it is difficult to be able to judge accurately with the naked eye. Our tests, carried out both on the guided prologue and in the open world phase, highlighted an important finishing work. It is clear that it is always the same game, it is not a patch that has the intention of reviewing the general quality of the title, but we cannot hide that, perhaps moved by enthusiasm, it seemed to us on more than one occasion that some elements were even improved. However, we must rightly stick to the information that the team itself has revealed and, for this reason, we have focused all our attention on the framerate. Ghost of Tsushima finally runs at 60 frames per second which, according to our acquisitions and also our eyes, they remained granite for most of the test. To be totally honest and transparent, on some occasions we happened to find some cutscenes capable of sobbing, as if something in terms of code, in relation to this latest patch, needed to be tweaked. Regardless of this, it is very clear that the work carried out finally allows us to enjoy itre of a better version of Ghost of Tsushima from all points of view and for this reason we can only be happy with this fluid and (almost) completely backwards compatible generational passage. using the brand new PS5 SSD. To tell the truth, this is not a revolution that completely changes the cards on the table, but it is certainly an added value. To be more specific, we can tell you that in our direct comparison, the initial load of the game has gone from 32'' on PS4 Pro to 21'' on PS5. However, we are talking about 30% of the time saved: as mentioned, not revolutionary, but significant.", "date": "2020-11-08", "grade": "8.2"}
