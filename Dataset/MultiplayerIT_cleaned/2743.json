It must be said that El Hijo, despite being among these, had a setting and above all a color palette that was impactful enough to be noticed, but more than a year passed without relevant news once again risked making it fall into the memory forgetting. In fact, we were a little surprised when we finally saw it return, ready to land on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and with it it reminded us of why, albeit feebly, it had impressed itself in our mind. Find out in our review of El Hijo - A Wild West Tale. History There is very little to say about the story of El Hijo: the premises are presented very quickly and the titular protagonist is, as expected, a child of only six who lives on a ranch with his mother. After a very short tutorial phase to teach us the first game commands, mother and son see their house stormed and burned by bandits: forced to flee, they reach a monastery where in El Hijo they are buried by the mother herself his sling and a photo of both before being left - for his safety - in the care of the monks. The woman walks away but is caught up and captured by the criminals. Can we possibly allow it? At first glance it seems like a sequence of events without apparent sense but slowly the reason why the mother behaves in this way, and why the bandits have stormed the ranch, emerges. In all of this, El Hijo doesn't fit in being abandoned in the monastery and plans to escape to go in search of his mother, leaving the rest in our hands. The entire series of events is told through short films without a single line of dialogue: the images give voice to the game and we found it a good choice also by virtue of the type of aesthetics, which otherwise would have lost much of its beauty . Even in the brevity of these events, some glimpses are touching, especially when mother and son are separated. In some ways it was like watching a Pixar short, albeit with completely different graphics. The gameplay As it is logical to think, where the story does not stand out much and serves just as a premise to introduce us to the heart of the game, the gameplay is the real backbone of El Hijo. Being a non-violent game, everything is based on stealth, on creatively escaping the dangers that threaten us and over the course of the ten hours or so (taking all the collectibles) that make up the game we are not really given the opportunity to attack anyone he would like to harm us - if not towards the end, we can stun them with some innocent fireworks. Therefore, the only way to overcome the various situations in which we end up unharmed is to make the most of what the environment offers: in this, it must be said, Honig Studios has done a very pleasant level design job, presenting scenarios from time to time with multiple approaches, not all of them as immediate as one would expect. Several times we found ourselves looking at a point without apparently finding its meaning, taking an opposite direction and then discovering that we were reconnected to the previous area from which we could move more easily thanks to a ~ladder~ of rocks. In short, the key to understanding it is never single and this stimulates us to find the best path to proceed, through thirty-one levels which, after an initial linearity in order to make us understand the individual mechanics, will begin to embrace the distinctive features of the sandbox. As virtual children that we are, therefore, we take these challenges as big playgrounds in which to have good or bad weather, using the shadow as our best and most precious ally to hide but also a series of gadgets at our disposal. In fact, if initially El Hijo can only rely on a handful of stones, once he escapes from the monastery (and don't think he's so quick) he will come back in possession of his beloved slingshot with which to create even more havoc. In addition, he will be able to take advantage of wind-up toys, a strange natural powder to go unnoticed as if he were in a temporary cloud of smoke and finally the most powerful weapon at his disposal, fireworks. Using these four objects and a lot of ingenuity, El Hijo will make his way through the numbersposed dangers in order to embrace the mother again - who in turn becomes a playable character in some levels, offering different approach possibilities from those of the son and who manage to distinguish her in terms of gameplay. The beauty of the game, as we have written, lies in the multiplicity of solutions available to us, which is why we can choose to almost never rely on other objects and only go slingshot, or give vent to our creativity. In these ingenious playgrounds there is also space for small puzzles, nothing complicated but perfect in the construction of the level design. Between frequent checkpoints (which are reusable) and pre-established enemy patterns, the sense of frustration due to failure is greatly mitigated: there is always a weak point to be exploited in the apparently insurmountable disposition of bandits and monks, it all lies in observing the area also relying on our budgie which, taking off, can offer us an overview of the area. This is also useful for understanding where the sixty-nine children are located, divided into almost all levels, who take the place of collectibles but can also prove to be valid allies by rewarding us with objects or even helping us solve some environmental puzzles. his painful notes and those of El Hijo reside in two specific aspects: the enemy artificial intelligence, very calibrated downwards, and a certain imprecision in the commands especially when it comes to bending down. In the first case we have enemies who react only when a noise enters their area of action or when we expose ourselves in the cone of vision, for the rest they remain impassive even when we break an oil lamp right under their nose or drag a cart from mine before them while keeping us out of sight. This causes the difficulty level to be particularly soft and does not even follow a possible crescendo as the game progresses, presenting final levels that are sometimes even more approachable than the previous ones. As for the input lag of some commands, we don't have much appreciated the fact that El Hijo can only bend down in the vicinity of specific obstacles rather than being a free-to-use command: this above all because a moment of conflict is created precisely in the least suitable moments, risking us being discovered due to an error not dependent on us. A similar friction is perceived in the use of the slingshot when trying to hit objects placed at different heights, with the viewfinder tending to get stuck easily. Accuracy isn't really the strong point of the game. Beyond this, however, El Hijo is a very pleasant experience, perfect if you want to get away from other more demanding ones and immerse yourself in a ~cartoonish~ spaghetti western atmosphere. Technical aspect El Hijo is an indie to the core and its technical sector proves it, presenting a very simple game in its graphic design but equally embellished by the cartoon-style artistic direction, which goes perfectly with the lightness of the title. Surprisingly for still being a game inspired by the Far West, the soundtrack does not stand out and indeed, it is not very present and to accompany our journey there is absolute silence for most of the time. A particular choice but not for this uncomfortable.", "date": "2020-12-09", "grade": "7.2"}
