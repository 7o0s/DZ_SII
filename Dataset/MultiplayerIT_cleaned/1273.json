{"name": "Mashed - Review PS2/Xbox", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mashed-review-ps2xbox.html", "text": "Three buttons are enough to play Mashed, in addition to the analog lever to drive the vehicles: the accelerator, the brake and the button to use the different weapons available that are collected along the paths. The brake is of little use, the progressive abandonment of the accelerator once you approach a curve is better able to do it. Despite this apparent simplicity and thanks to a thousand small tricks, it soon becomes clear that no two Supersonic games can ever be identical. Four cars, whoever arrives first takes two points, second takes one, third, minus one and fourth, minus two. The combination of these elements makes each encounter uncertain and potentially infinite, with obvious references from the history of multiplayer titles (first of all MicroMachines 2 by the same team), but with an original and refreshing attitude. In Mashed, to win, you need to be able to reach the very edge of the screen, cutting off your opponents who will blow up every time they fall behind. No split screen, but a single screen that proceeds at the speed of the strongest, and every time you remain last, either due to the blows of your opponents or because you get stranded on the seabed, there will be only one end, that is the explosion of your own half and the victory of the others. What makes the difference is the level design of the tracks, really well studied, and the feeling, which comes inevitable, of being able to fight until the end of each race to overturn the result. a game in which the real skill of the contenders manages to prevail over the mere knowledge of the tracks A thousand small details that come out game after game: finding yourself fighting to recover ground clinging to rock spikes; racing up to the last second, even in reverse, with a vehicle now devoured by flames and almost unmanageable; realizing that the weapons that are mounted on the bodies affect the physics of the vehicles, allowing further evolutions. These and other details create the framework for a game in which the real skill of the contenders manages to prevail over the mere knowledge of the tracks, which can be exploited at every point to conquer the last decisive victory. Which version? The differences between the two tested versions are truly impalpable. The Renderware, used for the polygonal engine, shows off more vibrant and lively colors on PS2, while on Xbox it boasts more marked graphic effects and greater image cleanliness. Finally, the hardware of the Microsoft console guarantees significantly faster loading which can have a weight during a long evening in multiplayer, with sudden changes of tracks and machines. To you the choice Born for multiplayer Mashed immediately betrays its nature as a title born for multiplayer, as soon as you realize that the single player mode is just a way to progressively unlock all the tracks, cars and modes to use in games with friends. Each track must be won three consecutive times, passing different tests. In most cases you have to score the required number of points before your opponents do, but there are several variations on this theme. Sometimes you have to finish first after a certain number of laps on the track; being able to shoot down a helicopter flying over the runway, hitting it with the weapons given by the power ups; you have to survive unscathed three laps on an icy track while avoiding the thrusts of your opponents, in a crescendo of variety which is, however, too small to justify the single player mode as a valid reason to buy. There are 13 courses, but getting through them won't take more than a couple of nights of intense play. Had there been an online mode, even players short on friends, willing to play long evenings, would have had some more motivation to get involved. Once you have overcome the various tracks and the relative rules governing solo battles, these will be available for multiplayer, where up to four players can collide, using a single pad to control two different cars, thanks to the trick that allows you to use the two levers of a joypad to drive as many cars. The real joker of the whole system is the ~Air Attack~ mode, which can be activated in direct clashes. Once activated, when eliminated, we are given the command of a sight with which to lock the opponents and blow them up with an automatic homing missile. Thus, each clash will be uncertain until the end, given that with a single torpedo you can send all your opponents off the track, evening the score and increasing the desire for revenge of the opponents who have seen all their efforts vanished in an instant. To move the runs without regole of Mashed, Supersonic have chosen to use Renderware, a software established thanks to the Grand Theft Auto saga, which is now widely used by all houses that want to develop multiplatform titles without wasting too much time in the technical design phase. The result can be defined as functional, but nothing more. Some light effects or the reflections that are generated on the wet or frozen surfaces of the Xbox version are nice, as is the vivacity of the colors of the PS2 version, but the complex remains that of a title that plays its cards elsewhere. Some light effects or reflections are nice ... but the complex remains that of a title that plays its cards elsewhere. The same goes for the audio sector, with average sound effects and an almost completely absent musical commentary. The dubbings, all in Italian, of the offenses that the pilots exchange by pressing the appropriate button on the pad deserve a separate mention. You can't help but smile at the first ~You're fast as a booger!~ or ~Son of a bitch!~, but in all likelihood they will soon be overwhelmed by the curses you will exchange with friends during games in company. Comment The question might be how does Mashed get such a high rating, compared to the little fame that precedes it. The answer is that, if only it had a more consistent single player mode, the possibility of online play and a graphics sector worthy of its great playability, this game would have deserved even more. The title of the Supersonics, already authors of MicroMachines 2, is a compendium of the best that a multiplayer title is able to offer: immediate, long-lived and capable of giving an irresistible experience. Anyone who has a group of friends, always looking for a home and a console with which to spend the evenings in joy, cannot help but consider buying this adrenaline concentrate. Lone wolves, on the other hand, had better direct their savings elsewhere. Pros: Exhilarating and irresistible multiplayer Playable in two even with a single joypad Cons: Graphically poorly cared for Single player mode meager Lack of online mode Admitting that you were taken by surprise by a game is a rare and comforting event. This happened with Mashed, which came from nowhere to give PlayStation 2 and Xbox users a multiplayer game to satisfy the thirst of gamers who don't have a plethora of titles available to revive tired evenings with friends. Few concepts, but well executed, for a really pleasant title that with a few tricks and online support would have been perfect.", "date": "2004-06-22", "grade": null}
