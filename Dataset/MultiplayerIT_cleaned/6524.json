Developed by the Viennese group Cliffhanger Productions, Aerena: Clash of Champions tried to propose a soup of those genres, slipping in some ideas taken from MOBAs and thus attracting the attention of strategy enthusiasts on PC and mobile. However, despite the good feedback received and the Austrian developer's numerous attempts to enrich the experience with new content and updates, the free-to-play model seems to have proved counterproductive, driving away a large portion of users. A year after its debut, Aerena thus returns to mobile devices and PCs with a re-edition entitled Masters Edition, which abandons the free-to-play formula but which, in essence, changes very little. The masters of the ether Aerena: Masters Edition begins in media res, right in the middle of the action. In fact, as soon as you start the game, you immediately find yourself in a match against an opponent controlled by artificial intelligence. A fairly (but not completely) guided challenge, which serves as a tutorial and aims to explain what the basic rules are. Once the main mechanics have been described and given the few necessary inputs, the tutorial releases the grip on the player and makes him go alone on his bicycle. Aerena: Masters Edition, we said, is the same and identical turn-based strategy released last year with the subtitle of Clash of Champions. Almost like a board or card game, the two challengers face each other and with a small arena in between. At the start of the match, you have to decide which of the champions to bring into battle and in which boxes to place them, after which the objective becomes to eliminate the opposing ship by attacking it directly or by taking out the opposing units. The strategic component of Aerena is perceptible right from the start, given that each character has different characteristics, movement capabilities, strengths or defense points, special abilities or attack range. Inside the arena there can be a maximum of three champions on each side, but each team can have two reserves on the bench, thus allowing some characters to be replaced during the match to better neutralize the opponent's game. In the first few training matches or against other live users, it is likely that you tend to play in a very predictable way, but it is only after a large number of matches that you begin to carefully exploit all the advantages and weaknesses of the own characters. For example, Crank is a strong character, has little mobility but does a lot of damage and, above all, is able to push opponents to other adjacent squares (perhaps right above a trap). Hammer has the ability to self-destruct and cause damage to both sides (but with a little cunning, the opponent will lose the most points). Then there's Bloody Mary, who can hit opponents from a distance with her rocket launcher, making her a particularly annoying character. These are just some of the champions available, because as in a trading card game it is then possible to unlock new ones to strengthen your team or create new strategies. Aerena is back on tablets and smartphones, an interesting mix of turn-based strategy and MOBA Premium is not better Overall, Aerena's rules work extremely well, making it a fast and balanced turn-based strategy game. Each match lasts no more than a quarter of an hour, and every time damage is received, points are also obtained to spend to activate special abilities, thus maintaining a balance and giving the player at a disadvantage the possibility of overturning a game. Even aesthetically, the Cliffhanger Productions game looks very good, with a setting close to steampunk and pleasant 3D graphics. If anything, the problem is that even the Masters Edition seems to be designed almost exclusively to be played on the iPad. The development team made no effort to adapt the interface to the smaller screen of smartphones, and so even on the iPhone 6 the texts appear tiny and a large part of the touch screen is occupied by two large vertical bands. Although the free-to-play formula of Clash of Champions has been left behind, the new edition of Aerena still maintains microtransactions and in-app content, but luckily all characters, ships and upgrades can also be purchased with normal currency of the game; a separate discussion for embellishments such as clothes and new skins, which have no effect on the gameplay but can only be purchased for usegoing the so-called Aether Coins. The real problem of the ~new~ Aerena, however, is linked to its still limited diffusion. At the time of writing, the game's community is still quite poor, making it very often difficult to find opponents in ranked matches. In the absence of a campaign, or of interesting content for the single player, this represents an abnormal flaw for a Premium game.", "date": "2015-03-04", "grade": "7.0"}
