{"name": "Vernal Edge: la recensione del metroidvania ambientato a Laputa", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/vernal-edge-recensione.html", "text": "If you've ever dreamed of playing a 2D metroidvania with the structure of Hollow Knight and the aesthetics of Laputa - Castle in the Sky, one of Hayao Miyazaki's masterpieces, then Vernal Edge is the video game for you. Some say that pixel art is boring, but we don't agree because when it's done well it gives back a retro charm that contributes greatly to the effectiveness of the atmosphere created by the developers. It is evident that in the game developed by Hello Penguin and published by PID Games there are many mechanics similar to Team Cherry's metroidvania. More than a copy-paste, however, it seems that the developer has used that model so as to make the platform and combat-related mechanics familiar. We also appreciated the ability to choose the difficulty level to make the game more accessible and less frustrating when needed. From the combat system to the atmosphere, this game amazed us thanks to a non-linear progression system and a very low use of backtracking which made the exploration of this floating universe always new and varied. In this Vernal Edge review we explain why, in our opinion, this game is the best way to train and enjoy a good story while waiting for the sequel to Hollow Knight: Silksong. The Castle in the Sky In Vernal Edge you will take on the role of Vernal, a girl with a thirst for revenge on a mission to kill her father There is little to go around it, Vernal Edge seems to be set in the world of Laputa - Castle in the Sky, the cult film of the Japanese animation master Hayao Miyazaki. The various game maps are floating islands that for unknown reasons have begun to rise in the sky after a cataclysmic event, our adventure companion is a scientist locked up in the body of a robot who has lost his memory and the technology present in the game is the reflection of a shining past now fallen into ruins. If you loved that retro-futuristic aesthetic with a hint of decadence and medieval armor then you will feel at home in this game because rarely from such an obvious quote has a different and at the same time familiar product emerged from the material from which it was inspired. The story is classic: players take on the role of Vernal, a girl who is on a mission to find and kill her father, one of the most famous scientists in the universe, who seems to have done her an unforgivable wrong. There is also a mysterious cult that has taken over the floating islands and is determined to stop Vernal, no matter what. To complicate everything, our heroine is armed with a mythical sword, a powerful relic of the past that is tempting to all her enemies who, obviously, want to take possession of it by any means. The narrative develops in a non-linear way, like the exploration, even if, due to some blocks in the progression, there are certain obstacles to overcome or skills to acquire in order to continue from one macro-area to the next. At sword point The fights in Vernal Edge are frenetic and multifaceted even if the enemies are not very varied Looking at the combat system, the similarities with Hollow Knight become more evident. Killing smaller enemies (one of which looks straight out of Team Cherry's masterpiece) is the only way to recover lost health between save points. Our main weapon, the mythical sword, can strike in the four canonical directions but also on the diagonals by activating the slide. By killing the most powerful enemies, then, we will receive in-game currency with which to buy upgrades both for the sword and for our techno-magical skills. In addition to health, in fact, we will have an energy bar (which recharges over time) to cast offensive and defensive technological spells. A maximum of 4 can be equipped at a time and we recommend a controller to make the most of them. The last aspect of combat is linked to one of the most important narrative themes of the game: memory. Vernal has a kind of RAM with a fixed number of slots that can accommodate passive modifiers. One of the first you unlock will turn your dodge into an attack that damages enemies and will take up 3 of the 5 available slots. With experience, exploration and credits you will be able to increase the RAM available and activate more passive modifiers to do more damage or be more resistant, shaping the game according to your needs. Old fashioned exploration To explore the islands of Vernal Edge you will have to combine jumps and dodges with precision, only in this way will you be able to reach the most inaccessible ravines Like any self-respecting metroidvania, Vernal Edge also has an explorationone layered, challenging and fun. Many of the platforming mechanics present will be familiar to lovers of the genre while those facing a game of this type for the first time will find themselves faced with no small challenge. It takes coordination and concentration and the absence of frequent save points means that you could lose even 10 or 15 minutes of the game if your life bar were to reach zero. Some sections of jumping and dodging are mandatory in order to reach the object, skill or enemy needed to continue, but most are optional and eventually hide a new spell, a disk fragment to expand your RAM or a Heart Shard to increase your health. Where the game let us down a bit is in its handling of the more difficult and inescapable combat moments. If Hollow Knight had a plethora of unique and iconic bosses at its disposal, Vernal Edge, for the first 4 or 5 hours of the game, puts the protagonist in front of closed rooms full of the usual enemies encountered in exploration with a little more health or an additional stun orb. In fact, to defeat an enemy more quickly, it is possible to stun him, which will make him more vulnerable to damage and will render him briefly harmless. To do this, it is essential to know how to use Vernal's charged shots that are activated by holding down the attack button. While airborne, it is possible to land up to three hits while remaining suspended in the air but be careful because it is not possible to jump a second time after attacking so watch where you plan to land. It doesn't matter if you prefer combat, exploration or a fishing mini-game that ate two hours of our lives, whatever you do will be accompanied by a beautiful techno-fantasy soundtrack. Here Vernal Edge has managed to concentrate the essence of its retro-futuristic setting to create a truly iconic and never boring collection of music.", "date": "2023-03-29", "grade": "7.5"}
