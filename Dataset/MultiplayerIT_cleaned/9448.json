Julia Innocent Eyes - Black Tears only manages to confirm the fact that the three separate games were in principle a single game, badly divided to raise cash. Why badly? Well, if the first puzzle of a standalone game necessarily requires having played the other two to understand something, it becomes clear that we are dealing with a disassembly operation, rather than a project born in episodes. In fact, just compare it with any Telltale episodic game to understand how episodic, in Julia's case, is simply a hiccup. Of course, even series like Sam & Max or Monkey Island are best enjoyed if played in order, but there is not a single episode that presents puzzles that are difficult to solve if you haven't played the previous ones and, above all, each episode has its own breath . The same overall structure of Julia is strongly affected by the unnatural fragmentation, which would not have been felt if the chapters had been merged. Of course, nothing is built with ifs and buts, but we believe it is important to explain how a gaming experience can be worsened even by ill-considered publishing choices, which necessarily enter the critical discourse. Bitter tears Another puzzling aspect is the duration. While the second episode had engaged us for a few hours longer than the first, Black tears is a decisive step backwards in this sense. Three hours are enough to finish it and most of the time is spent listening to dialogues. The puzzles are few, the subgames are six in all, four of which are easy, one challenging and one frustrating. And the investigative sections present in the previous chapters have disappeared. Half of the time you are forced to retrace locations you have already seen and it is clear that you are at the end of a story, because the few puzzles seem to resolve themselves. The only novelty is the possibility of guiding Leo Baxter in three sequences, two of which are very short, bringing the directly controllable characters to four. The plot is what you expect and ends the story of the first two episodes. It's not bad, but it doesn't stand out due to all the other issues listed, which castrate the overall experience. The graphics engine has remained that of the previous chapters, without any adjustments, as have the system requirements, unusually high for a title that could easily run on a PlayStation 2. So expect poorly detailed three-dimensional models, bare environments with textures faded and a few too many glitches that are never good for health.", "date": "2011-02-28", "grade": "5.0"}
