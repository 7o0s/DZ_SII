In short, the secret of success seems to have been the continuous support on the project with regular updates and also listening to community feedback. Of course, Rainbow Six: Siege also has some flaws and it is literally impossible to please every single player but what the Ubisoft Montreal team has set up is certainly to be taken as an example if you want to reach high levels. A very precise development plan therefore, with scheduled stages capable of combining the spectacularity of competitive matches with the presentation of new operators, but also the ability to know how to remove game elements that do not work or that have become old to replace and refresh them duty. It therefore happens that with Grim Sky, the latest operation to arrive on the game servers, the Hereford map is re-proposed after being adapted to the direction taken by Rainbow Six: Siege and two new operators are also added. Can we therefore be satisfied once again with the work done by Ubisoft? Let's try to find out together. A new map with a nostalgic flavor Hereford isn't a completely new map since it's part of that content revamp we were talking about earlier. It is difficult to find a team willing to completely review their work and admit that something is not working properly but Ubisoft, rather than leaving obsolete maps in rotation, (as Blizzard has already done in its time with Heroes of the Storm and others before that) has wisely decided to remove this type of content from the game, rework it and later bring it back in an improved version to the ~new generation~ of players. The process is certainly not simple or painless, but it is also true that in this way you can recycle old ideas, tear them from what doesn't work and have new locations with nostalgic touches: an explosive mix perfect for all lovers of the French war shooter . So it happens that Hereford returns after almost three years to propose new lines of fire and unprecedented strategies, aligned with the new operators and increasingly extravagant skills introduced with the latest operations. With increasingly over the top mechanics, therefore, a design that keeps up with the times is needed and Hereford does it great, demonstrating how it is possible to adapt old maps without completely distorting them. The location is still recognizable but the engagement and defense strategies have changed radically, given that there are now more flights of stairs thanks to which to move between one level and another and it is necessary to keep an eye out on several fronts, in defense as well as in attack. Even the spaces inside the buildings have changed, with wide-ranging rooms where you can engage in interesting shootouts with your opponents, for a much higher dynamism than its previous version. Obviously, the whole aesthetic aspect also changes with Ubisoft artists capable of rethinking a different setting, taking advantage of the light drizzle that cloaks the play area, dramatically improving its atmosphere. Two new operators to complete the package Maps aside, the real highlight of Grim Sky is obviously the arrival of Maverick and Clash, two new operators divided equally between attack and defense, so as to maintain the numerical balance. After forty operators, inventing something completely new and impacting on the gameplay is undoubtedly difficult, much more than reimagining a map for the current meta. But Maverick is an interesting addition, a gimmick that can radically change the way you defend and attack. In addition to his standard assault loadout, Maverick is equipped with a very functional blowtorch, thanks to which he can pierce virtually any surface, including reinforced and electrified walls. So imagine if from the wall that you thought was impregnable until a few moments before someone opened a small hole and created new lines of fire, not only to identify you but also to suddenly score some well-placed shots. A strategy of sure effectiveness, which improves further if we think that thanks to the physics of Rainbow Six: Siege it will be possible to repeatedly pierce the walls creating gaps through which to pass crouched, a surprise that very few, at least until today, expect in the game. Maverick is therefore capable, by itself, of changing many strategies, without, among other things, adding gadgets too imaginative or imaginary, an element that was starting to make the community turn up their noses, accustomed to more classic and reality-related features. In short, Maverick is an operator with incredible versatility for attacking secretly but also indispensable for destroying the usually immovable defensive gadgets such as Maestro's mobile shields and CLE-V. If that weren't enough, even his Ar-15.50 assault rifle is particularly fearsome despite the single shot, an option that can be replaced with the more classic M4 if you want a higher rate of fire. On the other hand we find Clash, which unfortunately didn't hit us as positively. Not so much in terms of effectiveness, but because we've already seen a lot of operators with shields in Rainbow Six: Shield. To try to get our favor, Clash makes it up to you, however, with a taser integrated into the shield, based on the cooldown of the battery and usable without too many limitations. The downside of this Operator is his need to carry the shield on his back in case he wants to use firearms, which makes him very useful over short distances and more disadvantaged in changing game situations. The Clash shield, a unlike those of Blitz and Montagne it completely protects the operator from frontal attacks and the only way to remove it is to hit it in melee or use grenades. His application in defense is interesting, which not only makes him the classic turtle to contest specific points but also allows him to come out and play relatively safely as a scout. Curious to see its applications in the competitive field.", "date": "2018-09-14", "grade": "8.0"}
