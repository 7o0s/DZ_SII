In the case of Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands, the developers have decided to avoid comparison with the ~major~ consoles and to go down the road of revisiting. In fact, this new episode of the series on PSP incorporates many of the elements that characterized the gameplay of the original Prince of Persia, the one released for Apple II in 1989 and converted the following year for all platforms of the time. We therefore have the character who moves in a two-dimensional context, blades that protrude from the ground, platforms to jump on and enemies to fight with the sword. The plot sees our Prince busy defending his family and his kingdom from the assault of a fire demon, exploring a series of scenarios with the help of Helem, one of the daughters of the God of Time. The latter appears in the form of a sphere of light and gives the Prince the power to control time: when Helem approaches a trap or a moving object, he can slow down or speed up its functioning to allow us to pass unscathed. The same magic can be used against the enemies that we will face during the game, increasingly cunning and resistant. Something old, something new There are seventeen stages to be overcome to complete the game, and in three of them we will find ourselves facing bosses. The Prince's mission begins from the desert ~canyons~, in which we must repeatedly resort to the character's ability to run on the walls, and then move to the city gates, where we also become familiar with his ability to jump from a ledge to a other to overcome passages that develop vertically. The opening of new doors coincides with a minigame in which Helem starts a sphere inside a small labyrinth dotted with barriers: our goal is to speed up or slow down the movement of the object so that it never comes into contact with obstacles, an eventuality that would restart the test from the beginning. The control system of Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands adapts to the two-dimensional gameplay, assigning the movement of the character to the d-pad while the main console buttons are used to jump (X), attack with the sword (Square) and parry ( Circle). The Triangle button is only useful when you are near a ~magic fountain~, to activate the upgrades screen: inside the stages there are many spheres of light to collect, and we can use them to buy health bar improvements or new offensive maneuvers. The latter make the fights decidedly more articulated and fun than in the early stages, marked by the classic (it is appropriate to say it) jab / parry sequence that also characterized the original Prince of Persia. The Prince can acquire the power to charge an extremely powerful shot, jump on opponents' heads and strike them from above, swing mid-air, instantly counterattack or rebound off walls and then launch backwards like a drill. In addition to accessing upgrades, the ~magic fountains~ are very important because they allow us to restore the health bar and above all the ~lives~ we have available to cross the scenarios, which are increasingly full of pitfalls. Magilandia, fifth blue dimension The controls don't always react promptly to our inputs, plus on certain occasions the game asks a little too much in terms of responsiveness. In such situations it happens that, for example, the X is not ~received~ by the system, transforming a spectacular sequence of jumps and climbs to the limit into a frustrating ~game over~. Moments like this are unfortunately quite frequent, just think of the cases in which we have to face desperate runs while everything around us collapses, repeating the section many times until we have it perfectly memorized, also calculating any delays in responding to commands. The situation is complicated by the management of Helem: as previously written, the daughter of the God of Time allows us to control the operating speed of the traps or sand flows and these functions are performed by acting on the L and R back keys. The problem is that, in the presence of multiple controllable objects, Helem must be moved from one target to another using the analog stick. As long as it is the game itself that moves our shiny friend's field of action, everything is fine and you can tackle sequences of fast jumps and in the name of absolute precision, but when you have to simultaneously remove your thumb from the d-pad to movere Helem with the analog stick, then everything becomes very, very complicated. Bordering on cumbersome, to be honest. Due to the complexity of some sequences from a certain point on (see when you jump from one stream of sand to another, ~freezing~ them one at a time, on the fly), the frustration of losing lives to the fault of the controls is felt a lot'. In the same way, however, the imagination of the developers of the Canadian division of Ubisoft must be recognized for having invented truly spectacular and fun situations to ~solve~, which alone are worth the price of the game. The technical realization is of an excellent level, with the edges of the polygonal models that are hidden by the small dimensions in the standard view and a series of really beautiful scenarios to see. The animations of the Prince are very well done, although for obvious reasons it was not possible to replicate the ~wow~ effect that accompanied the release of the original Prince of Persia, in which we saw the first ever form of motion capture.", "date": "2010-06-10", "grade": "7.5"}
