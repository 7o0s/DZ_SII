{"name": "Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-vegas-2-recensione.html", "text": "100 points for a shot to the head, 50 to the chest Experience is the basis of everything now, as in any RPG, or rather as in Call of Duty 4, we are given the possibility to specialize our alter ego in 3 main skills: precision, melee combat and assault, the latter relating to the use of explosives and the killing of enemies in cover. Obviously the way in which enemies are hit rewards the player in a particular skill rather than another: a sharp shot from a distance gives us points in accuracy, killing enemies by shooting blindly behind cover increases the experience in close combat and so on . From a single player point of view, this new system called A.C.E.S., an acronym for Advanced Combat Enhancement Specialization is just a good method to diversify the action, to make the way in which new weapons and new equipment are unlocked intriguing and decidedly engaging, but if you look at it under the lens of online gaming, both cooperative and ~competitive~, it acquires considerable thickness and depth. Specializing your soldier therefore becomes an imperative both when facing the single player campaign in two players (no longer four) and when challenging other human opponents in online games. It is therefore essential to have a certain type of approach to battles to get the right clothing and weapons to play according to the chosen style. Obviously in the story mode the specialization is not as absolute as in the titles in which the mechanics necessarily revolve around this, choosing a weapon of a given caliber rather than another, endowed with peculiar characteristics such as penetration and stopping power is a necessary and essential choice to survive in very fierce matches against human players. The A.C.E.S system therefore it works perfectly, the challenge rate always remains very high, also because thanks to these ~specialist~ mechanics, Vegas 2 invites us to play by constantly pondering our movements. In short, no entrances with your head down in a room, given that even at the lowest difficulty level the game becomes decidedly difficult as the levels progress. 100 points for a shot to the head, 50 to the chest In terms of small additions, applause must be given to the race: thanks to this, the outflanking maneuvers are decidedly easier to perform, as is running away from a grenade that is too close. Maneuver only defensive as it is impossible to shoot during a dash. The cooperative mode (also locally via split screen), another plus of the first chapter has undergone a substantial change, no longer four human players but only two, in addition to the two soldiers managed by artificial intelligence. Unfortunately, only the host of the game can give orders, consequently the guest to play remains a bit on the sidelines, being unable to do anything but shoot at the enemies who are still standing. This thing is particularly irritating when the team leader dies: waiting for the respawn, the two companions remain without orders hoping that sooner or later someone will tell them what to do. But especially if the skirmish mode, or Terrorist Hunt can be played in four, why the single player campaign only in two? Bishop we are surrounded! Still on the subject of artificial intelligence, that of the opponents seems to have benefited from some improvements: now they are decidedly more aggressive and act more in concert trying to surround our leather heads, even if sometimes they don't seem to notice a comrade killed with a precise headshot at two meters. The same thing can be said for their fellow soldiers who enjoy good aim, but have the tendency to remain more often than not exposed to enemy fire, disdaining any type of cover other than that designated by the squad leader. Despite many ups and downs, Vegas 2 is always fun and extremely rewarding to play, both for the excellent level design and for the many tactical possibilities offered by the immediate, but at the same time complete, team management. You are always on the who goes there, you will always make small movements in the open field, the L1 backbone assigned to cover will be consumed more than the fire button. The tension, also thanks to the infrequent save points, is always high, and reaches its peak when, as experienced in a mission set in a climbing gym, you find yourself surrounded, with opponents sprouting from everywhere, even descending from above with ropes. From this point of view, Vegas 2 constantly forces us to have our eyes open, to peer behind every parapet or desk, also helping us thanks to the very useful tactical map, or the equally indispensable scansni thermal satellites. Bishop we are surrounded! On the multiplayer side, three new modes have been added, in addition to the canonical deathmatch and team deathmatch: attack and defense, team leader and total conquest. The latter is particularly interesting and adrenaline-pumping given that in time limit we have to conquer and keep on three connections with the satellite. Obviously the reversals of the front between areas taken and then suddenly lost become normality, like the frantic races between one control point and another. Unfortunately it was not possible to test the goodness of the net code since the servers were still closed, but without a doubt it is possible to bet on the excellent quality of the mechanics given the excellent implementation of the same in the first chapter. It remains to be understood why the Xbox 360 version supports up to sixteen players while the PlayStation 3 version supports fourteen. Graphically, the Unreal Engine used in this second chapter has not undergone any upheavals, and apart from some improvements on the Rainbow team models and weapons, it is completely similar to what we saw almost two years ago now. Consequently, the general aspect, however well built, detailed and animated, does not represent the best present at the moment, especially as regards the environments. Honor to credit for the partial destructibility of the environments, a necessary requirement given that the assault skill involves killing enemies in cover: the heights of Call of Duty 4 cannot be reached with large-caliber bullets that pierce walls, but less durable armor will be shattered by precise volleys from a shotgun or assault rifle. Comment With Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas 2 the feeling of deja vu is clear, it's not a completely new experience, but thanks to small innovations, the title can be played with great pleasure both by those who have completed the first episode, and from those taking on the role of Team Rainbow for the first time. Some small flaws in terms of artificial intelligence, a graphic sector that is not always up to par, together with an unnecessary distortion of the cooperative mode are the critical issues that mainly emerge from this test. The question of originality remains on the plate: despite the well thought out A.C.E.S. and the new multiplayer modes, the gaming experience is very similar to what we saw in the first chapter. Is this a flaw in the absolute sense or is it the right price to pay for not overturning a practically perfect game too much? Despite everything Vegas 2 remains a solid fps, immediate, fun, extremely rewarding and long-lived. More of a data disk than a sequel in all respects, however, there were other more of the same of this level! Pros Persistent development of the A.C.E.S experience Fast-paced, tense and immediate Multiplayer well thought out and long-lived Cons Graphics not always up to par Underdeveloped two-player co-op More data disks than a full-fledged sequel", "date": "2008-03-20", "grade": null}
