In its nearly thirty-year roaring career, the Nintendo series has seen us race the most incredible tracks: from the incandescent corridors of Bowser's Castle to increasingly psychedelic variations of the Rainbow Road, from the gears of the Tictac Track to the bucolic farms of the Green Prairie, passing through airports, volcanoes and submarine tracks. After the Hyrule track or the futuristic F-Zero track, we thought we'd seen them all, and instead we laughed heartily as we watched our living room transform into a game setting. We've tried Mario Kart in VR, we've played it in the arcade, but never before have we become part of the world ourselves, and there's something unique about realizing that you've lost a race because you crashed into the your foot. By combining a radio-controlled car, a camera and software on the Switch, Nintendo and American developer Velan Studios have created a racing game that is both toy and video game. Sworn enemy of your cats, ruler of your living room, through a mixed reality system Mario Kart Live transforms the room into a circuit full of obstacles, traps and turbos, in a home variant of the classic Mario Kart. But once the novelty effect is over, after the initial surprise, what's left? For our review we ransacked the house for a few days. Mario needs his space After associating the small plastic kart with the Switch software through a QR code, a tutorial allows you to become familiar with driving, drifting and using objects. Once all four cardboard doors have been placed on the floor, however, you can finally access the creation of the track and the different game modes. When deciding how to arrange the doors, one immediately realizes whether one's room is spacious enough for an optimal experience: they can be at any distance from one another, but since they must all necessarily be positioned, one must strive to exploit the spaces at one's own arrangement to create an interesting circuit that is not limited to a tiny oval. The stakes imposed by the walls of the house stimulate creativity and imagination, but it is clear that the less space you have available and the fewer variations it is possible to create. There's no getting around it: those who have a small bedroom, or can't afford to free up much space in the living room, simply won't be able to fully enjoy Mario Kart Live. The track editor is designed to be as intuitive as possible: with the kart's wheels covered in paint (obviously virtual), the player can ~draw~ the track by driving the car inside the room and customize the doors with object cubes , turbos or traps. Once back at square one, you're finally ready to take on Bowser Jr. and the Bowserotti in Grand Prix races, challenge friends in multiplayer or try to beat your own records in Time Trial mode. A different Grand Prix The heart of the game, especially if you don't have a friend with a second kart (and a second console) is obviously represented by the Grand Prix competitions. Eight trophies made up of three different circuits, which differ in setting and obstacles. The shape of the circuit remains the one you drew in the editor (and which you can change whenever you want between one race and another), but each level ~transforms~ your environment according to the theme or scenario. With some filters and some embellishments the atmosphere of the room is distorted, which passes in an instant from the thick jungle to the seabed, but even more important are the changes to the gameplay. Boo's Castle is full of ghosts which, if hit, end up reducing the visibility of the track, in another circuit the rain causes turbo mushrooms to grow in the tall grass, while in yet another a sandstorm causes the kart to skid , pushing him to the edge of the track. The way in which the behavior of some objects has been modified is also original: if mushrooms, shells and bananas have not changed by an iota, the Categnaccio becomes a malus in Mario Kart Live, which tugs the player's kart left and right, making it difficult to continue straight along the path. There is also room for some new items, with the old Kamek who seems to take revenge for all the times he was excluded from the series: when activated, the funny Magikoopa reflects the camera, forcing the player to run in a mirrored version of the room in which it is located. The effect is nothing short of alienating. A livelier Mario than usual There yesit takes a while to get used to the new view of the game, with the camera just above Mario's shoulders. This much closer perspective compared to the classic Mario Karts, however, allows you to appreciate the many small details of the kart and the character. The way Mario is animated, he appears much more lively and aware of his surroundings: when the game is first started, he looks around the room in amazement, taps into the camera to warn the player and falls asleep at the wheel if the console is left in standby. The kart in the game follows exactly the design of the radio-controlled car, but if you pay attention you will notice that in the game, in addition to the speedometer, there is a fuel gauge that indicates the battery level of the kart. The limits of the game After a certain number of trophies won, it is possible to unlock the 150cc and 200cc classes, allowing the small radio-controlled kart to reach significantly higher speeds than the 50cc, where it is instead a real snail. In the 200cc, in particular, the kart is a splinter, making the races more adrenaline-pumping and stimulating the creation of circuits with long straight stretches where you can whiz at top speed. The coins collected during the competitions instead give access to aesthetic customizations, such as clothes for Mario (or Luigi), karts with the most unlikely appearance and different types of horns. These unlockable extras add a vague sense of progression, but in the absence of an online mode in which to show off they represent a side element. The story is different for the music, for the settings and for the objects that are obtained by completing the Grand Prix, since they allow you to customize even more the circuits created for the free and timed modes. When it works at its best, Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit is energizing. As you throw red shells and avoid bananas, you see your apartment from a whole new perspective, and ordinary, inanimate objects can become unpredictable obstacles. A ball rolled across the room resembles the giant boulders of Cioccocanyon, a plant pot takes on the role of a round grip, your legs can transform into a tunnel, and a notebook can become a small bump. But as new paths are experimented and the imagination is set in motion by using real objects, the different limits of the game also emerge. Forget about making courses that expand through multiple rooms, because it only takes the kart to move a few meters away from the console before the camera image starts to get corrupted and eventually you lose control of the car. Nintendo recommends not exceeding 5 meters away from the kart, but as long as there is an obstacle in the middle (such as a wall) or that the wireless signal is disturbed by several devices nearby, to further reduce the effective distance. Another limit is given by the interface that the game superimposes on the real world, since this does not always succeed effectively. In non-optimal light conditions, the camera has a little more difficulty recognizing doors and signals, and since the software cannot distinguish the floor from a wall, it has happened on several occasions that the edge of the road was confused with the wall or with an obstacle. During a race, when you are focused on the objects to collect, the opponents to overcome and the road to follow, it will not be uncommon to crash into the wall without realizing it. Again, the ideal would therefore be to play in a spacious environment and as free from obstacles as possible, also because some environments, such as the underwater one or the desert one, limit visibility to such an extent that you will often end up hitting the leg of a table or the edge of an armchair. To avoid making the experience too frustrating, the development team decided not to penalize those who cut corners and find themselves off the course, as long as they pass correctly through the four doors (even, the game turns a blind eye if they leave skip one once in a while). Especially in multiplayer challenges, Nintendo therefore suggests using heavy objects (such as backpacks, boxes and books) to delimit the path and prevent one of the players from competing too cleverly, but the players are left free to indulge themselves, create shortcuts or use a carpet to make some sections of the route more difficult to walk. Little red car, where are you going? Obviously much of the charm of Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit depends on the small radio-controlled kart, red in the version with Mario and green for Luigi. Light and lively, the plastic kart does not hide any particular surprises. It is in fact a sparse toy caror controlled 2WD, which responds to game inputs by locking the rear wheels or ~pulling~ the front wheels in one direction or another. The effect, once in-game, is actually successful, but the experience is designed for internal use (even the software does not recommend playing away from home) and it shows. The decision to opt for two-wheel drive, combined with the absence of any type of suspension and the reduced size of the wheels leads the car to often and willingly get stuck in some obstacles, such as a simple cable or a bump with a steeper slope. In short, those who hoped to create tracks full of ramps, gradients and loops of the loop will have to revise their expectations. In line with Nintendo's indications, the battery of the kart lasted just under an hour and a half playing mainly at 150cc, while - depending on the situation - the distance reached by the car was on average between four and five meters compared to the console. Better as a couple? Having only one kart available, during our test we were unable to try multiplayer in the company of a second player. And perhaps, among all, this is the biggest limitation of Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit. The need to have a console and a kart for each of the players makes the multiplayer experience expensive and exclusive, and we really wonder how many will have the opportunity to share it with a friend or another family member. From this point of view, the possibility of passing the console and taking turns in the Timed mode represents only a meager sop.", "date": "2020-10-14", "grade": null}
