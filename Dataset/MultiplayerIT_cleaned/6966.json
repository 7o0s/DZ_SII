When he arrives on the spot, the legendary warrior discovers that the assault was not random, but aimed at conquering a device with mysterious powers. Together with Leandra, a shrewd and instinctive girl but actually endowed with an intelligence out of the ordinary, given that it was she who built the devices that exploit the ancient Shianti crystals, Lone Wolf sets off on a mission full of pitfalls: recover the object that the Giaks have stolen and prevent their master from using its boundless power for his own purposes. We have therefore reached the third of the four acts that make up Joe Dever's Lone Wolf, the amazing mix of gamebook and RPG developed by the Italian team Forge Reply with the collaboration of Dever himself, who created the texts, the plot and the inevitable ~crossroads~ that have always characterized his works. The adventure must in fact be ~read~ like a novel, until one is called upon to make a choice or to engage in combat: in this situation the device must therefore be held horizontally and the mechanics become those of a traditional role-playing game with turn-based combat system. One of the peculiarities of this production is represented by the ~growth~ of the character over the course of the chapters (three for each act), who acquires more experience, improves his skills and learns new and devastating attack techniques which involve the use of the extremely powerful Sword of the Sun. Furthermore, the replayability factor should not be underestimated: in addition to the aforementioned crossroads, which lead to important turning points in the plot, it is in fact possible to shape the character of Lone Wolf according to our preferences, making him a master of sword, ax or war club, and providing him with a repertoire of different Kai powers on a case-by-case basis. During the fights, the warrior will in fact be able to unload a powerful psychic attack against his opponents, heal his own wounds, surround himself in shadow to dodge blows, call a real wolf to his rescue, draw energy from the wounds of his enemies and so on, in optics of a particularly multifaceted system open to the most varied strategic approaches. There is clearly no shortage of conventional moves based on edged weapons, throwing knives or darts, the effectiveness of which must be consolidated through the execution of simple quick time events, perfectly placed in the gameplay. Joe Dever's Lone Wolf - Il Tempio degli Shianti is the episode of maturity for this excellent RPG The Shianti Temple The adventure of Joe Dever's Lone Wolf continues, as per tradition, introducing a new and fearsome adversary with each act. In this case it's up to the Vordak, a sort of undead sorcerers who drag a heavy iron mace, are immune to psychic attacks and can use spells to steal our vital energy. The Vordaks join the types of enemies seen in the previous episodes, making up a fairly rich but above all well-characterized bestiary, which starts from the literary work of Joe Dever to provide each creature with a different modus operandi, as well as unique skills. The degree of challenge initially seems to be affected by the progress made during the first part of the story, but in reality it is simply a greater awareness that determines our moves and allows us to defeat a small group of orcs by launching a lethal combination of mystical and conventional maneuvers , topping it off with a few flaming or poisoned darts to deal extra damage. In fact, there is no discussion about the thickness of the experience: each weapon and armor has a durability that decreases based on use and forces us to take advantage of the rare encounters with merchants to restore their original state or enhance them using various materials found all over the world. inside the scenarios. Furthermore, it is necessary to know how to handle objects well, the possible practice of meditation and, in general, the state of health of the protagonist to avoid ending up in an ambush unprepared. The act is completed in just over three hours by reading quickly, but as already mentioned it is possible to replay it to experiment with different choices or a different approach to fighting. Certainly the developers have operated an excellent finishing process, which has smoothed the (few) edges of a responsive and precise touch control system in any area. Puzzles with the Shianti Cube also seem more accessible and are rarely frustrating, to the benefit of godibility of the adventure, assisted once again by a technical sector of excellent workmanship in terms of design, animations (albeit with some exceptions) and soundtrack. Now the anticipation is growing for the grand finale...", "date": "2014-08-07", "grade": "8.9"}
