This is the case with this Demon's Soul by From Software, a title developed exclusively for Playstation 3 which, in spite of everything and everyone, is gathering acclaim from critics and audiences all over the world. The game proposes at the plot level the almost primordial clash between good and evil, in this case inserted in a fantasy context. In the spectral Kingdom of Boletaria King Allant, in an attempt to give great prosperity and wealth to his people using the ancient power of souls, ends up unintentionally awakening the Ancient Demon, a gigantic Beast that according to an old legend was imprisoned in the depths of the Nexus , the world of the dead, and which instead from that moment begins to move for that of the living with its army of demons and various creatures, feeding on the souls of human beings. The player, in the role of the spotless and fearless hero, has the task of bringing back the light by moving in dark and at times dreamlike scenarios, freeing the souls of some legendary warriors and eliminating the monsters that gradually come against him. And it will be damned difficult. The Nexus At the beginning of the story, the player can create a personalized avatar by choosing his class from among the ten available. These take up those typical of the genre and therefore range from the canonical thief to the wiry warrior passing through wizards, knights and so on. Each of them is characterized by unique abilities, physical, intellectual and magical characteristics, also linked to the types of weapons and accessories that they will be able to use in the game. It should be noted that the choice of the latter elements is very important in relation to the type of PC that one has chosen to impersonate, since the overall weight of the equipment worn will affect the hero's movements and fatigue, especially in battle. Once this is done and after a short tutorial you are introduced to the Nexus, the focal point of the whole adventure. It is in fact from this place where the souls of the deceased dwell that all the main actions related to the strengthening of the character, his weapons, the purchase of objects and the learning of spells and moves are performed. It is also from here that you can access the maps. The game structure of Demon's Soul at first glance may seem similar to that seen in many other titles, therefore a sort of action-RPG with typically dungeon crawling elements. You explore, you fight with any means, you kill, you absorb souls. In reality, the gameplay of this product has several innovations that make it unique in its genre and profound in some aspects. Starting with the particular and in some ways innovative use it makes of online. This component is a fundamental element of the product and is, if desired, permanent. That is, it is present right from the start of the adventure if the console is connected to the PSN (the Playstation 3 automatically connects to the servers), influencing several aspects of the single-player game. Everything works almost as if you were in a permanent online world: while you explore, investigate, fight, you find traces of all the players who, at that moment or at other times, have crossed a given area, leaving a trace of their own presence. Soul hunter For example, it is easy to find their signaling messages. Any player can leave as many as he wants through his character by selecting one of the many predefined ones available, in order to warn, for example, another user of what awaits him continuing: a particularly ferocious and difficult monster, a rare object or groups of hidden enemies , and so on. To prevent some players accustomed to jokes from deceiving other users with fake reports, there is the possibility for everyone to assign votes to the messages found along the various paths. In this way, players can check from feeds whether the alert found is reliable or not, thus avoiding unpleasant surprises. Think, for example, of finding yourself in front of a terrifying demon where you were sure of recovering an easy precious object following a ~forged~ message... In some situations it is possible to see in the form of white figures the characters of the other players who are facing the same level at the same time, while scattered throughout the dungeons it is possible to encounter bloodstains by interacting with which the last moments of the life of the player will be revealed. player who lost his liferight at that point. These elements can also be useful for understanding what is hidden in the darkness of an area or on the corners of some streets. Or to plan the most suitable strategy to use to best deal with the monster that caused the death of the user to whom the bloodstain is associated. But it is the cooperative section that is the most interesting part of the Demon's Souls online game. Up to four players can team up to take on any dungeon together, as well as end-of-level monsters. There are two main modes related to multiplayer: if you are in solid form, in your body as a living person, you can summon up to three fellow venturers who will appear in the form of blue ghosts. All this is possible only thanks to the so-called Blue Eye Stones and finding a special ~marker~ through which you can check how many and which other players are online, their rank in the world rankings and their level of reputation. Conversely, if you find yourself in an undead, ghost condition, then it could be the user who is invoked in another player's game as a support ghost, so to speak. In both cases however, the only possible interaction with the other human gamers is limited to the exchange of goods and equipment, then once a fight is completed, each of the fellow venturers will return to their game, except for the player who acted as host calling out to others. Playstation 3 trophies There are 38 Trophies available in Demon's Soul. Of these there are 27 Bronze, 5 Silver, 5 Gold and 1 Platinum. While to collect the former it is necessary to work a little less, satisfying requirements such as obtaining the best weapon from Clearstone or Hardstone, or assassinating a specific demon, for the latter, especially the Gold ones (which once conquered will unlock the Platinum one) it will be necessary literally go out of their way since to obtain them it will be necessary to learn all the spells or recover the rarest weapons, for example. Author online The other system linked to multiplayer is instead a little more subtle: in practice, with the help of the Black Eye Stone, a player can transform himself into a black ghost and invade the game of any other user connected to the network. By doing this, the invader can challenge the unfortunate and involuntary host in a battle to the death, after which he can literally loot the stocks of the defeated by stealing all the souls collected up to that moment. With serious consequences on the balance of the world. In fact, it is necessary to pay close attention to the actions performed by one's virtual alter ego: they can influence the surrounding environment thanks to the so-called World Tendency. This sort of meter of the level of Good or Evil present in the various areas in which we move takes into account the deeds of the protagonist: if he kills demons and similar amenities, then the explored area will tend, for example, to have a positive status which will translate into particular optimal conditions for the player, such as enemies with a lower number of HP or a lower level of physical and magical strength, or opponents no longer present in points where they previously stopped. Again, the hero controlled by the player will gain more power or be able to access side missions. Conversely, ignoring bad opponents and massacring some innocent people, the ~indicator~ will tend towards black, and all around, fomented by hatred and malice, will make the mission difficult. It should be noted that always depending on the level of goodness or evil of a given place, some characters with whom to interact or fight may or may not appear. During games with the internet option activated it is interesting to note how it is influenced by all players connected to the server in which you are connected. Whether in certain areas the level of goodness or badness will be high or low, in essence, will depend on the actions performed by all online users. Not a simple action Whether you play or not with the internet option activated, Demon's Soul is always and in any case a very difficult product to carry on, for some casual gamers it can even be frustrating. For example, there are no checkpoints. This means that every time you get killed you have to start a level from the beginning. And all enemies that were previously eliminated will be in their places again. Fortunately, in some points of the map it is possible to create shortcuts that can be useful for moving from some initial locations to other more internal ones. If you are killed you can continue fighting as a ghost but with only half your total energy waiting to recover your body(defeating an end-of-level boss or finding some special stones - Ed) and even if it is true that in this case the opponents in turn become a little less difficult, they still remain difficult to beat. Without forgetting the perennial risk of losing all the accumulated souls if the red spot that indicates the place of death of one's character is not reached within the pre-established time frame. That Demon's Soul is not a simple hack & slash or dungeon crawling if you prefer it is demonstrated by the fact that the player must immediately approach the adventure in a fairly reasoned way, that is, without throwing himself headlong into battles like a madman. First of all, it is essential to fully explore every corner of the world of Boletaria so as not to lose precious objects and upgrades that are often essential to face the more advanced stages of the game. Atmosphere It is important to learn how to balance your hero's equipment in relation to your style of play (for example heavy weapon with heavy armor - Ed) with an eye to magic that should never be wasted. The various status bars relating to health, magic points and stamina level, the latter as we mentioned at the beginning of the article subject to decrease in relation to the equipment worn and the moves made (parries, attacks, running, etc.), must always be monitored to avoid running out of energy during a fight, which in the end turns out to be much more strategic than it may initially seem, as well as extremely interesting. Final note on the technical sector of Demon's Soul. Despite some drop in frame rate here and there and a level of detail that certainly doesn't make the most of the potential of the Playstation 3, the graphics of From Software's game are overall of good quality. The polygonal models are not exactly the best and their animations sometimes leave something to be desired, while the representation of the demons, often huge, compensates for the aforementioned lack. Yet despite everything the overall vision works, the atmosphere, the settings manage to be evocative, pleasing to the eye and at times engaging thanks also to a good attention to detail linked both to the system that manages the lights and to the one that regulates atmospheric phenomena such as wind or fog. To contribute there is also an audio sector that provides a soundtrack hinted in favor of more or less natural sounds such as the blowing of the wind, the sound of footsteps or the lamentations of demons which intensify that sense of unease that the game setting offers to the public.", "date": "2009-12-28", "grade": "9.0"}
