{"name": "Singstar Party", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/singstar-party.html", "text": "Low ranking Second edition of the karaoke game edited by Studio London, Singstar Party betrays its nature as a simple data disk right from the very first game screens, presenting menus and options that are completely unchanged and even offering the user the possibility of replacing the disk on the fly game with that of its predecessor. Nonetheless, given the peculiar nature of the Sony title, the fact that the only new features compared to the first Singstar are represented by a different tracklist are not surprising at all, nor do they lead to wrinkling one's nose at the sight of such immobility. After all, the possibilities for playful expansion of a karaoke game are not exactly numerous, quite the contrary. Having said that, the expectations that one places in front of Singstar Party are, so to speak, few but good: the game system is already tested, and all that would be needed are a convincing tracklist and a couple of elements capable of justifying the nickname ~Party~. Surprisingly, the Studio London title manages to miss both (very easy) targets. Scrolling through the list of songs that make up Singstar Party, a whole series of very unflattering conjectures come to mind regarding the musical selection of the Sony product. First of all, looking at some tracks, one has the clear sensation of being faced with an annoyingly cheap title: just think of ~Who do you think you are~, one of the worst songs ever by the long defunct Spice Girls (which is everything to say), or to ~Un giorno d'amore~ by Daniele Stefani, already not too famous at the time of the release of the album in question and which also soon fell into a well-deserved oblivion. Not to mention Fiorello's ~Vivere a Colori~In short, one gets the impression that the budget of Singstar Party was not sufficient to be able to win relatively recent hits, and that for this reason Studio London fell back on real scraps of the music industry. But that is not all. The composition of the Singstar Party tracklist clashes loudly with the target audience to which the title was addressed, especially in Italy where it enjoys the sponsorship of the television program for teenagers Amici di Maria de Filippi. With the exception of ~This Love~ by Maroon 5 and a very few others, it does not seem exaggerated to say that Singstar Party does not offer any song that can be known or at least appreciated by the entirety of its possible catchment area. The choice of pieces by Bennato, Oxa, Bert, Spagna, Paola and Chiara and company appears somewhat questionable not only due to the dubious reputation of the ~artists~ in question, but above all because they could hardly meet the tastes of the possible buyers of Singstar Party. And in a title that is totally based on the user's involvement with the songs on their tracklist, this is no small limitation. Tracklists Here is the detailed list of the 30 songs offered by Singstar Party. De gustibus. Alicia Keys - Fallin' Bill Withers - Ain't No Sunshine Bob Marley - No Woman No Cry Buggles - Video Killed The Radio Star Cyndi Lauper - Girls Just Wanna Have Fun Destiny's Child - Survivor Dido - White Flag Duran Duran - Hungry Like The Wolf Elton John & Kiki Dee - Don't Go Breaking My Heart Franz Ferdinand - Take Me Out George Michael - Faith Pink - Just Like A Pill Spice Girls - Who Do You Think You Are The Foundations - Build Me Up Buttercup The Police - Every Breath You Take Maroon 5 - This Love Jamiroquai - Cosmic Girl Sonny & Cher - I Got You Babe Bluvertigo - Other Forms Of Life Fiorello - Living in Color Loredana Bert - The Winter Sea Paola & Chiara - Blue Irene Grandi - Bad Girls Zeropositivo - Phases 883 - How come E.Bennato - It's about love Spain - People like us Alexia - Tell me like Anna Oxa - Without pity Daniele Stefani - A day of love My free song However, the doubts related to the musical selection of Singstar Party do not stop there. Some tracks simply appear too difficult to tune for individuals of average vocal ability (following Cindy Lauper's treble on ~Girls Just Wanna Have Fun~ or Alexia's screams on ~Tell Me How~ is prohibitively difficult for many), while others present sung sections so short or in any case so little varied as to find little reason to exist in a karaoke game (Take Me Out by Franz Ferdinand and Video Killed The Radio Star by The Buggles have an undoubted charm, but do not allow much space for the vocals of the 'user). In short, the Singstar Party tracklist could and should have been studied in a better way. As previously mentioned, the playful structure of the Studio London title has remained substantially unchanged, leaving room for a single novelty, namely the possibility of carrying outand real duets together with a second player in the songs that offer the occasion. By choosing pieces such as ~Don't Go Breaking My Heart~ by Elton John and Kiki Dee or ~I got You Babe~ by Sonny & Cher, the two users will immerse themselves in the parts of the artists in question, sharing the sung parts and not simply hollering in unison throughout the track. As interesting as these duets are, they often end up in too unbalanced situations, with one player assigned to give voice to the most important parts of the piece and the other forced to do a boring job as supporting actor. For the rest, Singstar Party has exactly the same modes as its predecessor, with a small space dedicated to the single player experience and three different options for multiple players, namely Duet, Battle and Pass The Microphone. Nothing new to report, therefore, but the qualitative abyss that separates the tracklist of Singstar Party from that of its predecessor makes the gaming experience with the latest Studio London title decidedly less satisfying and also for this reason not very suitable to be convincing from a multiplayer perspective. Comment Singstar Party is basically a title based on notable misjudgments. First of all, on the target user of the product: indicated to a young audience, the creation of Studio London presents an ~old~ tracklist and apparently aimed at saving, with tracks that may be little known or even unknown to most and which are unlikely to succeed to meet everyone's favor. As if the sensational slide on the musical selection were not enough, Singstar Party also disappoints in terms of the pleasure related to the performance of the individual pieces: some are too difficult to follow, others require considerable vocal skills, still others have sung parts that are too short or monotonous . Far from the goodness of its predecessor (reviewed here), Singstar Party is therefore a title that can only be recommended to those who consider the ~peculiar~ tracklist offered by the Studio London title to their liking, in which case the vote can be considered greater than a point. Pros: Proven game system 30 new songs Cons: Inadequate tracklist Some songs too difficult or boring to sing Short solo, not suitable as a party game After the success of Singstar, it was reasonable to expect that Sony would sooner or later come out with an update to be fed to users eager to try their hand at new singing feats: in fact, this was the case, and this Singstar Party presents itself with the beauty of 30 new pieces ready to be tuned. ~Beauty~ so to speak, unfortunately.", "date": "2004-12-03", "grade": null}
