{"name": "Kung Fu Chaos", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/kung-fu-chaos_a.html", "text": "Shao Ting chasing fame and glory! Shao Ting is a low-budget action movie producer who decides to finance an absolute masterpiece of the genre and to do so he needs the best actor around. Kung Fu Chaos, in single player mode, is the story of the most violent auditions that have ever been seen on the face of the earth and the fighter who emerges victorious will have the starring role in this unlikely colossal. This is the preamble to the game and its content, unfortunately, does not differ much in depth and variety of situations. Kung Fu Chaos takes up the structure of games such as Power Stone 2 and, after choosing one of the nine characters available, you have to face about thirty variable-themed stages, obtaining a minimum score of three stars, necessary to continue, up to a maximum of five, to unlock all the secrets available. These range from alternate character costumes, to bonus warriors, to new modes for multiplayer battles, to graphic effects that serve to recreate the look of the movies recalled by the game, both from the 70s and 50s, with cuttlefish bone filters and slow motion in profusion. The initial approach is very positive, the look, especially of the themed backdrops, is very spot on, both in terms of design and color choices. Cheap versions of some myths of world cinema have been reconstructed, from Jurassic Park, with a stuffed dinosaur that will chase you for an entire scheme, to an improbable Titanic, up to the farcical reproduction of Independence Day. scrolling, well thought out and full of surprises, alternate with sub-games in full party game style, where, for example, you will have to help shipwrecked people by throwing life preservers at them, make your opponents fall from an iceberg, having to save ninjas with a cloth they throw themselves from a building, avoiding flying cows(!), and others that are increasingly crazier and, why not, amusing. Shao Ting chasing fame and glory! The problem is that the difficulty in overcoming them all lies in knowing what will happen in the scheme, because the gameplay is reduced, too soon, to a frantic pressing of some key combinations. The moves available are very few: two attacks with the X and Y keys, a hold with B, the jump with A, the Right trigger to parry and the left one for the Taunt, which if performed three times will allow you to perform a fatal blow; add a few combos and the playground at your disposal will be complete in every attraction. Your opponents will oppose the blows rather naively, only some will be able to parry and retaliate to the attacks, but once you learn the combo to open their guard and the exact timing for the Taunt, you will have everything you need in your hands to reach the end of the schemes and to make the high scores. These problems are also found in the multiplayer mode, whose clashes take place in the same stages as the story mode and where, who already knows the various levels and who knows how to master the Taunt in the best way, will have the upper hand. The different modes available are too similar, only the rules for winning will change: who kills their opponents several times, who does the Taunt several times, who scores the highest and so on, but the basic simplicity remains. It's like imagining a football game where one time the one who hits the most crossbars wins and another time the one who hits the most posts, but having only the header and the low shot available. In the long run it becomes repetitive and there are no power ups, weapons or means available to collect and use against opponents, which can make the games more varied, if we exclude chairs, tables and crates scattered everywhere. Look at that move, feel that blow! To get an idea of the graphics of Kung Fu Chaos, you have to try to imagine a three-dimensional reconstruction of some SNK games like Metal Slug. The combinations of colors and textures are very similar and equally valid, the polygonal models are certainly not complex, far from it, but the frame rate is fixed at 60 frames per second, between tables, chairs and ninjas flying across the screen. The only note that can be moved is that it is not always very clean, thanks to a slightly excessive use of the Blur for the wide field, which in some stages (especially Jurassic Park and Independence Day) gets to make the rendering of the seabed in the distance. The soundtrack is very varied and allows you to choose from a number of different styles for the music, which fit the action perfectly and which are listened to willingly. Comment Kung Fu Chaos is a decent title I knowtto many points of view and its purchase can be taken into consideration by those looking for an immediate game to spend evenings with friends. Unfortunately, the discreet technical realization, the good design of the backdrops and settings and the natural sympathy that inspires at first glance, are not matched by a sufficient variety in the gameplay to guarantee a long and fully satisfying challenge even in multiplayer. Therefore, while not keeping many of the promises that the initial approach seems to imply, given that it will be marketed for only  39.99, the Just Add Monsters title becomes an almost obligatory choice for Xbox users looking for a party game. The biggest regret is represented by the choice of not having included this game in the Xbox Live program, also because add-ons and new features to download from the network would have greatly benefited the longevity. Pros: Nice and captivating graphics for an immediately positive approach Good fluidity and level design Immediate Absolutely competitive price Cons: Too simple and linear Lack of power ups and real variety in the gameplay, even for the multiplayer mode Xbox, among the good ideas already implemented in other consoles that preceded it, has taken over that of the four joypad slots to be proudly displayed in the front chassis. Four joypads mean evenings with friends to the sound of endless multiplayer challenges, side by side, between curses and laughter. Microsoft has commissioned the development of a series of titles that give its users the opportunity to take advantage of this feature and, apart from sports simulations, Kung Fu Chaos was one of the most anticipated games among them. Just Add Monsters, founded by former members of Sony Cambridge, is the English team that dealt with the development of this party game with a clear beat'em up matrix, inspired by those low-budget martial arts films of the seventies that pass in continuous rotation on myriads of local television networks. Among many very low level films there are the pearls of Bruce Lee and those of Jackie Chan, it remained to be seen in which range Kung Fu Chaos would be able to place itself.
