{"name": "Clash: Artifacts of Chaos", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/clash-artifacts-of-chaos-recensione.html", "text": "Pseudo, a hermit warrior who has moved away from the civilized world for who knows what reason, by chance meets a strange creature, called ~The boy~, who lived with his grandfather, who was killed in combat. Determined to help the boy, a furry black ball that looks like a black man mixed with a bird, Pseudo embarks on a long journey that will lead him to face many enemies with features that only the creativity of the Chilean studio ACE Team could conceive, the same as eccentric Zeno Clash, Rock of Ages and The Eternal Cylinder, just to name a few of their games. Be that as it may, if by reading these few lines you have heard echoes of God of War, you are not wrong because, as we will see in the course of the review, Clash: Artifacts of Chaos seems to be almost a caricature of the Sony Santa Monica title. That is, more than anything else a direct criticism of certain design choices. Exploration The enemies are original and very beautiful to look at There is profound beauty in the maze of paths and roads that make up the portion of Zenozoik, the world itself of the Zeno Clash, which Pseudo will have to travel to reach his destination. Architecturally and morphologically, the lands of Clash: Artifacts of Chaos seem to have little sense, but on closer inspection they appear as the objective correlative of the protagonist's consciousness, as well as the manifestation of the authors' will to make the player lose his way, in every sense. We look out from a ravine and we are enraptured by the amount of details that make up the formless and surreal landscape that we find before our eyes, with which Pseudo blends perfectly in its splendid otherness. It is jagged and has nothing human about it, but it is harmonious in its almost pictorial definition, a feature also underlined by the chosen graphic style based on pastel colors and outlines. Technically there is nothing monstrous, but it is difficult not to be enraptured by the general vision that the game conveys, precisely because of its uniqueness. Back to our senses, the first thing we notice is that we are not told what to do and where to go. To orient ourselves we have a very small map available, where Pseudo is represented by a circular icon. Furthermore, around we do not find large reference points to follow. From time to time we see some building appearing on the horizon, or it is the road itself that guides us, but getting lost is really easy, among sudden turns, walls to climb, ravines with treasures inside, crossroads without indications, roads that end up against walls and an almost endemic lack of suggestions that end up weighing especially in those cases in which it is necessary to retrace one's steps. It is easy to understand how leaving the player at the mercy of Zenozoik's labyrinthine geography, made up of large interconnected areas that are loaded from time to time, is a precise design choice, made in contrast to those games that hold the player by the hand from start to finish, never allowing it to truly get lost. The world of Clash: Artifacts of Chaos is beautiful It is clear that it is an approach that can prove problematic if you don't have a certain taste for exploration and a good tolerance towards the risk of going back and forth in search of the right path. Some will find it too indigestible, considering the current standards of the genre. In reality, having accepted the system, one ends up seeing it almost as a consequence of the general style chosen for Clash: Artifacts of Chaos, almost an invitation to participate in the deformed magical realism that characterizes the entire Zenozoik, Pseudo included: an explosion of muscles on a slender figure with an irregular body. Combat system The combat system of Clash: Artifacts of Chaos is complex, but tends to get repetitive What do you do around Zenozoik, besides getting lost? You fight, most of the time. At the start of the game, Pseudo can choose one of three combat stances, which greatly modify his attack techniques. During the game he will be able to find new positions, select the discarded ones, as well as acquire some special moves that will allow him to increase his offensive potential, in communion with the statistics that can be improved by leveling up. Their clashes are very physical and ideally recall those of Zeno Clash, although Pseudo is viewed in the third person and not in the first person and the clashes are less technical, even with the presence of more moves. The heaviness of the blows remains, but the third person has evidently recommended greater dynamism, to make sense of the dodges and the greater space available. Enemies follow the style of the scenario and are a show ofthem, among big, squat and hairy barbarians with heads instead of torsos, among flying creatures that look like pterodactyls drawn by Bosch and among other anthropomorphic beings with armor decorated with a strongly tribal taste and with a physicality similar to that of Pseudo, in addition to many creepy creatures like the boss Gemini, who looks like something out of a Go Nagai nightmare. Easy to get lost in Clash: Artifacts of Chaos In short, the parterre of the enemies turns out to be really rich and varied, so much so that it can be considered one of the strong points of the entire experience. As already mentioned, the fights are not very technical. The important thing is to understand when is the right moment to strike, between a parry or a dodge, studying the attack patterns of the enemies. Keep in mind that opponents are generally stronger than Pseudo, but much less agile. So several hits are required to knock them down, while a couple or so of well-executed attacks are often enough for them to finish the job. In some cases our blows can break those of the opponents, but in others not, so the fights are often reduced to a hit and run tactic, in which it is better to keep a safe distance and attack at the right moment, rather than attempting a more direct counting on parries and close dodges. Especially when you have to face multiple enemies at the same time, the latter approach can prove decidedly counterproductive. Rituals of the night and day Enemies of the night are different from those of the day It must be said that, in case of defeat during the day, Pseudo does not die permanently, but a nocturnal version of him is activated which can reach the body and wake it up, fighting in turn against unique enemies. The nocturnal Pseudo not only has a healing function, so to speak, but also serves to overcome some passages that are impracticable for the diurnal Pseudo, thanks to its thicker and harder skin, which forms an impenetrable armor, which is not damaged by brambles and shrubs . On some occasions it is therefore necessary to use it to clear the way for the pseudo diurnal towards new areas. The problem is that, in the event of death, the nocturnal Pseudo cannot be awakened and must be reloaded from the last checkpoint reached (small camps where it is possible to sleep in order to change Pseudo, create healing potions and assign the skill points earned by leveling up ). But let's get back to the fight. In addition to his fists, Pseudo will unlock various melee weapons during the adventure, whether they are found or purchased from merchants in exchange for the raw materials found while exploring Zenozoik, which will help him greatly against stronger enemies, despite often risking break right at the climax (each weapon has its own durability). Before each fight with intelligent creatures, you can participate in a ritual At the beginning of each encounter with intelligent creatures it is possible to participate in a ritual based on the roll of the dice (completely optional). Each participant puts an emblem on the plate that gives the opponent some penalties during the fight in case of victory, then rolls the dice hoping for a good result, using strange objects to alter it and have the highest possible score or lower that of the 'other. Whoever has the most points at the end of the ritual prevails. Then we move on to the fisticuffs. It must be said that, despite the variety of opponents, in the end the fights become quite repetitive, undermining the involvement a bit, because we tend to use often very similar tactics. The bosses break the mold a bit, but in principle we proceed along well-known tracks. There are elements to consider that make the experience more interesting, such as the stamina bar which determines the power of our blows and the damage produced by those we suffer, but a certain fatigue is inevitable towards the last stages of the approximately twenty hours that we want to complete Clash: Artifacts of Chaos. A world outside the box There are so many things to discover around Zenozoik Clash: Artifacts of Chaos is a strange item. As mentioned, its design seems to want to continuously argue with that of modern action, presenting less obvious solutions, but at the same time harder to digest. The story itself that it tells, albeit more rarefied than that of other titles, appears deeper and better constructed within the game world, thanks to a series of secondary descriptions and small tricks that make the side more present than it seems narrative, between unexpected encounters, enemies who show their own character and characters who act in an unexpected and interesting way. The main story itself isn't all that detailed, but that's about itthe context to enrich it, including the relationship that develops between Pseudo and the Boy, built in a less trivial way than the usual father and son relationship to be recovered from some modern video games.", "date": "2023-03-29", "grade": "8.0"}
