{"name": "Sudden Strike II", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sudden-strike-ii.html", "text": "RTS? Not exactly In a nutshell, and for the few who don't know it, Sudden Strike is a particular RTS set during the Second World War and with which it is possible to command the main armies that took part in it. I remember that in this last chapter the Japanese army was finally added. In reality, the game has a big element of innovation which consists in the absolute lack of resource management, so dear to competing titles, and which rightly elevates Fireglow's product to a truly tactical game, where the parsimonious management of one's own forces, represents one of the key aspects of the whole game. If you think about it, in traditional RTS the resource collection aspect takes priority over the rest, this is because the more resources you have the more units you can produce, and all in all it's not so important what type of unit you make, the important thing is and that there are many. And this is well known by the many lovers of rush (the real scourge of this type of game). Even the ~legendary~ Blizzard have fully understood this aspect, so much so that in their Warcraft III they have drastically changed the management of resources, so that the results are not the desired ones, that's another matter. In Sudden Strike, this is not possible and you have to focus on individual units, their positions and their fire capabilities. It is evident that in this way, the game takes on its own and different connotation from the usual. Substance more than appearance If we look at the screenshots of Sudden Strike II, we can see that the graphics engine has remained fundamentally the same, so the news resides elsewhere. Meanwhile, the number of units has increased and the previous ones have been made more realistic, so everything has been the subject of a correct balancing work and this is very important, remember what I said earlier about the importance of unit types? well now our possibilities expand enormously. And then it doesn't happen in all games to be able to control land, air and sea units of different types and importance. Everything is based on the search for exasperated realism, starting with the number of soldiers needed to pilot a vehicle, the power and capacity of the weapons and so on. Then the experience was introduced that units acquire during combat and which serves to improve movement speed, accuracy and vision. Unfortunately, apart from some missions planned to support it, the units lose the experience gained at the end of each mission and which therefore will not be inheritable in subsequent maps. A vast and competitive Singleplayer... What to say; there are 5 campaigns one for each army, which I remember are the Japanese one, which represents the absolute novelty, British, American, Russian and German, each composed of various missions and embellished by a new difficulty system (selectable from four levels ), which increase its longevity exponentially. I found the missions to be well crafted and done to always present new tactical difficulties, like a well thought out puzzle. I will never stop repeating that here it is not possible to attack en masse, under penalty of the rapid demise of all our units and therefore a more thoughtful approach must necessarily be adopted. In this sense, great importance has been given to exploration and sighting, which if well exploited represent our extra weapon against the enemy. If I know exactly who I have to fight against, I will certainly have a better chance of success. ... and a Multiplayer with lights and some shadows. Let's start immediately from one of the main weaknesses of Sudden Strike II and that is the impossibility of playing in Multiplayer maps against the CPU. A real cancellation, also because this mode is now always present in all titles of the genre. For the rest, the Multiplayer mode presents no problems and proves to be excellent from all points of view, in this sense it is to be appreciated that the number of units that can be commanded is as many as 1024, an enormously higher number than that of competing titles. Since there are no resources, you will start with a predefined number of units which can only be increased if you reach a specific point on the map. Interesting right? I remember that in the old title, there was no real Multiplayer mode and therefore its implementation can only increase the overall value of Sudden Strike II. Conclusions Sudden Strike was already an excellent title, this second episode strengthens its characteristics and makes it even better, without distorting it. In the review I didn't tell you about the excellent audio, made up of realistic sounds and a well-chosen use of accents.characteristic of each nation. In short, a title that deserves all our attention and that should be part of your personal collection of strategic games. Ah, I almost forgot to mention the excellent level editor that comes with the game. A pleasure! On the attack again A year ago, more or less these days, an interesting strategic game came out developed by Fireglow, an enterprising German software-house, and distributed by CDV which had the merit of offering something different in a sector which, vice versa, in recent years has not managed to evolve as one would have expected. We're talking about Sudden Strike, which after just one year and after the release of an expansion (whose reviews you can find here and here), is re-proposed in a renewed version that will be available in our stores around the middle of the month of September, while in other countries the title has already been presented. We are now able to provide you with this review, thanks to the final version sent to us directly by CDV and which we have played for you.", "date": "2002-09-09", "grade": null}
