Once upon a time, friends and relatives looked disgusted at us when we nerds, who saw it eaten in Japanese cartoons, talked about sushi: today it's normal to sit in front of the conveyor belts of some cafe and chat between one nigiri and another. Nigiri is a type of sushi, huh. Each variant of this dish has a name: nigiri, temaki, hosomaki and so on. Sushi Striker explains each dish in a sort of small encyclopedia, also offering accompanying illustrations that make your mouth water: this should make you understand how much care the guys from indieszero - the same ones from the excellent Theatrhytm Final Fantasy - have put into the presentation of this videogame scope. What really matters, however, is the taste: if you want to know how ~fresh~ Sushi Striker's fish is, read on! The Sushi War Sushi Striker is full of dialogues and cinematics, completely cartoonish, which tell one of the most bizarre stories we have ever seen. We are definitely at the levels of Inazuma Eleven, to give a videogame example, because if in the Level-5 series the whole world revolved around football, in the puzzle game signed indieszero sushi is at the center of everything. In fact, in the world of Sushi Striker, fish is dying out and for this reason sushi has become a delicacy worth fighting real wars for. Now that the Empire controls the distribution of sushi, only the fearless rebels have the courage to fight to ensure that it returns to the public domain: the player therefore plays Musashi, a boy - or a girl, you can choose sex at beginning of the game - who, following a daring series of events, finds himself fighting together with the rebels and the spirits of sushi, little creatures that are decidedly reminiscent of pokmon and which confer various powers. Musashi's journey is punctuated through dozens of battles to the last sushi against the more or less important minions of the Empire. The dialogues, written completely in Italian and recited in subdued English that made us wish for an unfortunately absent dual audio option, are the feast of nonsense and clichs, but it was to be expected given that the story is an obvious pretext: every fight increases the experience points of our hero and his sushi spirits, unlocking new dishes, bonuses and skills at certain levels up. Progressing in the adventure, Musashi also acquires new gadgets that allow you to customize his abilities in battle, such as the wheels that alter the speed of the conveyor belts and, therefore, the level of difficulty in general with all the advantages and disadvantages of the case. The tutorial is quite long and can be considered finished once you reach the village where it is possible, among other things, to face other players online or locally: in this sense, Sushi Striker would also be an excellent living room party game, given that you can play with one Joy-Con each, if only it weren't damn irritating. May the best gunkan win The dynamics of Sushi Striker are quite simple, apparently, but once you reach a certain level of progression, after unlocking some features such as, for example, the spirits of sushi and their evolutions, it becomes clear that the indieszero title is much more layered and complex than it may seem at first. Essentially you fight like this: each challenger has three conveyor belts in front of him, plus a central one also common to his opponent. Sushi Striker is a match-color, so you have to tie adjacent plates of the same color together, possibly within the seven seconds it takes for a plate to travel across the screen from one end to the other. Once enough plates have been connected, perhaps by ~stealing~ those in the central belt, or when the time available runs out, our darling accumulates the plates on a table, ready to throw them manually or automatically when the stacks become too high: only then can they effectively inflict damage to the opponent who, having lost all life points, will be defeated. Obviously, the longer the combos, the greater the damage inflicted on the basis of the multipliers which depend on various factors such as the spirits of the equipped sushi - a maximum of three, plus two in reserve - and the connected courses. Furthermore, each combo loads the indicators of the spirits: their skills, once activated with the indicator filled, represent an important strategic element,since some simply inflict damage to the opponent, while others can change the colors of the dishes, transform the sushi into healing sweets or even generate barriers that can only be broken through by combos of a certain number of hits. To all this are added rules and variations that make the clashes more and more complicated, perhaps involving special courses that can only be linked in combos of a certain size and so on. As we said, the frenetic action is combined with a truly remarkable tactical complexity. Unfortunately this is the moment when the donkey falls, because if you manage to pass over the colorful graphics but decidedly more suited to a smartphone app and the decidedly low production costs, it becomes more difficult to become familiar with a control system which, quite simply, it wasn't meant for a console like the Nintendo Switch. Holding Joy-Con or Controller Pro, the selection of courses via analog stick soon turns out to be cumbersome and imprecise, so much so that better results are obtained by abandoning any strategic claim in favor of random rotations, not to mention that you have to get by with the functions of the other keys. Everything becomes more manageable by holding only the Switch screen - after having completely disconnected the Joy-Con - to resort to touch controls, simpler but equally inaccurate: it almost seems that the screen does not correctly recognize tactile inputs, especially if we scroll our finger too much hurry on the moving conveyor belts. The idea that we have, in short, is that the game was designed primarily for the lower screen of the Nintendo 3DS with the use of a comfortable stylus and that something was lost in the conversion for Switch. These are problems you get used to after a few hours and a little practice, of course, but they still make the experience frustrating on the worst occasions, underlining the importance of a lucky hand compared to the pure and simple skill of the player.", "date": "2018-06-07", "grade": "6.8"}
