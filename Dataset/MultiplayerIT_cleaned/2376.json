{"name": "Il Signore di Atlantide: Poseidon", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/il-signore-di-atlantide-poseidon.html", "text": "Uncle Poseidoooneeee!! I'm sure many of you will remember the old cartoon ~Pollon Combines Trouble~, among other things recycled on TV a few months ago as Mediaset mother used to do. However, the good old God of the Seas (who notoriously, at least in the cartoon, did not know how to swim) has very little to do with the severe Poseidon we met playing Zeus, being a treacherous and sensitive deity, always ready to sink you the city as soon as you dare to chase away the innocent Cyclops who was delighting in reducing it to rubble. Well in this expansion pack we will have the possibility to found and develop the mythical city of Atlantis, which means that it will be a good idea to have an eye for Uncle Poseidon, since the Atlanteans will get exceptional benefits from the adoration of the King of the Mari, compared to the common populations of the Hellenic world. Since whoever reads this review will already have at least an idea of what Zeus is, I won't dwell too much on describing the game dynamics, contenting myself with illustrating the new features introduced in this expansion. 3 Hera and Atlas, snake relatives Of course, there will not only be Poseidon running around the world doing damage and claiming temples and sanctuaries, but the entire pantheon of the original deities is still present, enriched for the occasion by two new elements: Atlas, Rector of the World, and Hera was the unconciliatory consort of Zeus, Queen of the Gods as well as Lady of the Heavens and Patroness of Fertility (ahem). As is known, devoting oneself to the adoration of a single deity is very dangerous, as this will invariably cause the envy of some other immortal who may have the bad idea of taking a stroll on the roofs of your houses (with easily imaginable results). Furthermore, it will be good practice not to antagonize the most powerful deities (the same ones whose favor is most difficult to gain) since the attacks launched by the inhabitants of Olympus can only be repelled by a more powerful patron deity. Well, if Atlas turns out to be a ~normal god~ (that's good!), Hera will reveal completely unexpected strategic potential. In fact, in addition to being a rather powerful divinity (only Zeus, Poseidon and Hades are more powerful than her), able to give her faithful some very useful abilities (reproducing faster for example ... hehe) she is also the only divinity in able to fend off the attacks of an enraged (notoriously unstoppable) Zeus, which proves that not even the Father of the Gods can prevail in an argument with his mistress Monsters of every shape and color Well according to some ~scholars~ the first to build the pyramids were the inhabitants of Atlantis (the fact that no trace of these monuments has remained I suppose is a completely negligible detail) and this does not surprise us at all, given the extraordinary technological capabilities available to the sons of Poseidon. Among the innovations introduced in this expansion, the replacement of the Gymnasium and the Greek schools of philosophy with astronomical observatories, universities, libraries and various research centers stands out. The entire ~Culture~ section present in Zeus has in fact been replaced with one called ~Science~, through which to reach extraordinary levels of technical knowledge, unique in the whole ancient world, which will allow us, among other things, to erect the monumental works that Father Poseidon and his brothers require to continue to watch over their children. Among them the majestic Citadel of Poseidon and the magnificent Pyramids stand out. Of the latter work, of which the Greeks ignore the existence, there are numerous versions, from the more traditional Egyptian-like pyramids, to hyperbolic mausoleums dedicated to the celestial powers, up to the most ancestral of sanctuaries, the Temple of Olympus , so high as to reach the abode of the gods. Naturally, even the construction of the humblest of these wonders will amply repay you for the efforts and expenses incurred, both in terms of game advantages and in mere visual satisfaction and general embellishment. The fateful question Does this expansion really offer something new to the proven plot of Zeus? The answer is yes, albeit with some reservations. At first glance, actually two new gods and a few more options don't seem like much, and those who have played the original title to exhaustion might be a little disappointed. However, taking into account the multitude of new and original buildings (thinkor at the racecourse, whose shape can be determined as desired), of the possibility of following a long and unprecedented process of technological evolution and of the hours of play awaiting those who want to try their hand at the long and exciting ~Atlantean~ campaign, I realized that in reality irons in the fire have been added with both hands. Of course, if you have played Zeus ad nauseam, you will hardly let yourself be fascinated a second time by a gameplay that is now metabolized and ultimately equal to itself, but if you still don't have enough, The Lord of Atlantis: Poseidon will be right for you. 8 So here we are talking about the official expansion of the Zeus who once and for all reaffirmed the leading role in the creation of the management citizens of Impression Games, who with his Pharaon and the Cesar series has eclipsed the old Sim City, rising to the Olympus (in every sense) of the software houses. And while Maxis continues to play around with her Sims, The Lord of Atlantis: Poseidon finally sees the light, with new options, new civilizations and above all new Gods!", "date": "2001-10-31", "grade": null}
