The first is the one who accidentally used the old game floppies as a glass holder. For him, there is the possibility of replaying the entire adventure as it appeared at the time. Then there's the one who boasts that he hasn't bought a game since 1995, but actually spends hours with Guitar Hero. Here, for him this edition can be played with characters and backgrounds entirely redesigned by hand. Then there's what has as its only link with the title, the vacant monkey expression in the face of all this. No problem, The Secret of Monkey Island - Special Edition also meets him, just read the next paragraph to understand how. Keeping you on your toes huh? Of course... But a little history is needed. It was 1990 when LucasArts (at that time LucasFilm) rocked the world of video games (no, really, it was a great moment), with The Secret of Monkey Island. There were many talents that contributed to making this game one of the most loved point and click adventures ever, and it is important to remember them. The creator was Ron Gilbert, who followed the saga up to the second chapter. This is why fans tend not to consider the third and fourth episodes of the series, which turned out to be disappointing. At his side were also David Grossman and Tim Schafer. Michael Land composed the music, while Steve Purcell did the graphics. Michael Land and David Grossman are still at work behind the Tales of Monkey Island series developed by Telltale, which refers precisely to the old 1990 brand. Is everything clear? Well. What happened to Ron Gilbert and Tim Schafer in the meantime? The latter has signed masterpieces such as Grim Fandango, Day of the Tentacle and Psychonauts, and has recently returned to the headlines with Brutal Legends. As for Ron instead, ask him directly, his blog is GrumpyGamer. Curiosity The Secret of Monkey Island - Special Edition is a remake of the almost homonymous graphic adventure released in 1990, revisited in terms of graphics, music and interface. This first chapter was followed by Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge (1991), The Curse of Monkey Island (1997) and Escape from Monkey Island (200). Telltale recently acquired the trademark license for a new series of episodes, titled Tales of Monkey Island. The first of these has already been reviewed by Multiplayer.it at this address. Pixels are lost over the years Gilbert hopes on his blog that this new edition will attract the attention of those players who only know how to use the console controller (it's not an offense). To be able to do this, LucasArts has revised several elements of the game, starting with the graphics, which have undergone a major restyling. In bare skin, we were more convinced by LeChuck than Guybrush, who has a late 80s Rotterdam rave haircut; but on this everyone will have their say. In any case, while the backgrounds are delightful, the characters often have an amateurish quality, closer to fan-art than the work of a professional. It should also be noted that the new drawings faithfully follow the underlying structure, and that the animations have remained those of the past: the effect is grotesque at first, but then adapts so well to the adventure that one suspects that it is intended. In short, it does not detract from the spirit of the game. The music has also been remastered, bringing new luster to the famous soundtrack. And we have to say with more success than Telltale managed to do in the first chapter of Tales of Monkey Island. The most relevant aspect, however, concerns the interface. This title also comes out on Xbox 360, and has to adapt to the needs of a new audience. First, the series of verbs is never present on the screen, but must be recalled with a keystroke. In addition, the cursor has become a practical icon that immediately offers the possibility to select the most obvious action with respect to an object (such as opening a door). Most importantly, the game incorporates a robust hint system. The Secret of Monkey Island, for those who don't know it, is one of those games where you can get stuck for hours on a puzzle. Let's assume that the subtitles are in Italian and that the original actors have dubbed the characters again, and we find ourselves with a five-star restoration work. And so, some will say, why so much excitement? The x marks a treasure These days, LucasArts has revived many of its historical adventures on Steam; all splendid, none excluded. Why then was The Secret of Monkey Island chosen to groped the boarding of new players (who are not said to be young)? Sure, it's a game full of peoplecharismatic today, the story is so original that it refers to the personality of Ron Gilbert, and his humor still remains legendary to players who have memorized entire lines of dialogue. Indeed, Monkey Island is a self-contained little world, with its islands, its nemeses and its idiosyncrasies. There are monkeys, love, pirates, voodoo, and everything that revolves around this Caribbean circus. In short, we do not know the answer to our question. It was the talent of the people who worked on it and the historical situation that made it a timeless masterpiece. Something similar must have happened with the Star Wars trilogy. Certain works seem to come out at the right time by divine mandate, while only men are behind them. Men with something extra, and not knowing what to call it, we mark it with an x.", "date": "2009-07-17", "grade": "9.2"}
