Played almost everywhere even in the boot of Europe, the ball game has often seen us among the protagonists on the world scene and there are many who have long dreamed of a nice managerial title to be able to identify with an international basketball coach. Not that these have been lacking in the past and we can also mention an Italian production for the Amiga called The Basket Manager, a not bad title developed by Simulmondo. But in recent years, management software dedicated to basketball has ended up in the cauldron of low-profile games and it is certainly not an ideal location for creating titles of particular depth. But there is an evolving series that has made great strides since its genesis, in 2012, with a promising but decidedly immature chapter. We are talking about the Bastketball Pro Management of Umix Studios, a small software house that for the last three incarnations of the series has made use of the support of Cyanide, a publisher that deals with many genres but has always dedicated part of its efforts to sports. Basketball Pro Management returns to the field with a new interface and some other innovations Still imperfect Basketball Pro Management 2015 is a modest title but offers a rather rich management component and brings with it various innovations that highlight the attention of the developers in relation to the complaints made by the players to the previous chapter of the series. In fact, the interface has been completely revised and uploads are streamlined thanks to much better optimization work. Unfortunately, early access started under a bad star, with technical flaws in quantity, but after the arrival of a substantial patch, released on the occasion of the launch of the final version, we finally managed to take the field by choosing a team among the hundreds belonging to the over 40 championships included in the title. For purely sentimental reasons we launched on Pesaro but to create some context we made sure that the title also simulated some other championship. The number of leagues that can be simulated at the same time is at the discretion of the player and this choice should be carefully evaluated since although the loading times are much shorter than those of the previous chapter, the simulation of too many leagues could put a hardware that is not particularly difficult. performing. Our advice, therefore, is to do a couple of tests before actually starting the season, in order to avoid exhausting expectations. Once this formality has been dealt with, all that remains is to start the dance starting from the evaluation of the workforce. And it is here that we realize that to get around the age-old problem of official licenses, the developers have taken the not very elegant but certainly effective decision to change a letter in the name of the athletes and completely avoid the proper name of the teams. And so we launch ourselves towards the conquest of the Scudetto with Marco Mordenta and LaQuinton Russ, both players of a generic team called Pesaro. The result is not exciting but still guarantees recognition to the clubs and athletes although the purists have already run away under the umbrella of modding churning out correct and decidedly more attractive databases. In any case, what matters to us is the quality of the gameplay and this includes the management of the youngsters, that of the stadium, the satisfaction of the fans and that of the management, the articulated planning of training sessions and the obvious management of budgets and transfers. The calendar allows us to jump forward one or seven days at a time and there is also the option to go directly to the first game. At this point we can make the computer simulate the match without showing us anything, we can simulate the single quarters focusing on the management during the intervals or we can visualize the action influencing it in real time through patterns and modifiers. All actions which, like the players' performances, are reflected in the team's performances and allow for notable recoveries, with relative satisfaction, managing well changes and encouragements between one quarter and another. The characteristics of the players are so many and they also include explosiveness, creative resources and coldness as well as, of course, all the items that concern every specific possible action in basketball. And it is also possible to calibrate the marking, launch a specific pattern and set the offensive approach, including shooting distance, for each player on the pitch. OverallI know football managers have reached peaks of higher complexity but some managerial subtleties, the very rare inclusion of the female sector in a sports game, the adaptation of texts in Italian and the shortage of thick managers dedicated to basketball give meaning to the Umix title Studios. Unfortunately, in order to enjoy this sense, it is necessary to swallow some bitter pills. The interface is improved but still imperfect, dispersive and incomplete. In some screens it is difficult to understand which statistic corresponds to the values reported, comparing the statistics of the players is a feat, the management of scouting is almost delusional, the options even lack volume and customization is almost nil. But it is the three-dimensional camera that represents the lowest peak of production. The players are two-dimensional sprites as rigid as granite statues, the actions are often incomprehensible and the aesthetics are bleak. And to make matters worse we find ourselves listening to bad audio samples alongside a not-so-bad but still not exciting soundtrack. Some tracks are listenable, as in the case of the song Falling, but the average tenor of the musical accompaniment of Bastketball Pro Management 2015 is that of long-standing management with clean synth songs characterized by impactful but limited and rather repetitive bass. In essence, considering the quality of modern indies, it is really difficult to technically defend the Umix Studios title, a child product not only of a limited budget but of choices that obscure, and not just, the commitment made in relation to the management component. The advice, therefore, is not to fall into the temptation to press the three-dimensional view button whose yield is even lower than that of the non-exciting 3D mode of International Basketball Manager which already, in 2010, did not shine in quality. Better, and by far, to be satisfied with the bird's eye view which, among other things, makes the numbers of the players clearly visible and allows us to manage the team more easily.", "date": "2014-12-02", "grade": "6.8"}
