{"name": "Trials of Mana", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/trials-of-mana-recensione.html", "text": "We've been using the word ~remake~ a lot lately. Just a few days ago, Square Enix finally released its highly anticipated Final Fantasy VII Remake, and shortly before that another important and divisive remake hit the shelves, Resident Evil 3. Were it not for the pandemic that is forcing us all at home, that of Seiken Densetsu 3 would have gone unnoticed. We could not begin the Trials of Mana review without reflecting on the unfortunate moment in which Square Enix decided to publish it, crushing it between role-playing games of the caliber of Final Fantasy VII Remake, Persona 5 Royal and the next Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition. Perhaps it was a prudent choice, given that Trials of Mana cannot count on an extraordinary budget, but only on its peculiar historical case: known in Japan as Seiken Densetsu 3, in fact, it earned a western title only when the Japanese company decided to bring it to the world last year in the Collection of Mana for Nintendo Switch, twenty-five years after its 1995 Super Famicom release. Three stories in one For many years, we've been playing the Seiken Densetsu 3 ROM that some kind soul had illegally translated into English, and so we've been lucky enough to play one of the best titles released in the 16-bit era. An era that today seems distant to us more than ever, in which the narration was often subordinated to the gameplay and much was done by the player's imagination. Deprived of a real localization for too many years, Seiken Densetsu 3 has timidly regained its place in the spotlight with a remake that Square Enix surprisingly announced last year and that we have finally played and finished these days, ascertaining the seriousness with which the Japanese developer has approached this classic after the disappointing remakes of the first two episodes made in the past years. A seriousness that unfortunately hasn't helped a narrative sector that was justified in '95, but which today leaves much to be desired. The story of Trials of Mana revolves around six different characters. At the beginning of the game we will choose the protagonist of the story, along with two supporting characters who will join him during the adventure. This choice determines the prologue and epilogue of the game, as well as various interactions or cinematics: throughout the game we will meet all the characters, but those we have not chosen to form our team will play a secondary and little-developed role. In reality, the storylines are not really six, but three, because the characters share them in pairs, just as they share the three final bosses: Duran and Angela, Riesz and Hawkeye, Kevin and Charlotte. By choosing at least one of these couples at the beginning of the game, the narrative appears more cohesive thanks to the greater number of interludes involving our protagonists, making them talk to each other and thus better outlining their personalities. Trials of Mana therefore faithfully follows the original fragmentary structure, focusing the story on a common quest: the Mana is running out and a Fairy chooses the protagonist to reunite the elemental spirits, enter the Sanctuary, draw the mythical Sword of Mana and protect the Goddess before everything falls apart. Dark forces surround the Mana Tree, forces that intend to free the Benevodons, the gigantic supernatural monsters that during an ancient war were imprisoned in the Mana crystals scattered around the world. It so happens, then, that these dark forces are linked to the various protagonists, closing the circle on a story that renounces a sophisticated narrative to adopt the fairytale style that distinguishes the series created by Koichi Ishii. The protagonists therefore travel far and wide around the world without asking themselves too many questions, motivated by personal vicissitudes that are intertwined with the search for the Sword. Although the prologue and epilogue change according to the protagonist, the heart of the adventure remains much the same regardless of the combination with which the team is formed; however, the order in which you visit the places and meet the various characters also changes. If in '95 there were few titles that tried to manage all these variables on the SNES, today the situation is completely different: Trials of Mana ventures a nostalgic approach in respect of the original, but manages to evoke that ingenuity only partially. The transition to 3D and the more cinematic setting betray a rough direction and clumsy editing. The story, which already suffered from a certain frivolity, maintains the characteristic fairy-tale imprint, but loses the hasty pace in favor of a more woody and mechanical representation. The problem is noticeableabove all by choosing the English dubbing, clearly lower than the Japanese one especially in the case of the more imaginative characters. Let's make it clear right away: Trials of Mana is not in Italian. Luckily, it's not a complicated title to follow either. The story lingers only relatively on the protagonists: their goals are clear from the start, but there is no real character development. The protagonists reflect the classic stereotypes, entrusting the bulk of the work to the dubbing and clean character design of Haccan. In the light of these considerations, however, it would be wrong to be too harsh. Trials of Mana is not Final Fantasy VII Remake and obviously we dream of the stratospheric budget of the other Square Enix remake. Beyond this difference, however, Trials of Mana does exactly what many fans would have liked in the other case: it puts technology at the service of nostalgia, faithfully respecting the original script, perhaps even too much. It is a deliberate choice, clearly, even net of a technical sector that certainly does not make one cry for a miracle, and which focuses above all on the maniacal care with which the old sprites have been transformed into 3D models. In this respect it would be unfair to complain, although it is clear that all efforts have focused on the protagonists and their nemeses. The image is always fluid and clean, the game world is very colorful and detailed, the animations are convincing in the fights, less so in the interlude sequences. Over the course of the twenty-five hours necessary to complete the adventure, we met again all the enemies defeated in the original, from the funniest to the most disturbing, redesigned with enormous respect for a title that was in 2D in '95 and taken from the high. Trials of Mana now employs a freely controllable camera that follows the player as in a third-person adventure, also because the remake rides a much more dynamic wave on the notes of the beautiful original soundtrack by Hiroki Kikuta, rearranged for the occasion by Tsuyoshi Sekito, Koji Yamaoka, Ryo Yamazaki and Sachiko Miyano. The most nostalgic will probably appreciate the ability to set the original tracks from the options menu. A chat with the producers What is your relationship with the Mana series? Masaru Oyamada: I had my first opportunity to work on the series with the mobile version of Final Fantasy Adventure in 2006, becoming its producer in 2014 with Rise of Mana, when Mr. Koichi Ishii left the company. Shinichi Tatsuke: For me it's the first time. I was hired as a development assistant for a few console games, then I became a producer for mobile titles, but this is my first time working as a producer on a console title. What's your favorite Mana? Oyamada: Final Fantasy Adventure. It was the first video game I completed in my life. Tatsuke: Trials of Mana, of course! How did you manage to modernize Trials of Mana compared to the SNES version? Tatsuke: We imagined what Seiken Densetsu 3 would look like if we developed it in 2020. It was important to work on the graphics, of course, and after several attempts we settled on the third person view. Not being limited by the dynamics of the original game, we were able to make some significant changes to the combat system and character development, as well as adding new ideas. I think the result is very close to what modern video games are. What do you think it offers to players who have never had to deal with this series? Tatsuke: We're talking about a legendary title from 1995 that we redesigned to release in 2020. And then the various episodes of the Mana series are not connected to each other, which means that new players can approach this title as a completely new RPG. If you could redo another mana after Trials of Mana, which one would you choose? Oyamada: That's a really difficult question. Legend of Mana has never been localized in some countries, but it is also true that it is a very complicated title that uses a huge amount of graphic assets, so working on that would be problematic. I'd like all titles in the series to be playable on current generation hardware at some point, so I think we'll start with the lesser-known ones when the time is right. What were the toughest challenges you faced during the development of Trials of Mana? Oyamada: The multiple plot is undoubtedly the main feature of this game as forming a team, choosing three characters from the six protagonists, leads to a great variety of different combinations and dialogues which were difficultto write. In the original some dialogues only took place under very specific conditions, so it was tough to check every possible variation and make sure everything was in place. Tatsuke: Developing the battle system wasn't easy either. We started work respecting the dynamics of the original game, but when we decided to move to 3D we realized that we wanted to give the player more freedom, and therefore we had to change our approach halfway through. We then implemented mechanics like air strikes, dodging and combos that bring Trials of Mana closer to more modern action titles. What was it like recreating the graphics and sound of the game? Oyamada: Once the character models and their animations were completed, we realized that we were truly echoing the style of the original game. It was a lot of fun working on the graphics and we couldn't wait to see the result! Tatsuke: We haven't changed the soundtrack significantly. Our goal was to reproduce the original music in high definition, entrusting it to our best composers. Above all, we imagined what those same music would be like in 2020. In the same way, we were careful to keep some specific sound effects, including the characteristic one that is heard every time the ring menu is opened. Playstation 4 trophies To unlock all the Trials of Mana trophies you will have to complete the adventure at least twice, so as to reach Class 4 with all the characters. You will then have to open all the chests scattered around the world, find the little Cactus hidden in all the maps, improve the pot of objects and also defeat the inevitable secret boss. A renewed fight So Trials of Mana is a technically average title, and it's already a miracle that it exists, let alone claiming it with the budget of much more famous and desired franchises. Maybe that's why Square Enix seems to have focused all its efforts on another aspect of Seiken Densetsu 3, the one for which it sold in '95: the gameplay. While faithfully following the original script, through thick and thin, Trials of Mana distances itself from the historical setting to adopt a much more modern one. This approach forced the developer to redraw virtually every map in the game in three dimensions, implementing various platforming sequences, as it is now possible to jump, and labyrinthine floor plans reminiscent of those explored on the SNES. In this respect, an excellent job has undoubtedly been done. The various maps and numerous ~dungeons~ have been recreated with great care, and also retain the occasional environmental puzzles to be solved to open new chests or simply reach the exit. Enemies wait for the player in small groups at predetermined points, and attack him on sight. At that point, the scenario becomes a battlefield and the player assumes direct control of one character in the team, while a modest artificial intelligence takes care of the other two that we can limitedly adjust in the team menu, until we decide to take control by pressing the back buttons. The action combat system uses a fast basic attack and a slower powerful attack that can break down defenses and generate CS crystals that increase a gauge under the characters' lives. The CS or Class Strike are cinematic attacks that discharge the aforementioned indicator and inflict a lot of damage with a spectacular animation. It is important to balance weak and powerful attacks, dodge telegraphed blows from enemies - which become increasingly complex and immediate throughout the game - and jump attack flying targets to knock them down and interrupt spells or other abilities. It's not a particularly sophisticated combat system, but it does its job very well, it's immediate and a lot of fun. We played our game on the Hard level, encountering some difficulty on a few occasions, but especially fighting bosses who often have to be tackled with a minimum of strategy, rather than simple brute force. Also because Trials of Mana grants the player a great variety of spells and special abilities to be set on four shortcuts just like Class Strikes or choose carefully - the day/night cycle affects the effectiveness of the elements! - recalling the characteristic ring menu which, moreover, puts the fight on pause. Anyone who has played Trials of Mana in the Collection of Mana, please breathe a sigh of relief. In the remake you never stop and the animations of the most powerful spells do not slow down or freeze", "date": "2020-04-22", "grade": "7.8"}
