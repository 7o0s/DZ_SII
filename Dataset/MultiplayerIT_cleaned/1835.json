Of course not, and here is Activision churning out this XXX which should refer to the deeds of our Grand Vizier and make us musculature too! But, as usual, let's forget about the movie and analyze the real substance of the game. The structure is nothing new, it's an action game strongly focused on shooting, vaguely reminiscent of the good old Super Probotector (or Super Contra) released on Snes quite a few years ago. So a good number of enemies to eliminate, some jumps to do and the ability to shoot in all (eight) directions, both while running and hanging on the stairs. The latter proves to be a possibility that manages to give a little more depth to the title which, otherwise, would limit itself to offering large levels, all in all very well structured even if without the slightest originality, in which to search for a large series of items ranging from detonators to missiles, from viruses to keys. In three of the eleven levels (plus the final boss) the action will change and see us driving a very ecological tamarrissima enduro scooter that travels a kilometer with 20 liters. The aim is to reach the end of the journey (we are asked to reach a specific place) avoiding to explode the motorbike due to too many impacts and to run out of petrol (indeed, the fuel of the special ~high tech fuel cell~ as I informs the manual) for not having collected the tanks scattered along the route. All while avoiding bushes, road construction sites, cars and tamarri, like you, who try to steal the title of Grand Vizier from you with their fists. But, in your opinion, how is this Tamar Game made? If I ask you, what am I doing?! The structure turns out to be fun and also quite interesting, but strongly limited by too little originality and the lack of variety and twists. Cute, but flat, even if with some sharp points in the study of some passages and in the optimal study of the level of difficulty. Never too difficult, engages without becoming frustrating. The passages on the bike are also fun even if a few small and elementary precautions are enough to master them enough to get to the end. As already mentioned, the levels are well structured and force the player to turn them in their entirety in order to reach and use the exit. However, there is a lack of ~end of level monsters~ or small changes in action routines. The enemies are not very stupid and sometimes put in difficulty. Graphically speaking, the speech could be the same. It does its job well and reaches enough (especially in the management of the sprites, many times six or seven enemies are displayed perfectly on the screen) but it never manages to amaze, to fully convince also due to the too much repetitiveness of the modules that form the levels and some limited and ugly parallax backgrounds. The motorbike sections are beautiful, with excellent backdrops to represent the cities of Brno and Prague (where the action takes place) and a good variety of roadside objects, all made with the canonical scaling technique. Even the animations do not go beyond this discussion, sometimes nice, other times limited. Finally, the character design is not too sophisticated. An applause goes to the music instead, the authentic demonstration that with few elements and registers it is possible to create good sound accompaniments. The music changes from level to level and is always quite rhythmic and pleasant, so much so that some even manage to be remembered. Good, even if some a bit ~electric~, samples and sound effects. The game is not very long and you will finish it in no more than five/six hours and then never touch it again. Comment XXX isn't a terribly bad game, it does its job well without even posing the problem of becoming a little videogame jewel or an unforgettable masterpiece. However, its role of accompaniment and commercial exploitation of the XXX brand does not relegate it to the limbo of filth. A cute little toy, maybe to scrounge up for your Vin Diesel fanatic friend, or to rent for a couple of days (it doesn't last much longer anyway). In my opinion, the purchase remains quite risky unless you are so fanatical about the character that you have seen the film The fast and the furious eight times and this new XXX as well. Pros: Good level design Appreciable graphics No major flaws in every respect Cons: Adds nothing new Limited longevity Anonymous Remember The Fast and The Furious? But yes, that film focused on racingabout the quarter mile that hit theaters last year. If you know him, and perhaps you were inspired by the subject and have equipped your Cinquecento with an aluminum amplifier bigger than the trunk and two green neon lights under the body, you undoubtedly also know Vin Diesel who was the real strong character in the film . If you don't know him, just know that, quoting Aldo, Giovanni and Giacomo, this figure is the Grand Vizier of all the Tamarri. Could it be the anabolic muscle that appears under the tank top (to show off even in the company of the penguins at the Polo)? Will it be the mignon-sized tattoos (30*30m) or that tough guy look that peeks out from the big bald head? Be that as it may, after being consecrated in the aforementioned film, now the good Vince returns in the role of a secret agent fighting against a phantom terrorist organization called Anarchy 99. All in one film, this XXX to be read ExExEx or Essex, which contaminates the classic James Bond with a heavy dose of tamarragine and a taste for excess (precisely).", "date": "2003-01-04", "grade": null}
