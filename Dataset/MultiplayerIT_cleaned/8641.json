And nothing has been the same since. The cars of the Japanese company have worn out virtual tires for countless years, on all possible platforms. 19 years later the saga finds itself at a crucial crossroads: without the invaluable support of its arcade counterparts and with the scene sensibly leaning towards more realistic productions, what is left to offer in this tumultuous generation of consoles? The answer is shocking but not incomprehensible given the latest trends, i.e. putting the brand in the hands of a western team, in this case Bugbear Entertainment, so as to be able to return to the enamel of the golden age, but with a language in tune with new productions of the genre. The choice isn't even random, the Finnish software house is famous for the various episodes of FlatOut, a series based on destruction and extreme spectacularity. The alarm bell sounded in the heads of enthusiasts is inevitable: what does a similar approach have to do with the driving finesse of Ridge Racer? Total destruction Right from the cathartic title, Ridge Racer Unbounded unleashes an extremely aggressive and anarchic opening film, where a persuasive female voice-over exposes what appears to be a true declaration of intent, only to then discover that she is (perhaps) Reiko Nagase, the sexy mascot of the Namco saga, here transformed into a murderous punk hooligan. Before his eyes the metal sheets of cars torn apart by ferocious impacts move, Ridge Racer for the new generations, we said. The scenario that kindly hosts the massacre turns out to be Shatter Bay, on the other hand there has always been a ~ludocentric~ city, a city capable of changing based on the difficulty and the type of race. Who remembers Ridge Racer Revolution or Rage Racer? Bugbear has tremendously clear ideas on how to set the curve and puts the resources directly into the player's hand to create his own city. From here to the editor, the step is short, and the developers are so eager to present it that they minimize the campaign, let's call it that, for single player, which becomes a mere container of pre-packaged circuits from the point of view of the title. The idea is really presumptuous, no doubt about it, but once you enter the editor you can easily understand the reasons. In fact, we still have to decide if it is Ridge Racer Unbounded that is amazing, or if the competition is simply non-existent. The customizations that can be made in Project Gotham Racing or Gran Turismo 5 would come to mind, but in reality the aim is much higher, in this case to Nadeo's Trackmania. Anyone who knows this name will understand how the question becomes decidedly interesting. My city The editor is divided into two parts, basic and advanced. In the first, all you do is assemble freely rotatable square blocks on a grid in order to build a complete path. The blocks represent already established parts of the scenario, whose typology is freely selectable (but to be unlocked) and we must be careful to match the single roads with those with multiple lanes. Once this is done, you move on to the advanced stage, where you can add objects, obstacles or real architectural parts, including gigantic half pipes, tunnels, ramps, loops and concave walls. This allows the construction of circuits of all kinds, from simple ovals for testing speed to gigantic amusement parks limited only by the imagination. Once we have finished our creation we can freely test them in all the available modes, from time trial to Domination, alone or with artificial opponents. This test is practically mandatory, otherwise we cannot publish our masterpiece on the net. In our tests we had the opportunity to play on numerous circuits created by users, all of excellent quality, complete with a ranking of the most popular. To mention a track born from some troubled mind, totally set in the air and shooting our car directly over the buildings! As you can easily guess, it is therefore a ~persistent~ setting where single-player and multi-player modes blend seamlessly. A factor further strengthened by the RPG elements that characterize the game. Every action, every race, everything done in the world of Ridge Racer Unbounded increases the player's experience thus opening access to a series of elements ranging from new cars to unpublished blocks for the editor. Where are you going if you don't have nitro?But ultimately what has changed on the track with this Unbounded? A lot, maybe too much. It is hard to find in the code any trace of the game we loved in the past years, this is because the product is unsurprisingly the son of the current of destructive racing sublimated by FlatOut itself, the Burnout saga by Criterion, or recently the excellent Split/Second . From the latter Ridge Racer Unbounded draws precisely the aggressive aesthetics, with statistics and information embedded in the scenario, continuing a stylistic path already inaugurated years ago by Codemasters. The main mode, the aforementioned Domination race, consists in concluding the race at the expense of the unfortunate competitors. The focus consists in the use of the nitro bar, the obtainment of which is linked to various operations: first of all the controlled drift until the destruction of the other cars (emphasized by cutscenes and slow motion), both through direct collision or contextual accidents. Supremacy is decided precisely by the use of nitro, an element that establishes a sort of vicious circle that the player must feed in order to have a chance of winning the race. Parts of the scenery can be destroyed by crashing into them, opening up valuable shortcuts. Obviously the opponents enjoy the same possibilities, thus making the games extremely chaotic. It's not exactly a rare occurrence to be swept away by an onslaught of crazed cars, and the lack of a rear-view mirror, replaced by a video signal, prevents you from accurately understanding distances. The Shindo test leads into more usual territories for the series, where drifting and the purity of the race are emphasized. Here too, however, the proposed system is totally unrecognizable from that of Ridge Racer, mainly due to the driving system, still arcade but more realistic, with cars that transmit greater heaviness. We are light years away from the technicality achieved by Namco programmers, also thanks to the 30 FPS, the Bugbear title is not (and basically it doesn't even want to be) exactly the emblem of elegance. Xbox 360 goals Ridge Racer Unbounded features the classic 1000 player points split across 50 objectives. The first hundred points comes by exploring the various modes, building our first path or scattering a bit of opposing metal around the circuit. The others require dedication that will take you a long time, like finishing a multiplayer race without using nitro. The most coveted goal of the game (100 points!) requires you to finish all Shatter Bay Domination races in first place; we just have to wish you good luck, you will need it! Generations on track Despite everything, it must be admitted that the game is fun, albeit with a very steep learning curve in the first few races of the campaign, which feature an artificial intelligence that is even too aggressive, and little margin for error. Furthermore, it is all too clearly subordinated to the level of experience of the player, a factor which implies continually retrying the same tests to gain access to the most powerful cars. As mentioned, the races are very chaotic, almost random. Much better to throw himself headlong into custom circuits, both one's own and those of the users, the ideal field of action of the title where it manages to express all its potential. Racing on our own tracks is a pleasure that is hard to describe, and the possibility of sharing everything online makes the longevity potentially infinite. Technically Bugbear knows his stuff and makes the most of the experience gained over the years with FlatOut. The chromatic and stylistic choice aims at photorealism but not at originality, with a result that is all too similar to the aforementioned Split/Second with beautiful plays of light, especially for races set at sunset. On the other hand, it is difficult to distinguish some obstacles due to the extremely marked contrasts and an image tending towards dark tones. Here too we are far from the dry and colorful style of the Namco saga. Instead, what leaves you speechless is the physics guaranteed by the engine: most of the elements of the track can be torn to pieces, including the target areas indicated by a cursor, which the player must commit to hitting. The dynamic damage on the cars is also excellent. Some sporadic slowdown is fortunately not able to compromise the graphic impact. A last note for the shamelessness of Namco Bandai, which adds songs by Hiroshi Okubo and other exponents of the old Ridge Racer to the inevitable Skrillex and associates in the soundtrack, just to make this experiment even more bizarre for western markets.", "date": "2012-03-27", "grade": "7.8"}
