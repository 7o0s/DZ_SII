{"name": "You're in the Movies! - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/youre-in-the-movies-recensione.html", "text": "The fresh passion for social video games and the recent adverse weather conditions typical of this winter period represent an almost perfect dichotomy capable of renewing the desire to stay at home under the covers playing with friends or family. The vast category of party games, now heterogeneous and stratified for all ages and tastes, renews karaoke titles, quizzes and card games among its ranks. For the first time, however, thanks to the use of the Xbox 360 camera we can act in front of the TV as if we were seasoned Hollywood actors to create our own films, or follow the scripts already written by the director! The traveler has arrived. Choose and perish! You're in the Movies is a half-game, in the sense that it is a software that allows us to act and be edited into a virtual film, but that does so through numerous mini-games in which we have to challenge the CPU or a opponent, creating skits that represent the conditions and the pretext for carrying out certain actions which will then find a logical sense in the final assembly. For example, there are games where we have to hit virtual targets on the screen and dodge blows: in this case our moves will be captured by the camera lens and then reused in a different context, that of the film, where, for example, there is to be taken punch a monster that spits fireballs at us. In another mini-game, however, the director asks us to run a marathon: these scenes will later be used to mount our race in a thriller film that sees us being chased by a bloodthirsty killer. In short, the game part is similar to what has already been tried or seen with the Playstation EyeToy, but the final result is absolutely innovative and fun. You're in the Movies is half a game because not every scene has to challenge someone or get points like in any classic video game; in many shots there is only to recite, without competing. In these cases the director himself will suggest the emotions to show to the camera and it is our skill to make the most of it. At the end of the script, these sketches are then integrated with all the others recorded to form a micro film lasting about half a minute, with the possibility of directly uploading the video on the internet and sharing it with our friends. If I can change...and you can change, the whole world can change! Before starting to play, You're in the Movies asks us to get out of the camera's field of vision, so that we can cut the background once we get in front of us to act, just like in real production studios with photomontages. At this stage, the first problems begin. To work correctly, the software needs to process a homogeneous image, with a solid color and possibly clear. Any picture, shelf or sofa that is inside the frame inevitably compromises the quality of the montage and therefore of the whole game. In order to work perfectly, it would be ideal to play in a room large enough and with a wall with a homogeneous color in the background, a requirement that is objectively not always easy to have. Furthermore, in order to have an optimal dedicated space, the lighting must also be strong enough but not too much: with lights that are too low or too high, the camera sees black. Another problem that is immediately posed to us is the size of the space within which we have to act: the game tells us to position ourselves with the body within the track on the screen, which is decidedly small and therefore we would have to move very far away from the television, to be able to cut our shape perfectly. a fairly large room with a wall with a uniform color in the background, an objective requirement that is not always easy to have In summary, not all people can afford a large room with uniform color and perfect lighting. However, if we manage to obtain an optimal image quality and satisfy all these requests, the game is then pleasant and fun, especially if played in four people, each of whom is called upon to play a precise role (for example the heroes, the bad guy, etc.) and play one at a time or in pairs in front of the TV. The scripts to be performed are numerous, and once finished it is also possible to take film clips and edit them as we wish, thus creating unpublished screenplays. You're in the Movies is not a classic video game, in its stark sense, but it represents a nice diversion accessible and usable by the whole family, even and above all to those who have never played in their life, representingI give for Microsoft that market share that Nintendo and Sony have already conquered with Wii and EyeToy. The other side of the coin is that the proposed mini-games are a little too simplistic, where the action is reduced to making a continuous movement of the hands or arms, or a particular movement. Comment You're in the Movies is a nice and fun diversion to use during rainy winter evenings with friends or family. It is dedicated to those who want to be together with people who have never played video games and want to be together, creating nice movies with the most disparate plots. In order to make the best use of the software it is necessary to have a suitable environment, otherwise the whole game is compromised by a poor image quality which does not allow you to play or view the movies correctly. The mini-games are perhaps a little too short, very simple and many are similar. The pace is not very frenetic, given that the acting takes place one person at a time, and to be fun it therefore also requires a good harmony between the parts. Pros Original and innovative idea Many scripts to make and the possibility to create new ones Possibility to download your own movies from the internet Cons Environmental requirements too difficult to obtain Mini games too simple Slow pace Xbox 360 - Goals You're in the Movies! it's a generous title in terms of achievements to unlock. After a few games you will already see a few hundred points accumulated, obtained simply by participating in all the available films and unlocking new scripts. There are no particularly difficult actions to perform, to get all 1000 points up for grabs, simply play (in multiplayer, above all).", "date": "2008-12-19", "grade": null}
