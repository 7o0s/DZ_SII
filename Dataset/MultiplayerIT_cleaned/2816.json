{"name": "South of the Circle", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/south-of-the-circle-la-recensione.html", "text": "Talking about narrative experiments in the videogame field has now become almost repetitive, given that in recent years we have seen an incredible evolution on this front especially in indie productions, but leaving aside the artistic avant-garde claims, you can follow us in this review of South of the Circle to discover a narrative adventure simply done very well. The quality of the writing, the pace of the narration and above all the acting of the actors involved in the dubbing and motion capture are the distinctive elements of this game by State of Play, a team that has already made itself known for a truly peculiar style that has characterized the his previous productions such as Lumino City, Kami, Kami 2 and Inks. South of the Circle can be considered the team's maturity project, on which it is clearly seen that the investment has been large and the aims set rather high compared to the other titles, although valid but certainly of reduced thickness compared to this one, which finds its maximum expression in a context such as Apple Arcade. The game falls into the genre of narrative adventures, but due to its structure it could be associated with greater relevance to the sub-genre of walking simulators, given the very limited interaction and absolute concentration on the narrative. In short, it is a question of staging a story, involving the player / spectator in its development through choices that above all influence the progress of the dialogues and in some cases the decisions to be taken on how to advance the events. The mechanism closely resembles the one used by Night School Studio for its games, namely Oxenfree and Afterparty, but in this case we find ourselves choosing above all an attitude rather than an argument to pursue, which in any case presents similar ramifications in the unfolding of the events. Obviously such a structure must be based on a quality narration, with an interesting story that knows how to involve and on these aspects it does not disappoint: perhaps it does not have the look of the aforementioned Night School titles in terms of subject and rhythm, choosing a path entirely marked on realism and the almost biographical story, but it has memorable atmospheres, deep topics, well-written dialogues and a truly high-level acting. As well as some surreal and disturbing elements that emerge in the distance, but for these you will have to advance deep into the story. A story of love and freezing cold We are in Antarctica in the 60s, but we are also in Cambridge and in the Scottish countryside: we have made a crash landing in the middle of the ice, trying to reach a scientific basis for climate studies, but we are also at university between research doctorates and student demonstrations against nuclear weapons, in the midst of the cold war. South of the Circle is composed of several juxtaposed narrative planes, through an alternating and chronologically staggered montage, which shows different aspects of the life of Peter, the protagonist: the present is represented by the dramatic plane crash that forces him to cross a part of Antarctica on foot or with makeshift vehicles, but these crossings merge with memories and events that took place previously, superimposing situations and choices, causes and effects. On the one hand we are faced with a real and immediate danger given by the desperate situation in the middle of the ice, with the Cold War in the background and the threat of a face-to-face encounter/clash with the presumed enemy, on the other we have to take some choices that can lead us to definitively embrace the love of a woman, trying in both cases to open our minds and face events with courage and determination. Ultimately, it turns out that the whole thing is a kind of training journey in which the young climate science major Peter must finally find his way, facing his own fears and mental closures of the difficult period in which he finds himself maturing. The gameplay is reduced to a minimum and we find ourselves exclusively touching some elements of the screen to advance the cinematic cut scenes, built with a fascinating low poly style and wonderfully animated, capable of returning one of the best virtual actings ever seen in video game. All of this is also underlined by a truly high-level English dubbing, with subtitles translated completely into Italian. The story is therefore the central element of the experience, but this includes the player in a series of choices that can influence its progress, in what are the only truly significant interactive moments in the ~game~ in question. The different deDecisions are entrusted to somewhat abstract symbols that refer to different states of mind or attitudes to be undertaken in order to give answers, take different paths or channel discussions and situations in various directions. It is not a very clear system, because it is not easy to understand precisely what the different options correspond to, therefore it is a question of going above all on instinct, but there are some specific moments in which the game makes us understand that we are making significant choices, which will then summarize towards the end to compose the life path we are choosing. The vagueness with which these choices are illustrated helps to make us perhaps more spectators than protagonists of the action, but this sense of mystery can also favor returning to the game in several successive runs to try all the outcomes of the different decisions taken, also because the ending is somewhat puzzling.", "date": "2020-11-07", "grade": "8.0"}
