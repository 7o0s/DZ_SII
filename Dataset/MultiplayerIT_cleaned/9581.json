{"name": "Ivy the Kiwi?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/82935-ivy-the-kiwi-il-brutto-anatroccolo.html", "text": "Tested version: Nintendo WiiWhen Yuji Naka decided to leave SEGA to found his own independent team four years ago, he did so with the aim of creating somewhat ~alternative~ products but with universal appeal, while exploring the unprecedented possibilities games offered by platforms such as the Wii and the Nintendo DS. Like all counter-current choices, Prope's philosophy has not yet led to striking results in commercial terms, so the hope is that their latest effort, Ivy the Kiwi?, can give life to a new course for the young Japanese company. Let's start with a couple of clarifications: for the uninitiated, the ~kiwi~ is a funny bird with a thin and long beak, native to New Zealand, which like the ostrich is not capable of flying and therefore moves using its tiny paws. Secondly, the question mark in the title of the game has a precise motivation: Ivy, the little protagonist, is not at all sure she is a kiwi. Like a new ugly duckling, by a mysterious twist of fate it emerges from its egg in complete solitude and is avoided by the other birds, who do not recognize it as their own kind. Trying to turn sadness into obstinacy, Ivy embarks on a journey with the sole objective of finding her mother, wherever she is and to whatever species of bird she belongs to. This narrative incipit is told to us at the start of the game, through a series of static images that recall the features of a storybook and are then reflected in the graphics of the actual game, one of the most characteristic aspects of the Probe product. Poison ivy Between the psychedelic Let's Tap and Ivy the Kiwi? there is an abyss as regards the artistic conception but the important element constituted by perpetual motion remains, albeit with some substantial differences: the character moves without ever stopping within the scenario, and it is up to us to operate so that he does not remain victim of insidious traps or some predator. In this specific case, our task is to pull ~vines~ on which the bird can walk to overcome obstacles and reach the ~podium~ which marks the end of each of the many stages that make up the adventure (they say are one hundred, but during our tests we did not go beyond the fortieth and therefore it is a fact that we cannot confirm). The action goes more or less like this: at the beginning of each level Ivy starts walking fast, she reverses her motion only in the presence of an obstacle but there is no way to stop her. Using the infrared pointer of the Wii-mote (the only controller required to play), which projects a hand-shaped pointer onto the TV screen, we can pull up to three ~ropes~ simultaneously and direct them towards them while we are still stretching them. It goes without saying that a liana placed at a certain angle will allow Ivy to overcome a series of high steps without problems, and in the same way a perfectly straight one, but placed above a dangerous row of nails, will preserve her health by avoiding game over. Furthermore, in the presence of floors placed at different heights, we can pull the ~vines~, make the character climb on them and only then ~rotate~ them to lift him or even throw him in the desired direction. A very simple gameplay, on paper, which however gradually gains speed and asks us for quick reflexes and precision well beyond the reach of any ~casual~ user. There is also multiplayer Ivy the Kiwi? it doesn't necessarily have to be played alone, in fact it has a multiplayer mode for four split-screen players who, equipped with as many Wii-motes, can collaborate to complete each level in the fastest and most effective way possible, or throw sticks between wheels each other with the aim of making the opponent's maneuvers unsuccessful. Don't pull the string too hard The game structure of Ivy the Kiwi? it lends itself very much to a ~trial & error~ approach, especially in the more advanced stages and even more so if we decide to complete each level by collecting the feathers that are scattered throughout it. Our approach to the game can therefore be hasty, pulling a few ropes to literally reach the finish line in a matter of seconds; or reflective, calculating the distances well to explore the scenarios far and wide in search of objects to collect. We will soon realize that the vines we use to transport Ivy are elastic and can be ~grabbed~ by pressing the B trigger of the Wii-mote, pulled and released as if they were slingshots. And the little bird will react to this maneuver of withconsequently, transforming into a projectile capable of breaking through certain types of walls as well as eliminating some enemies. The same role will be covered later by heavy boulders, which we can always move and throw thanks to our ~vines~, while the traps will multiply and it will become really difficult to keep the protagonist alive with only three ~moves~ available. The interaction system chosen by Prope constitutes in many ways a systematic limitation as far as gameplay is concerned: the Nintendo DS version of the game can rely on the stylus and the touch screen, or rather on physical references capable of guaranteeing a certain precision to our maneuvers , while the Wii-Mote can't replicate those performances in any way. In short, ~sudden death~ is always around the corner and not always our fault, and to this cause of potential frustration we must add the unfortunate choice not to assign the instant cancellation of a ~vine~ to any key: if we drew one by mistake (and clearly this is something that will happen often), the only way to make it disappear is to quickly draw three more, with all the necessary difficulties. Finally, a few words about the technical realization: the graphic style is really pleasant and particular, so much so that the only objection that could be made to the inspired work of the developers concerns the choice of colors, which is too little varied. Finally, the musical accompaniment is composed of really good music and a great atmosphere, but at the same time excessively repetitive.", "date": "2010-12-10", "grade": "7.8"}
