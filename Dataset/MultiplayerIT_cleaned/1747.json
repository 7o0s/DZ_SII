Even the very choice of inserting the operator within the Battle Pass makes it clear how the developers are constantly vigilant on market trends (the solution is in fact now a custom for season-based games with passes) to adapt the product and push it in the best possible direction without distorting it. So let's see the fundamental elements of this new injection of content in the review of Rainbow Six Siege: Operation Crimson Heist. Flores Rainbow Six Siege: Operation Crimson Heist: the new operator and his gadget Like every new season, the pivotal element is clearly the new operator. In this case it is Flores, the Argentine operator, which as we anticipated earlier makes its debut within the Battle Pass as the first premium level ever. Born in the Flores neighborhood of Buenos Aires, he abandoned the organized crime he had come into contact with from an early age to enlist in a military academy. Forced to flee because of persecution by criminals, he reaches the United States. It is here that he will join Team Rainbow where he will put his knowledge at the service of the players. His biography also perfectly outlines the in-game identikit of Flores. A shy operator who needs the shade to act undisturbed. His gadget, the RCE-Ratero modified drone, is an effective solution for lines of fire, sneaking into the undersides of walls, or clearing obstacles; obviously needless to say but it is ineffective against reinforced walls. Infiltration with the Ratero requires speed and reflexes, in fact the drone is invulnerable only after the triggering of the charge and its use is limited in time to the countdown that precedes its triggering. In short, you will have to be quick with ideas and you will have to have an excellent knowledge of the map to avoid hitches. As for equipment, Flores has either an AR33 assault rifle or an SR25 single-shot rifle. A GsH18 as a secondary pistol and stun grenades or claymores as a secondary gadget. An interesting operator who has given us satisfaction several times, but who is still very situational. Useful in the initial stages, he suffers the moments in which he remains without cover or in the situations in which he alone has to make a difference. Border and minor news Rainbow Six Siege: Operation Crimson Heist: Border The other big component of the new operation is the Border map rework. The big news concern the modifications of some areas and the balance of the audio in the map. Finally megaphone and helicopter have been fixed. The voice has been removed, while the noise of the helicopter has been drastically lowered in order to guarantee less noise pollution during the game. As regards the structural changes instead, beyond the adjustment of the bomb sites, the big news concern the creation of an external staircase that leads from the floor below to the balcony of the archives and now guarantees more attack solutions and greater rotation, and the reduction of the ~rat trap~ effect that the map had as an intrinsic factor. To manage this factor, two changes have been implemented: the first is the reduction of objects in the rooms (now cleaner and with cleaner trajectories), while the second is the change to the bathroom on the ground floor, now larger in order to offer more solutions. Along with the border map, Operation Crimson Heist brings with it other minor changes. Mozzie's drone now changes its detection to a different flash based on the distance it is from other drones. Also included the Gonne-6, or a solution among the secondary weapons that guarantees a single shot capable of destroying all the enemy gadgets, even the indestructible ones. Finally, an honorable mention should also be made for the two big news in terms of skins, both that of Zofia dedicated to Resident Evil and those of Ikumi Nakamura for Echo and Dokkaebi are really beautiful and also indicate a way for possible future collaborations that they would guarantee an excellent solution that does not distort the playful ecosystem of the game.", "date": "2021-04-04", "grade": "8.0"}
