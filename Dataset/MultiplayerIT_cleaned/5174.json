Both due to the presence of a team like Crytek behind it, and because its exclusive for PlayStation VR has nominated it to be one of the possible killer applications of the viewer combined with PlayStation 4. A special monitored status, therefore, justified by the propensity for experimentation with the new technologies of the Frankfurt-based studio, even after the company vicissitudes experienced in the last period. At the center of what Crytek has achieved in recent times, we find virtual reality: from the Back to Dinosaur Island demo we have in fact moved on to the game The Climb, to then get to Robinson: The Journey. As we are about to see, the latter draws from the two works that preceded it, without however being able - we anticipate it - to scratch as many had hoped. But let's not get lost in further chatter, because the time has come to put on the visor to go around among overgrown lizards. Robinson: The Journey is as good as it gets on PlayStation VR, but it doesn't scratch as much as hoped Like Robinson Crusoe While Daniel Defoe's castaway found himself on a desert island off the coast of Venezuela, the protagonist of Robinson: The Journey has to face the pitfalls presented by an unknown planet, where dinosaurs are still in excellent health. This is Tyson III, a globe very similar to the Earth on which the young Robin ends up following the disaster of the Esmeralda, a colony spaceship that crashed without leaving any other survivors, at least in appearance. The story of Robinson: The Journey takes place months after this event, starting from an ordinary day in the boy's life: getting out of the ship that in the meantime has become his home, repairing the instruments that allow him to continue living in safety and play in the company of Laika. The latter is not a dog, but a tyrannosaurus puppy found in a newly hatched egg, and subsequently trained as if it were a harmless poodle. Apart from the little T-Rex, Robin can count on the help of his HIGS unit, a floating artificial intelligence that instructs the young man on the actions to be performed, also helping him in some tasks. The gaming experience of Robinson: The Journey revolves entirely around these three characters, between whom, however, no particular alchemy is established. While offering some interesting jokes, the HIGS unit is not Portal 2's Weathley and it shows, while the interaction with Laika is too limited for the player to develop any real empathy towards her. Returning to the plot, Robin's quiet life will soon turn into the need to explore Tyson III, which from the point of view of gameplay is divided between a phase in which puzzles must be solved and another purely exploratory. As for the first, we have to say that more could have been done, as simple puzzles alternate with others in which the player ends up wondering what should be done. Not because the riddle of the moment is particularly difficult, but because there is a lack of elements that offer indications on how to move forward efficiently: the result is a bewilderment that in some sections reaches important levels, forcing those who have the visor on their head to wander around without success before getting to grips with the situation. PlayStation 4 Pro Robinson: The Journey is part of the list of titles that benefit from the transition to PlayStation 4 Pro. Unfortunately we were not able to try the game on the latter model, so we will limit ourselves to reporting the improvements that Crytek has promised before output: higher resolution and quality of texture filtering, improved SSDO/SSAO ambient occlusion lighting effects, increased draw distance and smoother LOD generation. However, the quality of the graphics of Robinson: The Journey can also be enjoyed to a great extent on a normal PlayStation 4. Jurassic sickness Robinson: The Journey is much more appreciable when it divests itself of the videogame component, to give space to its second nature as a technical demo. We don't believe it's a mystery, in fact, that this title was also designed to show the capabilities of PlayStation VR and virtual reality in general, representing an excellent spot in this sense. From the moment Robin comes out of his ship, Tyson III puts us in front of breathtaking scenarios, within which it is possible to immerse ourselves thanks to the excellent work done to adapt the CryENGINE to Play VR Station. Thus we find ourselves stopping to admire the pristine scenery of the planet, lowering our gaze to look at the overhang of a waterfall and then raising our nose up and seeing pterosaurs towering over us in the sky. The wreck of the Esmeralda hovers almost constantly above everything, thus enhancing the combination of technology and nature that distinguishes Robin's life on the planet. To tell the truth, the pop-in found in a previous test remains, but the beauty of the setting allows us to forgive it without thinking too much about it. Exploration is also encouraged through some devices, such as the electronic encyclopedia that keeps track of the various races and species that make up the fauna of Tyson III. The player is entrusted with the task of collecting and cataloging them, using the tool that the young protagonist has in his possession. It is a device that also allows him to move heavy objects via a beam, similar in shape to a Move controller: a rather bizarre stylistic choice, given that Sony's ~ice cream~ support is totally absent in Robinson: The Journey, where therefore only the DualShock 4 is used. The guys from Crytek show that they have dedicated a good part of their time to studying game controls, introducing expedients such as the impossibility of running to reduce motion sickness and leaving the player the ability to configure some elements, such as the way in which the right analog stick allows you to quickly turn Robin's gaze. However, the developers must have underestimated the choice of entrusting the free movement of the character to the left lever: in fact, it has rather heavy effects on the communication between the brain and the body, quantifiable in quite important ailments after game sessions that exceed half an hour. The motion sickness also affects the player in the numerous climbing phases, in which the absence of PlayStation Move support has been replaced by the movement of the player's head, who thus has to point to the holds to cling to. Shifting your gaze in this way often proves to be a source of nausea, especially since the elements appear particularly close to our eyes during climbing.", "date": "2016-11-11", "grade": "6.0"}
