You can't ~understand~ the game until you pass at least level 15, unlock the second weapon, tackle the first dungeon, and begin besieging the forts of Cyrodiil. Until then it appears essentially a dull and muddled MMO, a mere shadow of the glorious series that lent it its name. After that turning point, you love it or hate it, and this applies to both casual players and fans of the genre. For fans of the Bethesda saga, however, the situation is a little more complicated, because the world of Tamriel is that, you can teleport from Morrowind to Skyrim and back, but something is missing that makes The Elder Scrolls truly special . Coming to terms with this reality, the ZeniMax Online experiment also becomes pleasant, especially now that the developer has fixed most of the problems that plagued the PC version last year and, above all, has switched to the no-monthly-fee model. All this set of changes makes the console conversion much more interesting than all these months of waiting might suggest. With no monthly subscription, the console version of The Elder Scrolls Online shouldn't be underestimated The O that made the difference It would be madness to bring you an entire analysis of The Elder Scrolls Online again, also because we thoroughly reviewed it last year, so we refer you to reading our old review to better understand the game's mechanics and what distinguishes it from other MMORPGs on the market. market. In fact, not much has changed since then, but in the meantime ZeniMax Online has smoothed out quite a few problems, as anticipated in our in-depth study a few months ago, in which we dreaded the idea of switching to the no-subscription model and canceling subscriptions. conversions for next-gen consoles that had been indefinitely delayed. In the meantime, the game has really moved into a different business model, while the console editions have actually been released and updated to the latest versions of the PC client. The latter, in fact, has undergone drastic changes especially as regards the endgame, and in the meantime the possibility of robbing and assassinating some non-player characters has also been added, perhaps as a prototype of a system of ~justice~ (and bounties , maybe?) still undefined. All these changes are reflected in a truly mammoth PlayStation 4 client: we are talking about almost 60 GB of downloads for those who buy the digital version, and enormous corrective patches which, however, have solved the problems we had encountered in our hands-on of some week ago. The frame rate is much less erratic than before, although it still wobbles from time to time, especially in more hectic situations such as mass PvP, and the cases of tearing have almost completely disappeared: the PC version set to the maximum possible detail still remains a cut above the console ones at least in terms of textures and effects, but The Elder Scrolls Online is still a game of impressive ups and downs. The scenarios - vast, colorful and rich in detail - are occupied by characters modeled and animated arguably, but at least the whole recalls the somewhat eccentric but exquisitely peculiar style of the saga: in short, fans will recognize the surroundings of Tamriel that is possible to explore in this edition, but they will probably struggle to immerse themselves in an atmosphere that fails in the least to simulate the ~realism~ of the previous episodes. Those who expect to be able to do whatever they want, or even just watch the characters go about their lives, will be greatly disappointed because The Elder Scrolls Online is a traditional theme park MMORPG in structure, despite the interface and style of game remind Skyrim several times, and it is no coincidence. The progression in the leveling phase is rather linear and you move from area to area following the main quest and the scaling of the difficulty based on the levels of enemies and objectives, however the distribution of missions and points of interest on the map grants a broader scope than what MMORPGs like World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy XIV might have accustomed us to. In this sense, however, The Elder Scrolls Online struggles to shine, because most of the missions fail to be as interesting or engaging as those of the offline chapters, often ending in a succession of passages in which to fight enemies or interact with the environment, collecting objects or materials, without actively intervening on the status quo of Tamriel. Some missions lead to narrative crossroads, but the margin of choiceit is never decisive and, above all, it does not change the experience of the players around us. In this sense, moreover, the console version of The Elder Scrolls Online carries one of the main defects of the original edition on its shoulders, never resolved because it is too rooted in the structure conceived by ZeniMax Online: the game, in fact, abuses the phasing system in a decidedly approximate way, hindering the players who decide to form a group to the point that in the leveling phase it is simply better to get by alone. Sideways, when phasing is absent, we find ourselves waiting for the current target to appear in the midst of dozens of leaping heroes who totally kill the atmosphere of the most engaging quests, especially if we consider that practically every encounter in the game is dubbed in very good English, and often by professional actors. Playstation 4 trophies Most of the original achievements have turned into Trophies for this PlayStation 4 version: 34 bronze, 8 silver and 3 gold to be conquered to unlock the platinum one. For the easier ones you will simply have to progress through the main quest, while others will involve lycanthropy, vampirism, theft, completing all the missions in the various maps and so on. Speak softly Despite the structural problems that this conversion brings with it, we have to confirm the impressions we shared in our hands-on, when we said that we had a much better time playing with the joypad. ZeniMax Online has simply perfectly calibrated a combat and movement system which, although wooden at the base, lends itself much better to this type of use: it is probably a subjective sensation, yet we had the clear impression from the very first moments that The Elder Scrolls Online, on consoles, has found its true place in the world. The action-oriented combat system revolves around a handful of skills, and perhaps it's also the fact that there are many fewer than in more traditional MMORPGs that makes the title particularly suitable for those who have never played one. Obviously this does not mean that it lacks depth, so much so that, once the possibility of equipping a second weapon and switching the respective builds on the fly is unlocked, the combat system becomes much more enjoyable despite the fact that the sensation of impact and collision when swinging a broadsword or taking a particularly violent blow. The variety offered by the free progression system - which allows you to equip any weapon or type of armor regardless of the chosen archetype - only meets its limits in the endgame, when you move on to the scrupulous enhancement of the main skills based on the role we have chosen to carry out in group activities: in other words, here too there is the triad formed by tanks, damage dealers and healers, but playing alone the discrepancies are much less noticeable. In this sense, The Elder Scrolls Online does its homework well, and between a solid crafting system and extremely complex and layered mass PvP, it offers hundreds of hours of gameplay and lots of content. The problem, of course, remains that of the community. Switching to the subscription-free model should have partially remedied it: quite simply, now that you no longer have to pay a monthly subscription, The Elder Scrolls Online evaluates itself in a different light, especially after ZeniMax Online has improved the basic offer. Realistically, there are now two problems. The first, however, concerns the physiological drop in users that sooner or later will hit this online Tamriel, damaging not only the content endgame which is based almost entirely on group activities, but also and above all PvP, which will lose all meaning when it will no longer be possible to stage the enthralling pitched battles and sieges that characterize it. The other problem, hand-in-hand with group content and the community, concerns the communication system. For some incomprehensible reason, ZeniMax Online has removed text chat, implementing only proximity voice chat. This means that surrounding players will hear anything you say as long as you're close to them and haven't left the zone channel, which also requires annoying menu navigation. The solution used in turn presents at least three problems. The first is a little ridiculous: the game simply disconnects you from the server if you ~clogged~ the voice chat with messages... that is, if you talk too much. We hope your microphone is not too sensitive, because we have only been disconnecteddue to the fan turned on a short distance from our location. The second problem is purely structural: the proximity chat, by its nature, prevents you from communicating with all the players in the area and, therefore, from organizing yourself easily. Put simply, we are limited to talking only to those who are close to us, with all due respect to those who may need help but are too far away from other players to call them. Finally, the third problem is simply linguistic. The Elder Scrolls Online is entirely in English and divides the community into European and American servers: obviously, if you don't speak or understand English, the situation could be really dramatic, especially if you manage to join a group of random players. Playing with a small group of friends, to be heard perhaps by opening a party on PSN, could be the ideal solution to face the adventure serenely and better bear the limits imposed by the economy entirely based on guilds and by the already mentioned defects that weigh down the gameplay and make it an uncertain middle ground between an interesting experiment and the roads already trodden by the competition.", "date": "2015-07-07", "grade": "7.8"}
