How can we forget it: suddenly when it came out, everyone in the family began to play, not only the pimply boy but also his mother, father, little sister, grandmother, dog and cat, with the pimply boy who kept holding rockets RPG and to cast spells feeling increasingly in an Indian reservation, the last exponent of a glorious tradition of hardcore gamers that seemed destined to disappear. Nintendo had created a huge market out of nothing, the speakers were thankful but the players began to look at it with hatred, considering it responsible for the beginning of the end of the world of video games as they had always known it. More than five years have passed, the ~fashion~ of casual games is over, dogs and cats are back to spending their days scratching themselves sprawled in the sun waiting for baby food and cuddles, and Nintendo, incidentally, seems to have embarked on a more wise middle ground with Mario and Link in great shape and a WiiU that promises to be the reconciliation with ~serious~ players; in short, the bubble has deflated, but that doesn't mean that there isn't a succulent market segment left that still wants to train its brain while having fun. It is in this segment that Ubisoft enters with its latest product for 3DS. Kajimoto exits, Robertson enters To be completely accurate, Mind Quiz was originally SEGA's former arch-rival's answer to the Grande Enne brain trainer, whose release followed a few months first on DS and then on PSP, and, not to be missed absolutely nothing, even SEGA enlisted the help of a famous Japanese neuroscientist (well, famous in the field of Japanese neuroscientists), one Dr. Kajimoto. Despite the not exactly enthusiastic reviews, Ubisoft took care of the Western editions of both versions, and evidently the brand must have remained in the hands of the French multinational if it is now re-proposed for a title this time entirely Made in the UK, developed by Ideas Pad with the collaboration of the famous (always in that field there, only this time English) Dr. Ian Robertson. It is a polygonal-cartoonish version of it that welcomes us in the introduction of Keep Trained 3D, an introduction that closely resembles the FMV movies of the first PC games that exploited the CD Rom, and it is not a compliment; but you know, the famous neuroscientists, of whatever nationality they are, pay attention to the substance, and this Mind Quiz seems to have a lot of substance if on the back of the package it promises the presence of 700 different games. In reality we soon realize that the number 700 is not exactly true, and is the result of a calculation that multiplies the game sessions necessary to finish the program by the number of challenges that make up each session, as we will see shortly; there are actually 20 mini-games, five for each category: mnemonic, numerical, visual and linguistic games. It won't be the seven hundreds heralded, but we can't complain. Oh God, we couldn't complain, if only... The 3D effect Quite surprisingly given the general trend, Ideas Pad has exploited stereoscopic 3D in at least a decent way: in addition to the obvious, and which we now take for granted on 3DS, the ~detachment~ between backdrops and game elements, in some minigames, especially the ~visual~ ones, 3D is actually useful for a better performance, while in others, where it would not be strictly necessary, it is used with good results to create nice animations and which at the same time manage to communicate the idea of time passing , pressing the player properly. Perhaps this is the best element of the whole package. Microcephalus! Mind Quiz Keep Trained 3D looks like a real training program: 90 sessions, to be held theoretically one a day, each of which consists of four warm-up games, one for each category to be tackled in the preferred order, once completed receiving at least a C in each (there are six different marks that Prof. Robertson bestows after a performance, from a fantastic A to a terrible F depending on timing and results) you move on to the Challenges, which always consist of a game for each category, this time however slightly more difficult and proposed in an unchangeable sequence. After completing a session, the friendly doctor will offer you a trivia about the human brain and/or advice on how to best use gray matter, both in the game and in everyday life; it is also possible, of course, to consult a summary of one's results expressed in the form of a practical histogram, and thus monitor any improvements or deteriorations in one's faculties. Basically that's all what you can do, and if from aOn the one hand, the training program is certainly well structured, on the other, one cannot help but be embittered by the limitation of the same, which does not offer particular incentives unless you are really greedy for the doctor's suggestions and curiosities, and which does not even allow to tackle the mini-games separately outside the very rigid structure; plus, once you've finished ninety sessions, there's really no reason to put the card back into the 3DS. At least these minigames are good? Some yes, undoubtedly: funny and pleasant they actually test the intellectual abilities of the player. Others however less, much less, and it is not a question of mere personal tastes, but of an unbearable randomness: there is a mini-game which, for example, asks you to complete words by inserting the missing letters, without however giving you any indication on what is the mysterious word. Well, how then does the player understand that perhaps the word he has completed, although very correct, does not exist in the internal vocabulary of the game? And again: another minigame gives you a theme and then you have to touch on the touch screen, among a whole series of words that ~fall~ at random, those that have to do with the given theme; if the theme is ~fruit~ and between the words there is ~banana~, ok, but how many of you know of the existence of a fruit tree called ~kumquat~? At this point the game is testing our culture, and no longer our intelligence, and that's a tad unfair given the purpose. Without then considering all those games whose explanation is not at all immediate, and which will require several seconds before being fully understood, with obvious consequences on the final grade. Finally, as regards the technical-aesthetic part, we can say that this does its duty without infamy and with some small praise, alternating the graphics between vaguely surrealistic backdrops and nice appearances of the aforementioned caricature of Prof. Robertson, and proposing the sound effects and music from a TV quiz show, anxious but without exaggerating.", "date": "2011-11-29", "grade": null}
