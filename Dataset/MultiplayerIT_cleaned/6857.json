Well, Miniclip has taken care of filling this gap with its new single stick shooter. The assumptions are simple: the character is controlled using a single thumb, while the fire is automatic but is only activated when we stand still. A curious and captivating mix, which the development team has declined in the form of a long campaign and a survival mode to surround it, adding weapons, objects and upgrades to unlock to the whole. Was it true glory? We reveal it to you in the Gun & Dungeons review. Gameplay: One-handed! Gun & Dungeons, a firefight As mentioned, the gameplay of Gun & Dungeons stands out for its particular immediacy: the game is controlled with a single finger, piloting a repositionable virtual stick that moves our character on the screen while we hold the device in portrait mode. It is therefore possible to move to avoid contact with the increasingly numerous enemies and their possible projectiles, then stop to launch the attack. The latter is activated completely automatically, changing modes depending on the weapon equipped and the power-ups collected. therefore it is not possible to direct it as in the classic twin stick shooters nor decide which opponents to frame and hit: you have to trust the proximity aiming system, but it is clear that this mechanism turns out to be a limit when the degree of difficulty begins to increase, in particular during the boss fights that conclude every single dungeon. Structure: many internships but large paywalls Gun & Dungeons, survival mode is distinguished by dark backgrounds The formula created by Miniclip for Gun & Dungeons appears simple and effective, and can also count on a robust structure, in this case a campaign made up of ten chapters, each of which is divided into ten dungeons of increasing difficulty, as well as a survival mode that provides some small variations on the theme. The problem is the paywalls, which reveal themselves too suddenly during progression: despite having enhanced the character to the fullest and having selected a weapon (the shotgun, in this case) capable to inflict big damage at close range, in fact we found ourselves unable to beat the boss of the tenth stage because he was too resistant and equipped with insidious attacks. At that point the usual grinding became necessary, therefore replaying already completed missions in order to obtain the resources useful for further growing the character, but with a big hitch: an action energy indicator that requires ten minutes of waiting for each unit, while consuming at least five per game. In short, the one chosen by Miniclip for its new title is a very invasive free-to-play approach, even considering the microtransactions for the purchase of crystals, the only currency that can be taken to continue after game over, and the abundance of more or less temporary bonuses that can be obtained by watching an advertising trailer. Technical realization: perfect voxel Gun & Dungeons, inventory management It is really a pity that the Gun & Dungeons system soon proves to be so limiting, given that on the technical implementation front the developers have done a really excellent job, delivering us very stylish, colorful and well represented voxel graphics, which runs at 60 fps or 30 fps depending on your preferences. Despite the cubic shape, both the protagonist and his enemies and the big bosses boast excellent characterization, and this uniqueness is also enhanced by the sound sector, which thanks to a set of good effects and of perfectly functional music accompanies the action in the right way, without ever being annoying.", "date": "2022-07-13", "grade": "7.0"}
