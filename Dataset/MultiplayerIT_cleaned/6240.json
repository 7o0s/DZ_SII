If you move your gaze from the printed media to video games, Bandai Namco does the honors, with dozens of titles published in recent years taken from all the most successful successful series, some of which are confined within the borders of Japan, either due to a lack of appeal of the reference brand that would not justify the localization and distribution costs, or due to game mechanics that are not very similar to Western tastes. In any case, when it comes to an ~all star~ title with all the most famous exponents of manga inside, the exception is immediately made and even if we had to wait more than a year, the time has finally come for the launch by J-Stars Victory VR+. Without asking too many questions regarding the actual nature of the characters and the series involved, the developers have chosen the blows as the common denominator of all the narrative universes involved, with a three-dimensional fighting game that makes fan service its strong point. If seeing Luffy team up with Goku or Pegasus fighting alongside Kenshiro makes the otaku in you thrill, then thank Bandai Namco who surprisingly also manages to slip in some effective and extremely pleasant gameplay mechanics. J-Stars Victory VR+ brings together more than fifty characters in a highly spectacular 3D fighting game A new world Talking about a plot for the adventure mode of J-Stars Victory VR+ would be decidedly ungenerous towards those titles that actually have a plot, given that it is a bland glue to act as a link between all the various battles that we will face while shooting for the game world. At the center of the story is a tournament organized by a mysterious deity who will grant a wish of the winner. The development is somewhat trivial, both in the quality of the dialogues that present each mission, and in the presentation of the same through static two-dimensional screens. We will find ourselves facing a series of combat missions and the search for specific objects ranging through settings linked to the various narrative universes, but everything is rather flat and monotonous, both due to the level of difficulty calibrated downwards and due to the very nature of the plot. At the beginning we find ourselves choosing whether to play Luffy, Naruto, Ichigo or Toriko, but it doesn't really change anything to choose one over another, given that the missions and the sequence of events will inevitably be the same. In this sense we would have liked to see a more dynamic and engaging mode, which would put the player in a position to impersonate more than one character during the clashes, touching more franchises and narrative plots, perhaps taking a cue from a very eventful story like that of Dead or Alive. However, it's up to put your soul in peace and move on, given that to complete the roster it will still be necessary to get to the end of at least one of the four adventures. The gameplay runs towards us with a fun and accessible combat system, very immediate but also full of nuances for a deeper approach than a mere button mashing. Nothing excessive, mind you, but still suitable for both low-demand players and those who want to try their hand at making the most of the advanced mechanics of each character. In this sense, in addition to the simple weak, strong blows and the related combos, there are area attacks, break defense, dodges, projections and a sort of perfect parry that opens the door to an immediate counterattack. Given the variety of the move pool and the related animations, all attributable to the specific attacks of each character seen in the manga or anime, what gains is the spectacularity on the screen, with energy beams, special moves and bodies flying from side to side other of the arena. Playstation 4 trophies J-Stars Victory VS+ provides fifty Trophies for all those who will have the patience to completely finish the adventure, including the secondary tasks, and to try their hand at the other modes to unlock all the main and support characters and the one hundred J-cards Stars. Clash in Free Battle and online will be necessary for the coveted platinum. At the last shot Being a three-dimensional fighting game with a view behind the fighter, the arenas acquire a fundamental importance in the economy of the matches. In terms of variety, the goal is fully achieved thanks to scenarios ranging from Naruto's Leaf Village to Toriko's Vegetal Sky, passing through the temple of Athena and the Penguin Village, with some that focus on verticality with scalable palaces and buildings, while others are more airy and suitable for attacks in flight. However, some design choices partially undermine the dynamism of the clashes: the vastness of the arenas tends to be dispersive and consequently slow down the pace of the fights, despite the possibility of grappling with the opponent and the invisible walls that limit the area of game too many times they helped us to frame the enemy and fill him with blows until the KO. Playing 2 against 2 with the added possibility of calling up a support character is the best way to have maximum fun and move matches by organizing yourself with multiple attacks aimed at the same objective and managing the energy bar and the fury bar that it unlocks in the best possible way the ~Fury V~ power-up. This allows you to launch very powerful and ultra-spectacular attacks capable of turning the tide of a match. There are also cards to equip to each character to enhance it and make the most of its peculiarities. Undermining the enjoyment of the clashes is an artificial intelligence that is not very reactive in certain situations, both on the side of the opponents and in the control of the teammate, to which we can still give general instructions to direct its behavior by pushing it to be, for example , more aggressive or more conservative based on the opponents and the evolution of the match. In the end, playing it together with a friend (online or in split screen) and perhaps against as many human opponents is the best way to enjoy J-Stars Victory VS+. In this sense, the Free Battle and Online Battle modes add several hours of gameplay, but there are also Towards Victory and the classic Arcade for increasingly difficult challenges against artificial intelligence. On the technical front, there isn't much to say: J-Stars Victory VS+ does not deviate from expectations, with graphics that are certainly improved compared to the PlayStation 3, but lacking in many points of view, from the quality of the textures to the details of the models figures of fighters. The sound is also good, with music taken from the respective anime and feature films, and a successful Japanese dubbing.", "date": "2015-06-29", "grade": "7.5"}
