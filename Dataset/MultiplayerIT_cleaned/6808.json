{"name": "Anatomia di una storia", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/139658-enola-anatomia-di-una-storia.html", "text": "Enola is easily described as a first-person horror adventure that follows in the footsteps of Amnesia: The Dark Descent and its successors. The game system is equally simple and immediate, with the protagonist who, in addition to walking, can run, crouch and interact with some objects, collecting them as needed to use them later by recalling them from the inventory, in pure graphic adventure style. The player takes on the role of a woman, Enola, who must find out what happened to her beloved, Angelica, who disappeared mysteriously. To do this he will have to explore his dream world and reconstruct the pieces of his past, reading the notes scattered around the maps and facing related situations that come directly from his unconscious. The first impression Enola is a particular title, not so much in the gameplay, which as we will see is not at all different from the typical one of the genre, but in the structure of the levels and, above all, in the ability it has to bring the player from an initial repulsion, mainly due to the bad technical side, to a sincere interest in what is being told, a sign of good writing and the ability to modulate the story properly. But let's go in order and describe the first impact with the game, certainly not positive. If we were based on first impressions, Enola could be archived in four words, to be taken from the vocabulary of epithets. Graphically, the title of The Domaginarium is really bad, even for an independent production, with poorly modeled graphic elements, low-grade animations, washed-out textures, bare maps and so on. It is sincerely difficult to find something that is worthy, if not perhaps the general atmosphere, guaranteed by the gloomy tones and by the arrangement of some disturbing objects that decorate the maps. Also from a level design point of view there are several problems. The world of Enola is semi-open, in the sense that the game is divided into levels, but with large explorable areas where there are objects necessary for a complete understanding of the story. Having to explore is certainly not a bad thing, but the lack of reference points, although the situation has improved with the 1.02 update, makes the process too anxious, with the player very worried about having lost something important along the way to understanding the narrated facts and follow the various aspects of Angelica's story. Even the save system is not the best, with the impossibility of freely recording the game, having to rely on music boxes distributed for the levels, not always placed in very comfortable positions with respect to the flow of the game. One of the cornerstones of the gameplay are the aforementioned puzzles, which do not require a great deal of mental effort to be solved, since they are often limited to finding some object to be used where indicated by notes and suggestions and nothing more. Let's discover Enola, a horror adventure with controversial themes that is channeled into the Amnesia vein A captivating story In short, so far there is little to save from Enola, apart from the puzzle that does their job. Fortunately, the initial impressions soon give way to a sincere interest in the story told, which becomes increasingly dark and desperate, as it is adult and unedited for the world of video games. As we said, the narration is conducted above all by reading documents, even if there are short filmed sequences, made with the game engine, and implicit descriptions of the traumas suffered by Angelica detectable in some of the elements that make up her dream world. The same enemies that infest some areas, not particularly difficult to avoid once you understand how to do it, are soon revealed as part of the story, which from the point of view of coherence is really solid and well conducted. In short, Enola is the classic title that relies almost completely on its narrative side to excite the player, revealing a surprising maturity in a story that escalates with the discovery of each new message. Too bad for the problems already reported, to which we can add a certain woodiness in the transition between areas, very similar to that seen in the old nineties survival horror in which each area was loaded separately. At the time it was a necessity dictated by the limited memory of gaming machines, today it is a much less justifiable solution, if not done properly. A similar problem concerns monsters, which when they grab Enola disappear by starting mini death cutscenes. In the author's intention there should be particularly horror moments. In fact, they translate into nuisances that don't add much to the atmosphere and which, on the contrary, dampen the tension, making the monsters more tangible.", "date": "2014-10-27", "grade": "6.0"}
