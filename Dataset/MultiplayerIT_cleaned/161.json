{"name": "Bratz Forever Diamondz", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/bratz-forever-diamondz.html", "text": "The passion for fashion! Bratz Forever Diamondz is basically a kind of adventure in which we will play one of the four Bratz, Jade, Sasha, Cloe and Yasmin, and with which we can indulge ourselves in doing a little bit of everything, including buying music from a shop, use your cell phone, buy and look after a puppy, and much more. The Bratz world is essentially formed by a mini city divided into sections, such as the shopping center and the fashion promenade, in which there is a large number of shops where you can perform various tasks, such as creating a T-shirt, buying food for your dog, make a photo book, change the makeup to the Bratz, and go to the movies. Once the chores in the city are finished, you will have to return to the ~base~, or the Bratz office, where you can save the game, take a look at the wardrobe, change the Bratz you are impersonating, and above all observe the progress of the fashion magazine that it will be up to you to carry on. One of the goals of the game is to create articles for the Bratz magazine, articles that are assigned to each of the four characters. Then, depending on the Bratz you are impersonating, you will have to perform tasks through which the pages of the newspaper will be filled, such as taking photographs of flowers and fountains, or dabbling in creating a dress and wearing it for photos in an agency fashionable. Another simple way to pass the time is to go around the city on rollerblades and have a chat with friends, who often offer us to take part in fun mini-games, including speed skating competitions and special exhibitions for our puppies to play. Moving between the shops and remembering everything you have to do is not an easy task, in fact there are many places to visit and the tasks that will be assigned to us, but luckily we will have a very useful mobile phone with us, ready to use for any eventuality . The most important functions of our mobile phone are the Agenda and the Find menu, with which we will always know what our goal is and above all where to find the store or the area we need to reach. The multimedia functions, on the other hand, allow us to take photographs (obviously indispensable for some of our missions) and to create a personalized soundtrack, with the songs that we will buy at the music store. The other features that cannot be missing from a respectable mobile phone are the Address Book and the Messaging, through which it is possible to always keep in touch with one's virtual friends and the rest of the Bratz group. Bratz Style! Graphically, something amazing is certainly not to be expected, but all in all, it cannot even be said that the work done is bad. The models of the Bratz and other characters are well animated and fairly detailed, and the textures are very clean and cartoonish. Everything else is done in perfect Bratz style, in which the strong abuse of bright and gaudy colors (especially pink) helps to make everything rather cheerful and feminine. For the type of game, the graphic impact is more than sufficient, and it can be said that the only real flaw lies in the lack of detail of the environments, which tend to appear a bit bare. Our supermodel life will, as already mentioned, be accompanied by a good number of original Bratz musical motifs, the genre of which can be labeled as dance/pop. Technically speaking we are at very low levels, but it must be considered that some of these songs are pleasant to listen to even for a long time, and can be an excellent soundtrack for a young girl. Furthermore, let's not forget that each of the characters we will meet in the game (including the Bratz) has its own voice, this was possible thanks to a well done and completely Italian dubbing. Comment Bratz Forever Diamondz is a game that in some ways satisfied us, thanks to the discrete variety of things that keep the player busy: skating, using the cell phone, taking pictures, creating clothes, looking after a puppy and more It's basically for this reason that, against all expectations, Bratz Forever Diamondz is able to give several hours of fun to all (e) those who love the world of Bratz, and who for once want to try playing virtually with their favorite dolls. It goes without saying that this title is expressly created for a very young female user, but perhaps there was no need to say it. Pros: Decent realization of the Bratz style A myriad of tasks to do and places to visit Satisfactory technical department Cons: Aimed at a targetand very specific To end the year on a high note, THQ has decided to take advantage of a very popular license among girls from all over the world, namely that of the antagonist Barbie dolls: the Bratz. If you are reading this review it necessarily means that: you are female, do not exceed the tenth year of age, and you love dolls; the alternative is that you are brothers/dad forced to give a gift to your favorite little sister/daughter, but you don't know what to buy, and this game seems like the only hope to make her happy. Whichever of the aforementioned categories you belong to, Bratz Forever Diamondz has all the numbers to be exactly what you were looking for: a title that can keep young girls with a ~passion for fashion~ glued to the screen as much time as possible. The main purpose of the Bratz is to capture the attention of teenagers by exploiting the charm of supermodels, a charm obtainable thanks to the use of tons of make-up, long and backcombed hair, trendy dresses, and chic attitudes. Bratz Forever Diamondz manages (unfortunately) to reproduce this ~charm~ in a very faithful way to the brand it represents, and can become a rather fun game for those who love it.", "date": "2007-01-19", "grade": null}
