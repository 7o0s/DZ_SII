{"name": "Universe at War - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/universe-at-war-recensione.html", "text": "A difficult but possible challenge The story of Universe at War, despite its very nature as a video game, is complex, deep and unfolds through battles and intertwining between four different species. It all begins in 2012, when the alien race of the Hierarchy lands on earth; thanks to its superior military and organizational technology, it manages to conquer the planet in a short time, sweeping away the terrestrial resistances. However, the human race had survived. The military survivors are helped by the Novus, a highly advanced robotic species that manages to exploit energy networks to move and attack: the Novus are the historical antagonists of the Hierarchy, and they fight them throughout the Universe. The ongoing war on earth then manages to ~awaken~ the ancient Masari civilization, until then dormant at the bottom of the ocean and once at the height of their civilization, when they built pyramids and Mayan constructions on earth. Upon their return to the surface, they discover a world destroyed and the human race on the verge of extinction. The controls of Universe at War After the attempts of Warcraft III, Starcraft and Command and Conquer, the developers of RTS have evidently not given up on stubbornly wanting to adapt a genre purely suitable to be played with mouse and keyboard, in their ~simple~ home joypad counterparts. The main difficulty in playing these adapted versions is always the same: managing dozens and dozens of characters, weapons and vehicles simultaneously on the screen, with the sole aid of an analog stick and a few keys. In RTS it is essential to be able to move quickly from one part of the game map to another, without wasting time, and to lock the elements of the battlefield that we want to manage in a fast and intuitive way, with no margin for error. The gameplay of real-time strategy games holds no mystery for fans of the genre. However, in the console version of Universe at War there are particular solutions that make the commands versatile and effective, despite being given by a joypad. After a brief introduction showing us a Novus base, the adventure lands on earth and we immediately start fighting. The game maps are initially small, but already after the first few hours they become more extensive and varied. To move the game view quickly, just press the right trigger and move the portion concerned with the analog: in this way you switch from one side of the map to the other with extreme speed. Certainly it is a movement that is always slower than possible thanks to the PC mouse, but it is an excellent compromise. The pointing system was the second problem to solve: in an RTS it is necessary to be precise, selecting exactly the ones we want to activate in a sea of elements on the screen. Also in this case the triggers of the Xbox 360 pad enter the scene very well: pressing the right backbone opens a display menu at the bottom that shows us the icons of each character and half present. By choosing and pressing the confirmation key, the pre-selected elements are selected en masse, without the risk of erroneously hooking other objects. There is also another way, faster but less precise, by moving a cursor on the battlefield while holding down the X key, which indiscriminately activates everything it passes over. The graphics sector is unfortunately not worthy of the PC counterpart, with low definition textures and vigorous slowdowns in the most agitated phases of the game when the screen comes alive with dozens of characters. The general look is ok, the style and the character design too, but the impression that from Universe at War is that of being a game from too many years ago with some elements, such as the vegetation, which seen from a distance have the air of small artifacts, seen their shine on the screen. But let's see the three factions in detail, following the order in which they will be used during the campaigns: the Novus are technologically very advanced but do not have a great resistance to enemy blows. This relative weakness is compensated by the incredible speed of movement allowed by the possibility of creating a real network of towers. Moving entire armies in a few moments is something new for RTS and makes this faction the most dynamic and suitable for rushes. The only way to stop the Novus is to destroy their towers or lead a massive attack into the heart of their base, trying to raze key infrastructure before the enemy has a chance to regroup. The Hierarchy, on the other hand, follows an entirely different philosophy. Armies are slow but extremely powerful, infrastructure is limited but mobile, allowing them to spawn troops right where they rage.battle, and, above all, they can use marchers, metal beasts bigger than the screen and capable of wiping out entire armies by themselves. Lastly there are the Masari. Their way of fighting is really special. Everything is centered around their base, which has an automatic system for collecting resources from the surrounding world and which can be easily set up as needed. The Masari can also switch from Light materia to Dark materia, radically changing the abilities of the army. Exploit the potential Why create three such well-characterized races if you then choose to create a campaign that doesn't allow you to use them to the fullest? If you are among those who do not play multiplayer, you will miss out on many of the potential of Universe at War, because it is only by playing online or participating in a skirmish that you can truly understand the peculiarities of the three factions which, instead, in single player are under exploited. The problem is that the missions are far too guided and it is difficult to make them deviate from the tracks set by the developers. Probably a narrative that is too invasive does not bind well with the RTS, but it is a pity to know that many will not enjoy the title 100% since they will not be aware of the depth that is hidden behind the scientific research system of the factions which allows for great customization. Indeed the single player campaign is the weakest part of the game, as it is quite boring despite some good intuition. The problem is that as soon as one realizes that the only strategy that pays off is to do what the developers have foreseen, enthusiasm dwindles and, if the story hasn't managed to involve us, we risk losing all interest in what happens on the screen . There are some more open missions, for heaven's sake, but the substance doesn't change much. In some levels it almost seems to be faced with a RPG with troops, since everything is focused on the hero of the moment (one for each faction). Comment Universe at War for Xbox 360 is a product with many merits but unfortunately also some limitations that make it potentially unexpressed. The controls via the Joypad are well studied and work, despite being slower and more cumbersome than the PC counterpart. The missions and battles to be faced are many, varied and well structured, always resulting different also by virtue of the three very differentiated and well-characterized playable factions. Universe at War, however, suffers from some poor design choices such as the inability to zoom-out more than allowed. The game is very confusing in many situations and the AI often adopts questionable strategies. To complete the judgment, a decidedly subdued technical sector, with low definition textures and numerous slowdowns that affect playability. However, given the shortage of RTS on consoles, fans would do well to give it a chance, especially if they are eager to play it online. Pros Well-adapted controls Long-lived and very varied One of the few console RTSs Cons Graphics Some visual issues AI takes too many self-defeating initiatives Xbox 360 - Goals Like any Xbox 360 title, Universe at War is also giving away the canonical 1000 points to unlock. Each campaign unlocks an achievement, while many of them are related to the online component, by winning multiplayer battles. Still others are obtained by performing particular actions, such as collecting cows (which are found in large quantities in the fields), turning civilians into zombies or building the first buildable structures or energy generators. Completing the game doesn't get you many points, so you need to look at the objectives in order to ~understand~ them and complete them all. AI and camera Not only does the game suffer from the latter problem, because otherwise we could solve the review simply by recommending it to all those who love online. Despite the general goodness of the work done, unfortunately there are defects. The most obvious is the AI of the troops, which occasionally takes the initiative and does things that no one has ever ordered it, such as starting the attack with your head down despite having received the order to hold the position. It doesn't happen very often and, with practice, you learn to limit personal initiatives, but the problem remains and, especially by playing multiplayer, it becomes complicated to recover situations compromised by rash moves made independently of our will. Another flaw is represented by the camera. The amount of framed game world is very limited but the possibility of zooming out is also limited, which makes it cumbersome to move many troops from one point to another. The problem becameThis is annoying even in the presence of the biggest troops, i.e. the marchers of the Hierarchy, who alone occupy a large part of the screen. Is it so difficult, in 2008, to make graphics engines that allow you to zoom out so that you can see a large portion of the battlefield?", "date": "2008-04-02", "grade": null}
