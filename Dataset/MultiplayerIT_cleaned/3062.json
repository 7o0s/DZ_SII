{"name": "Super Fowlst 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/super-fowlst-2-la-recensione.html", "text": "The stumbling block of the interface has always been a huge limitation in reproducing some classic and fully arcade gaming experiences such as action or platform in mobile format, but in some cases it is possible to find very convincing solutions, as we see in this review of Super Fowlst 2. It is necessary to go out of the box a little, for this reason the best solutions often come from games conceived specifically for these platforms, studied starting from the touch screen as a basic element, not as an obstacle to be indulged by transforming it into a pale imitation of the controller . And if these good structural ideas are also seasoned with a remarkable artistic direction and a lot of creative madness, then you really risk being faced with a very interesting game, as in this case. The first Super Fowlst had already convinced us, with its bizarre mix of characteristics and genres, but this sequel represents a clear evolution in several respects and therefore can only be evaluated positively, as one of the best ~action~ (so to speak) currently in circulation on mobile platforms, at least taking into consideration the most recent productions. The basic mechanics have remained more or less the same: it's about guiding a chicken through various levels, overcoming obstacles and fighting everything that moves around us: there's something deeply arcadey about this obsessive presence of threats and in the need to destroy them as soon as possible in order not to be destroyed in turn, which is very well associated with the elementary nature of the control system. The first chapter was rather unnerving in this respect and this too is no joke, but it is a necessary annoyance, induced ~by design~ as a founding element of the game itself: touching on the right or left of the screen makes the protagonist perform a jump in this direction and by combining various touches with the right timing, it is possible to gain altitude and reach apparently inaccessible places. The problem is that it is not possible to perfectly control the parabolas of the chicken, therefore it is necessary to calculate - limited to the simplicity of the controls - times and spaces to be able to arrive precisely where you want and above all without giving up, given that the scenarios are full of dangers of various kinds. Combat introduces two more commands that fit perfectly into the overall style of the interface: a swipe up allows you to attack with the power-up in use, while swiping down deals damage from an impact. chicken wings As we said for the original, it feels a bit like a fusion between Flappy Birds and Downwell with some roguelike mechanics, and the strangest thing is that, although this may seem like nightmarish material, it is instead an idea that works. The control system remains difficult but is somehow more pleasant than the original, while the level design is especially enriched in a notable way in this second chapter: although the structure of the levels remains rather simplistic, deriving from a random generation, the quantity of enemies and above all the variety of these, which lead to decidedly unexpected situations, are probably the extra weapons of Super Fowlst 2. Even compared to the first one, however, we note a further turn towards violence: rather sadistic obstacles, heinous enemies at the beyond their generally peaceful appearance, they determine somewhat impactful scenes, even more being represented by a graphic style that focuses on comic cuteness, but this is a bit part of the rather crazy nature of the developer Thomas Young and his works videogames. Again there are puzzle elements scattered throughout the levels, with the need to perform certain actions in the right sequence to open new areas, following a rather basic logic. All this, combined with the intrinsic difficulty of moving by fluttering and constantly fighting with the force of gravity, determines a rather rich and demanding gameplay, compared to what one might think at first, even if always very fast and elementary as regards the controls. In Super Fowlst 2 we are continually engaged in managing the bird, trying to lift it off the ground, make it reach the desired platforms and above all make sure that it survives in the midst of an overwhelming amount of dangers. In all this, we note how the game world has become richer and denser, in general more lively: variegated monsters and different creatures keep the interest and curiosity high to see what lies ahead, progressing from level to level, while the pixel graphics go wild in a real party ofanimations and colors, with a style of impact and gore over the top. On the technical side, we must point out a problem of no small importance: tested on a Samsung Galaxy S8, the game crashes regularly after a few seconds, which does not happen using iPads. Given the extent of the problem and the fact that it also occurs on other devices (according to what was reported by various users in the reviews on the Play Store) the developer will clearly have to fix it as soon as possible with a patch, because otherwise the game will be unusable on some devices. Super Fowlst 2 is offered as free-to-play with ads that, while not exactly invasive, certainly break the pace of the game in a sort of Rogue-lite like this. Also considering the proposed value, unlocking the version without ad at a cost of just under 5 euros is particularly recommended.", "date": "2020-06-03", "grade": "7.9"}
