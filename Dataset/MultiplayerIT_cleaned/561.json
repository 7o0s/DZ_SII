{"name": "Tycoon City: New York - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tycoon-city-new-york-recensione.html", "text": "I wanna wake up in a city, that doesn't sleep The first choice to make when starting a new game of Tycoon City: New York is between the two game modes available: in fact, if one allows us to build the city without limits with all the districts already unlocked, it is certainly the other, which sees how the only initial place available is that of Greenwich Village, the most interesting and stimulating. After a very quick initial tutorial that will provide only a basic smattering (to then offer further explanations during the game) we will in fact find ourselves starting from the district mentioned above with a tidy sum of dollars available, a population to satisfy and many ideas to put up. First of all, don't worry: if you initially feel lost, you will be surprised by how quickly the interface will open up to your knowledge, leading you to familiarize yourself with the game system in a fairly short time after which you will be able to move skillfully between the available menus and the alleys from New York. After so much talk, however, it's time to start our climb to the ranking of the richest in the city, so it's better not to waste time and immediately devote yourself to building the foundations of your own economic empire. the amount of buildings that we will be able to build (once we have unlocked them all) is definitely satisfying I wanna wake up in a city, that doesn't sleep Initially we will have only some of the total building types available, which will however be enough to satisfy the needs of the population of Greenwich Village given that, as the tutorial also suggests, it is advisable to keep in mind above all in the early stages of the game that a bar in New York collects always a certain favor among the people. At this point, however, the problem turns into how to ensure that our business rises above the others, guaranteeing economic returns and popularity for our business: Deep Red has obviously also thought about this, giving our New York alter-ego the opportunity to customize your buildings through the arrangement of signs (especially to increase the area of influence), various embellishments (especially plants) and other improvements such as increasing the number of seats for restaurants and the like or introducing staff additional as distributors of flyers and sandwich men to make their place known by highlighting it. The amount of buildings that we will be able to build (once we have unlocked them all) is decidedly satisfactory, given that it will be possible to build practically all types of commercial activities (from the shoe shop to the mobile phone shop, passing through blacksmiths and florists) and cultural (theatres, cinemas, museums, art galleries and more). I wanna wake up in a city, that doesn't sleep Since the world began, however, a city is not made up only of shops and attractions but mainly of houses: this too will be an aspect not to be underestimated, partly because people will have to go and live somewhere, and bad planning urban planning could also put our economic activities in difficulty, but above all because it will be good to also pay attention to the type of houses we are going to build next to certain types of premises. If, for example, we intend to open shops where we can buy above all very expensive luxury goods, it will be good to place them near buildings inhabited by wealthy families, just as vice versa, near student apartments, it will be better to place night entertainment and cheap shops, which may not affect too much on the population budget. Building New York Every city in the world has monuments, works and other peculiarities that make it unique on the whole globe. Could you imagine Rome without the Colosseum, Paris without the Eiffel Tower or London without Big Ben? Of course, New York is no less, given that it can count on a series of buildings that are also as famous all over the world as the European ones mentioned above: first of all, the Statue of Liberty, but also churches such as that of the Trinity and that of St. Patrick's Day and buildings such as the Empire State Building, without forgetting green corners such as Central Park and many others, just to name a few of the Big Apple's attractions. If the development team has given the possibility to build everything according to their own ideas, this does not apply to historical buildings, for which an ad hoc system has been created: all of them will in fact be placed in advance in a virtual way by the game itself, under form of building site or simple fenced park. In the case of the former, through the achievement of certain objectives (of the kind of quests that the game will entrust us with, to put it in RPG terms) we will have at our disposalion of special points to be used precisely for their construction, which in any case will not fail to bring money and fame into our pockets. As far as the parks are concerned, the management is very similar to that of the buildings, with the possibility of inserting amusements, attractions and various plants in order to make the area unique and colorful and, therefore, a valid point of relaxation for all the inhabitants of the metropolis. [C] The detail is; extraordinary What would NY be without taxis? A rapper in the middle of a Greenwich Village park [/C] Another important feature of our economic empire is linked to the number of commercial chains that we will be able to raise, creating success and leadership within a given sector: after having built a certain number of shops of the same type we will have in fact, the possibility of building the headquarters of this commercial activity, as usual, is represented by a skyscraper. It goes without saying that the more majestic our headquarters will be, the more prestige we will obtain also against the other tycoons since after all we are in New York, and having the tallest building certainly represents a status-symbol for any entrepreneur who wants to be respected at least . From Little Italy to South Beach Building a city like New York while sitting comfortably in front of your PC must also be pleasing to the eye: Deep Red has certainly understood this since the level of detail and the scalability of the engine are certainly at levels far beyond simple sufficiency. Seeing the faithful reproduction of famous places or the way in which the same building can change depending on which district of the city hosts it is certainly one of the main attractions of the game, combined with the ability to rotate the shot as you like and tighten the zoom down to the smallest details of the alleys in the heart of the city or widen it to have a spectacular metropolitan view. From the point of view of the audio sector there is nothing particular to note given that the soundtrack and the various effects fulfill their task without making a miracle cry. From Little Italy to South Beach building a city like New York sitting comfortably in front of your PC must also be pleasing to the eye: Deep Red has certainly understood this Final comment After some controversial titles, Deep Red seems to have finally specialized in the production of ~Tycoon~ through the creation of this product, certainly valid from most points of view as we have seen in the body of the review. The only sore points concern a pace of play that is sometimes too bland and that too often fails to press the player and offer that level of competition capable of putting hardcore gamers in difficulty. It being understood that this Tycoon City: New York remains a product at least to try for all fans of the genre, based on what has just been said, the more experienced players could lose interest after having built all the buildables and having admired monuments and characteristic places of New York. Conversely, for players who do not spend large amounts of time in front of the PC and are looking above all for a way to relax in a video game, this game probably represents the ideal with the added value of being able to see one of the most beautiful and important in the world.Pro Building in New York is quite another thing Many buildings to be built Excellent graphic reproductions of the Big Apple Against little competition Pace sometimes bland Tycoon what a passion Zoo, RollerCoaster, Airline, Coffee, Casino and so on and so forth. Those just mentioned are only a small part of the videogame trend identified by the word ~Tycoon~, which over the years has taken steps to put the player behind the desks of more or less important companies for the sole purpose of becoming the number one on the market, earning flowers of money. Deep Red Games knows very well how much this type of game is appreciated by the public, given that in recent times they have decidedly specialized in the creation of titles related to the economic-strategic genre, through games such as Beach Life, Seaworld Tycoon and Monopoly Tycoon only to name a few. Given that the product most appreciated by the public was just the last of those just mentioned and that the English team certainly couldn't sit idly by keeping their fans dry-mouthed for a long time, they decided to create a new game from grandiose ambitions: to rebuild New York from the ground up.", "date": "2006-04-03", "grade": null}
