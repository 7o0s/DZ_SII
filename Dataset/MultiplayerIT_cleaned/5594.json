{"name": "La dura vita della morte", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/166304-deadbolt-la-dura-vita-della-morte.html", "text": "Blinded by the difficulties of 3D modeling and the innumerable complications associated with the art of animation, many think that developing a two-dimensional title is a shortcut, a kind of easy way to become a successful independent programmer. Following this line of thought, however, a monstrous quantity of factors is underestimated: the need for a more solid than normal artistic direction, for a stylistic imprint original enough to distinguish from the crowd and the obligation to put in place mechanics and systems capable of making overshadowing the ~big graphic~, which far too many players now consider a must. Hopoo Games are part of that small group of indie developers who know all these things, and in particular this tiny team has always followed the line of hard and pure play, where simple but concrete mechanics are combined with a very high level of challenge, with the clear will to bewitch a small niche of veteran players. Their latest project, however, is a far cry from their first offspring, Risk of Rain. In fact, we are talking about Deadbolt, a title that is always two-dimensional but largely detached from the roguelike structure to which these talented guys have accustomed us. Who knows if it is appropriate to be afraid of the Hoopo reaper, or to welcome death with open arms. Being the grim reaper is tough, especially if you have to kill people who are already dead Stay dead Deadbolt is clearly the illegitimate son of Hotline Miami and Gunpoint, but he is a godson of the good ones: tall, blond and blue eyes, to understand. The choice of these two titles is not only linked to the color tones and flowing blood, the gameplay of Hopoo's work after all takes part of the stealth mechanics and puzzles of the Suspicious Development project, and pastes the shootings of Hotline, even going to increase the difficulty curve not exactly delicate of the latter. You step into the worn out clothes of a grim reaper, busy limiting the consequences of an unexplained invasion of the undead. Guided by a mysterious voice coming from the fireplace of your cottage, you will soon find yourself enmeshed in a plan involving many more creatures of darkness than expected, and you will have to drive them all back to hell with the efficiency that only death himself can have. It is a fairly interesting premise to build on and, although the plot is rather hermetic, it at least manages to make you want to read the brief introductory dialogues of the missions or the insights of the cassettes scattered between the levels. The variety of situations that is created by this simple narrative line is still impressive, and consolidates the firmness of what is the core of the experience, or the gameplay. And it's not a system that is difficult to explain, far from it: the view is lateral, with maps showing sections of buildings full of alternative entrances and approach possibilities. Your alter ego, then, can do very little apart from aim, shoot, open doors and take cover behind some elements of the scenario. To brighten everything up, therefore, elements detached from the basic mechanics think about it, such as the presence of ventilation ducts in which the reaper can pass by transforming himself into smoke (really essential to overcome some uncomfortable situations) or an incredibly aggressive enemy artificial intelligence, which reacts to noise and actively searches for you when it notices your presence on the map. Hard as bone Such combative enemies are nothing new, but when you realize that a single shot is enough to put our handsome reaper out of commission, you also immediately understand that progress in Deadbolt will not be a walk. The situation is similar to that of Hotline Miami, precisely: a trial and error made up of sudden changes of strategy and studded with human errors, which becomes even more intricate when the variety of enemies makes the leap in the second phase of the game. The missions are in fact many and, after a series of shootings with zombies of variable resistance, vampires and skeletons begin to enter the mix, often equipped with specific skills. There are bloodsuckers that are impossible to kill without first eliminating their phylactery (often hidden in another room), skeletons that appear out of nowhere taking the player by surprise, bat monsters that take an entire clip to knock down, and even some boss whose elimination is practically a puzzle in itself. The study of the environments is very important, and the layout of the rooms must also be studied to best apply a rudimentary stealth system linked to turning off the lights,able to offer significant advantages during missions. The player's precision and quick reflexes are never neglected in all of this, for the record. In other words, each phase of the game must be approached in a strategic and patient way, without head shots or random shootings. Sometimes the daredevil mentality can pay off, but these are isolated cases in a sea of avoidable deaths. The absence of intermediate checkpoints will soon eliminate any tendency to sudden aggression, however, don't worry. Pixeldeath In short, the difficulty curve is one of the steep and very difficult ones to climb even for trained players, and the weapons that can be purchased from Charon in exchange for the souls of the enemies are not enough to facilitate the situation. As soon as the vampires begin to show their pale flesh, the sudden deaths become numerous, and we go from 3-4 departures per mission to 20-30, at least until we understand the bad habit and start playing with our brains. For this reason, Deadbolt is not a title recommended for the faint of heart or for those without peace of mind: dying at the last moment of a practically completed mission due to an oversight is a more frequent than tolerable eventuality, and there is no shortage of combinations of opponents capable of paralyzing the facial muscles with their infamy. The positive side is that the fault almost always lies with the player, since apart from some annoying bugs that create problems in collecting the weapons scattered on the screen (rare, but problematic given the shortage of bullets) there are never really intolerable situations. After all, the enemy artificial intelligence is not very brilliant, and apart from some senseless behaviors, it has predictable patterns for the more shrewd users. Nothing to say about the technical sector instead, minimal but pleasant and full of character enough not to get tired. A respectable soundtrack helps to immerse yourself in the atmosphere of the game, and the presence of a map editor ensures considerable longevity for those who will fall in love with the system. The campaign is already refreshingly rich, but community-created maps of rare cruelty are popping up around.", "date": "2016-04-07", "grade": "8.0"}
