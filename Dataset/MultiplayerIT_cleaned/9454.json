Bulletstorm's motto is also a manifesto as simple as it is eloquent of the offer of the new shooter developed by People Can Fly and Epic Games. Legend has it that the scoring system that accompanies the player throughout the adventure and beyond was born almost by mistake during a preliminary testing phase in 2007, to be precise, during which it was realized that the use of the whip to bring enemies closer and the kick to push them away was used as a pretext to start a sadistic ballet with the opponents, rather than as a simple way to kill them. From that cue was born the evolution of torture porn in a videogame key, an experience where you are rewarded for shooting the unfortunate person on duty in the attributes and then beheading him or for prolonging his suffering by torturing his body on some wall full of spikes. Gratuitous violence? Absolutely yes! Fun? Pretty cool! How I kill you in 130 different ways We had already had the opportunity to talk at length about the first hours, the mechanics and the general setting during a test published a few weeks ago. Played from start to finish what has been said then acquires further strength by virtue of a great variety which, apart from a small decline towards the middle of the eight hours necessary to complete the game, makes Bulletstorm an original and very fun experience. On balance there are only three defects that prevent the experience for the single player from becoming truly unforgettable. The first flaw manifests itself immediately, a new game has started: People Can Fly chooses to start slowly, to tell of space pirates, stories of revenge and of a planet, Stygia, which once looked like a paradise and was corrupted by the hand of man. It is drawn from sci-fi entertainment products such as Firefly/Serenity to then introduce characters such as the evil General Sarrano or the wild Skull tribe. Nothing bad, just that the effort in this direction is superfluous, as is the low pace of the first half hour. The plot in Bulletstorm is amusing when it is made up of short flashes with crazy movies and nothing more, intervals to an action based on Skill Shots: executions that mixing the use of weapons with that of the whip, environmental interaction with ability to slide and kick in the air. A sandbox combat, as they say lately, where killing is just a pretext for entertainment. And the beauty is that the developer has not only committed themselves when it comes to designing the game mechanics, but has finished them in a more than optimal way. When you lift an enemy into the air, however you decide to do it, only he enters a kind of stasis that slows him down, while the player and the rest of the world - therefore the rest of the challenge - move at normal speed, preventing you from doing of all levels a simple choreography; here first of all you need to be skilled, not stylish. The weapon upgrade system itself, through which you can also buy the very powerful secondary shots, is instantaneous but pushes you to search the database for the Skill Shots that have not been completed, still loaded with the increased bonus reserved for each first execution. With open mouth Established that People Can Fly has worked hard to create an all-round combat system, succeeding, what would all this goodness be without the right amount of different situations in which to exploit it? Nothing, and in fact Bulletstorm manages to effectively mix more traditional sessions, even interlocutory ones, with real moments of delirium. Passages such as those inside a skyscraper collapsed on one side, in a disco or inside a building but with a storm of lethal lightning outside, enhance the mechanics described in the previous paragraph but become ordinary administration at the end of the game. They pale in comparison to helicopters between whose propellers propel a huge mutant, breakneck escapes from giant magnetodynamic generators, radio-controlled dinosaurs and botanical gardens full of poisonous spores capable of immobilizing nearby enemies. At times some rules are bent to the needs of level design, but the excellent realization of these moments makes the compromise lightly forgiven. This is the case of a collision with a plant of biblical dimensions during which the slide, which usually ends after a few meters when you are on the flat, becomes continuous to allow you to go around the monstrous creature. Putting aside the bosses then, the variety of opponents is remarkable with the attacks coming from the short, medium and long distance as well as in different ways. Some enjoy an ammount of extra life points compared to the others or of parts that must be hit to destroy the armor, before sinking a few projectiles into the vital parts. Others even feel like a throwback from the days of Painkiller, like kamikazes running towards the player brandishing explosive collars. Moving through the levels is a pleasure precisely because at any moment there is always someone to let off steam on, to throw an explosive barrel at or to throw on cactus with deadly thorns. The problem, and here comes the second flaw that we feel like pointing out, is that for the levels you always move in the company of at least one companion controlled by artificial intelligence but no cooperative mode along the campaign is contemplated among the options. Of course: the coop is not necessary per se, but a lot in Bulletstom seems to suggest its presence, at least at an embryonic stage of development. Perhaps it would have broken some balances, it is true, but for this very reason it would have been perfect as a bonus to be unlocked once the game is over, for example. What replay value? As already mentioned, it takes about 8 hours to complete the Bulletstorm campaign. In short, a little more than the average of modern shooters, even if there are a couple of elements that should increase that value. First of all, the design of the levels invites you to get higher and higher scores or to unlock new Skill Shots which are often environmental, specific to certain passages. So it happens that you reload a checkpoint for the sake of running it again, only better. Second and even more important stimulus to get back to playing: there is the Echo mode which asks you to (re) complete some clips - twenty in total - obtaining the maximum possible score. In this case the points obtained, the multipliers but also the playing time count, so it is necessary to test yourself again and again to limit any possible waste of time. There is no shortage of online leaderboards and other tools, such as a reporting system that highlights where friends have done better than us, inviting us to return to that challenge. Overall Echo Mode is a nice addition that gives a few hours of extra fun. The problem - and here we come to the third element that made us slightly turn up our noses - is that a sui generis, crazy and original product like Bulletstorm would also have deserved something more bizarre, extreme. The four difficulty levels - from Easy to Very Hard - are ok, but why not add an extreme level of challenge? Or some mode with weapons that have infinite secondary shots? Experience would lend itself well to this kind of excess. From a technical point of view, the game performs very well and the internal co-development at Epic Games shows. In fact, the Unreal Engine 3 is not a brand new engine by now, but in the right hands it manages to do really excellent things: the glimpses of Stygia often summarize the contrast between uncontaminated nature and what has been added by man, alternating wild environments - even prehistoric, as in the case of the lair of a huge beast - to others futuristic, with metropolises and amusement parks for families. From the sky to the depths of the earth, all levels have a specific and distinctive look which has not however prevented the creation of detailed, richly detailed environments. The enemies themselves recur several times but have a good variety of skins, never getting boring. In terms of effects, what stands out is the use of lights which, if it doesn't leave you stunned by the number of sources or revolutionary reflection techniques, amazes you by how they are positioned so as to enhance the most evocative landscapes. In terms of performance, the machine used for the test, indicated in the box at the bottom of the page, had no problems staying above sixty images per second with all effects and 4X anti-aliasing for most of the game, with only some peaks downwards in the most agitated moments. How I kill you In total, including the whip, there are eight weapons in Bulletstorm. A number in and of itself not very high but to be re-evaluated according to the fact that they are all different in terms of functioning and, above all, have a secondary blow that revolutionizes their use. The latter can be purchased by spending skill points on special terminals which, in Anarchy mode, also allow you to increase their power and reload speed. The rifle, a machine gun good for all occasions, allows when its special shot is loaded to discharge a single , a very powerful projectile that instantly incinerates less powerful enemies. The pistol is more exotic: very precise when used normally, it is loaded with a sort of firecracker that projects thetarget, before detonating it. The inevitable sniper rifle, on the other hand, has a secondary mode similar to that seen in Clive Barker's Jericho, with the single shot addressable at will, while the pump unloads an unprecedented power, capable of hitting even those who are behind the first target. There are also some far more exotic weapons. This is the case of an explosive bola-launcher or a cannon that unloads large spherical bombs onto the ground, even in a bouncing version with a dozen explosions that tear apart anything in the vicinity. Finally, to close the overview are a kind of crossbow that launches metal stakes and the whip itself which, as a secondary function, allows you to throw surrounding enemies into the air, starting possible combos. Gang bangs If the whole single experience is a long, intoned solo that continuously pumps adrenaline into the player's veins, the multiplayer wanted to be the same thing in the heads of the People Can Fly guys, only experienced in the company of up to three friends. To obtain this result, it was decided to recycle the concept of Horde already seen in Gears of War 2 and then in a host of rivals, bending it to the peculiarities of the game. The result is the Anarchy mode which, having chosen an arena from those available and set some settings more than anything else graphic, vomits against the four unfortunate waves of opponents, increasingly numerous, powerful and well armed. As imaginable, the Skill Shots also return in this scenario, thus also gaining a further dimension: if usually the work of approaching the enemy or his projection into the air is functional to unleash the fire of one's weapons, here the same gestures can be assists that propitiate kills performed by teammates. A type of game that is rewarded with special achievements, new moves and even higher scores. Very often, even the last opponent of a wave has the name of a specific kill on his head which, if performed, adds multipliers next to the skill points. It's quite simple as a concept but all in all it works, so much so that after the first interlocutory waves we realize that the only way to reach the scores necessary to unlock the following ones is to try to coordinate in increasingly devastating combinations. Unfortunately, however, in the era of persistent progression systems, the lack of an ultimate goal is felt, something that pushes you to return to Anarchy mode for more than a few evenings. As it is, it is a diversion that does not annoy in any way but cannot stand alone on a pleasant but content-deficient multiplayer offer, as well as not very original.", "date": "2011-02-22", "grade": "8.8"}
