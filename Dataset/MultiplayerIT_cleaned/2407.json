{"name": "The Sting!: essere gangster felici e realizzati", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-sting-essere-gangster-felici-e-realizzati.html", "text": "!!?? But what game is it? Somehow cataloging The Sting! in a specific videogame genre it was more complicated than one might think. The first impression is that of being faced with a graphic adventure, but to be honest, if we want to talk about adventure, it would certainly not fall within the canons we are used to. The aim of the game is to carry out our good career in the world of organized crime, and to do so it will be necessary to carry out some predefined ~hits~ in sequential order, in different areas of the city. As we progress in fame and expertise we will have ever more efficient means and ~collaborators~, and starting from a banal burglary with a crowbar at the petrol station near the house, we will arrive at daring bank robberies, passing through the classic robberies in gun in liquor stores. Everything in the game must be planned, so before carrying out a coup we will have to prepare an adequate ~plan~, as taught by every healthy criminal tradition. The planning process is as original as it is difficult to describe in words; in essence, the execution of each theft will be ~memorized~ through a special interface similar to a recorder. It will then be possible to ~rewind~ everything, make changes, select the most suitable accomplices, the vehicle for the escape and the ideal equipment (lock picks, blowtorch, etc.) before executing the entire plan in its final version. And at this point there will be the unexpected: if, for example, you have miscalculated the times of the police patrol, some nosy cops could pass in front of the door you have just broken into... in which case they could think that it is not very probable that the owner of that business picks its lock with a crowbar in the middle of the night. Naturally on these occasions you will have to review your last plan, a bit like Wile E. Coyote. Ultimately The Sting is yes an adventure in which it will be necessary to explore a city, find the right objects and talk to the NPCs, but it turns into a sort of management when you have to invest the finances obtained with your ~business~ , select the tools of the trade to pull off the more complex heists and so on. Furthermore, once you are engaged in drafting your criminal plans as champions of chaos and dishonesty, it will seem like you are trying your hand at a Lemmings-like puzzle game, in which it will be necessary to move our aspiring mafia with millimeter precision, between a patrol of vigilantes and the other, dodging the police cars and controlling the noise of our ~interventions~ at the locks. Go for the adventure/puzzle/management, but be it in 3D Surely you will remember Grim Fandango, the Lucas title which constituted the proverbial turning point in the world of graphic adventures, determining the definitive affirmation of the polygon on the now obsolete 2D graphics. Above all, it was the new control system that made many enthusiasts turn up their noses, as collaterally with the arrival of the third dimension there was the abandonment of the old formula based on the use of the mouse (which produced classics such as Full Trottle and Day of the Tentacle, plus the first three Monkey Islands). In short, an adventure in which to move you had to use the pad or the keyboard, according to many, distorted the genre a bit. It goes without saying that The Sting also projects us into a three-dimensional world, but the control system is instead pleasantly retro, being based on the more classic point & click. Not only that, but the interface through which to interact with the surrounding environment is exactly that of the old Full Trottle and Monkey3: once you place the mouse on an object and hold down the left mouse button, a small menu will appear with the icons of a hand, a magnifying glass, etc., depending on the different actions you can perform. It is a rather classic interface, but which goes well with the general setting of the game, certainly more modern, putting the player at ease. It must be said that, on the other hand, in terms of graphics, we are not in very good shape: the super-deformed-pseudo-cartoon style of the characters and the crazy architecture of the buildings are very appreciable, which are reminiscent of the old Lucas productions, but the The 3D engine certainly doesn't shine for being avant-garde. The 3D models appear somewhat rough and jerkily animated, the polygons that vanish into the walls are the order of the day, and annoying bad-clipping is everywhere. On the sound front, on the contrary, I can only be satisfied, especially for quel which concerns the nice 50s tunes that seem to have just come out of the Dick Tracy film. promoted? It is undeniable that The Sting is a rather original title, which blends an all in all innovative concept with a control system that mimics some illustrious productions of the past. The fusion of genres that underlies this game leads to the birth of a somewhat spurious gameplay, but no less enjoyable for this, provided you compromise with uninspiring graphics and with the fact that the different missions (the different ~shots~ to be made in short) are proposed in such a linear way, leaving little room for the player's initiative. If you are looking for something new you might find The Sting! interesting, but in any case I would recommend watching the demo before proceeding with its purchase. When I grow up I want to be the boss Titles such as Gangster and the awaited Mafia seem to confirm the happy moment of ~simulations of the underworld~, which seem to have taken hold in recent times. In particular, in the Sting! we will play Matt Tucker, a small-time criminal, determined to make a name for himself in the world of organized crime, in a classic 1950s metropolis dominated by the even more classic Italian mafia.", "date": "2001-09-07", "grade": null}
