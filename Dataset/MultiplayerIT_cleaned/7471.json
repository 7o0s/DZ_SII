Unexpectedly, Need for Speed: Rivals instead takes up the tradition inaugurated by Criterion with Hot Pursuit, expanding that same open world philosophy to the maximum consequences and exploiting the online component as much as possible. Autolog and All Drive therefore merge into a dual career, as a Racer or as a policeman, up and down the streets of Redview County, an imaginary American statelet that collects all the best that the USA can offer in terms of landscapes, from deserts to snowy mountains. Not an easy challenge for the newborn Ghost Studios (but it is good not to be fooled, given that more than half of the talents come from Criterion), also given the development between two generations. The result is a solid and multifaceted experience, provided of course that you appreciate the unique style of arcade racing signed by the developers who came to prominence with the Burnout saga. Of Need for Speed: Rivals we will remember above all the extraordinary tension that accompanies the races Cops and robbers Although they may appear similar, the two careers offered by Need for Speed: Rivals have characteristics that make them unique, and profoundly change the way you approach the roads and dirt roads of Redview County. As the Racer, the main aim will be to create as much chaos as possible, because the greatest source of virtual money will derive from breaking the rules of the road. By participating in the races, present in the area in a variety of different stipulations, challenging the other racers in very rapid head-to-head and setting speed records at the speed cameras, in fact, you will accumulate the classic game currency, i.e. the Speed Points, but not only . Once a certain number of road crimes have been committed, the Racer's level of suspicion will rise, both increasing the score multiplier and attracting more and more attention from the police. Given that the only way to secure the accumulated money will be to return to one of the refuges scattered on the map, and that the capture will mean the loss of all the accumulated gain up to that moment, it is clear how to play as the Racer means constantly running an increasingly higher risk, the growth of which also corresponds to ever greater earning opportunities. On the other hand, the gameplay as the policeman presents less risk, and is suitable for more relaxed sessions overall. First of all, there will be no risk of losing the Speed Points accumulated in the session and, moreover, the accumulation of the latter will be less essential for progression, given that the cars will be unlocked as the grade progresses, and automatically provided by the department of police. The game currency will still be used, albeit to a much reduced extent, for the purchase of gadgets, in all respects similar to those available to the Racers, and coming directly from Hot Pursuit. Among these we find in fact the spiked strips, the stun mines, the electromagnetic pulse, the boosted turbo and the shock waves, with the possibility of installing two of them for each machine owned, and a progressive increase in effectiveness as one progresses in the career. In addition to progressively completing the various activities on the map during free exploration, both for the policemen and for the Racers, Need for Speed: Rivals also provides for a more structured growth, based on the so-called Speedlists. These short lists of objectives (usually three or four at a time) require the player to complete several tasks, mirroring whether you are playing as the illegal pilots or on the side of the law. Thus, the Racers will have to reach the maximum speed or win a certain number of clandestine races, while the policemen will be required to capture a certain number of pilots, or to successfully use offensive gadgets. In this way, the developers have guaranteed a constant tension on the game map, with the objectives of the two factions that irreparably end up colliding violently, giving way to furious chases. At the same time, the duality that characterizes the progression of Rivals guarantees a good variety of approach to the gameplay, with the Racer career devoted to a more aggressive style and in constant uncertainty, and the policeman career instead more relaxed, however characterized by the unique charm to feel constantly on the hunt. As for the driving model adopted, pad in hand, lawyerthe strong legacy of Hot Pursuit (and, wanting to go further back, of the Burnout saga), with vehicles endowed with the right weight, yet able to launch into drifts well beyond the limits of the credible, somehow maintaining a credibility entirely arcade. Even the differentiation does not disappoint, with the ~muscle cars~ capable of unloading an absurd amount of horsepower on the ground, even if they lack pick-up, and the ~super cars~ credible in their absolute driving precision. Human or AI? As was the case with the previous Need for Speed developed by Criterion, the quality and quantity of entertainment offered by Rivals are closely linked to the availability of an online connection. Only if you are connected to the EA servers, in fact, a maximum of six players will be able to live together in the same game session, and take to the streets in the role of Racer or policemen. All the other participants will instead be entrusted to artificial intelligence, thus guaranteeing a constant number of members of the two factions in play. Although the number of online participants is actually limited, and perhaps for this very reason, the guys from Ghost Studios have worked with great care on the routines that characterize the Racer and policeman AIs, with success. If there weren't the username in sight to identify the pilots in the flesh, distinguishing between AI and humans really wouldn't be easy, thanks to the excellent routines put in place by the developers. Both in the shoes of the Racers and in those of the police, the opponents led by the CPU will always know how to move with aggression and intelligence, making the most of the gadgets at their disposal, but also, occasionally, making mistakes, especially when under strong pressure. The centrality of this aspect was evident from the very first tests of the game, and, fortunately, the test can be said to be passed brilliantly. The importance of progression The entire play offering of Need for Speed: Rivals is strongly characterized by a strong sense of progression, essential to keep interest high, also due to the open nature of the map, with the race events largely available immediately . Right here the well-known open world philosophy of Criterion successfully marries the two careers, which, with a constant flow of cars, gadgets and customizations to unlock, find a way to keep the player's attention discreetly alive. At any time, it will in fact be possible to decide when to stop following the more guided progression offered by the Speedlists and start exploring, challenging other Racers (or chasing them) and setting records at speed cameras. Slightly against the trend, we soon notice that the map is less large than one might wish, given that after the first 5/6 hours of the game it will have revealed most of its surprises, and, past a certain limit, the unlock of new cars may no longer be enough as a reason to continue. This is exactly where Autolog comes into play to a greater extent and the importance of the friends list, from which the system will automatically select the best performances among those of its acquaintances and will propose to the player to beat the various records from time to time, whether speeds recorded by speed cameras, race times or speed zones, i.e. stretches of road where you need to step on the accelerator as much as possible. As in the past, the expedient works, provided you have a sufficient number of active friends in the game, thanks to which it will be possible to significantly extend the experience offered by Rivals. If not, unlock the best cars (a task that took us about 13 hours), the decline in interest in progression is inevitable. As for the customization of the vehicles, this is limited, but still welcome, and allows you to vary the color of the bodywork and rims, add a good number of decals (not all beautiful in terms of design, to tell the truth) and increase the performance of the vehicles. both in terms of resistance, both in terms of acceleration and top speed. The streets of Redview County In characterizing the fictional county in which Rivals is set, the folks at Ghost Studios have done a great job. Although, as already mentioned, the dimensions of the map are less generous than a first glance might suggest, the mix of landscapes and different roads to explore is remarkable, from highways between canyons to winding mountain roads, complete with climate and dynamic day/night cycle. Between the main routes and the many alternative routes, there is plenty to explore, although the greater population of some areas in terms of events to complete leads to a constant crowding in the same fiveue or six map points. Having been able to try the game extensively on both Playstation 4 and PC, we got a pretty good idea of how the cross-platform nature was handled, and the opinion is overall good. Frostbite 3 moves a considerable amount of polygons with agility, without renouncing the partial destructibility of the environments and the damage model of the cars, capable of effectively reproducing damage to glass, bodywork and plastics. The mass of moving polygons, with excellent results also recorded by the detailed models of the cars, however has a considerable price in terms of frame rate, blocked at 30 frames per second on all platforms. Given the great sense of speed that characterizes the races offered, this limitation is annoying, especially on PC, where the lock appears absolutely forced and specious, perhaps for the purpose of maintaining the most homogeneous experience possible on all platforms. This is also accompanied by a fair number of graphic bugs, especially interpenetrations, which we hope can be resolved with patches after the release, but they cannot fail to weigh on our overall opinion. Another not indifferent technical limitation, and this unfortunately not solvable, derives instead from the ~host based~ nature of the online sessions. In fact, if the guest disconnects, all the players connected to that session will have to wait for the migration to complete before resuming play (about a minute of waiting, on average), losing at the same time all the progress made in case found in the middle of a racing event. Excellent results, on the other hand, on the audio front, with an excellent sampling of the rumbles of the super cars, and a very varied licensed soundtrack, flanked by original compositions that accompany the most excited moments of the races.", "date": "2013-11-19", "grade": "8.0"}
