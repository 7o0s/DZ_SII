Raise your hand who, at the time of the publication of the fifth and last episode of Life Is Strange, was indifferent, with a clear conscience and feelings. Or who was quiet after wrapping up the second of three Before The Storm episodes, with that final ~revelation.~ Liars. And now history repeats itself: the story of Chloe Price and Rachel Amber find their conclusion. And, regardless of your choices, the grand finale will never be just sad or just happy, otherwise it wouldn't be able to do justice to the human ~drama~ that underlies the entire series. But in the end it is precisely the mix of mixed feelings, not only in the characters but also in the player, which have contributed to making the title so famous, in such a short time. Hell is us Maybe it's a coincidence, but the titles of the three episodes of Life Is Strange: Before The Storm are connected in a perfect way. It's not just a matter of numerical progression or semantics, the attempt to assign labels that somehow make sense. On a deep level, they manage to keep pace with the evolution of the characters, almost everyone, the changes in the game world and the unfolding of events, which keep escalating until the final climax. Awake showed a Chloe grappling with a reality that she no longer recognizes as her own, due to internal conflicts over her father's death, and external conflicts for a new family that feels like hers; but it was also Rachel's awakening, from the fiction she had thrown her life into. The Brave New World, the title of the second episode, was both what the two friends were trying to build, and at the same time a hostile world where nothing is as it seems, and even the strongest beliefs turn out to be lies. In short, a sort of hell: but as the last chapter of the prequel trilogy tells us, Hell is Empty. It's empty because we fill it, it's the characters, with their very existence and with their actions. Perhaps it is difficult to accept, but behind the concepts of Life Is Strange there is a very often disenchanted vision of reality, up to some extremes in pessimism. And perhaps, after all, the title of the third episode also gives you an idea of where the direction is going. We don't want to make spoilers of any kind, or anticipate anything to the players, but in short... do you remember, no, how did the second episode end? Now the path traced goes in that direction: to dig more and more into the past of Rachel Amber, a character so important that in the first Life Is Strange there was no time to delve into it. The narration becomes much more tense and fast, so fast that the chapter seems shorter than the previous ones, but without really being: we are, as always, in the context of about a couple of hours of play (going calmly) to complete it. The overall quality can only be enhanced. The first two chapters had some tired moments, let's face it: situations in which it was necessary to waste time in the various environments to do futile things, a filler to counterbalance the more agitated situations and purely dedicated to narration. All right, moments like this have always been there, but rather than moving for the umpteenth time to a junkyard in search of objects or Chloe's room, for once the narrative sequences are the masters, with more dialogue and choices that never. Playstation 4 trophies Now that the third episode of Life Is Strange: Before The Storm is finally available, platinum is also within everyone's reach. Just make all the graffiti, finding the right areas to welcome them, and complete the adventure. Apparently the bonus episode didn't turn out to be necessary to go platinum, and will have its own separate slate, but the latter is our guess. The right decision, before the storm Speaking of choices, we're sorry to make you anxious but it's time to come to terms with your past actions. The way you decide to act in Awake and Brave New World will have consequences from the very beginning, affecting how secondary characters will address you, as well as other actions you can take. Starting with a certain amount of money that you may have decided to keep for yourself, or to return to the rightful owner. Sometimes it's very simple, even this time, to know what to do to be a good boy. Other times not. Absolutely not. As with some choices regarding Rachel's family, above all the final decision of the season. A point in favor also for the almost unique session dedicated to the exploration of the environments, in one of the rooms of Casa Amber. The way the developers decided to make us behave by searching for items, and then using them at one of the p pointsmost intense and crucial episode, it's really interesting. Because there are many false leads to be followed, and in the end none is really the exact one: so much responsibility in one's hands is always complicated (and satisfying) to manage, and will certainly make happiness for those who always want to get the most out of narrative adventures in terms of possibilities. Instead, it seems that the mechanics of the Insults Competition have been forgotten: it returns in a single case, not even fundamental, and it does not work as we remembered it. We probably won't see her again in the future, or at least she will be seen again, which is good since she could have been likeable once or twice, no more. In any case, the writer is very keen to underline that, when we talk about Life Is Strange Before The Storm and indicate its ~defects~, we must remember two things. The first: the title is a narrative adventure. It means that if the genre doesn't interest you, and not even the plot manages to grab you, then you won't be able to fully appreciate it, because it's a game - not a game - in which the decisions taken, the relationships you establish between the characters, and much much less the few explorations of the environments. The second: within this genre, all in all very modern in the drift undertaken in recent years, Life Is Strange is placed on the top step. Because despite the few mechanics, the gameplay is the one that has studied the most profound, interesting and original mechanisms: even just using a cell phone to read messages from one's friends and family, faithfully recreated also for types of language. But above all, Before The Storm wins on all fronts for the maturity, audacity and depth in the issues addressed. It's not just a game based on reality: it's reality. The problems of the characters, the small and big dramas, the world of drugs, crime, conflicts of interest and passions are an everyday matter. Maybe we can't see them anymore because we've adapted, maybe we really needed a video game to bring them back to the foreground.
