{"name": "World's End Club", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/worlds-end-club-la-recensione.html", "text": "Regardless of the assessment that can be made at the end of this World's End Club review, anyone who wants something original and with a strongly Japanese taste on Apple Arcade should probably try this game from Izanagi Games. The project comes from the (distorted) minds of Kotaro Uchikoshi, creator of the Zero Escape series, and Kazutaka Kodaka, author of Danganronpa, or a real dream team if you want to build a game capable of combining psychological thriller restlessness, anime spirit and a pinch of Japanese irony, which transpires quite well from World's End Club, which in addition adds to all this an apparently childish characterization, with the result of making some situations even more distressing. On the other hand, the background of the two authors clearly emerges from the premises and from the first minutes of the story, when an apparently daily and joyful situation turns into a nightmare with hallucinatory tones. In a class of an elementary school in Tokyo, the ~club of daredevils~ was created, made up of kids with peculiar characteristics and personalities, but apparently within the limits of the ordinary. During a quiet school trip on the outskirts of the Japanese capital, a cataclysm upsets reality and transfers all the boys into a sort of waking nightmare: when they wake up they find themselves trapped in an underwater amusement park and forced to play a disturbing ~game of Destiny~ which forces them to fight against each other, only to discover an even more distressing reality once their freedom is regained on the surface. Without delving into too much so as not to run into spoilers, the premise is that these children find themselves in a sort of post-apocalyptic world and in a place far from home, forced to travel a long march of 1200 kilometers in an environment that hides threats everywhere. In such a desperate situation, however, strange powers awaken in them, making each child endowed with extraordinary abilities and progressively revealing the true role of the Club of the Daredevils in this new world in ruins and dominated by metaphysical and unknown forces. Gameplay: A narrative action adventure Both Uchikoshi and Kodaka are authors much more prone to narrative experiences, perhaps with a certain focus on puzzles especially as regards the former, therefore the fact that in this case they have ventured into an action adventure with 2D structures and platform elements is a something new that increases the curiosity for World's End Club. However, the background of both emerges clearly, for better or for worse, in the structure of the game: the direct control of the characters, in 2D scrolling action style, is probably the worst thing that can be found in experience. The use of the controller is practically mandatory in order not to run into a nervous breakdown but in any case the design remains strangely based on a staid action that clashes absurdly with the emergency of some situations, which should raise the pace. What comes out is therefore more of a strange 2D scrolling adventure with simple puzzles than a real action with puzzles, but even this from a certain point of view increases its bizarre charm. The first phase with the introduction to the ~Game of Destiny~ offers an atmosphere immediately in line with the typical sadistic games of Danganronpa and Zero Escape, not surprisingly, but it almost seems like a sort of intentional self-quotation, a gimmick to introduce the tone and themes of the game in a sudden and shocking but also a bit misleading way compared to the continuation. In fact, after the first few minutes in the underwater amusement park, the structure opens and transforms, proposing a broader and more studied level design in order to exploit the different abilities of the various characters. It then turns out that the goal is to travel the 1200 kilometers that separate us from Tokyo, choosing from time to time the stages of the journey to be made and visiting different settings taken from the real Japanese geography. However, the elements of mystery remain and are reflected in the relationships between the boys, which alternate relaxed phases with others of great tension, with the constant threat of betrayal and selfishness that keep alive the ~game~ which, despite themselves, they are forced to take part to survive. However, the narrative always takes over: the amount of dialogues and cutscenes makes it clear how the intent of the authors is above all to tell a story and this is in fact the backbone of the whole gaming experience. moreover with texts entirely translated into Italian (the voices remain in Japanese). Building the levels, small puzzles and enemies rarely leads todemanding challenges and the use of the various powers is always quite guided, so the gameplay never manages to shine that much. The driving force that drives us forward is therefore to discover the mysteries of the story, making us take in the narrative that mixes elements of a psychological thriller in a sort of coming-of-age story for a young audience. This creates a bizarre mix that can be well appreciated by anime lovers, who can also welcome some clichs and stereotypes typical of this kind of productions.", "date": "2020-09-11", "grade": "7.2"}
