Then take some healthy 8-bit vintage and mix it together with a touch of healthy irony: what will come out is The Escapists, a title that we have already had the opportunity to try in Early Access, now officially out of the development phase and on sale in final release on Steam. For those who hear about it only now, let's briefly recall what it is: designed by Moldy Toof Studios, The Escapists was financed through Kickstarter and then let itself be embraced by Team17, the historic team working on the Amiga that perfectly embodies right in its playground the style and videogame philosophy behind this title. Taking advantage of the definitive release, we have therefore returned to interpreting the masters of evasion, to sum up on The Escapists after having already spoken about it positively in our tried previous one: will it have kept its promises? 8-bit prisons and humor come together in The Escapists: will we be able to find the escape route? Need to escape The first thing that catches the eye in this definitive version of The Escapists is the presence of a tutorial of its own, which we previously felt we needed like bread. The prison-school, separate from all the others, offers us an introduction to the controls and mechanics of the game, however only going to scrape the surface of what is the myriad of possibilities inserted within the game. Its duration, in reality, is not very long: about 5 minutes, after which one feels ready for the adventure only for the period that anticipates entering the ~real~ prison, where, despite the further suggestions given, we find ourselves alone with our need to find a way to escape. It is evident that this introductory phase arrived during Early Access thanks to the feedback of the players, who felt a little lost in the simulated prison life within The Escapists: the game puts us at the center of the perfect monotony of inmates , with days marked by appeals, compulsory meals, recreational and work moments, during which you can also find the time to plan and implement your plan to run away. An undertaking easier said than done, given that as we said The Escapists provides the player with a number of options that without adequate support can end up confusing: working in the laundry, for example, it is possible to steal a uniform of a guard, with which to circulate in closed areas and thus start the escape. However, this stratagem alone is not enough and it is therefore necessary to put in sequence a plan made up of multiple steps, which allow us to reach the final objective. Fortunately, the different difficulty of the 8 available prisons comes to meet us. The various structures are in fact proposed by the game in order of increasing security, so before reaching the 41-bis of the final one you have to go through the one that has more or less the same level of surveillance as an elementary school. The usual grind In addition to the activities imposed by the guards, life in prison naturally brings us into contact with other inmates, with everything that goes with it. Between the bars it is in fact possible to obtain micro-missions from your colleagues in misfortune, in truth not too varied: they range from beating someone up to recovering stolen objects, with variants that add little else. All to earn money to then spend on trade with the prisoners themselves: a self-respecting prison obviously does not do without smuggling, thanks to which the protagonist can buy and sell what he needs. You can find them of all colors, starting from the seemingly harmless ones, to be used in the crafting system to create tools to be used to escape or to generate weapons of all kinds. There are also fights between the prisoners, which often end up involving the guards as well. As already mentioned, the activities to be carried out can make us fall into a sense of bewilderment, fueled by the inadequacy of the tutorial. Living prison life without making the guards suspicious is not a simple thing already on its own, but if you then want to set up an escape plan, things end up getting irreparably complicated. The preparation is therefore made of observation and planning, through what can also be several days to spend in the routine of confinement before trying to take off. But woe to getting caught, both while running away and when getting ready by collecting objects or digging tunnels: to sDepending on the seriousness of the fact, the guards will seize everything in our possession - including money - even putting us in solitary confinement to make us reflect on our misdeeds. Vintage is beautiful From a graphic point of view, the style of The Escapists looks like a feast for the eyes, especially for those of the many nostalgics who take advantage of every good opportunity to relive the golden age of 8-bit. The design of the characters and some objects is particularly satisfying, while a little more could perhaps have been done for the structure of the prison. From the old school, the game also incorporates ironic elements, expressed together with some quotes from films and television series that are easy to recognize. The developers' idea of offering players the possibility of changing the names of those who live with us in the prison is also amusing, thus being able to insert those of friends, relatives and anyone else you want. The vintage model of the visual aspect of the game is also accompanied by the audio sector, made up of some sound effects that we could have easily heard in a game twenty-odd years ago. The soundtrack is also in the same style, quite catchy but perhaps a little too used even in phases where there could be healthy silence. In terms of multiplayer we do not find particular features, since The Escapists is basically a single player game. However, there are leaderboards for the various prisons, thanks to which you can compare yourself with the performance of the other players in their escapes.
