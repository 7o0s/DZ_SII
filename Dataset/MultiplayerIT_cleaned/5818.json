Usually these games exploited an external view or a point of view of the hero of the moment. Great classics such as Dungeon Master, Eye of the Beholder and Double Dungeon are based on this second choice and, although they remain great classics, we do not believe we are committing a crime of treason if we declare that the first person is perhaps not the most pleasant way to move within narrow labyrinths. This hasn't prevented it from becoming a much-loved sub-genre by lovers of role-playing games who continue to appreciate them, despite the fact that the world of video games has moved on to different and slightly less cumbersome experiences. However, the success and affection shown for games like Legends of Grimrock demonstrate that there is still ample room for those who want to update their graphics and ideas with a touch of nostalgia, and that is exactly what Mana Games have done with The Fall of the Dungeon Guardians. Are you looking for an old fashioned RPG? Introducing The Fall of the Dungeon Guardians! Never alone in the dark After the introduction we find ourselves many meters underground in a prison that was just then the subject of an elaborate escape plan. Our aim will be to lead a team of four heroes in search of 15 particularly dangerous prisoners. Given the extremely classic setting of the game, the party is made up of four components that we can assemble as we please. There are tanks, healers, rogues, warlocks, mages, archers, and so on. If that's not enough for us, we can also create new ones at will, the important thing will be to bring together a well-balanced group because otherwise we'll last very little down there. Fortunately, the game has seven difficulty levels, ranging from ~you can safely walk around picking flowers~ to ~we doubt you can make it out alive even if you developed this game~, so anyone will be able to find a suitable challenge for their skill. However, our impression is that, even at medium-low levels, the game tends to become very unbalanced and almost inaccessible over time: some fights are simply too difficult for the level of our characters and ~grinding~ is not very easy since the simpler enemies don't respawn, or so it seemed to us. Despite the polygonal graphics, The Fall of the Dungeon Guardians is played just like an old 3D RPG, so to move you have to follow a strict grid, one step at a time, only making 90 rotations. Fortunately we can at least use the mouse to look around, select targets and attack. Orc barrel The combat is real-time, fast and brutal, but requires some experience to fully appreciate it. The four characters will attack automatically, unless you want to keep a member on the sidelines, while we will have to manage the two skills they have available. By pressing the space bar the game will pause and we will be able to decide their sequence of use, bearing in mind that there is a cooldown of the skill and the general one, which prevents ~spamming~ too many spells in a very short time. Thanks to this system, the clashes will be imbued with tactics, even if the impression is that at the highest levels some clashes are simply impossible. Since it is not possible to choose the position of the various party members, enemies will base their attacks on aggro, so they will focus on the character who does the most damage or who has been able to attract their attention with specific skills for tanks. The problem with this system is that over time it tends to become very rigid: once you find the right balance, it is simply a matter of pausing, pressing the right skills and then repeating everything until the monster dies. However, at the highest levels it will be very important to know how to manage our four heroes to prevent larger creatures from taking it out on particularly fragile wizards or thieves; in short, the usual story. Obviously there is also the loot, completely random, which can immediately provide us with excellent weapons with which to level up quickly or make us sweat that shield that you really need to increase the survival of the ~tank~. The development of the characters is traditional and well set up like the rest of the game: there are quite a few specializations that allow us to make our group of adventurers unique and which will have to be chosen based on our style of play. Again, as in the seletion of the party, one wrong choice could prove more harmful over time than a room full of traps and skeletons. Walls, walls and more walls Being an independent title set in a dungeon, The Fall of the Dungeon Guardians doesn't offer many panoramas with which to refresh the eyes. This doesn't mean that it's a visually bad game, but let's say it's average in its category, without particularly shining for its beauty. Even the enemies are not very many, given that we will be dealing with skeletons of various types, giant rats and little more; only the fifteen wanted ones will offer a touch of novelty. Fortunately, there is a very special system of maps for orientation. In each level there is a ~basic~ map that allows us to understand which rooms we have already visited, and a ~special~ one that contains all the secrets scattered around the rooms and corridors. Obviously the second is much more difficult to achieve. The only real flaw of this title is that in the long run the banality of the environments could tire, on the other hand we are talking about a title that can easily occupy about 30 hours of your time, however it is also true that fans of the genre know very well what they meet. Dungeon crawlers are so called because they explore closed and narrow environments, they are not made for those who want to take a walk in a field of flowers. The interface isn't exactly the best either. The keys are all very small and in the heat of the moment it can happen that you miss a few clicks. To pick up objects you have to approach them, look at them, drag them into a bag and then rearrange the view and there is no key to turn 180 degrees. These are trifles that do not affect the overall solidity of the game, but which can be annoying in the long run.", "date": "2015-12-18", "grade": "7.5"}
