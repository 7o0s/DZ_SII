For those unfamiliar with it, it is a series of third-person adventures characterized by amusing plots and, from a gameplay point of view, by a good mix of platform and shooter elements, where the funniest and most peculiar feature generally lies in the use of the multiple gadgets and the many weapons available to the two protagonists. Born in 2002 on PlayStation 2 thanks to the work of Insomniac Games, it has seen the light on all the subsequent consoles of the Japanese company, reaching important goals not only in terms of sales, with over fifty million copies placed worldwide between the main series , spin-offs and so on, but also in other entertainment sectors. The brand, in fact, has been able to generate a whole series of side productions, such as comics, manga, action figures, an online mini-series entitled The Adventures of Captain Starshield and an animated film that will arrive next year probably at the same time or almost with a game for PlayStation 4. In the meantime, the series shows up on PlayStation Vita, with the re-proposition - exactly two years after its release on PlayStation 3 - of a collection containing the first three titles of the main series, or Ratchet & Clank (2002), Ratchet & Clank: Fire at Will (2003) and Ratchet & Clank 3 (2004), thanks to Mass Media Inc. Even if, we say it immediately, with not exactly satisfactory results, given that the production suffers from many gaps that penalize the final evaluation. But let's proceed in order. Ratchet & Clank land on PlayStation Vita with a compilation of their first three adventures Three times Ratchet & Clank Let's start by saying that in general the three titles are re-proposed without exclusive features or other particular characteristics compared to the home counterpart. With the obvious exception of the control scheme which, due to the lack of the R2 and L2 keys on PlayStation Vita, led the developers to assign the functions relating to the first person view and the possibility of crouching to the two backbones of the console, while lateral movement , where foreseen (the lateral strafe is absent in the first Ratchet & Clank), has been assigned to the rear touch pad, which must be pressed on the upper right half for the purpose. Which objectively is particularly annoying in the most agitated situations, when perhaps at the same time you have to shoot, jump or move to avoid being hit. In any case this is in some ways a ~problem~ which may also depend on the user's degree of adaptability to the commands, and is in any case secondary to those which in our opinion are more unpleasant to digest, especially in the progenitor. Once you select the game from a decidedly poor main menu that gives the feeling of having been pushed there almost only because necessary, you immediately get the feeling that something is not right. In fact, the Ratchet & Clank interface immediately appears not optimized for the small screen size of the Sony portable console, and after a few moments we realize that even the playability is tormented by an annoying input lag which actually makes it difficult to act in several points of the adventure, especially in those situations where perhaps a certain precision is required in making a jump or some rapid movement. In fact, the character does not respond immediately to the commands given to him, and this, as mentioned, is detrimental to the correct usability of the game. With regard to the positive aspects, however, the title still maintains its classic adventurous platform style, with an entertaining plot and gameplay that involves interacting with the environment, collecting objects and engaging in sessions made up of jumps, puzzle solving, clashes with enemies, end-of-level bosses, and hoverboard racing. All components capable of giving an extra pinch of variety to the linearity of the game, which tells of Ratchet, a mechanic of the Lombax race from the planet Veldin, and his friend Clank, a robot with whom he will try to stop the fearsome Drek. The situation definitely improves in the second episode of the collection, which already in the original on PlayStation 2 expanded the mechanics of the predecessor by introducing some substantial innovations in terms of gameplay, such as RPG elements that improved the gaming experience. It is in fact precisely in Ratchet & Clank 2: Fire at will that a basic form of weapon enhancement was implemented which provided for each one a different type of development linked to the upgrades that can be purchased in the S shoplim Cognito and nanomites, a key item to be acquired by defeating enemies. Which gave the gamer one more reason to eliminate all types of opponents and thus accumulate experience, and improve the equipment supplied. Without forgetting the armor and the very useful gadgets, indispensable among other things to solve environmental puzzles, but also to access new areas or for other functions, such as moving objects marked with particular symbols, or ~hypnotizing~ certain robots to then take control. In practical terms, the response to the commands is good, and there are no noticeable delays in the execution of the same as happens in the first episode. All in a scenario that takes our heroes around the galaxy in search, on behalf of Megacorp, of the Protopet, an apparently harmless animal created in the laboratory, but in reality an extremely dangerous weapon. Hasty conversion? The third and final episode contained in the collection is decidedly more focused on action and shootings than the platform component. With Ratchet & Clank 3 the feeling of being in a third-person shooter is really strong, and the level design is more geared towards encouraging confrontation than anything else, with Ratchet sometimes facing hordes of enemies with different objectives in some missions. However, the exploratory phases do not have a marginal role compared to the rest, as it might seem, and the game attaches a lot of importance to backtracking, partly because it is very useful for purely economic purposes, as each completed mission brings the user money from spend on weapons and armor, you want because in this way you can take advantage of the recovered gadgets necessary to reach previously inaccessible areas. It should be noted that even in Ratchet & Clank 3 we did not encounter the command lag problems of the first chapter, and that multiplayer is missing compared to the home counterpart. Although the contents are almost identical to those of the PlayStation 3, the PlayStation Vita port of Ratchet & Clank Trilogy suffers from many gaps which, as mentioned at the beginning of the article, penalize the final evaluation. Apart from those mentioned in the previous paragraph, the rest of the problems are mostly of a technical nature. In this sense, let's start by saying that from an aesthetic point of view, all three titles partially disappoint, some more, some less, expectations, especially making a comparison with the PlayStation 3 edition. It's true, some could argue that the comparison between the two versions shouldn't even be made considering the differences in hardware, but here the problem seems to be more of a design nature than raw performance. The graphics, for example, remain fairly anchored to the fixed 30 frames per second (against the 60 frames per second of PlayStation 3) and are at first pleasant from a chromatic point of view, given that it has a very bright color palette, and nice light effects, especially in the second and third chapters of Ratchet & Clank. But, on the other hand, it is quite disappointing otherwise, with the heavy absence of the anti-aliasing filter which causes every element on the screen to be surrounded by annoying jagged edges. And it doesn't matter that on the small screen of PlayStation Vita, thanks also to the cartoonish style of the games, sometimes they are not markedly noticeable: they are there and that is enough to criticize their presence, especially if it serves to highlight the poor product optimization work. To what has just been described are added some decidedly poorly defined and in some cases even grainy textures, especially in the progenitor of the series which is certainly the one that most of all feels the weight of age, and some ugly interlude sequences to look at due to both of their size, 4:3 complete with black side bars, and of the poor video resolution, with evident artifacts of the compression algorithm to spoil the vision. The sound part does not go better, where unexplained bugs are reported, such as the disappearance of music while playing or audio fragments that seem to ~jump~ or loop at some moments. In short, we think that all this does not depend only on the hardware available to the developers, but also on a job perhaps done in a hurry, without excessive care in adapting the product to the characteristics of the PlayStation Vita in the best possible way. And this is a real pity because even if the games are still usable, the bitter observation remains that to play them one would have to pretend nothing happened and overlook a series of defects which, if instead they had been eliminated at the origin, would have allowed everyone fans of the adventurous platform genre to fully enjoyand uncompromising three great titles on their favorite portable platform.", "date": "2014-07-10", "grade": "6.0"}
