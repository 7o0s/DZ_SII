{"name": "The Council: Complete Edition", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-council-complete-edition-recensione.html", "text": "Eight months after the release of the first episode, the story of The Council has finally reached its conclusion. Coinciding with the arrival of the fifth chapter, the graphic adventure created by the French team Big Bad Wolf can now be purchased in the complete edition. By doing so, it is therefore possible to immediately access all the five episodes that make up the work, both on PC and on PS4 and Xbox One. As generally happens when we talk about a classic genre such as graphic adventures, The Council has also been designed to particularly enhance the use of dialogues and narrative progression: in this sense, the interactions with the key characters of the story and the with them they represent one of the cornerstones of the work. The social relationships entertained by the player are accompanied by the presence of a multitude of investigative activities which involve the observation of situations and the recovery of objects, but also the resolution of some puzzles. Those who have already had the opportunity to consult our review dedicated to the first episode of The Council (The Mad Ones), will also know that the title created by Big Bad Wolf has tried to go further, expanding the scope of interaction through some interesting tricks of side roles, which have served to slightly distort the cards on the table compared to the traditional exponents of the category. Story: Louis De Richet and the mysteries of the Golden Order The events depicted in The Council are filtered from the perspective of Louis de Richet, a young member of a secret society called the Golden Order. As can be guessed from the incipit, the organization has a certain influence in the political and diplomatic circles of the late eighteenth century, but also seems to be enmeshed in some shady intrigues. Looking for answers after his mother disappears into thin air, Louis is invited to the island by a mysterious aristocrat who everyone knows simply as Lord Mortimer. The man soon discovers that he is in good company, since some illustrious personalities of the society of the time dwell on the island, including none other than a young Napoleon Bonaparte, the first president of the United States of America, George Washington, but also Manuel Godoy, Spanish politician with strong diplomatic skills. Around them gravitate a series of other subjects who, in their own way, will have a role in allowing the player to extricate himself from mysterious events, murders to be solved and events that do not seem to be simple coincidences at all. We had previously observed how The Council showed that it possessed potential by virtue of the variables put on the plate: deep dialogues, narrative crossroads, the presence of puzzles and some related to the progression of the character to act as a side dish. The main unknown was linked more than anything else to the need to analyze the evolution of the formula and the quality of the narrative arc as a whole. After having completed the five episodes of which it is composed, we can confirm that the product manages to keep the interest of the user alive, slowing down a bit only in a couple of phases of the story. After a promising start and a second episode characterized by a certain linearity, the events take off definitively in the third and fourth episode, managing to effectively lead the player by the hand up to the epilogue. Unfortunately the real Achilles heel of the production is inherent in its technical realization. Although a graphic adventure doesn't need to offer a first-rate degree of detail, being able to afford to focus on other factors, we can't help but point out the excessive static nature of the characters, always too rigid and not very expressive, even when the events of the story would require an emotional reaction accompanied by a body language consistent with the events experienced on screen. During the game it happens to catch some rather gross uncertainties, such as the lack of synchrony between the dubbing of the voices and the characters' lips, as well as some errors in the correspondence between dialogues and subtitles, but there are also obvious optimization problems regarding the PC edition. In our opinion, even better could have been done in the selection of the musical pieces used in some key moments of the story, which certainly would have given more coherence and decision to some sequences. To the detriment of a technical part on which one must inevitably turn a blind eye, it is worth noting that with the arrival of the Complete Edition the use of the work can now also be done through the subtitles in Italian (previously only those in English were selectable ). Interesting gameplay but some problemstoo much technician As we said earlier, The Council tries to mix the traditional elements of graphic adventures with some variables coming from the RPG side. After the introductory movie, it is possible to select one of the three classes with which it is possible to define the characteristics and talents of Louis. By choosing to enhance diplomatic skills, one can enjoy some advantages in the ability to direct the flow of dialogues, unlocking opportunities that are made possible by one's eloquence. Conversely, by opting for the Detective skill you get some advantages during investigation activities and in the collection of clues. Alternatively, it is possible to lean towards the Occultist branch, which gives access to the practice of the dark sciences and arts. Depending on your preference will also vary the skill tree that you can use the player while carrying out the investigation activities on the island. By investing the Effort Points, you guarantee access to a series of answers and opportunities that vary precisely in relation to the way in which you have decided to evolve your character, with obvious influences on the comparisons made possible from time to time with the others guests of the estate. The number of individuals Louis has to deal with in the course of his investigation varies and grows progressively; this helps to establish a variety of situations, sometimes diametrically opposed, which helps to keep the interest alive during the progression. Nevertheless, a tendential simplicity emerges from the game: The Council could have put a strain on the player's logical-deductive skills, but in reality it was preferred to adopt a slightly more moderate approach. Beyond some uncertainty, we still appreciated Big Bad Wolf's attempt to keep interest alive, also through the introduction of new gameplay variations that take over in the second part of the game. Factors useful to justify some events that occurred previously and to entice the user to complete the adventure. From this point of view it certainly cannot be asserted that the developers lacked initiative, and in saying this we think above all of the works of the now defunct Telltale, where on the contrary the interaction remained unchanged from the beginning to the end of the story.", "date": "2018-12-04", "grade": "7.5"}
