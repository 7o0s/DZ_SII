Specifying it is not useless, because only in this way can you understand the competence and deep love for the genre of fighting games that oozes from every pixel of this little-known independent title. Faced with giants like Street Fighter IV, the various VS. and others, who would bet anything on such a product? Yet starting it we had to change our mind. The first games were traumatic, with the opponents (the roster of selectable characters is completely female) who beat us as if we were absolute novices. Persevering and taking more beatings we realized the mystery, namely that we are facing one of the more technical 2D fighting games seen recently (actually the Japanese version, downloadable for free from the developer's website, has been around for a few years already ), with so many and such combat variables that it dwarfs many of its competitors. Each of the selectable warriors has special techniques and particular abilities. All are well characterized, even if there is no lack of love for the long thigh, for the underpants in sight and for the unlikely clothes typical of Japanese friends (and not only). In all honesty, the style chosen to present the contents clashes quite a bit with the rest of the game. The warrior girls are mostly dressed as brothels, a choice that clashes strongly with the technicalities of the gameplay (which we will talk about in a bit). In short, many could snub Vanguard Princess for the underlying voyeurism of which it is full, missing out on an excellent title, while others could buy it precisely for this aspect, finding something unmanageable on their hands. Limits But let's get into it. The beginning does not give much hope. Many options are missing and in general there is a certain air of austerity. There are also only two selectable modes: the single-player campaign, which can be tackled at three difficulty levels, and the one-on-one mode, to play against a friend (in this case we recommend at least one joypad to be placed alongside the keyboard). If desired, it is also possible to play online, but it is not an immediate operation, since an external client must be used which must first be set up. Nothing too complicated but the average user might be put off. In short, from the point of view of the options there are some obvious limits that betray a production that is certainly not very rich, also made evident by the fact that some settings can only be modified from the .ini file. Even from a graphic point of view, despite the beauty of the drawings and special effects, there are some sharp edges in the color palette and glitches are not lacking. Sure, we're talking very honest 2D, with very good animations, especially those of the super moves, but don't expect anything exceptional that will make your jaw drop. A true warrior Vanguard Princess is at its best in gameplay. The depth of the game mechanics, which becomes evident after a few games, makes every encounter, especially at the two highest difficulty levels, an exhilarating competition against a system that does not let an error pass and offers no escape. You find yourself thinking about the moves at the speed of light, using the reflect technique (in other more famous games it is known as parry), the support fighters (who are called up with a key and who become essential in the hottest fights) and learning that the damages done and suffered vary according to various factors, which one learns to exploit in a reasonable time, but which can take a long time to be mastered. After learning to play well, i.e. by finishing the campaign at the highest level of challenge, one begins to feel the need to play online, to confront other human opponents and to experience what has been learned against a more plastic intelligence. However, even playing alone is not bad at all, and beating the final boss on the maximum difficulty level is no small feat, since it requires great timing and perfect mastery of your character. In short, from this point of view, one could not really ask for more from Vanguard Princess, which remains a title sold at an extremely cheap price. We just have to close with a wish: we hope to see other small pearls like this imported into the West. There are many Japanese indie titles waiting to be discovered by us as well.", "date": "2013-02-22", "grade": "7.8"}
