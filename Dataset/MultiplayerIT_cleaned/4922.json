It is a contradiction mainly due to its age: in our latest Monographs we told you how the series started in 1987, which means that Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap (at the time Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap, but also Monster World II in Japan) specifically is twenty-seven years old, having been released in 1989. The confusing diffusion and nomenclature of the various episodes - called a bit Wonder Boy and a bit Monster World, as well as ~cloned~ in Hudson Soft's Adventure Island franchise - also helped make Westone's series even more elusive, especially as the best releases only saw the light of day in Japan on SEGA's 8-bit and 16-bit consoles. Yet Wonder Boy III represents one of the pillars in the birth and evolution of the adventures / platformers that today we affectionately call ~metroidvania~. The small developer Lizardcube has therefore decided to take over the original code and offer modern generations a taste of what it meant to play in the 80s: an operation that was one hundred percent successful, for better or for worse. We explain why in our review. Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap is a fantastic remake but way too short for what it costs Back to the Future It is simply pointless to analyze Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap through a comparison with the Master System original, since the Lizardcube remake essentially maps the original code 1:1: in fact, just press the right shoulder key at any time to change graphics and go from gorgeous modern illustrations and animations to that eyesore we get today's sprites and colors of the SEGA 8-bit console. Ironic, given that Wonder Boy III was a technically lavish game at the time. The solution adopted by Lizardcube is refined and elegant. Furthermore, by pressing the right analog stick, it is also possible to replace the modern audio compartment with the original one and therefore the cards can be shuffled, playing for example with the ancient soundtrack and modern graphics or vice versa. Realistically, there's no reason to recommend the old cosmetics, as the new one mirrors every frame perfectly, but enriches it with ultra-smooth animations, gorgeous details and pastel colors that make each location look like a Skottie Young comic. Even the structure of the game perfectly replicates the original one, except for one tiny addition: before starting the game, you can choose whether to play Wonder Boy... or Wonder Girl, his female counterpart. From a gameplay point of view, absolutely nothing changes. Indeed, once you get to the heart of the game, the choice loses all meaning. Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap, in fact, begins when the original prequel Wonder Boy in Monster Land ended: our hero - or our heroine - faces the Meka Dragon in his castle, but is cursed upon his defeat and transformed into an anthropomorphic lizard . The only way to become human again is to find a powerful relic, but forget the plot or dialogues: Wonder Boy is a full-fledged 1989 title, in which you have to play instead of read. There are a few lines at the beginning and at the end to explain what happened, the rest is left to our imagination and interpretation. In this case, once transformed into a lizard and returned to the village of Alsedo, one immediately begins to explore the surroundings, taking advantage of a world that is anything but linear and which extends in every direction. Multiple personalities In lizard form, the protagonist of Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap can breathe fire and crouch. These are sufficient skills to overcome the desert to reach the first boss, the Mummy Dragon in the pyramid: once the monster is defeated, we will be cursed again and transformed into a mouse capable of walking on walls and ceilings. The adventure continues in this sense: each new form allows you to explore previously inaccessible areas, open chests in places where we could not enter and face new enemies. Each boss - there are five of them, in addition to the initial Meka Dragon - gives the hero or heroine a new form: in addition to the lizard and the mouse, we will become piranhas capable of swimming underwater, lions capable of inflicting more enemies and hawks that can fly and dodge virtually any encounter. At a certain point in the adventure, we'll also gain the ability to change shape at will, which will be useful for solving the most intricate puzzles and facing the most annoying combinations of enemies. In the transformations of the Wonder Boy, in fact, a shy role-playing nuance is hidden: the frame animations make each animal more or less effective in combat and some weapons and armor gain or lose points of attack or defense depending on the form with which we equip them. They are somewhat superficial role-playing traits which, however, can make a fair difference, mostly because they were not implemented in a very balanced way at the time. To be honest, Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap has very little balanced. It's a vintage game that couldn't be more vintage, designed by game designers whose purpose was not to take players by the hand, but to annoy them in the most subtle ways possible, perhaps by placing enemies who shoot projectiles in very annoying crossed positions. They are the same game sequences which, today as then, once overcome, give immense satisfaction. Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap, in fact, is not an easy game, mostly because the fights require almost perfect timing and execution in the combination of jumps and attacks, especially when controlling shapes, such as that of a mouse or a hawk , less prone to direct confrontation. The bosses themselves attack following extremely basic patterns which, however, can cause quite a few problems if you don't get the right moment to attack. Despite this, Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap is an extremely short game, especially if you have a good memory or take note of suspicious obstacles as you explore each stage. We completed it in just over three hours, although it takes a few more to find each weapon or collectible: despite being a timeless little jewel, we are not sure that the launch price is suitable for its limited longevity.", "date": "2017-04-22", "grade": "8.0"}
