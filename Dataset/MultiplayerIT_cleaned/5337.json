Proposed at the very affordable price of 2.99 on both Steam and iOS, and a few cents more (3.29) on Android, Reigns is an atypical product, however, intended to quickly capture attention, involving the user in the attempt to be able to govern as long as possible, thus making the right choices to keep the founding elements of the kingdom in balance. Reigns is a simple but very addictive game that deserves to be tried Decisions, decisions The mechanics of the product published by Devolver Digital is therefore of absolute simplicity: in practice, everything takes place through cards, or tiles, if you prefer, which are proposed on the screen. Most of them depict a character who carries news, an event or a fact for which it is necessary to provide an answer - choosing between the two available - via a swipe left or right, just like you do with the famous app of meetings above. For example, the Court Doctor may perhaps propose to carry out experiments, the Army General may report an attack in progress, the Diplomat may suggest a marriage of convenience, the Archbishop may request the construction of a new cathedral, or the own dog can ask to play and so on. It is therefore up to the user to give an answer in each of these situations, with the awareness that this will then determine a variation in the four indicators placed at the top of the screen which signal the situation of the pillars of the kingdom: Church, People, Army and Money. The task is to be able to maintain for as long as possible a balance such as never to bring these indicators either to empty completely or to fill up completely: the loss of power of the army would inevitably lead to the invasion by a neighboring people , but even the opposite excess would be fatal due to the organization of a military coup. And again: not having economic resources, so to speak, would inevitably lead the kingdom to ruin, but also having overflowing coffers would create different conditions for the same end, i.e. the death of the sovereign. And in Reings, kings die often, and quickly. One after another, the new kings then enter a timeline that signals their duration on the throne: the goal is therefore basically to try to make this period last as long as possible, skilfully juggling between decisions and orders and predicting their repercussions. However, that's not all: there are also objectives to be achieved, always linked to choices to be made at certain times, through which new characters and cards are unlocked which are intended to flesh out the deck and consequently to guarantee greater variety and unprecedented situations during the game next one. The beauty of Reigns is that the answers are not always trivial, and indeed require making often complex decisions capable of having effects that are not easy to predict. Furthermore, the need to manage the four indicators often obliges to go in the opposite direction to one's morals or to what one would think is more right to do. The writing of the texts then, which unfortunately for the moment does not count the Italian translation, is brilliant and permeated by a very tasty black humor. The result is a fascinating experience, which is also enriched by excursus that translate into the exploration of a dungeon or some cold-weapon fights, both of which must always be managed through the swipe system. Even the graphic component, while simply functional, can be appreciated for a really spot-on stylized and ~flat~ aspect, especially as regards the design of the characters. In all of this, the most critical element of Reigns is undoubtedly to be found in the inevitable repetitiveness of the gameplay and above all of the situations that arise in front of the player, destined to manifest itself rather quickly, all the more so by facing numerous games one after the other.", "date": "2016-08-25", "grade": "8.0"}
