The version tested is the one for Xbox 360. Few would have bet on the success of Puzzle Quest. Yet the title produced by D3 and appeared on DS and PSP a few months ago managed to hit the target, offering an interesting amalgam between Rpg and Puzzle game capable of really keeping you glued to the screen for hours and hours. Building on the good feedback obtained, the developer Infinite Interactive therefore decided to expand the ~territory~ beyond the confines of portable consoles, thus reaching Xbox 360 via the Xbox Live Arcade service. The cost? 1200 points. Let's find out if it's worth it or not... Do I buy it or not? If those who have never dealt with Puzzle Quest should proceed with the purchase without thinking too much about it, perhaps those who have already played the laptop versions thoroughly may have some doubts. In reality, the programmers wanted to include a good series of innovations, even of considerable weight, to the point of putting even this last category of users into strong temptation. First of all, the greater trust and the feedback obtained has finally allowed us to offer a complete translation into Italian, the lack of which has weighed heavily on the penetration of the game in our country in the DS and PSP versions. Secondly, the graphics, while remaining the same, have obtained a significant benefit from the increase in resolution, thus offering greater clarity from every point of view. We are therefore always talking about a totally 2D product which, although well designed, certainly won't make your jaw drop open, limiting itself to doing its job in a convincing manner. The interface has also been improved, making matches more fluid and information more easily accessible, and some balancing fixes have been made in general. The most interesting aspect, however, is undoubtedly the online multiplayer, which despite offering nothing more than single challenges with other users, allows you to use your own character developed in the adventure, therefore with related spells and equipment. Xbox 360 - Goals Puzzle Quest will not drive you crazy to get the points of the objectives with challenges to the human limit. On the contrary, it will be sufficient to continue the adventure, overcoming key stages such as reaching level 50 (25 points), capturing a steed (10) or defeating the most important enemies. Comment Puzzle Quest is one of the best games available on Xbox Live Arcade, if not the best in some ways. At the cost of 1200 points it is in fact possible to download an engaging and intriguing puzzle game like we haven't seen in a long time, based on a simple mechanic but strengthened by a side dish of great depth capable of guaranteeing many hours of fun. Recommended without reservations therefore, unless you manifest a total aversion to this kind of games. In that case, worse for you... Pros One of the best games on XBLA Engaging and stimulating like few others Finally in Italian Cons Good but not excellent multiplayer If you hate puzzles it's not for you Graphically little better than PSP Knight help me in the puzzle For those who have not had the opportunity to play the previous versions of the game, it is enough to know that Puzzle Quest analyzed in its individual components is not a particularly original product. But as the Americans say, the overall result is really more than the sum of its parts, and it only takes a few minutes of playing to realize this. Basically, the Rpg component immediately manifests itself with the need to create one's own alter-ego among the classic series of classes available within the fantasy genre that acts as a theme (druid, knight, warrior and magician), each with different characteristics and affinities. Movements take place through a map in which castles, villages, forests, enemy camps and so on are present and are gradually discovered. By moving your hero over one of these locations, a series of missions become available, which, despite the various nature of the objectives, always require you to face one or more fights. But - and here comes the fun part - the aforementioned fights do not take place through the classic dictates of Rpg, but through challenges to a puzzle game that we could define as a sort of Bejeweled to the nth degree. In fact, spheres of various colors, skulls, coins and purple stars are represented within a square grid. Both contenders act on the same grid, one turn each, with the aim of bringing 3 or more elements of the same type closer to make them explode and gain their effects. And so the colored spheres carry the ~ingredients~ to perform the spells, the purple experience stars, the money coins, while theskulls practically represent the blow inflicted on the opponent, since they go to affect his energy reserve. If it is enough to make combinations of 3 to see them explode, it becomes crucial to be able to perform those of 4 or more elements, since in this case you get an extra turn which is often of fundamental importance. The combination of simplicity of the concept - basically it is the formula used in a thousand other puzzle games - and the depth of everything that revolves around it therefore represents the main strength of Puzzle Quest, capable of providing an enormous stimulus to the player so as to activate the sneaky ~one more game and then I'll stop~ mechanism. But the D3 production is by no means all here; the experience gained in the fights allows you to increase your character's stats, with reflections in a large number of elements. With money it is instead possible to buy objects, weapons and shields with which to equip yourself and able to provide particular effects during the challenges. But that is not all; there are runes to use, citadels to build, steeds to harness, and so much more. The effort of Infinite Iinteractive manages to add new components for a long time, then keeping the player's interest constant with a sensationally well-studied formula.", "date": "2007-11-02", "grade": null}
