{"name": "Black Shark", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/black-shark.html", "text": "The first title that came to mind once we started the first game with Black Shark could only be Tiger Eli, a great classic from the NES era that saw us engaged with a combat helicopter against an enemy army. Things have not changed, the Herocraft game in fact puts us on board the KA-50 a war helicopter, amicably renamed Black Shark, which is one of the best and most modern ~seek and destroy~ aircraft in the world to destroy the terrorist organization named the ~Sons of Danava~. In this two-dimensional shooter we will guide the Black Shark through 10 articulated levels with the aim of destroying all the enemy units that we will meet on our way. We will find ourselves facing anti-aircraft positions, infantry troops armed with rocket launchers, heavy vehicles, tanks and even nuclear missiles. During the flights we will rely on the arsenal supplied with the helicopter, we will be able to expand this equipment at the end of each mission, spending the credits earned by destroying enemy structures, so we will be able to go from a simple machine gun with a few bombs, up to a mega nuclear weapon . We will be able to move the helicopter in all directions with the usual directional cross that is created in the center of the numeric keypad of our phone, also making it stop in mid-air to better aim against the positions of the terrorist group and with the key 9 we will be able to drop the bombs. The variety offered by the mix of enemies encountered, weapons and levels to face offer the right amount of novelty for an immediate and engaging title, whose only major flaw is the length, given that the 10 worlds can be completed in no time. Technically the Herocraft game is very good, the sprites are colorful and well defined and the game engine doesn't suffer even in the most intricate situations. The rival units are treated in the smallest details, closely recalling the graphic style already seen in Metal Slug.
