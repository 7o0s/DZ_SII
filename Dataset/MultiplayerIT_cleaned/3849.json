The only way to refer to this area is then to take it as inspiration to propose something that has practically nothing to do with a real climb, just like it happens in Hang Line: Mountain Climber, which we explore in this review. The protagonist is a sort of mountain rescue worker, who finds himself involved in rescue operations at high altitudes, from time to time unloaded directly from a helicopter on various rock faces in search of survivors lost in the snow, missing objects and more. depending on the objectives set by the mission. The way in which climbing is approached is somewhat bizarre: the main character is not exactly a climber, but he is able to use an enormously extendable grappling hook, which can hook onto snow, ice and other specific types of surfaces but unfortunately not to bare rock. By throwing and hooking up the grappling hook, the protagonist is thus able to move in sudden changes between the rocky walls, swinging according to the dynamics imparted by the simulation of applied physics, therefore continuing to carry out a pendulum movement except possibly hitting rock spikes or other obstacles. Imagine a sort of Spider-Man with his classic swing movement among the cobwebs, only that in this case we are dealing with a rope, a grappling hook and possibly some solid handhold on which to leverage to further push and reach new points of the mountain. Extreme climbing Each level usually sets us three objectives to complete, which can include rescuing a certain number of people trapped on rocks, collecting bonuses or recovering objects. These objectives must be sought during the climb, with the ultimate goal being the achievement of the summit. The basic mechanics, as well as the dynamics of movement with the grappling hook, always remain the same, but moving from one mountain to another introduces some important variations in the composition of the scenarios: this is not so much as regards the aesthetic differences between the various levels (actually quite minimal) but rather in the elements of the gameplay, given that progressing in the game we find ourselves dealing with new obstacles and variations such as collapsing snow, crumbly rocks, avalanches and anything else that obviously complicate us significantly the climb to the summit. To launch the grappling hook it is sufficient to touch the point of the screen where you want to hook it but it must be considered that only some surfaces can be used for this purpose and usually they are the layers of snow. In the event that the target is missed, the protagonist falls into the void towards the inevitable ~game over~ and this can often happen once the first rather simple levels have been overcome. The snow that collapses and forces us to move quickly to another hold, preventing us from going back, the fragments of rock that fall on us or block the passages, there are many variables to take into consideration in our continuous oscillation on the void. At the beginning of the levels we can choose objects to equip that can substantially simplify our lives, such as the compass to detect survivors or the protection shield against the collapse of rocks, but obviously the micro-transactions are grafted onto these elements. Hang Line: Mountain Climber is a free-to-play that runs quite smoothly in its early stages, but the action is simplified so much with the support of objects to make them elements capable of significantly changing the overall balance. The developers have loaded up on this by making them quite valuable to use with in-game currency, which can prompt in-app purchases for limited-time use of the various gadgets.", "date": "2019-01-24", "grade": "7.0"}
