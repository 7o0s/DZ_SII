{"name": "Battlefield 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/battlefield-2-recensione.html", "text": "Good news on the Western Front The first novelties of Battlefield 2 are the coalitions in struggle and the scenario: having left Vietnam forever, we find ourselves in fact in the immediate future between the Persian Gulf and China, with the possibility of controlling the Middle Eastern coalition (CMO), the Chinese one (l 'high-sounding ~People's Liberation Army~) or the ubiquitous US contingent USMC (could they be missing where there is a war?). Naturally each coalition differs from the others from the point of view of the armaments and means available. At the beginning of the game the player must choose between the classes (or specializations) that each soldier can have. They have risen to seven: special forces, stormtroopers, shooters, doctors, engineers, support and anti-tank, each of which is well defined and not customizable as it happened in Battlefield Vietnam. The implementation of a real-time limitation of the map size based on the number of players present is positive, a feature that significantly helps from the point of view of lag and performance. Good news on the Western Front The main game mode is the one already seen in the past, namely ~Conquest~, divided into three variants: Assault, Double Assault and Direct. The rules have remained the same: each of the factions must either deplete the resources of the others (called ~tickets~) or conquer the entire territory of the map by occupying the outposts and replacing all the enemy flags with their own (an operation which takes several seconds and can leave at the mercy of sudden attacks). Each coalition can be 8, 16 or 32 players depending on the map settings, for up to 64 total players on one server. The implementation of a real-time limitation of the map size based on the number of players present is positive, a feature that significantly helps from the point of view of lag and performance. Strategy is the salt of war However, the innovations that mark the real evolution of the series are all in terms of team management, strategy and communication. In Battlefield 2, in addition to being able to play alone, posing as a ~lone wolf~, there is the much more interesting possibility of organizing oneself in teams, or groups of players, from a minimum of 2 up to a maximum of 6, which in practice carry out coordinated actions by moving together, organizing attacks, covering each other's backs and whatever else is required of a real military squadron. Each team has a leader, who naturally has to direct the team by organizing attacks, movements and so on. An even greater innovation is that of the commander, a real coalition strategist who, instead of jumping into the fray, remains behind the scenes to organize and direct operations, adding no small amount of depth to the gameplay. Strategy is the salt of war A great advantage of being part of a team is to have the respawn close to the team leader, so that after death you find yourself immediately resurrected in the heart of the action without having to waste time reaching the area affected by the clashes, sometimes quite far away ( given the vastness of the maps). An even greater innovation is that of the commander, a real coalition strategist who, instead of jumping into the fray, remains behind the scenes to organize and direct operations, adding no small amount of depth to the gameplay. The commander is elected at the beginning of the game through a democratic vote among the players, and has a particular user interface called UAC available, in this case a satellite view of the map through which he can manage the troops, use the artillery, parachute medkits and kits of repairing vehicles to the points where they are needed and several other rather interesting things. VoIP, on the other hand, is a voice communication tool integrated into the game, which works more or less like the well-known TeamSpeak or Roger Wilco. By activating it, you will be able to communicate vocally with the members of your coalition (including the commander in case you are team leader) without having to install external software. Of course, there is also the single-player mode, which allows you to play the maps offline with Bots (diminutive of robots, i.e. both characters used by computer artificial intelligence), but it is to be understood as a simple test or training ground in anticipation of online matches. Although in BF2 we can detect a slightly improved artificial intelligence compared to the prequels, in fact, it has not yet evolved properly and often makes the experience frustrating even if set to the highest levels. All on the front lineBut let's go test this BF2 ~on the road~: let's jump into the action. If we were to briefly explain the nature of Battlefield 2 to a player accustomed to more classic FPS such as Counter-Strike and the like, it would be appropriate to start by describing the freedom of action, the strategic variety and the multitude of different situations that can be encountered in a game . Battlefield 2 has huge maps, where you can use a large number of land, air and sea vehicles, where you can approach a battle in a thousand different ways. As in the prequels, the gameplay is a good compromise between realism and immediacy: if weapons, vehicles and scenarios have been reproduced with care worthy of a real simulator, the simulation ambitions of the real action are rather limited, allowing 'satisfying experience right away, not at all frustrating but at the same time fairly deep thanks to the strategic elements inserted. As already mentioned in the preview, Battlefield 2 is certainly not an unbridled arcade (like Serious Sam, so to speak) but a game that compromises to avoid the levels of frustration that can assail the average player in more simulative titles, such as in Operation Flashpoint, where the slightest mistake costs a life; so do not be scandalized if sometimes you need half a machine gun magazine to kill an enemy, or if a doctor manages to resurrect a soldier killed by a cannon shot in the face, or even if you will meet certain death after even minimal contact with a any moving vehicle (hopefully this last thing is fixed with some patches). Battlefield 2 is hardly a wild arcade, but a game that compromises to avoid the levels of frustration that can beset the average player in more simulation titles All on the front line The balancing of the classes and the behavior of the vehicles is ultimately more realistic than in the past: for example we no longer have the omnipotent sniper (although it is still a very valid class) and the physics of the vehicles has significantly improved, not allowing more those circus maneuvers that it was not uncommon to see in BF 1942 and Vietnam, indeed a certain period of apprenticeship is necessary in the case of helicopters or fighters. On the other hand, the speech on the weapons is controversial, which seem to have even less recoil than the previous editions and in some cases are badly balanced. The usable vehicles are numerous and differentiated from coalition to coalition. There is a certain disparity between land and air vehicles compared to marine ones, present in only two variants, so expect to find the fulcrum of the action away from the waves of the sea. On the other hand, the first two types of vehicles are really large, and among them you can find everything: Hummer jeeps, M1A2 Abrams tanks, F15 Strike Eagle jets, Z-8 transport helicopters, Mig 29s, Havoc helicopters and many others. Negative note regarding the cumbersomeness and slowness of the server interface, which occasionally has the courage to crash for whole minutes. The really drastic situation in the retail version of the game was partly fixed with the first two patches, but it's still not a rosy patch (the last one in particular is available in our Files Area together with the playable demo). Graphics and sound From a graphic point of view Battlefield 2 defends itself quite well, and even if analyzing the individual aspects that together form the visual sector of the game we don't find anything extraordinary or particularly striking, the general impact manages to convince even players with a palate finer, especially if you have a high-performance PC that allows you to set all the details to the maximum. BF2 doesn't have, for example, the physics engine of Half-Life 2, and it doesn't have a jaw-dropping level of detail, but it can boast a more than good polygon count in the polygonal models of vehicles and people, and if for the landscape cannot be praised in the same way (it is in fact sometimes a little sparse and not very detailed), however it is undeniable that the environments are highly characteristic and immersive, as well as truly enormous (the ~Alpine~ map is fabulous). The animations of the soldiers are good, as are the light and particle effects, and the sporadic polygonal interpenetrations certainly do not spoil the visual experience. The graphics engine is very scalable, and allows you to run the game even on less powerful machines, but don't forget that all video cards that don't support shaders 1.4 are not compatible with BF2 and therefore cannot run it; we are talking about very popular cards such as Geforce 2, 3 and 4, Radon 92x0 and so on. There are particular tweaks that force BF2 to start on Geforce 4, but with at least ridiculous resultsoils, and this practice is therefore not recommended. To increase performance you can disable VoIP and lower the lighting and shadow effects, while for swap there is little you can do: to eliminate it completely you need to install at least 1.5GB of RAM (not pork rind). ForceWare 77.50 or 77.72 drivers are recommended for NVIDIA users, not the 77.30 included with the game. With my configuration (Barton 2600+, 9800Pro and 1 gig of RAM) the game didn't show particular uncertainties even at the highest resolutions with an average level of detail. Even the sound aspect does not disappoint, with a good range of sound effects for vehicles and weapons that make the experience quite satisfying, resulting in the ideal complement to the graphics sector. Characteristic Middle Eastern music in a modern key in the menus. Final comment Electronic Arts wanted a sequel that maintained the winning formula of the first two Battlefields but significantly improved many aspects regarding gameplay and the strategic-organizational aspect: the result was achieved in full, and Battlefield 2 rises by right to the Olympus of Online FPS, placing itself as a sure point of reference for thousands of old and, we have no doubts, new enthusiasts. A highly recommended title for anyone looking for a bit of online action, and which also in terms of mods (the inevitable modifications that sooner or later will begin to flock, such as the famous Battlefield 1942's Forgotten Hope) seems to have a more than rosy future. Annoying the little optimization of some aspects, which in any case will probably be resolved definitively with future patches. As I always say, in online games one of the most important components is beyond the competence of the software house: the quality of the players we find on the servers. In any online video game it can happen (and unfortunately it happens) that matches are literally ruined by users who, in good or bad faith, misinterpret the spirit of the game, but I assure you one thing: if played with the right people, applying the due dose of strategy and teamwork, BF2 undoubtedly offers an experience that is difficult to replicate in other titles of the genre currently on the market. Pros Immediate and sufficiently deep gameplay Excellent maps Commander system and VoIP Cons Slow and cumbersome server interface Particularly expensive hardware requirements detail Long uploads Wars never end just like exams. But what a bad thing war is, right? And to think, however, that when it comes to video games it becomes one of the most fun and harmless practices that can be done sitting in front of a PC screen, perhaps in the virtual company of many other players connected from all over the world. This is a concept confirmed by the success of the many war-based games that have always populated the videogame world, and among these in particular the First-Person Shooters, real showmen. Speaking of FPS played online, until a few years ago the panorama was clear, unambiguous: Counter-Strike, the famous modification of Half-Life, dominated undisturbed, leaving only the crumbs to the few contenders on the square. For some time now the music has changed, and numerous titles have arrived to share the cake. The new chapter of the successful Battlefield series is among these, and promises to repeat and surpass the success of the prequels: after Battlefield 1942 and Battlefield Vietnam, Electronic Arts and Digital Illusion take to the battlefield again with Battlefield 2, putting some innovations on the table quite interesting. Let's go and see them up close.", "date": "2005-08-11", "grade": null}
