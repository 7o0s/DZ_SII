The game in question is an adventure with narrative elements well rooted in the experience but not preponderant, because its characteristic is the fact that it allows itself to be ~lived~ with the times chosen by the player and in the way in which they want to deal with it. At the center of everything is fishing, but we are far from a simulation: here it is above all a question of telling a story, or rather of experiencing it firsthand, inserting ourselves precisely in that slice of life, cut vertically, which allows us to fully explore a particular condition, making us reflect on the profound meanings of existence, relationships and feelings, between a casting of the line and a hopeful recovery. Put this way it may seem like a heavy and pretentious exercise in style, but the beauty instead of Moonglow Bay is its remarkable lightness and pleasantness, which derives from the immediate gameplay focused on fishing and cooking and also from its aesthetics focused on voxel graphics, which gives a very particular characterization to the characters and marine settings. All this allows us to immerse ourselves without friction in the strange but familiar world represented, despite the fact that the situation staged is anything but simple to manage, given that we still speak of pain and loss as the starting points from which the story of the hero. And this picks up right where it left off: from fishing and from the sea, once again metaphors of life and the role of man in nature, leading the protagonist not only to rebuild himself but the entire country where the history. A story of loss and gradual re-gain Moonglow Bay, an overview of the town The town of Moonglow Bay lives in terror of the sea, which is rather ironic considering that it was born and thrived in the past thanks to fishing and its splendid seascapes, but that idyllic relationship has long since cracked and practically extinguished the soul of the country. Rumors of monsters and curses from the depths have driven the inhabitants to abandon the sea, the fishing industry has completely stopped and the boats have been sitting rusting in the port for years. Beyond the legends, the fears of the inhabitants have a solid foundation, given that the waves have carried away several loved ones, to the point of transforming what was once the beating heart of the town into a sort of curse to be kept away from, ruining in a few years all the social fabric and the wealth of the town. The protagonist (or the protagonist, gender and even sexual orientation can be defined as desired by the player) of the story is among those who have suffered the greatest losses, with the disappearance of her partner at sea, the very one who ardently desired to live in such a relationship tight with the water. After years spent in pain, the sudden visit of the daughter pushes our character to reactivate, at first reluctantly but then starting to appreciate fishing and life in contact with the waves more and more, remembering the positive elements of the sea and what had prompted him together with his beloved to undertake that kind of life. Moonglow Bay recounts this progressive re-appropriation of life itself by the protagonist, who by regaining vivacity and desire to do ends up dragging the other inhabitants of the town into this positive spiral, trying to rebuild it and bring it back to its former glory. All this occurs essentially through fishing, the discovery of new areas and new marine species, and increasingly complex fish-based cuisine. The story of the protagonist advances gradually, but the game soon becomes a choral tale, when the path crosses that of the many other citizens who reveal their pains and gradually reactivate them too, revitalizing the whole country. A gameplay made of mini-games and reflections In Moonglow Bay, fishing is central to the story and gameplay Beyond the narration, the contemplation of the scenarios and the reflection, the gameplay is quite direct and fast, although the mini-games that make up the different possible actions can be. We are basically called to fish and cook fish, central elements from which all the secondary issues branch off, such as taking care of relations with the other inhabitants and bringing the entire town back to life, shaking it from its torpor. The two main action phases are therefore fishing and cooking, both surprisingly addictive, despite being extremely basic as a strture: perhaps precisely because of this basic intuitiveness, the way they fit into the general flow of the gaming experience or simply because they are quite fun, it is easy to find yourself squashing hours even without advancing that much the story. Fishing is the central section of the gameplay but it still takes place with great simplicity: you choose the place where to fish, moving from the initial coast to the open sea when the boat becomes available, you launch in a point that seems promising and you be careful pulling when the float sinks. Each type of hooked prey behaves quite differently and there really are a huge amount of different species to catch, so situations are unpredictable. However, the action is always very simplified and essentially requires us to pull the line on the opposite side to where the fish points, in a competition of resistance that lasts depending on the size and tenacity of the creature. Cooking is the other part of the gameplay in Moonglow Bay Added to this is a certain ~tactical~ preparation in terms of the type of fishing rod and the quality and type of bait to be selected, which also determine the characteristics of the fish we want to target. The latter are then present in huge quantities, with an enormous quantity of different varieties ranging from the realistic ones to the strangest and most monstrous ones, always keeping the desire to discover new species high. The kitchen is even more mechanical and more prone to mini -game: there are a huge amount of dishes to discover that represent some variation in the mechanics, but usually it's about finding the ingredients (fish, basically) and then cleaning, cutting, cooking, frying or whatever, with some minor variations but all focused on the timing and correctness of the gestures to be made with the controller. The dishes thus elaborated can be sold through our business or brought to the various inhabitants according to specific requests, advancing the narrative phases concerning the village in general. The progression in the story is grafted onto these simple actions, which gradually leads to a general evolution of Moonglow Bay and the protagonist towards a new self-awareness and a decidedly brighter vision of the future. However, there are also more properly ~action~ moments: linked to the progress in the story, we can find ourselves faced with different situations with a more rapid pace, such as real boss fights in the middle of the sea that upset the normal rhythm game by imposing different moments such as quick time events or completely different gameplay mechanics, spicing up the action a bit, although sometimes it is not easy to immediately understand what to do. A world in cubes Moonglow Bay, a dialogue with one of the inhabitants of the town Even the ~voxel~ is now widely cleared, especially as an original solution by various indie productions, so the appearance of Moonglow Bay is not surprising that much, but there is a remarkable stylistic coherence throughout the construction of Moonglow Bay and in the maritime landscapes that surround it. The peculiarity of this type of graphics is the attempt to reproduce the typical stylization of 2D in pixels through three-dimensional constructions, which allows you to keep the abstractionism of the old video games somewhat but with new technical solutions such as different zoom levels, rotations of the 'framing and essentially building a three-dimensional world that allows space exploration in every direction. Moonglow Bay takes full advantage of this solution, maintaining the imaginative strangeness of the ~pixelated~ graphics but inserting it in a context where the exploration of even rather open spaces is fundamental. This, combined with the characterization of a typical North American coastal town, with its contrasts between rural features and the sea all placed together in the same portion of space, makes life within Moonglow Bay always very charming and romantic. It must be said that there are some technical imperfections in the game: tested on Xbox Series X, the scrolling of the image is always not very fluid and with occasional slowdowns, even if this does not affect fruition that much, given the slow rhythms of the action. From an audio point of view, however, everything runs smoothly, with a musical accompaniment that perfectly underlines the romantic and rarefied atmospheres of the game, except for reinvigorating itself in the most exciting and intense moments.", "date": "2021-10-29", "grade": "7.4"}
