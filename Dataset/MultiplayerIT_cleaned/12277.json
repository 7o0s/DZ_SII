{"name": "Claire De Lune", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/claire-de-lune-recensione.html", "text": "Despite what the title might lead you to believe, Claire De Lune's review is not about a music game, but about a first-person adventure. Clair (without e) De Lune is in fact the most famous poem by Claude Debussy, master of French symbolism. The Canadian developer Tactic Studio, hitherto known for the free-to-play strategy Immortal Empire (released the beauty of six years ago), plays with the homophony between the French term and the English name to give life to a spiritual heir of Portal and The Talos Principle, two of the greatest exponents of first-person puzzle games, with atmospheres however very distant from those evoked in the third of the four movements of the Bergamasque Suite. Claire is the daughter of John, the interspatial smuggler who is controlled by the player. The two, aboard a spaceship controlled by the AI Arturo, a particularly successful character, are attracted by a magnetic field and fall on a planet that looks a lot like our Earth. A few moments before losing control of the vehicle, the father separates from the teenager who takes refuge in the escape pod to avoid the risk of a fatal impact. Emerged unharmed from the crash, John immediately sets out in search of Claire, located a few kilometers away from the crash landing site. Armed with a gun that shoots blue cubes, purple trampolines and red pipes, the player's task is, rather trivially, to orient himself in an unknown environment full of pitfalls and to arrive at the last place where Claire has been located . But will it really be there that the search for his beloved daughter will end? Multipurpose nanogun Claire de Lune; the main character Claire Said this way it seems easy, but in practice, death lurks at every turn. In the first instance, a compass is missing, and finding the way forward is in itself a challenge because, unlike the titles from which it takes inspiration, Claire De Lune's landscape is apparently much less ~schematic~, including for a large part of the game a series of mountain passes. Unfortunately, although these open spaces suggest that there are different ways to get to the next checkpoint, numerous and annoying invisible walls often force the player to go around in circles until he finds the right ravine. The puzzles can be challenging to the limit of improbable. Sometimes it is a question of using logic, but much more often coordination is involved: ~shooting~ the cube while falling onto a tube after having jumped off the trampoline is just one example of the synchronism necessary to overcome some steps. In most cases the error leads to death and therefore to a reload, and this exacerbates the annoyance because even on the most recent systems a few seconds are lost between one reload and another. Considering that the fatal falls are very numerous precisely because of the extreme precision required to solve some puzzles, one realizes how much it would have been appropriate to avoid these moments of waiting, perhaps by restarting the action instantly. Fortunately, the system often saves and you will practically never run the risk of having to repeat some particularly demanding acrobatics. The absence of a tutorial, compensated by a minimalist user interface, is not a negative aspect because the title is immediately mastered with ease: the central mouse wheel allows you to select the type of object, the left button fires it and the right one, which is almost never used, makes it disappear. Demanding Claire de Lune; the environment is very beautiful, but how many invisible walls in the open Between one level and another the plot proceeds which, apart from some melodramatic clichs, manages to capture and is perfectly timed with the rhythms of the action. Its greatest value is to arouse curiosity, adding information to each checkpoint that makes it more enigmatic; pity only that the epilogue is hasty and trivial. Between one jump and another there are also some puzzle week-style mini-games that represent a pleasant diversion. A ~speed run~ by Claire De Lune takes about five hours: this is the minimum that only the most savvy will be able to respect, while for the majority of users this value is at least doubled. The extra time will not be spent so much on getting to the bottom of the logic of the puzzles which, on the contrary, tend to be repetitive, but rather on overcoming some obstacles which, as mentioned, can be so demanding as to lead to frustration. Graphically, the title uses the proprietary Empire engine (compiled in Java), the same used for their previous title. Thanks to the direction artistic by Jesse Attard, lead programmer who also worked on Bioshock, makes a really good impression, demonstrating not only clear progress compared to the first iteration, but also managing to compete more than decently with higher-level productions. Too bad only for some stability problems which, on a couple of occasions, forced us to restart the game. The soundtrack accompanies the player without infamy or praise, while the English dubbing we liked, except for some of John's exchanges that do not seem to reflect the anxiety of a father looking for his daughter.", "date": "2021-07-24", "grade": "6.0"}
