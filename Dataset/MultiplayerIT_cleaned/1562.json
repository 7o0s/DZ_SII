{"name": "SOCOM: U.S. Navy Seals", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/socom-us-navy-seals-2.html", "text": "War has never been so much fun Socom can be compared in terms of mechanics and idea to the much more famous Ghost Recon and Counter Strike, of PC origin: war simulations in which we will be in command of an assault team (in this case the very famous Navy Seals) through which we will have to bring complete more or less risky and complicated missions, in order to safeguard military objectives or avert imminent dangers. The first thing that catches the eye, unwrapping the game packaging, is the peripheral sold with the title, i.e. headphones equipped with a microphone, which connect to the Playstation 2's USB port and allow the player to give voice commands to his team, as well as listen to the communications of your teammates or the briefing. It is interesting to note how ~ambient~ noises are reproduced by your television or stereo system, while communications take place via the supplied headphones. Despite being a peripheral designed to be exploited to the maximum in online mode, the Socom headset also behaves very well in ~offline~ mode, in fact there is a predefined series of phrases that can be imparted to one's companions only with the voice, and the result is commendable considering the excellent voice recognition system. Probably the issuing of commands via pad still proves to be a tad bit faster, but the result is certainly not to be thrown away. The missions in which we will exhibit our command and attack skills will be twelve in all, and will take our team to settings that will range from military ships to snowy bases, up to jungles where survival will be the primary factor. In order to simulate reality as accurately as possible, we are given the possibility of getting rid of the enemies with a single fatal blow, or with several blows if our aim is not precise. Naturally, there will be the possibility of concealing the bodies, a practice which on more than one occasion will prove vital in order to disperse one's tracks and not be easily traced by the enemy. The preparation phase of the mission will play an equally important role. After a detailed briefing we will have to worry about organizing our armament, in relation to the conformation of the territory and the objectives set, which may vary in number and difficulty based on each mission. During the course of the attack, however, we will be able to stock up on new weapons, subtracting them from the killed terrorists, even if we will only be able to carry two at a time. Born to kill The level design of the settings is very valid, in fact it denotes an excellent care taken by the programmers in the reproduction of the game environments, which will allow the player to set a good amount of strategies and to have a decidedly varied gaming experience. The detail of the maps, on the other hand, is penalized by generally dull and poorly defined textures from close range, as well as by the models, which are not too angular but which denote a not high quantity of polygons. The graphic effects range from discreet (volumetric light) to just sufficient (atmospheric effects), while the frame rate is at good levels, albeit with sporadic drops in fluidity. The sound sector, supported by music that dynamically adapts to the situation, focuses on a good amount of ambient sounds that create an excellent atmosphere, decidedly appropriate for the type of game. However, the remarkable characteristics of Socom collide with two defects that undermine its playability enough. First of all the control system, which although optimized for the use of the joypad, tends to be cumbersome and not as fast as a mouse + keyboard combination can be. The high number of keys used will also require a discrete learning phase on the part of the player, fortunately supported by various indications that will be provided in the first levels of the game. The second and biggest flaw lies instead in the mediocre artificial intelligence of the CPU-controlled opponents, which is reflected in several cases also in their teammates: unfortunately all the interesting ideas created by the game developers inevitably clash with this aspect, and the most Sometimes they don't get the desired results. Definitely... Socom: Us Navy Seal presents itself as a very accurate third-person war simulation with great attention to detail, unfortunately undermined by an artificial intelligence of the computer-controlled characters which partially mitigates all the advantages present within the game . The real test bed for Zipper Interactive production will therefore be the online game, where the CPU AI will be cancelledin favor of human players, who will make the difference and highlight all the numerous advantages of Socom. Who knows if this game could become what Counter Strike represents for PC players Pros: Good variety of missions Adequate realism Very immersive Cons: Average textures and effects Average enemy AI Difficult control system at the beginning After spending more than 10 months in conversion limbo, SOCOM has finally arrived for the pal market: U.S. Navy Seals, a title that has caused much talk in the United States due to the marked online component, which immediately paid off by transporting many people on the net, also thanks to the relative ease of connection, without paying any additional cost other than that of the network adapter. Fortunately, all this time was used by Zipper Interactive to make some ~filings~ to the game mechanics, as well as to eliminate the small bugs that characterized the American counterpart. The online multiplayer component of the game is currently only available officially in the United Kingdom; however, there are not a few (even in Italy) fans who are playing Socom in its most engaging and long-lived mode, however for now we will limit ourselves to examining the single player aspect of the game.", "date": "2003-08-04", "grade": null}
