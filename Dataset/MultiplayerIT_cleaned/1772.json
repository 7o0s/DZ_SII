{"name": "X-MEN Next Dimension", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/x-men-next-dimension_b.html", "text": "EVERYBODY ON THE TRACK After the usual introductory short film you will be presented with the classic introductory screen from which you can access the ~story mode~, a mode that takes place on the basis of the plot that I briefly described above; or you can choose ~arcade mode~ to fight against ten progressively stronger opponents; the ~versus mode~ if you want to challenge your friend in any of the settings proposed in the game; the ~survival mode~ instead will keep you engaged in an unlimited number of fights until you are defeated; and dulcis in fundo the ~practice mode~ which as usual is used to ~learn how to hit~. In short, nothing particularly original, for the moment. The available arenas are in total about 25 in which you can fight, while the number of characters is 20, plus another 4, secret and not usable from the beginning. From the gameplay point of view, the programmers have tried to increase the depth of the game by inserting some elements to interact with in the scenarios: for example Phoenix will be able to use certain objects present in the play area to hurl them at the enemy; or you can throw your opponent on, for example, a column which following the impact it will collapse.In addition, some characters have the characteristic of being able to remain suspended in the air and simultaneously move in three directions by throwing kicks and punches against the opponent. Speaking of kicks and punches, each character has its own fighting style and you will be able to perform various combos, which will be slightly complex at the beginning, but then with a little training it will become easier thanks to a clever combination of keys. The difficulty, in general, does not stand at very high levels, even if in any case you will often have to implement a different type of combat depending on the opponent, which increases the appeal of the game and the longevity, guaranteed in any case by the ~two player~ mode , which will allow you to challenge your friends in violent virtual fights. In practice, it is a game that lets itself be ~played~, provided that in terms of gameplay it does not add anything particularly new or innovative to the rather crowded genre of fighting games. TECHNICALLY SPEAKING First of all I must say that in this respect, among the three versions of the game, the one for xbox is the most successful, thanks to better textures and video definition. A positive note goes to the animations of the characters, made in a realistic way, and to their realization: not because they are made in an excellent way from a strictly technical point of view, but because you want for their name, or for the colors used, they are very charismatic and pleasant to look at. Another discourse must be made on the scenarios which are, in my opinion, a little too empty and devoid of details that are not always the same in this kind of game; also the use of graphic effects to which the microsoft console has accustomed us, seem to have been implemented with excessive parsimony, making the game overall nice, but nothing more! The superiority of this version over the PS2 and game cube versions must also be repeated for the audio, thanks to the support for Dolby Digital, which makes the action decidedly more engaging. In this respect, the title stands above the sufficiency, thanks to well-crafted sound effects and music which, however, it must be said, do not elevate the title to a higher step than the competition. But there is good news in this regard, which will surely please all X-men fans: the voice of Professor X is dubbed by Patrick Stewart, ie it is the original voice of the film! SO? So... this X_MEN NEXT GENERATION half convinced me: the positive half is due to the presence of the characters, beautiful to look at, charismatic and to the quality of the game as a gameplay which, although undermined by simplicity and a ~already seen~ flavor nonetheless it's fun. The negative half is precisely given by this particular lack of originality and by a rather bland graphic quality of the scenarios ... in short, if you have not understood it, I recommend this game only to fans of mutant heroes, who will certainly find in it more positive notes than negative thanks to the presence of their favorites ... for others I recommend trying it first, to avoid being disappointed. THE X FACTOR Games dedicated to super heroes have always flooded the video game market, starting with Batman and Spiderman to get to the X-men, protagonists of the famous comics. Unfortunately these titles have not always been able to establish themselves on the public and on critics, especially if they are betweenttave of tie-ins, because generally (with some rare exceptions) overshadowed by a more interesting film version. However, I remember that it came out ten or more years ago on a Sega console (I don't remember which one), a title dedicated to the x-men that struck me positively unlike many other chapters which in the following years were ~baked  for all consoles. Activision offers us, regardless of the competition of no small importance, this X-MEN NEXT DIMENSION in which our mutants will give each other a thrashing ... but let's go in order and see what this title offers us beautiful ... THE STORY Also if in a fighting game the story is not the factor of greatest interest, I spend a few words on the subject, if only to give you some good reason to risk your skin in the hard fights that will see you as protagonists: it all begins when Forge is captured by Bastion and the X-MEN must team up to defeat himat this point you may be wondering: what kind of story is this? I answer you that it didn't end here because to defeat Bastion our heroes will have to ally, guess who? Even with Magneto, their most bitter enemy of all time!", "date": "2003-02-06", "grade": null}
