With its first title, Media Molecule has opened a new path, a different and innovative way of making video games, a plethora of winning ideas amalgamated to create something that has certainly left its mark on critics and gamers. But it was also the beginning of a new adventure, and as often happens in these cases there were several things to improve, especially related to the balance between the actual played part and the creation part, too much in favor of this quest. last, and by the not extreme ease in moving between the myriad of levels published by users, consequently disadvantaging all those who prefer to enjoy the creations of others rather than try their hand at a rather complete but at the same time not easy to use editor. The budding developer It should be clarified immediately that LittleBigPlanet 2 can be considered a real extension of the first chapter and not a revolution, the continuation and improvement of a work begun in 2008 and which will continue to give users ever more varied and complex tools to create starting from a stylish, relatively fast and intuitive development platform, with at the same time a technological improvement and a substantial part dedicated to those who simply want to benefit from what is created by the users themselves and by the developers. Fully confirming this point of view, LittleBigPlanet 2 follows the imaginary manual of the good videogame developer and offers a transition where the profile is kept in full with objects and expansions and where it is possible to play all the levels created up to now by users, who have passed the remarkable figure of 3 and a half million. The transition was not painful, but rather the pre-existing scenarios automatically benefited from some of the technical characteristics available to the new graphics engine in the management of lights, shadows and particle effects. Those created from scratch by Media Molecule and by all the budding creators obviously denote the greatest detachment, thanks to the improvements mentioned above but also to a greater cleaning and in general different finishes here and there, which certainly don't make a miracle cry but are noticeable if you compare the two games side-by-side. Styles and ideas The biggest difference in terms of impact is in any case due to the styles chosen for this second chapter, which positively affect backgrounds, objects and the game atmosphere in general, giving a precise identity to the product. If in the original title a great job was done to create some able to charm the player, but tend to be quite similar to each other, in LittleBigPlanet 2 it was decided to go further, perhaps to force the hand a little but with the ultimate goal of give a look that is always interesting but also different in the various facets. Therefore, also playing on the contrast between different styles, Media Molecule has ~invented~ 6 main themes that will characterize the title, with high-sounding names such as Techno Renaissance, Steam and Cake, Neon Propaganda, Designer Organic, Hand Made Arcade and Fluffy High Tech. The result is usually the union of two styles in strong antithesis to each other, in the last case, for example, we are dealing with levels made up of technological and futuristic structures and objects, but with comic and soft characters inside. We must say that these contrasts work great, giving a convincing look to the game, which is really important given that the graphics engine and the whole platform are not and cannot deviate much from the original title. The number of themes is not randomly placed because each one is linked to the respective six worlds that make up the main story, which not only differ heavily from an aesthetic point of view, but introduce and offer different facets of the gameplay as well as acting as a ~showcase ~ for the multitude of possibilities that the new editor offers. In this second chapter the main protagonist (nicely renamed Sackottino within the game) has to face 40 levels in order to save the five creators who make LittleBigPlanet a happy island, with the ultimate goal of defeating Negativitron once and for all.big bad guy intent on undermining the balance. We therefore begin with rather simple levels that reproduce the platform and basic mechanics (jumping with the X and the rest of the identical control system), to introduce into each world all those new tools that heavily modify the gameplay, opening up to brilliant ideas that certainly won't take long to be put ~on paper~ by gamers. Impossible to make a complete list also to avoid overloading the reading, but some examples can be explanatory of the incredible possibilities that LittleBigPlanet 2 offers. Lots of news... Let's start from the camera, a detail that changes dramatically, it must be said, the impact with the game. Its management is much more complete than in the original title, now it is possible to position it according to different angles up to the completely vertical one, which opens up space for different implementations such as the rat race with a top view proposed directly by the programmers. The management of the camera is vital in the creation of the interlude sequences, which in this second chapter can be very complex and with a cinematic cut. If we add the music sequencer, which provides over eighty instruments with which it is possible to create any musical track, as well as the option to record audio directly from the microphone connected to the console, it is clear that it is possible to create decidedly higher levels impact. Too bad about the impossibility of importing audio tracks directly from the console dashboard, but already in this configuration the music creation options are practically infinite and the whole main story of LittleBigPlanet 2 has benefited from a more integrated and ~credible~ narrative sector compared to the original title. Speaking of objects, however, it is impossible not to mention the tortificatore, a nice gun that shoots generously sized sticky cakes, useful for knocking down enemies, creating new steps but also for pulling down bridges with their weight rather than blocking objects from escaping, all alternatives that can be enjoyed throughout the story and are just the tip of the iceberg for budding game designers who want to create ever-changing environmental puzzles or game situations. The enhanced creator instead allows you to emit literally anything (even cows!) and elemental type projectiles such as water, fire and electricity, which has allowed Media Molecule to propose more structured boss fights but also variations on the theme as in some extra levels which, together with the new score sensor, offer a clone of the legendary Pang! rather than a third-person shooter. ...and so on! Growing in terms of importance linked to gameplay we certainly have the introduction of the Sackbots, which fills another of the shortcomings of the original title. In fact, in the first LittleBigPlanet the secondary characters linked to the story or simply to the dialogues were static and inanimate, they were created and then associated with dialogues, switches or other. In LittleBigPlanet 2 the situation changes radically, the Sackbots become sentient beings to the extent that it is possible to create them and associate specific behaviors with them, such as following the player, attacking him, running away and more. They can be customized in appearance, associated with lights, colors, electricity, replicated in an indefinite number and so on, in order to make even the part not managed by the player more dynamic and interesting. And again, even the artificial intelligence creation phase, linked not only to the Sackbots, has been exponentially increased, now it is possible to create a sort of ~brain~ object within which it is possible to chain together different types of actions, whether simple or advanced. Obviously the first implementation that comes to mind is that of something in the Lemmings style, however in the main story there are several levels that see them as protagonists, some of which are very complex and fun to complete. Dulcis in fundo, LittleBigPlanet 2 has another important object that is however destined to change the game dynamic a lot, or the possibility of associating the keys of the pad to any component of the game world, including the Sackbots or the vehicles created. The use is quite simple, thanks to a small icon you access the PS3 controller menu, and if for example you have created a means of transport on two wheels, you can associate its movement to the left analog stick, any bullets squared, the jump to x and so on, or do the same procedure to a Sackbot rather than a gearinformation on the screen. The coveted direct access to objects therefore, which allows the creation of different genres as and more than before. Playstation 3 trophies LittleBigPlanet 2 offers 47 trophies, of which 5 secret (related to the story), 7 silver and 3 gold. The ~classic~ ones involve killing a certain number of enemies, spending time in create mode, publishing a level rather than changing costumes. The more time-consuming ones are related to completing the story levels 100% or trying the ones created by users. Finally, the most ~exotic~ trophies are obtained by playing the title every day of the week or before 9 in the morning and after 21, just so as not to miss the tender Sackboys at any time of the day. The creator Lovers of ~classic~ video games do not despair, all these innovations are manifested in an extremely positive way even in the story mode, the scenarios created for this second chapter are in fact more complex, longer and more fun than the original ones, with exceptional points in advanced ones. Longevity is certainly superior but for the type of game it is not yet completely satisfactory, then by definition LittleBigPlanet 2 gives its best in multiplayer, both offline and online (with voice chat) for up to four players. We have dedicated a lot of time to this aspect and the funny and hilarious situations have been many, the game manages perfectly to capture the pure essence of fun and greatly increase the longevity, especially when you are at least enterprising and curious in wanting to try the levels created by other users. In this regard, the search interface has been enhanced to allow for greater ease of navigation within the myriad of levels available. There are more filters, a more extensive evaluation system and levels recommended directly by the staff, not to mention the queue connected directly to the LBP.me site (see the appropriate box). The rest of the navigation has also been made more coherent and refined from an aesthetic point of view, all tinsel that try to make the title look renewed also because, it should be remembered, we are faced with a platform that has its roots and extends the first chapter . We actually talked about the editor indirectly throughout the review, because as is well known, the tools available allow you to exactly recreate everything proposed by Media Molecule with the main story. Its complexity in the light of all the additions has increased, the largely identical interface has however undergone various unifications and simplifications for numerous tasks, it being understood that to create levels of a certain caliber you need a lot of dedication. To give an idea of the mammoth mass there are fifty-two tutorials to view (there is also a trophy linked to everyone's vision!) which give the guidelines for every single aspect of the editor, it is then up to the budding creator to indulge himself and experiment and post something memorable. We would like to point out one last small and very useful tool, namely that of linking multiple levels together without having to leave the game world. This possibility, together with the cinematic sequences, allows you to create real video games with a story and perhaps different styles of gameplay, an infinite potential that will become increasingly clear as the weeks go by, where the best creators will certainly not fail to reach and surpass the quality levels created by Media Molecule. Actually already in the beta and in the very first days after the game's release (in the United States, for example, it's already available...) we were able to experience incredible levels for both an end in itself and fun to try. Between various clones of vertically or horizontally scrolling shooters, to even simulating an operating system, it is clear that incredible things can be done with the game editor and we are really excited to see what will be released in the coming weeks. The reader may be wondering then what LittleBigPlanet 2 needs to improve or lack, the original title had disappointed some users for the low longevity in single player rather for the lack of bite in the levels, even if for the somewhat ~rough~ platform mechanics especially in jumping. These aspects have also been conspicuously mitigated in some cases (the possibility of regulating gravity in jumps opens the door to new interesting scenarios), however LittleBigPlanet 2, as mentioned, represents an evolution that fully shares the philosophy and concept of the original title - a our way of", "date": "2011-01-21", "grade": "9.6"}
