A decidedly pleasant feature of the playful transpositions is their quality, a non-negligible factor considering other less successful sagas, see Dragon Ball. Thanks to the development team without a doubt, such as the very busy CyberConnect2 (Asura's Wrath) and its Ultimate Ninja, but we also remember with pleasure the two chapters dedicated to the ninja and produced by Ubisoft, the only episodes not edited by a Japanese company. It is still CyberConnect2 to deal with this new Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Generations, a sort of cumulative version (or dream match) of the product distributed by Namco Bandai, which covers both series. From the previous episodes the role-playing parts are substantially eliminated in favor of the fighting games, which become protagonists across the board together with an unlimited number of wrestlers. The work is not limited to this, bringing crucial refinements, an evolved online sector and other interesting features; let's see them all. Stories of ninjas The story mode abandons itself totally to the engaging narrative fabrics of Kishimoto, placing us in three scenarios: the first retraces the original events of Naruto in a youthful version, of the mythical village of the Leaves and his recruitment in Team 7. The second focuses on the events related to the second and more serious Shippuden series, where we find a grown up and fierce Uzumaki, still looking for his friend-nemesis Sasuke Uchiha, a boy tormented by the desire for revenge against his brother. We see him as the protagonist in the third scenario, committed to giving in to Orochimaru's dark forces up to a blaze of destructive madness. The clash between the two antagonists is the fulcrum of the work and faithfully follows the typical Japanese canons: the naive Naruto is an emblem of purity and courage, where Sasuke represents the evil derived from corruption and the unstoppable force of hatred. On this matrix a large group of characters develops, which goes to create that universe full of facets, which has decreed the success of the manga. There really is no one missing in this new transposition, including Sakura, Kakashi, Zabuza, Haku, Gaara, Minato and the Alba Organization. Not only that, by completing the three main campaigns we have the possibility of unlocking new ones dedicated to additional characters, bringing the story mode to a duration of over ten hours, with beautiful interlude films handcrafted by the Pierrot studio. There is nothing more to be desired to experience the cartoon atmosphere on our monitors. The characters unlocked in the various fights can then be used in free mode, where we can organize both tournaments and try our hand at survival, against the CPU or with friends. Violent punches As already mentioned at the beginning, the adventure sections have completely disappeared, considered by many to be the weakest part of the game. It's a shame that the developer didn't work more into the game design to find ways to keep them enjoyable, engaging and more blended into the rest of the gameplay. In our opinion, eliminating them was a bit too easy a solution. The focus has therefore shifted exclusively to the well-known fights typical of the series, which have at least increased in number and leverage on quantity: 72 main fighters plus 15 exclusively support for tag teams. Being taken from both series, we basically find many characters present in the young and adult versions. They are practically double numbers compared to the previous chapter, but CyberConnect2 was not limited to this, improving the game sector and increasing the dynamism of the clashes. These still take place in polygonal arenas with the possibility of moving in three dimensions, to increase the spectacularity of fights that are also expressed over distance. Giant shurikens, shockwaves and fireballs are the order of the day, or all the wonderful ninja techniques loved by fans and of which the title makes extensive use. The control system excludes complex combinations in favor of moves that can be implemented with the simple combination of keys. The mapping includes four basic actions: running, throwing objects, fighting and Chakra. The latter is an omnipresent element in the series and represents the energy necessary to implement the special techniques, and gives rise to a long sequence of highly spectacular actions: Naruto does his utmost to multiply his body and create lethal energy spheres, respectively the Bunshin and the Rasengan, menthree Sasuke uses the deadly technique of the Thousand Hawks. In addition to these, the left trigger of the pad comes into play, due to the most important move of the entire game, the Kawarimi technique, which consists in replacing one's body with an inanimate object, obviously the legendary trunk with leaf! The whole combat system revolves around the use of this move, which takes our character behind the opponent and represents the most effective way to ring in combos. Obviously the enemy has the same resources, so the fight is entirely based on timing and reflexes. In any case, the Kawarimi is limited to a certain number of slots, which can be partially restored, but which obliges not to abuse them in order to achieve victory. All characters can enjoy a special transformation, called Awakening, which exponentially increases their powers, while there is, depending on the clash, the possibility of calling certain companions for help to carry out specific combos with them. Xbox 360 goals Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Generations features the classic 1000 player points, divided across 50 objectives. 150 points will be yours for completing all the scenarios of the various characters, 180 for completing the available tournaments, 90 for the survival modes, while the others require the completion of certain conditions. Collect at least 80% of the game cards for another 100 juicy points, and while you're at it take the opportunity to buy something, you will be instantly rewarded with 5 indispensable player points! Graphics and online Technically Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Generations features the same cel shading polygonal engine already seen in the previous episodes, a choice aimed at making the manga atmosphere better. For fans it is undoubtedly a feast, especially in appreciating the bizarre style of Kishimoto and his colorful ninjas. The special moves are masterfully orchestrated with choreographies that do not regret a real cartoon. It's just a pity that in the most agitated situations the graphics engine tends to lose a few frames, nothing irreparable, but it takes something away from the flow of the action. For the rest we are dealing with a fighting game designed primarily for enthusiasts, commendable in the search for an accessible system and totally devoted to the spectacularity of the shots, but for this reason not without strategy. Of course, those looking for something more technical are better off looking elsewhere, but this has never been the purpose of the developers, and rightly so. Each battle resolved in the main campaign leads to the conquest of a certain number of Ryo, the currency of Naruto's world, essential for buying bonus items in the shop. Among these are the playing cards, which can be combined to obtain various effects in online modes, where we can organize both quick games and real tournaments using the entire roster of characters. This is probably the part where players will spend their time the most, obviously not before having unlocked everything the game has to offer in the main adventure, and we assure you that there is plenty of stuff. The audio sector is excellent, with the possibility of choosing both the English and the original Japanese dubbing. In both cases, subtitles in Italian are guaranteed.", "date": "2012-03-28", "grade": "8.0"}
