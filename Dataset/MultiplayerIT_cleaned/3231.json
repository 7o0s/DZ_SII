{"name": "Dadish", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dadish-la-recensione.html", "text": "In this Dadish review we talk about yet another two-dimensional platform that arrives on iOS and Android, a literally overflowing panorama of similar products capable of offering the most varied experiences: there are titles that pay homage to the classics of the past, others that try the way of experimentation more extreme, still others that embrace current trends to intercept the tastes of younger users and so on. In this crowded context, the work of CatCup Games (the name behind which the single developer Thomas Young is hidden) tries to differentiate itself by offering a gameplay that cannot be more easily inserted in a funny and humorous context. Will it be enough to deserve the download on your smartphone? Let's find out together. Honey, I ran out of radishes The pun that makes up the title is explained by the brief introduction that opens the adventure: the protagonist is a radish (radish in English) who is also the father (dad) of a multitude of colored children, who think it best to escape by taking advantage of a moment of sleepiness of the parent. A trivial but nice expedient to justify the 40 levels that make up the product offer, at the end of each of which there is the turn of the radish to take home. Dadish is a platformer with simple concepts, which is clearly evident from a control system that can be literally learned in a snap of the fingers: the left side of the touchscreen houses two virtual keys to go left and right, while with a tap in a any point on the right half a jump is performed, with the possibility of making it double with a subsequent touch. That's all. There are no power-ups, special abilities, moves to be unlocked with experience points, costumes or anything that could weigh down even a single gram on an essential play structure. The player's goal in Dadish is only to arrive safely at the end of the stage, avoiding all obstacles and enemies that cause instant death at the slightest touch. It goes without saying that such a setting must necessarily be supported by an inspired level design and a bulletproof control system, and in these two areas the work of CatCup Games does not always give the impression of fully hit the target. As for the first aspect, Dadish absolutely does not invent anything new, but discreetly exploits his skills by staging levels that can count on a bit of the whole range of platform stylistic features, from spikes to mobile platforms to pressure switches . The adventure of the protagonist radish rarely goes beyond his comfort zone, offering a pleasant experience but one that struggles to remain engraved in the memory. The level of difficulty is then rather fluctuating but without ever being prohibitive, and only the search for the hidden star in each stage can add a little spice to the whole. If Dadish is occasionally frustrating, it is due to the far from impeccable precision of the commands assigned to the movement, with a too thin demarcation between the two inputs that causes the software to occasionally confuse right with left, perhaps precisely during the last jump before the finish line. With the exception of these small hitches, the game runs quite smoothly for all 40 stages that make it up, also thanks to a free to play model that is based on advertisements (not too invasive and which in any case can be skipped easily) which can be removed for a small one-time fee. Finally, also from a technical point of view, Dadish reinforces the impression of being a valid product but far from excellence. The graphics are a nice pixel art but which literally has no distinctive feature compared to a thousand others seen in as many similar titles, and even the sound makes the minimum wage, with stock effects and all too repetitive music.", "date": "2020-02-21", "grade": "7.0"}
