We haven't seen such a spectacular racer for a long time, and if memory invariably returns to Project Gotham Racing 4 it's because among the ranks of Playground Games there are people who worked in Bizarre Creations, therefore they know perfectly well how to make the jaw drop passionate. After a few hours from the start of the campaign, we did a little experiment: we started walking freely around the huge British setting of the game, reached the city of Edinburgh and parked in an avenue in the park in front of the castle. At that point we virtually got out of the car and activated the drone, moving very quickly through the streets of the Scottish capital, admiring the architecture of its most famous buildings and the streets of the centre. Well, the shop windows weren't simple, rough textures glued to a few polygons that no one would have bothered to look closely in the middle of a competition, but defined and diversified interiors: on one side a clothing store, on the other a bakery, and then again a place where live music is played in the evening. Not far away, a square and a pedestrian course with people strolling and discussing, creating a stark contrast to the deliberately desolate areas where people run. The point is: such a level of care and detail were neither necessary nor obvious for a product like Forza Horizon 4, yet the developers took it on equally, with the intention of really leaving nothing to chance. Well, if such a great passion is found in the details, let alone in the main contents of this new chapter of the Microsoft series. Gameplay and structure Available free to Xbox Game Pass subscribers, both on PC and Xbox One, Forza Horizon 4 boasts a really interesting approach to the traditional open world structure seen in other racers. In addition to focusing on the great variety of situations, on a disproportionate number of events and on an equally gargantuan fleet of cars, which has something like 460 different cars, the game developers have tried to keep interest in the dividend progression high this aspect in several parts and tying specific achievements to the completion of the races, to the customizations, to the artistic and creative aspects of the experience, as well as to the possessions. As the narrator says in the course of the introduction, here it is not simply a question of grappling with a festival of out-of-the-line competitions, but with a real way of life; and life requires times and spaces that in Forza Horizon 4 are declined in the form of dynamic seasons and houses that we will be given the opportunity to buy. Trappings of purely aesthetic value, mind you, but which offer the convenience of an easily accessible hub, where you can manage your garage and make any changes and upgrades to the vehicles, to be financed through the use of credits earned with each victory. There has been plenty of talk about the seasons, but between saying and making a difference is notoriously wide. In the very first part of the campaign we will be able to appreciate them all in relatively rapid succession and experience how they affect the conditions of the asphalt, with situations that are even very distant from one extreme to the other. Because ~arcade~ doesn't mean ~trivial~, and when you aim at importing yourself as an absolute reference for the genre, you need to know the difference between the two concepts well. We are certainly not in the range of Forza Motorsport 7's simcade dynamics: in Horizon, fun, immediacy and visual opulence come before anything else, but each car responds to certain rules and the seasons play a destabilizing role compared to these elements, successfully mixing the cards of an experience that in this way is never boring and finds further comfort in the folds of an online sector that is also dynamic. However, for this PC test we've only scratched the surface of what the Playground Games title has to offer - for more details check out our review of the Xbox One version of Forza Horizon 4. The PC version Forza Horizon 4 runs on Xbox One S at 1080p and 30 frames per second, while on Xbox One X it offers the possibility of choosing between two different modes: 2160p at 30 frames per second or 1080p at 60 frames per second. The quality in these last two cases is variable: at 4K the effects almost entirely correspond to the ~ultra~ preset on PC, with the only exception of ambient occlusion, while at 1080p many parameters switch to the ~high~ preset and are deactivated some extras, like night shadows. Excellent results for a hardwareand which is sold for 499 euros, there is no doubt, but we were interested in understanding how the game behaved in the presence of more advanced components, specifically an NVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti video card. After the Forza Horizon 4 benchmarks with an RTX 2080 Ti, capable of getting 2160p and with all effects at maximum ~only~ 65 frames per second on average, we were afraid that we could not push too much with the settings to be able to enjoy a consistent, ~rocky~ frame rate. Fortunately we were wrong, and there is no doubt that even from this point of view the work done by the development team appears commendable. The options are numerous and effectively allow you to scale the experience based on the system in your possession: in addition to the resolution and vertical synchrony, it is possible to modify the general preset, the anisotropic filter, activate night shadows, set the quality of the shadows, the motion blur, environmental textures, static and dynamic geometry, choose which type of antialiasing to use and with which values, adjust the quality of ambient occlusion, reflections on the windshield and the mirror, the level of detail of the cars and the deformable terrain , finally arriving at screen space reflection, lens flare, shaders and particles. A huge amount of settings, in short, but what were the results on our configuration? By setting the resolution to 2160p and bringing all the effects to the maximum (therefore several entries on ~extreme~), without completely renouncing antialiasing but activating a simple FXAA, the same tests that on the RTX 2080 gave us an average of 65 frames they rewarded with a round 60 fps. The simulation used for the benchmarks is quite varied and eventful, but we wanted to verify this value also in real situations, perhaps within races with different participants and routes full of dynamic elements. Even at this juncture we weren't disappointed - there are moments where the engine drops two or three frames below target, but these are really small things compared to the extraordinary visual quality of this title.", "date": "2018-10-05", "grade": "9.5"}
