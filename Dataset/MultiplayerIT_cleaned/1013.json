{"name": "Star Wars: Republic Commando", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/star-wars-republic-commando-3.html", "text": "Star Wars: Republic Commando has been divided into 3 main campaigns, with related primary and secondary objectives to be completed, the missions will be 15 in all, and as regards the longevity of the single player section, we can say that about a dozen will be needed of hours to finish the game. Speaking of a game where you have CPU-driven companions, the implementation of artificial intelligence is crucial. In this area, the developers have undoubtedly done a great job. Team members will be able to protect themselves independently, and respond to enemy fire precisely and quickly. Also regarding the enemies, we can see that the response of the AI in the fights is well done. The only defect that can be noticed in this sector concerns the choice, made by the CPU, to assign in certain situations the ~unskilled~ character to the task that we ask our companions, a situation that is not too annoying, and can be circumvented. through a reorganization of training. In case we decide to proceed quickly, and personally carry out certain actions, we will be able to be relatively calm, because our companions will follow us and cover us in the best possible way. Technically speaking... Republic Commando, from a technical point of view, certainly defends itself well. Without reaching the level of two other ~titans~ in the sector, such as Halo2 or Unreal Championship 2, the Lucasarts title is promoted without reservations. One of the best things are the animations of our soldiers, thanks to the use of ~Rag Doll~ technologies, all the movements and interactions with objects and the environment are well reproduced. The effects used to reproduce the explosions are excellent, which in some cases are truly impressive, the textures are good and the polygonal realization of the levels is equally good, which are not limited to small rooms, but offer quite extensive and always well detailed external settings. The frame rate and speed of the game are more than adequate, and while there are occasional dips in the frame rate, the playability isn't particularly affected. To mention the very few aliasing problems, the enviable cleanliness of the image, and the widescreen support. As far as sound management is concerned, one can only take one's hat off to the developers, given the splendid work done in Lucasarts. Every single aspect, from the music, to the dubbing, to the sound and environmental effects, has been created to perfection. Thanks to the complete license on the Star Wars musical ~package~, Republic Commando gives its best, in the presence of a Dolby Digital 5.1 system. The version we tested maintains the dialogues in the original language, and is localized in Italian in the texts. That visor reminds me of something.. From the first impact with the game it is possible to notice how the HUD, and the information projected on our viewer, refer in an impressive way to what was seen in Metroid. The controls are made along the lines of those implemented by the two Halos, with the addition of the commands to be given to the team that can be assigned via the digital pad and by pressing a key. The aiming system also does not provide an ~auto lock~ on the target, leaving full control to the player. As for the weapons department, we will have several alternatives, in addition to the primary one, or the DC-17M rifle, there will be the possibility of using gadgets of different technology, such as the Geonosian or Wookiee ones. Side note, in the stages you will also be able to find and use fixed combat positions, such as machine guns, cannons and energy turrets. If someone is afraid of feeling lost for team management, don't worry, Republic Commando offers an extremely simple interface. In the various levels we will find some ~hot spots~ recognizable by holograms highlighted on our HUD, and in those points we will be able to assign specific tasks to our team. While this can be seen as a limitation to the ~strategic~ part of the game, in the middle of a fight, it proves to be a practical solution. The design of the various stages is certainly spot on, and in harmony with the vaguely ~dark~ atmosphere that extends to all the missions. As can be expected, the pace of the game is almost non-stop, recalling the chaotic situations of the battles seen at the end of Episode II. Unfortunately, the evolution of the levels proves to be quite linear, and in some sectors there is the feeling of the obligatory path That visor reminds me of something.. Multiplayer what a Passion.. The multiplayer component of Republic Commando is divided into two sections prmain ones, the one dedicated to full Xbox Live support, and the one dedicated to split screen up to 4 players with associated cooperative modes. The game modes via Live, are the basic ones present in all titles of the same genre, deathmatch, team battles, capture the flag, and among the various there is also an ~assault~ mode, which proves to be a variant of the capture the flag. Republic Commando offers support for up to 16 players per session, and of course the ability to customize your own clone. There are over 10 maps available for these modes, but support for additional content is already provided, which will be made available in the months following the game's release, directly from LucasArts. A specific characterization of some modes, via Live, would undoubtedly have been appreciated, although the game has evidently been developed for the single player campaign, in any case the support of Live, albeit ~basic~, proves once again to be an added value for all possible interested parties. Comment Ultimately Star Wars: Republic Commando, while not setting new standards in the genre, is a good title, it has some aspects that can be improved, such as too much linearity in the missions and not very high longevity, but none of these significantly affect the gaming experience. A team-based first person shooter, with lots and lots of action and relatively little strategy, but done in a decidedly good way. The references to the Star Wars universe, as we have known it through the last two chapters, are countless, and it could not be otherwise, also given the imminent release of the highly anticipated ~Episode III~ in cinemas. Any Star Wars fan, from this point of view will not be disappointed at all, and for them Republic Commando proves to be a must buy. Pros: Sound department Continuous action Spectacular setting Cons: Little longevity in single player Too linear From Lucasarts comes a new new production set in the Star Wars universe. Republic Commando begins, just after the end of the events of Episode II, and for once we will play the role of ~common~ soldiers .. No Jedi powers, no mortal combat with the Sith, no training to learn the secrets of the ~force~. In this Republic Commando we will take control of a team, made up of four ~clones~ belonging to the new army of the Republic. After an introductory film, which virtually traces the history of the Delta team, starting from the first years of training, we find ourselves catapulted to Geonosis, where we will face the first mission, which in practice is a training level in which we will learn to take control of our comrades. As mentioned before, our task in the game will be to impersonate the leader of the Delta squad. Although the clones, in theory, should all be at the same level of preparation, our team has been created, trained and trained in a particular way, to become in practice an ~Elite~ section, destined for specific tasks. Each character in the group has its own specialization, i.e. the demolisher, the hacker and the sniper, except for our virtual alter ego, who proves to be an ~all-rounder~ suitable for any situation. However, it must be said that our companions will still be able to carry out all the various tasks, but obviously they will offer better results in their own specializations.", "date": "2005-03-07", "grade": null}
