{"name": "Planet Zoo: Arid Animal Pack", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/planet-zoo-arid-animal-pack-recensione.html", "text": "Planet Zoo is one of those games that never die, so to speak. Or, at least, that they have a very long life expectancy. Since it was released, in November 2019, it has received as many as fifteen expansion packs, which add a now really important amount of animals and which are often better than those included in the base game, however already numerous. That of being infinitely expanded seems to be the destiny of every successful management game, so much so that currently to have the complete experience of the Frontier Developments title you have to spend hundreds of euros. It must be said that, as we will also see in the review of the DLC Planet Zoo: Arid Animal Pack, the additions are usually designed for a specific target, i.e. for fans of a certain biome and some animals, and there is no need to have them all to enjoy the game. The animals The animals in Planet Zoo: Arid Animal Pack are rendered excellently, as always Planet Zoo: Arid Animal Pack adds eight animals, more than other expansion packs. Seven species are for habitats, so they will be placed in enclosures that reproduce their living conditions in nature, while one species is for exhibition and will stay in its display case. As the name of the DLC suggests, the scenario proposed in this case is purely desert, with the habitats to be recreated which are mainly made of sand and rocks. The best animals in the package are certainly the dromedary and the crested porcupine, which in some way allow you to make the most of the setting, being made with truly maniacal care, so much so as to bring out the inadequacy of the camel, one of the old animals , which offers much less detail and less structured behavior within the same habitat. The other additions to the fauna are the addax, the Somali wild ass, the black rhino (perhaps a little too similar to the white rhino), the sand cat, the lady gazelle and the sand viper. As always, Frontier has equipped each animal with unique animations, which reproduce their real behaviors and which make them particularly alive when inserted in zoos, such as for example the dromedary which can spit at visitors, if an enclosure is built which allows them to go too close, or the porcupine that fills its habitat with tunnels, or the sand cat that behaves... like a cat, scratching and playing with the cardboard boxes. In terms of construction, therefore of additions to the game editor, the package offers structures inspired by Saharan cities, therefore with arabesque architectures in very warm colors, palm trees, rocks and lots and lots of sand from which sparse tufts of grass and brushwood sprout . As always, the variety is very high, with dozens of new objects that have been added to the game editor, but in this case it is fair to warn those who love mixed zoos that it is one of the most complicated scenarios to mix with others, especially those very luxuriant, with which it creates a very strong contrast. New scenery Will we be able to make the visitors happy? Also welcome is the addition of a new career scenario in which the player will find the usual heiress Tiffany Summers grappling with the usual half-disastered zoo that needs to be rearranged and made to flourish again before the inauguration. It is a content that not only adds a few hours of life to Planet Zoo, but also allows you to enjoy the new content all together, since it has been specifically designed. So it's the best way to immediately see how much Planet Zoo: Arid Animal Pack has to offer, before embarking on sandbox mode, i.e. free building. The difficulty level is low, given that these extra scenarios are mainly designed as showcases, but we trust that the average Planet Zoo player is very little interested in the challenge factor and prefers to focus on the expansion and customization options of the zoo added to the experience , which in this case are worth the ticket price. The question to ask yourself to evaluate Planet Zoo: Arid Animal Pack is always the same and above all concerns personal taste, since it is an extra. So, net of the fact that the work done by Frontier is excellent as always, if you like the added animals and the new biome intrigues, it is a recommended purchase. Otherwise you can wait for the next package without too many recriminations.", "date": "2023-06-28", "grade": null}
