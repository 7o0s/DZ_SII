{"name": "Kroll", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/kroll_a.html", "text": "Kroll was developed by Digital Legends, a not very famous team whose most important project was the fighting game One for the first N-Gage; this debut for the iPhone has therefore certainly represented a very important moment, a sort of leap in quality through which to be able to establish itself in the videogame market. Mission accomplished? Unfortunately the answer is no, even if in any case Kroll is a product that will certainly not fail to be discussed within the community of Apple smartphone owners. The protagonist is a sort of warrior named Delon, who, driven by a trivial narrative plot, must make his way through levels infested with enemies until he reaches the appropriate anti-hero. In summary, the mechanics are basically that of a scrolling fighting game, no more, no less; and the very simplicity of the game design leaves you immediately dumbfounded especially in memory of the famous movie of WWDC 2008, in which on the contrary the dynamism and variety of the action made the project look like something close to a Prince of Persia. On the contrary, the development has instead determined a significant step backwards in this sense, to the point of making Kroll a trivial flat and extremely boring beat'em up already after a few minutes. The interface rests on 6 icons, 3 on each side of the screen (with the iPhone held horizontally); the lower one allows the protagonist to run left or right, the central one is delegated to the weak and fast stroke while the upper one to the strong and slow one. In addition to the energy bar, there is also an additional one, which is charged by eliminating opponents and which allows you to release a little scenographic and not very effective special attack by shaking the device. Kroll's main problem is undoubtedly the repetitiveness of the action which is determined by the flatness of the gameplay studied by Digital Legends; in fact, all that needs to be done is to proceed to the right, eliminating waves of enemies in the same way, that is, alternating the two attacks based on the characteristics of the monster to be killed. That's all; the result is therefore very unsatisfying, and it certainly doesn't help the very little variety in the type of opponents present who can really be counted on the fingers of one hand. The lack of a button for defense or for any evasive maneuver is disturbing; fighting against the strongest creatures it is in fact simply impossible to avoid taking damage, which frankly appears ridiculous for a game that appears at the end of 2008. And also the basic elements of this kind of products, such as different weapons or bonuses to collect they are completely absent, further draining the mechanics of any possible depth. The only variations on the theme are the clashes with the bosses at the end of the chapter, who adopt the proven method of quick time events; in practice, the fight takes place automatically, with the player who only has to press the symbols that appear on the screen in order to obtain victory. As if that weren't enough, the production of Digital Legends redefines the concept of brevity; the 3 available chapters can be completed in half an hour, and there is no type of incentive to replay it except for the three difficulty levels present; even an ending is completely missing, which further confirms the already sure second episode. On the other hand, where there is very little to criticize is in the technical component, which undoubtedly takes Kroll to the top of the category; graphically it is a simply spectacular product, which in the abundant 80 Mb in which it is enclosed brings with it splendid 3D environments, full of details and animated, with high quality textures and more than good animations. The sound also convinces, with appropriate music and effects. PRO Technically excellent Nothing else to report... AGAINST Naive and flawed gameplay Ridiculous longevity Price too high", "date": "2008-10-01", "grade": "S.V."}
