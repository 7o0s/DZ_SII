Over the years, however, thanks to the foresight of the various publishers, primarily NIS and Tecmo Koei, who took care of the porting, it has earned a loyal and passionate following of its particular nature and in a certain sense an alternative to the classic structure of a JRPG. Atelier Sophie is the seventeenth regular iteration but also the first to land on current gen, and inaugurates a new trilogy, the one precisely called ~Mysterious~. Atelier Sophie is the new episode of a long-lived and peculiar JRPG saga: here is our review! The Philosopher's Book As always, alchemy is at the center of the plot of Atelier, today considered a pseudoscience with a magical and esoteric flavor, just right for setting novels, films and video games, but in reality a real ancestor of today's chemistry, in the past very serious and respected, target of the attentions of illustrious and unsuspected philosophers and scientists. In the town of Kirchen Bell, young Sophie lives alone: her grandmother was a great alchemist, to whom they turned from everywhere to obtain important medicines and the most varied objects, and the girl tries to retrace her footsteps, but without great success . At least until he comes across, among the objects left by his relative, a strange book with blank pages that apparently serves simply to write down the various recipes that an alchemist uses every day. As soon as Sophie writes her first recipe, however, the book comes alive, flies and even begins to speak, in a woman's voice: her name is Plachta but for the moment that's all she can remember. In fact, Plachta has lost all memory of her 500 years of life, and will recover it as Sophie enriches her mastery of the discipline, writing down more and more recipes. These are the premises of the plot of Atelier Sophie, a plot which in the full tradition of the saga is very light, not without moments of irony and which only approaches the canons of the genre towards the end; however, there are surprises, including one of which, although constituting spoilers, it is difficult not to mention at least briefly since it impacts the gameplay, in particular on combat, and introduces a system called ~Dollmake~, through which Sophie will create clothes and real and own body parts of a doll, modifying its stats and attributes. In the enterprise of recovering Plachta's memory, however, there are very numerous subplots linked to the many characters who in one way or another will come into contact with Sophie: some, such as Monika, Oskar or Julio, will help her get rid of her enemies , others, such as Logy (the only one that has already appeared in a previous title), Pamela or Horst, will provide her with assistance through their shops and ask her to carry out particular missions, which make up the subplots we mentioned. Some of these (few, in truth) are, however short, more interesting than the main plot especially for the way in which they delve into a certain character and its facets, and they turn out to be among the best means that Atelier Sophie has for keep the player's interest alive for the fifty hours it takes to complete everything. To get the ingredients it needs, then, ours certainly has the aforementioned shops available, but above all it has to leave the town to collect herbs, minerals and the most varied materials: said of a new world map in its representation and on which it is possible to move at will between all the discovered locations, each location has its ingredients to collect, this time also influenced by a day / night cycle and by rain, but also its hostile creatures to face. Playstation 4 trophies There are 45 Trophies that can be obtained in Atelier Sophie: The Alchemist of the Mysterious Book. Divided into 34 Bronzes, 6 Silvers, 4 Golds and the inevitable Platinum that encompasses them all, they are mainly linked to the development of the main plot and the subplots, or in any case to the completion of actions essential to moving forward, but there is no shortage of rewards for who completes the Book of Recipes, for those who bring the characters to the maximum possible level and for those who will enjoy discovering some action that is useless for the gameplay but fun and which, precisely, also rewards with a nice Trophy. Alchemical Tetris The combat system has been simplified compared to the last few episodes, which aimed at it a lot: in addition to the classic choices between attacks, askills and objects it is possible to assign an offensive or defensive attitude to each character, and this in turn automatically triggers, after filling a bar, a particular support move. Not that this doesn't have strategic implications, in particular in paying attention to the alternation between party characters and enemies during a turn, which prove to be important in clashes with the most dangerous creatures, which are decidedly more difficult than average, revealing a certain inconsistency in the calibration of the challenge; it is however possible to use four different levels of difficulty, interchangeable during the same game. However, the center of the whole gameplay remains Sophie's atelier, in which, once the ingredients have been obtained, it is possible to create the objects for which you have a recipe: this time, these are not found on tomes to be purchased, but are lie to the protagonist by performing various actions, which encourages the player to explore and experiment. Each ingredient has different specifications, starting from its quality, size and shape: in fact, the cauldron (this too can be improved by Sophie through alchemy, and a better cauldron corresponds to a better result) is represented as a grid in which to insert the ingredients like Tetris, being careful not only that they do not overlap, but also to ensure that the stars and symbols present are enhanced by the particular combination so that the crafting operation brings the best possible characteristics to the recipe. It's a system that's easier to understand in play than in words; it too encourages experimentation above all by virtue of the many ingredients available and their numerous variations and different characteristics. All this, combined with the many sub-quests and plots, the many locations to explore and a reference system that is not particularly complete or intuitive, runs the risk of making the whole experience a bit dispersive, but Gust had already thought well in the last episode of get rid of the time limits that characterized the series, and also Atelier Sophie allows us to indulge our rhythms as we prefer, dedicating ourselves at will to advancing in the story or, what in our opinion is more sensible given the nature of the game, to the creation of items always better and more advanced without ever feeling anxiety and urgency. Unfortunately the technical department which supports a positive system especially for those who already appreciate the series, is not up to it: Atelier Sophie is a cross-gen title and it bears all the signs of this. The characters are actually excellent, even if on closer inspection they are very simple from the point of view of detail also given the anime characterization of the whole. The imaginative design (this time entrusted to two character designers) and rich, and the attention given to them by the programmers makes them a real pleasure to watch, but the same cannot be said of the scenarios, especially as regards the town that serves as hub and in which you will therefore spend a lot of time. Kirchen Bell is bare, devoid of details and almost life, with clean but very flat textures, which the cel shading, while enhancing the characters, fails to mask in any way; some external areas are a little better, which at least are full of colors, but in general we are dealing with a title for PlayStation 3 and not even one of the best. Fortunately, at least everything flows in a granite fluidity, but for the real leap forward from a technical point of view, it will be necessary to focus on the already announced Atelier Firis, in development only for the Sony flagship. The sound is better but still not remarkable: the music is pleasant and traditional but never unforgettable, the English dubbing (by the way, there is no trace of Italian even in the lyrics) in line with other productions of the genre, i.e. not excellent and acting a bit over the top, to the delight of the fans, however, it is possible to select the original Japanese tracks.", "date": "2016-06-07", "grade": "7.0"}
