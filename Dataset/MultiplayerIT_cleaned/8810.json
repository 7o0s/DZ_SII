{"name": "Orde scheletriche", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/98044-medieval-moves-intrighi-scheletrici-orde-scheletriche.html", "text": "Developed by the same guys behind the good Sports Champion, Zindagi Games, Medieval Moves: Skeletal Intrigues puts us in the shoes of the young prince Edmund on his mission to save himself and his kingdom from the evil necromancer Morgrimm, who has turned everyone into skeletons, including the protagonist . No longer Edmondo, but Moribund. A thin thin plot for a title that exploits the peculiarities of PlayStation Move quite well, with many actions to be mimicked with the Motion Controller, but which unfortunately sins in much of the rest. A respectable arsenal Medieval Moves: Intrighi Skeletrici is in all respects an action ~on tracks~ in which the camera is always granite behind the prince's back, where we are only allowed to attack or defend ourselves from the dozens of skeletons of the necromancer. In short, it is the game that decides where to go and when to stop. Once the Motion Controller is held with a firm hand, this strong limitation is however mitigated by the many actions that can be done. The basic attacks are the sword slash, which can be carried in any direction, from above, to the side and even below, according to the types of enemies, armored and not that you face, and the bow, which you ~ activate~ by mimicking the movement of the grip of the arrow from the quiver on the shoulders together with the T key with relative slow and super unstable zoom. Going forward in the game, other weapons come to our rescue, the shurikens, also imprecise, but with a fast launch, dangerously close however as a movement to be made to the bow and dynamite, which must be ~turned on~ by covering the colored sphere with your hands of the Motion Controller as if we were really covering the fuse from the wind. Nice find! Defensively we can rely on the shield. Very intelligently, the developers have not limited themselves to a basic use, i.e. shield yes-shield no, but depending on the direction of the enemy attacks, whether they are arrows or slashing, you have to move the Motion Controller by parrying with the right timing and positioning. The list of movements to do does not end here. Energy is restored by mimicking a good drink, of milk in this case, from the bottle, while to activate the ~super strength~ just press the Move and T keys. Finally, from time to time we are asked to use the grappling hook to access places elevated, a means to escape from long walks in haunted cities. Nothing could be easier, point the Motion Controller down together with the usual T and that's it. Playstation 3 trophies Medieval Moves: Skeletal Intrigues rewards the player with 46 trophies, two of which are secret. The bronze ones are obtained by passing each level of the game, performing particular actions or killing enemies using only certain weapons. The silver ones work harder, like never using milk on the highest difficulty level or collecting all hidden objects. The gold ones are definitely tougher: among those present we find finishing the game on the king difficulty level or freeing 2500 enemies. Platinum is achieved upon completing all trophies. And after this? In short, Zindagi Games has not spared itself in trying to give as much variety as possible to the gaming experience (there are also a whole series of collectibles such as scrolls and gems to collect) but where the game lacks it is certainly in a certain repetitiveness which in the long run degenerates into boredom and sometimes frustration. The gameplay, due to its being on tracks, is basically always the same, the impossibility of moving freely greatly limits the range of possible actions despite the vast arsenal, and in the face of swarms of enemies who attack us from afar when up close, more often than not the shield becomes useless and the damage suffered is accepted, given that you block an arrow and there are others arriving within half a second and if you add to this the long aiming times with the bow, the imprecision of the shurikens and the sword-wielding skeletons that come under, everything becomes in the long run a sequence of clashes in which timing and reflexes are not so fundamental. Target shooting and button mashing at full speed, one wave after another without interruption. It is undeniable that the initial stages are quite fun, with an adequate number of enemies that allows us to use the weapons available ~reasonably~, but in the long run the re-proposition with few variations of the same game scheme, despite various bosses and amenities , is strongly limiting also because everything becomes confusing and unrewarding. In short, Medieval Moves: Skeletal Intrigues, in addition to being repetitive, also suffers from a bad balance in the level of difficulty. More enemies means more difficult of course, but if qhis goes to the detriment of game mechanics there is a big underlying problem. However, Zindagi's commitment to going beyond the usual casual title made with the minimum wage is palpable. In addition to the story there are alternative modes, competitive or cooperative, both single and in pairs, in which we are asked, for example, to defeat waves of skeletons or to defend some positions. On a technical level we are faced with a beautiful work, obviously not comparable to the more famous triple A titles, but still extremely well-finished and with its own style, highly ironic and stylized. We are near a Middle Ages with (obvious) fantasy nuances, but by no means trivial and ordinary. The only disappointment are the long loading screens, but they allow us to go through long levels without cuts.", "date": "2012-01-20", "grade": "6.5"}
