{"name": "Unplugged: la recensione del rhythm game per realt virtuale: Guitar Hero ha un nuovo erede!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/unplugged-recensione.html", "text": "Guitar Hero was undoubtedly one of the most fascinating, intelligent and fun products among those that landed in the homes of gamers. That simple plastic guitar with five colored buttons gave us many hours of joyous rock that, one sad day, ended. Despite the good reception, we all knew that Guitar Hero Live, released in 2015, would be the swan song of a series now on its way to sunset. The great glories of Legends of Rock and World Tour were already long gone and the idea that Activision would continue with the franchise was an impossible dream. However, hope is rekindled for Guitar Hero fans thanks to Unplugged, a virtual reality version very similar to the product we all know, developed by Anotherway and published by Vertigo Games. A fascinating and nostalgic experiment, which we tell you about in the review of Unplugged for Oculus Quest 2. No controllers, just hands! To start Unplugged, first do a thorough check of the headset and hand tracking Unplugged takes the solid foundations built with Guitar Hero and translates them into the world of the air guitar, or the act of playing an imaginary guitar. This is achieved thanks to the reading, by the Oculus viewer, of the player's hands: the Facebook viewer software, in fact, is capable of recognizing the user's hands and their movements. A feature of Oculus that started as an accessibility tool for people who need sign language to communicate and which translated into a playful element very quickly. Before starting the game it is therefore necessary to go to the Oculus settings menu and activate hand recognition (here the official guide). The game opens with an exhaustive tutorial, illustrated by an exceptional teacher: following us during our adventure is Satchel, guitarist of Steel Panther, who will speak to us from a poster during our adventure. To play Unplugged it is necessary, first of all, to be in a well-lit room, to make sure that the external cameras of Oculus are perfectly clean (to facilitate the reading of our hands) and that the sleeves are well rolled up, so as not to obstruct the viewer. We add that it is very important to find a safe and comfortable position, but one that is absolutely standing, for reasons that we will explain shortly. How to play The fret combos in Unplugged are placed at multiple points on the guitar neck After ticking off all the items on this list, a bit like doing the sound check before a concert, we can pick up our air guitar, position it comfortably in our field of vision and start playing. When a track starts our hands will clearly be engaged in two distinct actions: one in gripping the plectrum and the other the neck of the guitar. Unlike Guitar Hero, which only involved the use of five keys with different combinations, in Unplugged we are required not only to satisfy a specific combination of virtual keys (red, blue, green and yellow) but to do it in a specific position of the neck: to finalize the note this obviously has to be picked. The grid that we will find in front of us therefore has four different tracks, on which we will see the different combinations of the notes appear; to understand instead if a note is picked or not, we will see an animation near the strings. Some interesting things are added to the basic mechanics such as the presence of special combos and power ups. The special combos are represented by the notes that do not need to be picked and those vibrated: for the first the lack of the pick stroke is compensated by very tight sequences of combos along the entire length of the neck while the second ones are prolonged and replace the effect of distortion that in Guitar Hero was applied by the lever positioned under the key of the pick. The power ups instead will float on top of the guitar neck and to activate them we should hit them right with the guitar. To all this we add some very nice mini-games where we will be asked to tune the guitar. The tracklist of Unplugged consists of 23 songs Although there is no real guitar, with plastic buttons and levers that resist under our fingers, the feedback from the controls in the game is surprisingly pleasant, thanks also to a very well-finished sound design. The track list is varied and very valid, made up of 23 tracks ranging from great classics to more contemporary songs: from The Clash's Should I Stay Or Should I Go to Alt-J's Left Hand Free passing through Tenacious D's Roadie. and not forgetting, of course, Steel Panther's Eye Of The Panther. TheThe potential to expand the tracklist is clearly endless, a bit like the tracks on Beat Saber, and we're curious to see how Anotherway's experiment continues over the months. Ergonomics and final yield Small gem of Unplugged: on your knuckles there are the two ROCK HARD tattoos! The game really sets up as a very fun experience and if you have loved Guitar Hero over the years, Unplugged is the drug for you. Before we got to the fun part, however, we had to wrestle with some annoying ergonomic issues. Let's start from the position: we tried to play both sitting and standing, but the big limitation of Unplugged is having to keep both hands in the field of vision of Oculus. If you play seated then chances are the game won't see your pick hand - you'll need to rearrange the guitar over and over again to find a position that both tracks both hands and is comfortable for you. The best solution is therefore to play standing up, bringing the guitar to the height of the loins, a position which unfortunately forces you to keep your head very low. With the weight of Oculus, which, although light, still takes the form of a discreet encumbrance, the neck and shoulders are unfortunately very stressed ... even if the neck pains are not very rock, no one will blame you if after half an hour game you will feel the need to leave. This problem could be solved by creating an optional hybrid solution, leaving the hand on the neck free and the pick hand busy with a controller, capable of detecting the movement of the pick without the viewer ~seeing~ it. Having to keep your head down all the time is one of Unplugged's little flaws Then, on a conceptual level, it escapes us why to associate a very technical (albeit always fun) gameplay with the air guitar, a gesture clearly made to express a feeling of fun and total freedom with the body. Here we have two paths: either play for fun and that's it, without taking scores into account, or concentrate entirely on the performance, which however requires concentration and a certain motor control, in which freedom is severely limited by ergonomics mentioned above.", "date": "2021-10-22", "grade": "7.0"}
