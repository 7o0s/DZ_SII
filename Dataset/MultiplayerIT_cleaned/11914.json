The redesign of the Slim & Lite version, despite having left many perplexed in the face of the practically absolute aesthetic identity with the first version, instead brought with it a series of improvements that were anything but marginal, which were well perceived by the public - especially Japanese- which rewarded Sony with a record sales volume. And at the same time, even on the gaming front, products designed specifically and exclusively for the laptop in question are increasingly appearing, or conversions that are in any case attentive to the capabilities of the hardware. Restricting the field to the genre of turn-based strategic J-RPGs, two perfect products appeared shortly after, exponents of the trends just described; and so on the one hand Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions was published, a splendid revival of one of the best titles of the Psx era, on the other Jeanne D'Arc, a promising production by the well-established Level 5 studio, reached the shops . Long live France! And it is precisely the latter that we are going to talk about in this review, trying to clarify how many chances it has of establishing itself on the Square Enix masterpiece. As presumable, the plot and the same title mention Joan of Arc, a French heroine of the fifteenth century whose story has been handed down and told through numerous forms of art and literature over the years. Video games were indeed missing from this list, but don't hope to use the PSP to educate yourself in view of the history question. Level 5 has in fact drawn inspiration from the Maid of Orlans, but introducing fantasy elements and developing an original plot seasoned with fantasy monsters and creatures. However, the work of the Japanese team remains very interesting, which managed to give its own interpretation while maintaining components such as the fight against the English invaders and above all the spiritual and religious component of the protagonist, whose actions are often and willingly guided by a superior Voice. This made it possible to develop Jeanne's personality in a convincing way, giving life to a heroine with whom it is easy to establish an emotional bond during all the approximately 30 hours of the adventure. But can the gameplay be considered equally successful? The answer is yes, without a doubt. Level 5 has in fact succeeded in the task of finding a perfect balance between tradition and novelty, touching only marginally - but in an incisive and convincing way - a mechanic that for many does not require substantial changes. And so those who have played the aforementioned Final Fantasy Tactics or Tactics Ogre or any traditional exponent of the vein will not find it difficult to immediately enter the basics of the Sony product. It is therefore basically a question of sending a pre-established number of characters and allies onto the battlefield, with whom to try to defeat every enemy present. The levels, with a limited quadrangular plan, are divided by a grid of squares which make up the areas in which the characters can move based on the player's commands. Everything in the norm therefore as regards the foundations, but it is in the development that the effort of Level 5 finds the impetus to impose its quality. The protagonist, together with a group of companions, is in fact equipped with a bracelet capable in particular conditions of transforming them into ~super heroes~ with greater offensive potential both for physical attacks and for magic. However, this power is not infinite, but on the contrary it is extended by one turn only if an enemy is eliminated; this aspect therefore brings with it a further strategic component of fundamental weight especially in the advanced levels, in which the number of opponents necessarily requires the prudent and intelligent use of these powers. The Burning Auras are also very interesting; in summary, each successful hit creates a circle of fire in the square behind the enemy, which gives greater strength to the attacks carried out later by any ally who goes to position himself in the aforementioned space. Unfortunately, the same is true for enemies during a counterattack, with the obvious risks that this can entail for one's own characters. The stone of happiness Obviously in Jeanne D'Arc there is also a robust phase of ~preparation~ for battles, in detail as regards the management of the equipment of one's companions and above all for the use of stones. Each character can in fact be equipped with a certain number of stones, which guarantee him new skills, spells or increase his characteristics. It is therefore necessary to carefully study which set to entrust to each to avoid imbalances, even in the face of delimitations that prevent some from employing certain stones. The latter can be obtained during battles or purchased in shops, but also merged together to create new ones with higher quality. From a technical point of view, the work done by the programmers is definitely appreciable in this case too; polygonal 3D was used, but the limited size of the settings made it possible to achieve an excellent level of detail both for the characters and for the places they visited. Faced with themes that are anything but childish, the use of a comic style, even super deformed and with bright and vivid colors, could only cast some doubts. In reality, beyond personal tastes, this allows Jeanne D'Arc to maintain a particular characterization capable of distinguishing it from the crowd. On the other hand, the cartoon interlude sequences are excellent, and the soundtrack is extremely spot on, even if a little repetitive. There is no dubbing during the dialogues, but frankly the need is not felt too much. Finally, it should be noted that in the USA the game was sold at a reduced price, equal to less than 30 dollars. If this direction is also followed in Europe, admitted and not granted that distribution is also announced in the Old Continent, this will represent a further suggestion for the purchase of a title of great value. If not, well, we think a little internet shopping at some overseas store might do the trick for you Comment Jeanne D'Arc is a product that any lover of turn-based strategic J-RPGs will appreciate. While not changing the substance of a classic game mechanic that is still valid today, the Level 5 programmers have managed to study a stimulating and very intelligent gameplay development, which is enhanced by a practically perfect calibration of the difficulty. A convincing character development and a captivating plot complete the circle of a non-revolutionary but absolutely successful game. Pros Excellent game mechanics Intriguing storyline Very convincing balance Technically more than good Cons For some too traditional Graphic style for many but not for all European release not confirmed at the moment", "date": "2007-10-19", "grade": null}
