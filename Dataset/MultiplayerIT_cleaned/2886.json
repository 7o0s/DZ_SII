{"name": "Tennis World Tour 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tennis-world-tour-2-recensione.html", "text": "The games dedicated to tennis have experienced a great era, but for some years now they have suffered a decline. The first Tennis World Tour tried to fill the void created in the fans, but due to the precarious conditions in which the Breakpoint work debuted on the market was a colossal stumbling block. To put a patch on the situation of tennis titles, AO Tennis 2, developed by Big Ant Studios, took care of it. Although it didn't make a miracle cry, the Australian Open branded title was still a step forward and demonstrated the team's ability to try its hand at the genre. For this reason, the publisher (the same as Tennis World Tour) has put a new product in the hands of Big Ant: the Tennis World Tour 2 review is here to take stock and understand how it went. New engine and new animations Tennis World Tour 2 starts from the basics, i.e. from the graphics engine and does so by changing direction compared to the past. New engine and new improvements that point the compass in the direction of the increase of the animations, of the coherence of the same and in the direction that sees the proposition of a simulation more attentive to the details. Offering a faithful, fluid and visually credible title is the first of many goals that the team has set itself. The focal point of these improvements lies in the number of animations, significantly increased, and now more in synergy with the game actions. The big playful problem of the first chapter was the difficult reading of the opponent's actions. Tennis is based on a sudden ~action-response~ situation that requires fast and uniform readings, something that was missing in the playful revival of Breakpoint. Responding to an opponent's backhand cross on the field is based on the study by the players of some reference points related to movements: in game this should correspond to clean and fluid animations, able to be read effectively by the player. Increasing the number of animations and putting them into practice in a manner suitable for the aforementioned objective is therefore a great starting point for Tennis World Tour 2. Unfortunately, however, the work was a lot and the legacy was uncomfortable. Tennis World Tour 2 is a big step forward compared to the past, it is certainly a credible and even fun revival, but it suffers from various problems in some specific situations. First of all the ferocious and sustained exchanges from the baseline that occasionally lead to awkward situations and animations in moments in which the player's skill should emerge. Landing long on a crossed backhand (assuming and not granting that you get there) could often cause weird movements or even not let you hit. Secondly however, the critical issues are revealed when the player tries to get out of the classic schemes of a tennis match, but for this we have to talk about the gameplay introductions. Service and response The other great novelty at a playful level is the modification of the serve. An excellent ~joke~ is an extra weapon for the players, an arrow placed in the quiver that can make the difference in the hardest-fought matches. Starting from this concept, Big Ant has revised the service system, putting the possibility of choosing the effect and power of the shot in the hands of the player. The height of the impact with the ball will also be chosen, all with a very effective and not particularly complex system. The stratagem used allows players to become familiar with the various phases of the service and guarantees the more skilled players greater possibilities in terms of the effectiveness of their shots. Not least the review of the exchanges. Nothing transcendental and original is clear, but the response in the exchanges is now more similar to the titles of the past, where the player's skill made the difference. The search for the ball, this is how hitting at the moment is called in technical jargon just the yellow ball so dear to fans, is a key point of tennis. The difference between a champion and an excellent player has always been made by the way and precision with which a tennis player reads the action and positions himself appropriately to hit the ball better. In video games, the only way to try to reproduce this situation is to insert a timing response system. Hitting the ball with perfect timing and releasing the key even with optimal timing will therefore allow you to score insidious shots, vice versa they will be predictable and consequently not very performing. Precisely at this point a double-sided medal is inserted: on the one hand the excellent work done on the coherence of the animations and on the reproduction of a fun and engaging tennis and videogame feeling, on the other a small harness insideor of classic and canonical schemes that are not very suitable for current tennis, but perhaps for tennis in general. If we leave the classic schemes of prolonged exchanges and closing for the point, the game will occasionally be very complex to manage and at high difficulty levels the AI could give you some headaches. If the control system does not undergo any modifications with respect to the classic canons of the genre (the four main keys are the four shots: drop, lob, flat and top spin), at a playful level a card system comes into play that will change your way to play. Yes because through in-game currency (obtained by playing any mode and completing challenges) you can buy cards that will offer you bonuses or will cause malus to the opponent (for example your top spin shots will tire the opponent more ). These cards, of different values (bronze, silver, gold), will therefore modify your behavior in the game allowing you to create real builds. For example, if you use two cards linked to the serve and two to top spin shots, you will know that during the match you will have to exploit those shots to obtain the greatest effectiveness. Both you and the opponent will be able to see the cards chosen by the other and therefore this will allow for potentially different matches in which strategy will count. Betting on one's strengths will be supported by betting on the weaknesses of the opponent's strategy, which can be guessed by knowing the equipped cards. Mode and outline Then there is a whole set of methods that complete the content package. The online matches, friendly and classified, which will be based on a renewed netcode and which will allow players to compete to become the best in the world. The tournaments, also in this case offline and online, rather than the Academy, which is the training mode in which to learn the basics of tennis. Obviously without forgetting the classic career. In fact, we will be able to create our alter ego and lead it from the beginning to the conquest of one or more Grand Slams. After shaping your player (the quality of the editor can be reviewed even if we have seen much worse) you will begin your climb to success. In this case it is important to take into account the physical condition in which you will arrive at the tournaments, managing rest, targeted training (which you will perform with mini-challenges) or basic physical exercise (able to offer you bonuses to statistics) will be fundamental. In short, a classic career mode, which however offers prolonged fun for tennis lovers. What is considerable is the licensed content package which sees 38 players all licensed and numerous tournaments. It seems like a minor detail, but it is instead a factor not to be overlooked, given that in this kind of title, licenses have always made the difference. Then there are also the courts, which in the Tennis World Tour, in addition to the four classics (clay, synthetic, grass and concrete) see the introduction of a new type of terrain: wood (although perhaps it would be better to say parquet, given the its indoor connotation). Even the atmospheric conditions will affect the gameplay, modifying the yield of the rebounds on the playing surface. An interesting choice that enhances the work done by the team, despite the physics of the ball that occasionally trips over itself. We would have preferred more responsive physics in terms of ball weight, which is still lacking in all respects. We understand the difficulty of making every situation balanced, but those who have played tennis know that responding to a top spin from Nadal or a forehand from Federer with the same power throughout the match is not an everyday thing. For this reason and above all for the attention placed on bounces, surfaces and animations, we would have expected an evolution in this sense too.", "date": "2020-09-22", "grade": "7.6"}
