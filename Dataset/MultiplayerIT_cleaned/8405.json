Once the number of players has been chosen, plus very few other basic settings, we start immediately launched on the game map, the environment where practically the whole game takes place. But let's take a step back to find out what the background of this title is: we are in the middle of the sixteenth century, a time in which we find ourselves in the role of a ship captain committed to carrying out the great feat of finding and killing the legendary Kraken, a monstrous creature that scare the seas. Not an easy thing to do, given that to find the horrid monster you must first get three artifacts, extricating yourself from competing captains, other marine creatures and unexpected events that can disturb the course of the game. Therefore, before thinking about the Kraken, the player must work hard to obtain gold coins, thanks to which to upgrade his ship in three ways: increasing the capacity of the hold, the strength in combat and the possibility of moving on a greater number of boxes for each turn. From one port to another What is initially proposed to us as a map covered by clouds is nothing more than the reproduction of a hypothetical sea of variable size (depending on the choice made before the game), populated by islands where some ports are located. Much of the time spent playing Fortune Winds: Ancient Trader, as the title also suggests, involves moving between one port and another, buying and buying goods to earn money, sometimes even accepting quests usually of the type ~port the passenger from point A to point B on the map~. A trading mechanism known to most, intended as we said also to enhance one's ship for combat: keeping the boardgame setting, Legendo Entertainment's idea for this phase was to base the battles (both ship-to-ship and ship-monster) on the use of cards, however mixing them with the more classic dynamics of paper, stone and scissors. There are three types of attacks (and defences), each of which corresponds to a card with a score: once the card has been chosen, it is compared with that of the opponent, and so on with subsequent clashes until one of the two remains without cards, usually losing money or goods. The rock, paper and scissors mechanics come into play by adding +2 to the score if you have a blue card against a red one, a red one against a green one or a green one against a blue one, granting the extra points to the first of each coupled and in fact often deciding the turn match. When described so far it can certainly appear interesting, and in fact Fortune Winds: Ancient Trader proves to have only one defect: that of limited longevity. The absence of additional modes is already felt after a couple of hours of play, given that the only thing with which a little variety can be added is the choice of the size of the map-board, with a consequent increase of tiles and islands. In this perspective, the possibility of playing together with three other human beings on the same PC is partially met, being able to choose in this case as the final objective also that of accumulating a certain quantity of wealth rather than killing the usual Kraken: it had also been available online , this mode would certainly have been a notable addition, but this makes it necessary to get all together to play (which is not necessarily a bad thing, since we are after all talking about a boardgame-like game). Like Abraham Ortelius Together with the theme of the game, obviously inspired by the sixteenth century we also find the entire graphic sector, created by Legendo's own admission with the maps created by Abraham Ortelius in mind, the first to put a cartographic atlas on paper as we understand it today. The attention to the details of the artwork is maniacal, as well as placed on every single aspect of the game: from the avatars of the characters to the various elements on the map, everything really gives us the impression of actually being grappling with the cards of a ship of the sixteenth century launched into a legendary adventure. The soundtrack, based on simple instruments and melodies, accompanies the game in a pleasant way, as well as the attention to detail mentioned above has also been placed in the audio effects: we thus hear the cannons firing, the waves of the sea and the sound of coins spent each time you trade in the various ports.", "date": "2012-07-26", "grade": "7.0"}
