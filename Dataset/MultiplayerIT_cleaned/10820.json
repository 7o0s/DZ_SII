{"name": "Postal Babes", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/postal-babes_a.html", "text": "If a gamer pronounces the word ~Postal~, he certainly does not refer to letters or parcels. Instead, the mind runs towards an action game released for PC a few years ago and characterized by an isometric view as well as lots and lots of violence. To stay in recent times, we can talk about the film that the usual German director, Uwe Boll, made from the series of videogames developed by Running With Scissors (the name of a team has never been more appropriate), a film that critics panned but which some fans consider it a rather successful sort of trash-cult-movie. In the case of Postal Babes, there are no references to the PC game even if it remains an underlying philosophy based on spectacular violence and the absurdity of the plot. Simply, a dangerous situation occurs and the protagonists (in this case beautiful and provocative girls, who look like dancers in a night club) are transformed in an instant into real war machines, capable of using any type of weapon with extreme ease . The game sees us control two friends who during the internships take turns fighting criminals, with the common goal of rescuing all the girls taken hostage in their university. The former has long black hair and is very good at fighting with bare hands or using ~white~ weapons (clubs, machetes, throwing knives), the latter has red hair and is an expert in firearms , so much so that he almost always wields pistols, machine guns and grenades. Everything takes place as in the most classic of action games / scrolling beat 'em up, with our character having to eliminate the enemies in his way and explore the levels in search of hostages to free. Once in front of an opponent, we will be able to repeatedly press the 5 key to perform a devastating combo of kicks and punches, or use the available weapons looking for the ~perfect hit~ to end the fight in an instant. The gameplay varies a little when there are platforms on which to climb and jump, or during alternative sessions in pure shooter style: in this case we will have to move a viewfinder on the screen and try to eliminate all the targets with the minimum possible expenditure of shots, available in severely limited quantity. The technical realization of Postal Babes is discreet, but certainly more could have been done. The girls are well drawn and boast a large set of animations, but their walk (albeit fluid) appears decidedly unrealistic, with too many steps in too little space. Things improve during the fights, and the ~gore~ component appears to be done quite well, with blood in abundance and enemies that literally end up in pieces under the blows of our weapons. The locations move between ups and downs: the stages set inside buildings are well done and also boast some interactive elements, while those outside are really mediocre, especially as regards the construction of the buildings. The MIDI music is far from unforgettable, while the controls respond with sufficient precision and are intelligently arranged. PRO Good number of weapons and moves Smooth animations Immediate and quite fun... AGAINST ...but very, very limited Fluctuating location quality Really mediocre shooter sessions", "date": "2009-03-17", "grade": "S.V."}
