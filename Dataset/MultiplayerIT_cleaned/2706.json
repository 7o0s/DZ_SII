The series was born and triumphed in moments with an extraordinary debut game, continues to walk victorious in history with a highly successful sequel, to return soon after with a compilation of levels designed to give the public a little more Hitman, looking forward to a real sequel. The wait lasts about four years: Hitman Blood Money hits stores in 2006, ready to crash. But something has changed drastically, and it's the tastes of an audience that welcomes the new Hitman with dramatic disinterest. And to think that Blood Money is truly a stealth masterpiece, still the best Hitman around today and probably the best work by IO Interactive, which among many qualities also has one of the most satisfying endings (secret, but not so much) ever. Rightly convinced that they still have a great game in their hands, but forced to change its formula to conquer a new generation of virtual assassins, the designers of IO Interactive give life to a different Hitman for the next chapter. Himan Absolution comes out in 2012 and introduces some very interesting new stealth mechanics, which fortunately we will see again later, however it also has to make room for a much more rigid narrative than in the past, with consequences that will prove disastrous for its popularity. Hitman Absolution is the most cinematic of the series, not holding back when it comes to putting stealth aside to make room for a shootout full of explosions and flying bodies. But gamers, as we well know, love to tear their clothes off and scream at betrayal as soon as they see the possibility, and on Absolution the fans of the series were adamant. Absolution is probably the worst Hitman, but it's still a respectable stealth experience that wouldn't have deserved the right treatment. However, the flop is also the fault of IO Interactive which, after transforming Agent 47 into a cinematic character, with the 2007 film Hitman The Assassin, instead of riding on his renewed popularity, decides to devote himself to something else, creating the Kane & Lynch series. And we finally get to us, or almost. Work begins on the new Hitman, without number or subtitles. A reboot? Almost, IO Interactive prefers to talk about a new trilogy, the World of Assassination Trilogy. The problem is that SquareEnix, which in the meantime has acquired the Swedish company, after the previous slips, doesn't trust it much anymore. To limit the risks, all together they come to a solution: to break up the new Hitman like Telltale and Dontnod games. Bad choice, given that the game debuted in 2016, when everyone can no longer stand episodic games and the TellTale phenomenon has decreased considerably. For the new Hitman, the start is slow, so much so that to grab the mediocre result, however, will have to wait for the full version to be released. ~Finally,~ many exclaimed. Precisely for this reason, the idea of an episodic Hitman is set aside on the occasion of the arrival of Hitman 2 and consequently for this new Hitman 3, the final chapter of the World of Assassination Trilogy. Reboot or almost They are three games, it is true, but basically they are one big project in which the structure of Hitman is dried to the point of becoming almost only gameplay. There is a plot that unites the three distinct chapters and the different levels, but this is composed of very little incisive clippings that all together make it feel more like a trailer for an upcoming film than the finished story of a video game. After all, it is a pretext to show off at each release six extraordinary levels to explore far and wide, where several stories intertwine with each other, creating hundreds of opportunities to commit the perfect murder, flawless execution that deserves the best score and many more gadgets and opportunities. Because here everything is designed for maximum replayability: with each successful attempt, with each target eliminated in a certain way, new weapons, new gadgets, new contacts on the spot, new vanishing points are linked which will make you more and more performing in subsequent attempts , and capable of progressively more spectacular actions. Furthermore, the same levels are also the background to the contracts created by other players, who will be able to designate a new victim and a new regulation in order to continuously propose new challenges to the community. Bloody scenes It takes a lot to host a lot of gameplay, but the scenarios of the World of Assassination Trilogy of which Hitman 3 is the final chapter, are so well done as to offer an absolutely out of the ordinary replayability. Without scoModifying community-created contracts, which include their variables, the base game alone offers hundreds of different ways to kill every single target present. However, the most spectacular kills are usually those that the player will find himself in front of following the different plots present in each scenario, perfect murder opportunities that will make you experience the same level in three or more totally different ways. Not even these missions, however, cage the player in his choices: the different subplots always take place simultaneously and it is possible at any moment to change direction, approach or both. Of course, the missions can be abandoned at any time by simply starting to do your own thing, for example by acting instinctively, in order to take advantage of the myriad of opportunities that, in its pure sandbox being, Hitman disseminates throughout the game area. For this same reason, the level that you will probably finish the first time in one, two, maximum three hours, can continue to give you satisfaction for at least three times the time. For example, the writer loves to become familiar with the scenarios by facing them in the first instance as they come, seizing the opportunities that appear in front of him; later he finds it interesting to follow the stories and finally, after having completed them, he throws himself into experimentation trying to complete the different challenges. But everyone has their own way of approaching this wonderful trilogy, of immersing their hands in this gameplay mother yeast, and it certainly won't change with the new Hitman 3. Step forward After all, as with Hitman 2, Hitman 3 also represents a new course of the same tasty meal. The second game had brought some more or less interesting news, but the most concrete step forward came from the improvements to the level design and the evolution of the sandbox aspect. In Hitman 3, the biggest novelty is totally secondary: a camera that allows you to perform some very simple hacks, get additional information in certain missions and take pictures of the scenarios in a sort of photo mode. Other additions vary from level to level: some have terminals with which it is possible to interact, or numeric keypads in which to enter possibly correct codes, common elements in many games but not present in the first two chapters of this trilogy. In addition to a handful of new weapons, which never hurt, the rest of the game is practically identical to Hitman 2 in terms of gameplay and the amount of content offered. World Wide Killer A similarity that is not a problem, after all we expected it, furthermore deepening the same formula for the third time has however led to various benefits. We have already said that in IO Interactive there are very good level designers, and how it is precisely this quality that has made the Hitman series so special, but the six locations of Hitman 3 still manage to show further steps forward, both in the scenographic spectacularity than in their perfect logical construction. In this third episode, you start on the top floors of a skyscraper in Dubai and end up among the dangerous peaks of the Carpathians, in the middle a series of superfine maps among which the Chinese one stands out, with a cyberpunk aftertaste, and the one set in England . In the English countryside of Dartmoore, Agent 47 will arrive in the imposing mansion in which the target to be killed lives, at the same time as a private investigator called in the same place to solve a mystery of which, of course, we won't anticipate anything. Solving the mystery of Dartmoore is naturally one of the possible objectives of the level, and a perfect example of how IO Interactive has now reached the apex of the playful ganglia set up for this trilogy. Here sandbox and story-driven elements are intertwined with truly unique artistry. Graphic amazement But the ghostly home of Dartmoore provides us with another precious hook, this time to talk about graphics and, above all, atmosphere. The recently polished but old and creaky parquet, the built-in wooden walls, the silverware that shines in the milky light that filters through the windows, and then the kitchens with the clatter of cutlery and the bubbling of imaginary messes, the team of gardeners and the conspiratorial chatter of servitude. Each level of Hitman is a freeze frame of a moment, stuck in a rut that only we can break with our choices and our actions. And of this moment, thanks to an uncommon attention to detail, we can almost perceive the smells, the most hidden sensations. This craftsmanship here stands out further thanks to the new version of the Glacier Engine that perfects without distorting, aumechanging the effectiveness of lighting and reflections. The latter, although very good, in some situations show the side of their technical limits and make us regret the (momentary, but perhaps only on PC) absence of ray tracing. Thinking victims Hitman 3's AI works the same way it always does, but you may notice more reactions based on location and player behavior. If we take on the role of a gardener and move crouched among the foliage, even if seen by someone, nothing will happen, unless that someone is among those able to recognize the uniform we have stolen or our natural strangeness; but if we walk in the same way in the middle of a hotel lobby, we can see and hear the staff getting curious, worried and finally asking us politely to behave normally, or we will be thrown out. In short, the system works, and above all it always remains extremely credible. Then again, as always, there are mistakes, naivety, situations in which the AI seems to respond more slowly than it should, but concessions are also gameplay: after all, an artificial intelligence must always remain at our service, and this also means playing dumb right to enable us to win. Easy and difficult Not that Hitman 3 is easy. It is, if you just kill everyone, but as soon as you try to take it a little more seriously, its depth suddenly emerges and can throw you off balance. To make the best kills, but also just to complete the different subplots of each level, in most cases a fair amount of effort is required, if not sometimes outright wit. In every situation you can help yourself by dint of save games, but these will no longer be available if we choose the highest and most profitable difficulty, a function which, among other things, will further sharpen enemy senses. Naturally you can do the reverse procedure and choose the friendliest difficulty, excellent for those who are not interested in scores and unlockables but still want to aim for the maximum by making an effort to the minimum. As for scalability, we are there. DualSense effect We tested Hitman 3 in both the PC and PlayStation 5 versions. The game is extremely lean, very easy to run at maximum details without a beast under the hood, and is perfectly capable of hitting and maintaining the coveted 60 fps. On PlayStation 5, however, we noticed a few millimeters of detail less, such as small and sporadic drops in frame rates, but otherwise the two versions are almost indistinguishable. However, on PlayStation 5 there is DualSense, with its haptic feedback that is felt here too, fun as always, but its effectiveness quickly fades into the background. All or none? The only real weak point of Hitman 3, like the two and even before the one, are the six levels present which will also be large and very large, replayable and replayable, but they are still only six. It is a number that psychologically can be frightening, especially if a game is sold at a very full price, especially if you are the third act of a project that many are still having to discover for the first time. Hitman 3 however is lucky, it is the epilogue, and the epilogue is what certifies the completeness of a work and from which the ~all-inclusive and turnkey~ editions are born. The game is already designed for this: if you buy or already own the first two Hitmans of the trilogy, you will find all the levels of each chapter within the menu of the third, which will behave as if it were, but in fact it is, one big game. Furthermore, even the old maps have been updated with the new version of the graphics engine, with all the benefits of the case. What remains important to say? In this Hitman 3 they eliminated the competitive modes introduced in the second game, but let's face it: they did it because nobody used them. While as regards one of the most popular functions, the infamous Elusive Contracts, we will have to wait a little longer to understand the extent of the changes to the system announced by IO Interactive. At the moment we have not found any trace of these particular time contracts that have entertained fans of the game so much in past titles. Finally, before closing, an earful to whoever organized the compatibility of this Hitman 3 with the two previous titles: it's all too confusing and complex, when it should be easy and intuitive.
