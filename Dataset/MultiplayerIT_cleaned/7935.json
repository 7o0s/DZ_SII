Almost five years of work, a long and troubled development that has seen some postponements and the departure, over time, of numerous members of the software house involved in the project from the very beginning, various demonstrations in sector fairs to which we ourselves have often done hard to believe, given the incredible artistic vision that appeared before our eyes. But above all an important testing ground for Ken Levine, the brilliant game designer who, after a past behind the scenes with the various System Shock and Thief, amazed the whole world with BioShock, a title that forcefully brought the importance of story and quality of storytelling in a first-person shooter. Something that hadn't been seen since Half-Life, Deus Ex or System Shock itself. It is precisely with this burden on his shoulders that the developer is preparing to launch the ideal sequel to his title on the market, after the interlude of a BioShock 2 developed without his contribution and almost without his support. Will he have managed to amaze us again and confirm once again his ability as a screenwriter, director and above all creator of an engaging and perfectly finished gameplay? The answer can only be yes; shy however, due to a series of deficiencies in the structure of this sequel that we will try to analyze in the body of the review. Never seen a story like this It is difficult to go into detail about the story told without risking opening the door to easy and annoying spoilers, which is why we will limit ourselves only to the incipit of the plot. We take on the role of Booker DeWitt, a private investigator with a murky past in the US Army where he participated in the Wounded Knee Massacre, the last bloody and uncivilized confrontation between the United States and the Native American Indians. We are in 1912 and hired by two mysterious figures, he will have to travel to Columbia, a flying city built by the USA but which has escaped its control and become independent after an undeclared clash with China, to recover a girl, Elizabeth, and thus settle a debt hanging over his head. The incredible technologically advanced city is controlled in a dictatorial way by a visionary prophet, Zachary Hale Comstock, considered a sort of divinity by the population and who keeps our target girl under surveillance. Columbia has only a facade of benevolence and do-gooders, given that a very few hours of play will be enough to realize the serious infighting that is raging, the attempted rebellion of the Vox Populi, an outlawed faction that seeks to restore dignity and freedom to the less well-off population, constantly trampled on by the city's wealthy white residents. There are many references to the racial segregation of black people, to the obtuse blindness caused by religious faith, and by addressing the story of BioShock Infinite it will very often happen to wonder about the past of our civilization and the plight of the disabled in the twenties of the last century . Sometimes one will also marvel at Irrational Software's ability to bring such complex and burning issues to the screen, with disarming ease and without any type of filter. Surely thanks to a maturity reached by the video game medium in recent years. Not going into more detail, it is enough to know that from a narrative point of view we can do nothing but praise the work of Levine and his team. The story is engaging, well narrated and populated by secondary characters of great charm who will follow us for most of the game, always entering and exiting the scene in a credible way. The plot closes perfectly with a fascinating ending that perhaps lacks coherence and does not reach the heights of the first BioShock. In short, the surprise effect that amazed every single player of the original chapter and that Infinite tries to pursue with some success is missing. If we really have to complain about this aspect of the game, we would like to point out the lack of depth of Songbird, the iconographic bird of the game that has accompanied this sequel since the day of its announcement and which is even the protagonist of the Collector's Edition. In reality we will meet him very little during our adventure, always and exclusively in scripted sequences and his figure remains too much in the background, failing in any way to gain charisma or personality, but rather resulting without a doubt the least successful character of the entire project . The other element that made us turn up our noses is represented by the audio diaries. Just like in BioShock, read more about itment of the story and key figures of Infinite is left to research and listen to these audio documents scattered throughout the levels. If the first BioShock had been appreciated for this form of narrative and the second chapter had almost bored us on this front, today it is really not tolerable to resort to this ploy again which adequately demonstrates its age. In these five years there have been many evolutions in the shooter narrative and still having these audio contributions to listen to while standing still made us turn up our noses. In terms of longevity, however, we are on more than acceptable levels: finishing it took us less than 13 hours rummaging in practically every single nook and cranny in search of money and equipment. However, it is possible that running straight to the point, perhaps at the easiest difficulty level (there are three plus a fourth unlockable once the game is completed and dedicated to more hardcore players, the so-called 1999 mode), it could take you just over 10 hours . It is also important to point out that Infinite is only and exclusively single player. But... it's BioShock! What was said above for the issue of audio diaries also applies in part to the gameplay. It is precisely in this area that BioShock Infinite suffers the most. In fact, it is difficult to notice the great steps forward compared to what was seen in the original title. Booker can carry two weapons in one hand at a time choosing from the usual arsenal of any self-respecting FPS: pistol, a couple of automatic machine guns, shotgun, rocket launcher and a couple of slightly more exotic weapons like a grenade launcher and some sort of crank-operated Vulcan. The other appendix is instead dedicated to the Vigor, new Plasmids, a series of special or magical powers, if you prefer, which are acquired during the game and consume salts (consider it the mana). On this front, the variety is great but those who have already played an exponent of the series will feel the taste of ~already seen~ strongly: we find the Vigor of possession to have a temporary ally, various powers to have electric or fire attacks and other more details such as the possibility of creating a magnetic shield to return shots fired at us to the sender, or Vigor to lift enemies into the air or stun them with the help of some summoned crows. The application of this paraphernalia therefore leads to rather classic fighting situations for the series with the various powers used to keep the most aggressive enemies at bay and then the use of firearms to take them out. The only real and strong innovation is represented by the rails that ~beautify~ some of the Columbia settings. In fact, our protagonist will be able to launch himself on them to get carried away by a special grappling hook and therefore perform in much more frenetic and convulsive clashes. Irrational's work at this juncture is in fact excellent: in a moment you will become familiar with the controls and it will be possible, for example, to fight with a couple of enemies, escape through the rail to breathe for a moment or to reach an elevated point, go down to fly, fire a few shots from a distance, then get back on the rails to charge full speed at an enemy to stun them with a melee shot. It's just a pity that Columbia is particularly stingy with areas populated by tracks and there won't be many fights so ~airy~ given that for most of the game we will find ourselves in indoor scenarios or not so vast as to allow the implementation of the rail system. The other great element of distinction of BioShock Infinite compared to the classic first-person shooters is represented by Elizabeth. For months we were amazed to see his reactions in the various demonstration videos released by the developer and listening to Ken Levine's words in the numerous interviews published on the net. In reality, the splendid girl, to be particularly simplistic, is nothing more than a discreet and clever helper who will accompany us for most of the journey. We have not noticed these incredible artificial intelligence routines to manage its behavior: during the fights it will limit itself to remaining hidden so as not to be in the way and to intervene to help us when we are about to run out of ammunition or life, also acting as a respawn point (limited) in case of premature death. Even its great power to open dimensional rifts in time and space is actually little more than a gameplay ploy to allow us to populate the scenario with shelters, ammunition or perhaps defense turrets. In fact, it will be enough to frame the alteration of the continuum that interests us, indicated with a black and white crack and pressand a key to make Elizabeth open it on the fly. At any time we will be able to open another one, always one at a time and even use a previously opened crack again even if it is destroyed or exhausted. In short, there is no limit to respawn on this front. Now we don't want to appear critical at all costs and in fact Elizabeth, in her always being by our side, underlining our behavior with expressions and sentences or filling the more relaxed moments of the game with her long dialogues with our protagonist, works in a very realistic also thanks to her stage presence, and it will take very few hours to become attached to her. However, once we enter into action or in more routine situations, such as opening doors and exploring the environments, we cannot fail to notice his continuous respawns at our side or precisely his automated presence to rush into our help. There's more? Wanting to further extend the discourse on artificial intelligence, we can only highlight a certain tendency of the enemies to remain very distant from us during the fight. Except for those armed only with melee weapons, for most of the fights we will be able to safely remain crouched behind a crate or hidden behind a corner without having the risk that someone will come to flush us out or start bombarding us from a distance with grenades or other weapons from launch, since they practically do not exist (again there is only one exception, represented by a type of enemy). A completely different matter when units enter the field, pass us the term, elite like the Patriot or the Handyman. In these situations, the fight takes on a huge tactical element, given that we will have to deal with extremely more resistant opponents, who have at their disposal a mouth of fire capable of hammering us at a distance or, as in the case of the Handyman, of superhuman abilities such as the possibility of reaching us with a single jump or of massacring us while we are running away using a rail, thanks to the possibility of electrically charging it. It is in these moments that BioShock Infinite manages to shake off its legacy and to offer something truly new, giving us back the same sensations, perhaps even greater, experienced on the occasion of the first meetings with the Big Daddies. Even with regard to the evolutions of the equipment, the similarities with the original chapter of the series are strong. During the adventure it will be possible to rummage through waste, enemies, furnishings and furnishings in search of ammunition, food and above all money essential to purchase the various weapon and Vigor upgrades from the vending machines scattered throughout the game area. There is great variety in this aspect and it will be practically impossible to buy everything on offer, forcing the player to spend wisely to pursue his fighting style, preferred weapons and most used powers. In Infinite we also find a barely sketched system of perks. In fact, scattered throughout the various levels we will find pieces of equipment separated into four slots (hat, jacket, trousers and shoes) that we will be able to collect and equip to receive various bonuses such as for example the possibility of spreading a Vigor applied to a killed opponent to surrounding enemies rather than the ability to stun the bad guys next to us when we land off a rail. It's just a pity that since it is a first-person shooter, we will never see any aesthetics on Booker, despite the fact that it is additional clothing and therefore everything is resolved on the choice of the most suitable equipment for the situation. In the most hidden areas of the scenario it is also possible to recover infusions which, when collected, will allow the amount of life, salt or shield at our disposal to be increased by one level (out of ten), effectively enhancing our resistance and versatility in battle. PC options Taking advantage of our PC test, we could not help but dedicate a purely technical box to BioShock Infinite. The title supports up to the latest version of DirectX, 11 and offers numerous technical options that guarantee adequate configurability to meet even the most dated machines. First of all, it is possible to use six different graphic presets and leave the settings configured in automatic; if instead you decide to go into detail it is possible to manually set the antialiasing, the detail and the texture filter, the quality of shadows and lights, the ambient occlusion and the amount of post-processing. There is also a setting to configure the level of detail of the objects that populate", "date": "2013-03-25", "grade": "9.1"}
