On Nintendo DS this means using the d-pad to move the view on the seabed, then touch the touch screen with the stylus on the object that we believe we have identified. Depending on the stage, a list shows us what we have to look for and automatically puts a mark on the objects we have already recovered. Sometimes we will have to deal with somewhat obscure lists, which for example ask us to find ~three work tools~, without specifying exactly what they are until we have already found some. Clearly we can't touch everything on the screen hoping for a stroke of luck: faced with this type of conduct, the game penalizes us by deducting points from the total. If we really can't find an object, however, in the lower part of the touch screen there is the ~help~ button, which once pressed will show us the area in which to search. To take advantage of this advantage again, however, we will have to wait for the relative bar to refill... Matter of numbers Incredible Adventures: The Lost Ruins boasts eighteen different settings, which basically tell the protagonist's journey in search of the ruins of an ancient Mayan temple. So we start from the airport and continue in the villages and in the forest, getting closer and closer to the target. In each scenario special objects are hidden that are used to access the five minigames right from the start screen, but finding them will be anything but easy. At the end of each stage we will have to try our hand at minigames: the ~game of couples~ sees us eliminate pairs of identical tiles after having turned them over on a board, therefore it is based on memory; the ~puzzle~ asks us precisely to compose an image by fitting the available pieces in the right way; the ~tile exchange~ sees us compose an image in turn, in this case by moving the tiles from one point to another; the ~mah jong~ is like the game of couples, but it is based on the typology of the objects rather than on their similarity; Finally, ~find the differences~ is a ~visual~ minigame in which you have to find the differences between two images. All these minigames certainly guarantee a pleasant extra challenge compared to the standard game... Mayan art The strong point of puzzle games with hidden objects has always been graphics, in the sense that you have to design backdrops that lend themselves well to this kind of game and in which objects can be placed in the most varied ways. In this sense, the new episode of Incredible Adventures is really excellent: the scenarios are beautiful to look at, very colorful but above all incredibly intricate. Finding hidden objects is not child's play, it requires observation and patience, but at the same time the satisfaction is great when you succeed. The setting flows smoothly when we move inside it using the d-pad, and the translation into Italian is almost always precise and punctual, helping us in our task. The music and effects surround without annoying and without leaving a mark. Incredible Adventures: The Lost Ruins therefore presents itself as an excellent puzzle game, to be bought with your eyes closed if you have a passion for this particular genre.", "date": "2009-09-17", "grade": null}
