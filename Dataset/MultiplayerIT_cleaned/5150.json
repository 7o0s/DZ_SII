Although we tend to be as objective as possible, when it comes to personal opinions it is always a losing battle, especially when dealing with stories that touch the heartstrings in different ways different. The Final Fantasy XV review could be one of the hardest ever written because we are not talking about a simple video game, but a real myth. Both we and many of our readers actually grew up with a project announced a good ten years ago which in the meantime has changed its title, direction and meaning. Today, Square Enix's latest effort also represents what works and doesn't work in today's video game market and any other medium: a constant search for compromises and meeting points between the artists' visions and the expectations of a fickle public which can spell the end of any franchise, regardless of its longevity. ~Dedicated to the fans and new friends of Final Fantasy,~ says the game itself with each load: victim of its own legend, Final Fantasy XV will divide even the ranks of fans who have followed its development for so long. In this long and articulated review we will try to explain to you what prompted us to assign it the vote we have chosen, however much that small amount may be worth: make yourself comfortable, the journey begins and we have a long way to go. We played Final Fantasy XV: find out in our review if it paid off ten years of waiting Playstation 4 trophies As a rule it shouldn't be particularly difficult to collect the 51 Final Fantasy XV trophies: in addition to platinum, there are 3 gold, 5 silver and 42 bronze. For example, you have to complete the campaign, finish the side missions and find all the ancestral weapons, but also unlock each skill and maximize the specific talents of the four heroes. The uncrowned king One would think first thought of a prince whose kingdom was invaded, whose father was murdered and whose fiance was killed - i.e., we know that Lunafreya survived the incursion of the Empire of Nifhleim because we have seen the movie Kingsglaive, but Noctis discovers only a few days later - both to fight tooth and nail in order to regain his throne and save his people. Instead, once he learns that he has to find the mausoleums where the ancestral weapons of his ancestors are kept, the young prince of Insomnia finds himself having to make a much more difficult choice: better play a game of Justice Monsters V in a roadside restaurant or go chasing Behemoth to cook the best noodles his friend Gladiolus has ever tasted? This is just one of the many fitting examples that we could do when we have to talk about the inconsistent plot of Final Fantasy XV which, in the first half of the game, becomes easy prey to an open world structure that is strongly desired but, perhaps, not very appropriate to the style and tenor of the narrative. Everyone knows the story of the game by now, also because in recent years Square Enix has bombarded us with trailers, advertisements and multimedia insights: Noctis leaves for a sort of ~on the road~ bachelor party together with his three best friends, but meanwhile the Empire of Nifhleim attacks and invades the capital, forever changing the life of the prince who, out of the blue, is forced to take on the responsibilities of a king despite being completely unprepared. At this point the plot is divided into fourteen chapters divided through a main mission which is accompanied by a myriad of secondary missions that we can undertake during the journey and complete at any time: it is the problem of the open world in which the player decides the pace of history, constantly postponing its development. It feels a little strange to see Noctis and co. camping around a fire and playing King's Knight, a mobile app, while their people suffer and wait for the return of a selfie-taking king, but it's a compromise that has to be made. accept in compliance with a structure which, in any case, from the point of view of gameplay works properly. At first glance, Final Fantasy XV resembles titles such as The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt or Xenoblade Chronicles X. The player can explore the world of Eos on foot, aboard the Regalia or on the back of Chocobos; only natural barriers contain it, which can be lakes that are too deep or mountains that are too high to climb. Side quests incentivize you to visit every corner of a map that hides treasures and resources to collectto pick out, monsters to hunt, and breathtaking vistas that Prompto is sure to capture with his camera. Final Fantasy XV is not a dispersive open world in which to enter in search of something to do; in some ways the exploration is also quite guided, since most of the optional missions - such as the hunts for wanted monsters - are offered to us in the refreshment points along the highways and in the few but large cities that we will have the opportunity to visit. In Final Fantasy XV there are some that can take us by surprise while we explore a new area of the map, but the Square Enix title avoids leaving the players to themselves, seeking from the outset a compromise between open world and linearity that is also expressed and above all in the limitations of the Regalia. Noctis' car can be driven manually or entrusted to his friend Ignis but, in any case, the player's control is limited to acceleration and braking: you can change lanes and go against traffic, if you want, but once you let go the joypad is the game itself to put us back on track, avoiding making us collide with the other cars that sporadically travel the streets of Eos. It's a somewhat strange solution because the Regalia can be damaged with each accident and repaired in the garage of Cindy, the niece of the Cid on duty who, among other things, will allow us to decorate and customize it as we like, also offering us some missions to enhance its engine or improve its endurance. The Regalia is also the only means that allows instantaneous movements, but only if we have already discovered the parking lots and the paths that separate us from any destinations. Otherwise, we can let Ignis drive us to our destination and enjoy the view during journeys that can last up to ten minutes: if the four friends have nothing to say to each other, we can always turn on the radio and start playing music CDs with the soundtracks of previous Final Fantasy games. Lovers of road trips and exploration might appreciate the ability to passively look around without risking being attacked by monsters - but only during the day, because at night the streets are filled with hostile daemons - but we're pretty sure many players will prefer to wander around riding their Chocobo or cutting through woods and forests, despite the ambushes of monsters and imperials. The last stop Around chapter 9 something changes. Noctis and his friends reach the city of Altissia and it closes with the open world from then on. Also because calling it ~world~ is an exaggeration: to be clear, if you have seen the various trailers then you have already seen every explorable region, because they are only those of Leide, Duscae and Cleigne. The others, like the one in Accordo, lend themselves to a fleeting visit or little more. Despite the generous size of the three maps in the kingdom of Lucis, we felt a certain feeling of incompleteness: in this Final Fantasy you can't explore the whole world even when the Regalia puts its wings, and the reason is always the compromises. The second part of the game forces Noctis and his friends to follow an extremely linear process; the last six chapters offer a series of scenarios and sequential fights interspersed with cinematics that give the story that extra edge it had lacked up to that moment, making it culminate in an ending that will cause much discussion - we are realistically at the levels of Lost - but which we, for our part, found absolutely splendid and courageous. It's all about framing this story which is lacking in the first chapters and which in the last ones trudges a bit around a couple of themes that Square Enix has perhaps suggested too sibylline. First of all we have that of friendship that binds the protagonists, four poor people who over the years have been defined as a boyband of Japanese jocks and who instead turned out to be among the most interesting heroes ever proposed in a Final Fantasy. Beautifully characterized through the dialogues and their interactions before, after and during fights, it is practically impossible not to become attached to the idiosyncrasies of Prompto, Ignis and Gladiolus. The sense of camaraderie that is established immediately between the four ~warriors of light~ embraces the player and does not let go until the end, tearing tears and smiles. And then there's Noctis, the somewhat grumpy protagonist who follows a complicated and treacherous path to become king. Final Fantasy XV is his story, that of a prince who, before taking back the throne, must understand what it really means to be a king since sovereigns, even before commanding, must above all protect their subjects. From this point of view, the misadventuresby Noctis take on an important meaning that explodes especially in the final bars, when every piece of the mosaic finally falls into place. Before, however, the script gives the strong impression of having been reworked many times, shredded here and there, then pasted a little clumsily to adapt to the hybrid structure of the gameplay. Some interesting supporting characters enjoy less time than they would have needed to fuel: not only does this apply to allies such as General Cor or Gladio's sister Iris, but it is especially the case for important antagonists such as Ravus or Emperor Aldercap , less present than the trailers have suggested. The story revolves around one of the most convincing and hateful villains in the history of the franchise since the timeless Kefka Pallazzo of Final Fantasy VI, and this is a great compliment to the stakes, pace of selfies and noodles, but the fact remains that the story of Final Fantasy XV - which can be completed in about thirty hours with the minimum union of secondary missions - would have needed a broader scope, not a feature film or a complementary cartoon miniseries. The most sacrificed character, from this point of view, is Lunafreya, Noctis' betrothed who has more space in the film Kingsglaive than she has in the game; however we would have liked to know better the background of the Siderei, the capricious deities that Noctis must subjugate during the adventure, or the mercenaries in the pay of Aranea Highwind, the sensual dragoon. Ultimately, we had the clear feeling that the departure - or the removal? - by Tetsuya Nomura and the transformation of Final Fantasy Versus XIII into Final Fantasy XV have thrown into chaos a script that has only partially survived the original draft and of which Hajime Tabata was able to pick up the threads only in that linear part in which it was necessary to navigate less between story and gameplay: when you learn that it is possible to go back in time in dreams to complete the optional missions left unfinished in the open world, it is clear that the developers of Final Fantasy XV have been trapped for years in a skein that they have not been able to fully unravel. Weapons and spells Putting aside the strengths and weaknesses of the narrative for a moment, it is important to remember one of the main philosophies underlying Final Fantasy as a franchise: each episode should represent a different experience from the previous ones and the watchword should be ~experiment~. It is a doctrine that Square Enix has followed above all in recent years, when the generalization of the market and Western contaminations have led to a whole series of revolutions that Final Fantasy purists have accepted out of love or out of curiosity. In this sense, Final Fantasy XV represents arguably the most important and courageous experiment of all, especially in the way it distances itself from its predecessors. Let's leave the open world alone, which in their own way have already explored the two MMORPGs Final Fantasy XI and Final Fantasy XIV: here the fighting mechanics immediately catch the eye, worthy daughters of the Kingdom Hearts conceived by the former director Tetsuya Nomura . This is probably the pillar on which the Square Enix team built the entire game, an indisputable cornerstone from the beginning: Final Fantasy XV was meant to be an action RPG first and foremost and Final Fantasy XV, in fact, is a great nice action RPG. The merit is above all of the combat system: fun, frenetic and rewarding, easy to learn but difficult to master. Perfect? No, but it is important to state that the first few hours of the game could give the wrong impression. The first problem with which we must come to terms is the camera which struggles to keep up with the action: Noctis's rapid and convulsive movements constantly decentralize it, forcing us to control it manually while we navigate between the various keys that dictate the law in combat. Between Noctis teleporting from point to point, his three or four companions battling, and enemies that can number as many as ten, it's hard to keep your focus without getting confused. Over the hours, the situation improves and you begin to get used to it: projecting from one point of the battlefield to another becomes second nature, as well as changing weapons on the fly using the directional cross while grappling with the enemy, changing attack and you dodge incoming blows. The fact that it is enough to hold down the attack button to ring the combos should not be seen as a point against the technicality since it does not affect any mod", "date": "2016-11-28", "grade": "9.0"}
