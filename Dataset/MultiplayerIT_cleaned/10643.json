{"name": "L'FPS definitivo per Wii?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/68868-the-conduit-lfps-definitivo-per-wii.html", "text": "The developers of High Voltage Software certainly expressed a common opinion when they declared that the current Wii titles do not make the best use of (understatement) the technical capabilities of the Nintendo console. Their much talked about FPS, The Conduit, therefore sets itself the goal of showing everyone what is possible to do with a good graphics engine and a pinch of talent. Well, did this relatively inexperienced team really manage to achieve ~incredible~ results? Well, we will reveal the mystery in the usual paragraph on the technical implementation. Now is the time to briefly introduce what is the plot of the game: the character we control is the special agent Ford, in charge of recovering a device called DIVA (Intelligent Device for Alternative Vision) from the clutches of a secret organization that calls itself ~The Cartel~. The operation goes well, but things take a turn for the worse when Ford discovers that this time the threat is not represented by a simple terrorist group, but by the alien species of Arachnids. Our alter-ego will therefore have to review their plans and trust the mysterious Prometheus, until then indicated to him as the enemy to defeat. Arms and baggage One of the strengths of The Conduit is certainly represented by the arsenal at our disposal. The weapons are divided between human and alien ones, with further variations obtainable when we come across the eye symbol that represents the game, and which must be ~activated~ using the DIVA to open the door that leads to a secret room. We will have at our disposal an ordinance pistol, the most classic of shotguns, machine guns of various power and precision as well as rifles for shooting from a distance; but also ray guns, plasma cannons and other instruments of death that are very reminiscent of what was seen in Halo, a series which The Conduit is clearly inspired by (see also the verses issued by some enemies). To move and shoot we have to use the Wii-mote / Nunchuck combination in the most classic of ways: the analog stick to move the character, the infrared pointer to control the viewfinder and the view, the B trigger to open fire and the button A to jump. The d-pad is used to quickly turn 180 degrees (up), change the type of grenade equipped (left), change the equipped weapon (right) and operate the zoom (down), which depending on the rifle we can use to shoot with greater accuracy, perhaps to eliminate opponents with a headshot. Grenades are thrown by waving the Nunchuck, while moving the Wii-mote deep (in a ~stab~ fashion) results in an effective shot with the rifle butt. The C button is used to crouch, while holding down the Z button activates a lock-on on the enemy in our viewfinder. To reload the weapon, press the ~-~ key, whereas the ~+~ key is used to use the DIVA in combination with the B trigger. Unfortunately, it is not possible to run. Around Washington The action is spread over nine stages in which our Mr. Ford faces an entire army of human and alien enemies of all sizes. The structure is typical of first person shooters, without innovative ideas and without any ~impact~ gimmick as regards the direction. The level design, in particular, unfortunately appears dull and uninspired, with often repetitive locations and very limited interactivity: apart from some explosive crates (which fall apart with a terribly poor graphic effect...), our bursts they will scratch anything. While missing the obnoxious infinite respawn, several combat sequences in The Conduit they closely resemble Killzone 2 for the need to move quickly, take advantage of cover and eliminate enemies as soon as they are within range. The fact is that the two products have very different AI, and in High Voltage's FPS opponents often get lost in a teacup, placing themselves in front of a wall without worrying about the damage suffered. In short, there are very difficult sections more for a mere matter of numerical inferiority than for the strategy applied by the enemy. The DIVA, just as one would expect, allows us to see what is normally hidden from our eyes: ancillary elements such as secret messages but also booby traps to be neutralized, in addition to the aforementioned ~eye~ doors (which must be opened surpassing a simple minigame each time). The device is also used to deactivate the security systems that regulate the opening of certain doors, therefore it is essential to complete the stages: often we will have to turn near the walls waiting for the DIVA to start making sounds to understand that nearby there isit's a switch to interact with. Online multiplayer As a good next-generation FPS, The Conduit offers online multiplayer for up to twelve players simultaneously and three modes: Free-for-All, Team Reaper and Team Objectives. In the first, of course, you choose a character and aim to eliminate all the other players, the second is the classic team deathmatch and the third uses classic gimmicks such as ~capture the flag~. The game supports Wii Speak for voice chat, and features a match-finding system that can be adjusted to work only with friends, on a regional or worldwide basis. Unfortunately on the Wii you can't tell if a friend is online without making an agreement first, but the fact remains that an excellent job has been done for The Conduit, with almost lag-free games and a good number of options to liven up the game. action (the choice of weapons, for example). Technical realization So, does The Conduit boast graphics so advanced that it would make any Wii title obsolete? Well... no. The textures are decidedly ~oldgen~ in terms of quality and definition, and the almost total lack of interactive elements in the scenarios only reiterates a concept: evidently, you can't do more than that. The graphics engine is robust and almost always manages to guarantee excellent fluidity, a pity for the more confusing situations in which the frame rate misses a few shots. The special effects in general are not surprising, apart from a good realization of the water (little exploited, however). The locations, as mentioned above, are often repetitive and leave no mark. Even the view of Washington at sunset, after a battle consumed indoors, fails to be as evocative as it would like due to technical limitations. And finally there is a style problem: the design of the aliens in most cases is trivial, it tastes like ~already seen~ and the polygonal models are not surprising for either the details or the animations. The music is generally of good quality, often spot on for the action shown on screen, while the effects could have been done with something more. The dialogues, in English (subtitled in Italian), show a passable level of acting.", "date": "2009-07-10", "grade": "7.2"}
