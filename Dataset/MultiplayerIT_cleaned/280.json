{"name": "Top Spin 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/top-spin-2-recensione-2.html", "text": "The CA factor We PC fans have good memories of Top Spin: either because Sega made some hideous conversions of the two Virtua Tennis (at the level of those of Capcom), or because it's always nice to see a thick title like this converted, we can safely say that yes it is one of the best titles belonging to this genre (oh well, it's true, there aren't many... and it's also true that lovers of the more hardcore simulations have continued to prefer Tennis Master Series 2003) and, certainly, the best of those released lately. But how is this Top Spin 2? the first impression is only discreet, unfortunately, with menus that repeat themselves and, above all, with a configurability not worthy of the machine on which the game is running The CA factor The first impression is only discreet, unfortunately, with menus that repeat themselves and, above all, with a configurability not worthy of the machine on which the game is running. Few options (especially on a visual level which, as we know, is the crucial node around which the possibility of running a video game on your computer is based decently) quite generic, which do not give you the possibility of going to scale deeply , if necessary, the graphics engine or to remove unwanted effects even if your configuration is able to support them. After the first negative impact with the CA factor (it stands for approximate conversion) let's go and see if everything promised is there. So, let's leaf through the menus a bit. Yes, the four modes are there (Exhibition, Career, Party and Multiplayer), the 24 real players licensed for the game too (and they are also done quite well, both in models and animations), the 19 fields scattered around the world have answered the call in short, the numbers are all there. Let's see if they also have some substance behind them. The CA factor We play the first game in exhibition mode, which allows you to enter the field quickly and without too many headaches, using the preconfigured players. As in the previous episode, this mode allows you to play against pro players set to maximum difficulty. This means that, for newbies, these are games off limits, given that the opponents are really difficult. From a first game in which we were ruthlessly destroyed, we were still able to verify a couple of things: the first is that, compared to the previous episode, some balancing problems have been fixed so players got caught off guard with extreme ease (even at the highest levels), which made the game more accessible but also very repetitive in some phases (more on that later); the second is that the CA factor has struck again, since the graphics engine is quite poorly programmed and suffers from some rather serious flaws (we'll talk about this later too). Basic issues Before continuing to talk about the graphics engine, let's deal with the question of the control system. Unfortunately, all those who hate joypads and the like will be disappointed, because Top Spin 2 manages to give its best with one of these infernal gadgets (the Xbox 360 controller is ideal for playing ... but all the other similar ones are fine too). DualShock) resulting instead quite uncomfortable to play with the keyboard. This is mostly due to the key combinations needed to make advanced shots. Nothing very complicated, for heaven's sake, but sometimes you risk the octopus effect. Basic issues But let's go back to the game and examine its main mode: Career. As the name suggests, in this mode we will have to take a sack of potatoes (generated through a very complete editor that allows you to customize practically every aspect...) who has bought a racket from a Brazilian junk dealer and we will have to try to make him the number 1 player in the world, making him earn sponsors and money and, above all, getting him to marry a tissue... oh well, not that. Initially the skills of our alter ego (man or woman) will be limited, but as the training sessions go by (practically subgames not even vaguely inspired by those seen in Virtua Tennis) and matches (you start with tournaments played on second order, to get to play top-level tournaments or special events on the most prestigious courses in the world) they can be improved to face increasingly difficult matches. In all of this, our task will be to win as many matches as possible, in order to climb the world rankings and ensure the best in terms of equipment and training. It is interesting to note how importance has been given to the coach, the central figure who will determine which characteristics pcan be improved to the maximum; in fact, each trainer that can be hired will be specialized in certain sectors and will allow you to reach the maximum level (the fifth) only in one. Obviously, if you want to train to the fullest in other characteristics, you will need to hire another coach, sacking the current one and so on. Basic issues The party mode mimics the genre of party games (Mario Party above all), so popular on consoles, offering challenges for multiple players with various types of subgames. Fun if you have a few friends available, but a mode that can essentially be overlooked. Finally, the multiplayer mode is the ability to play online with players from all over the world (what did you expect?). Unfortunately, since we received the game before it was released in stores, we found the servers deserted and we could not verify any lag problems. But how is it on the pitch? Comfortable, definitely. Joking aside, those who have already enjoyed the first chapter of the series will find themselves at home, given that the gameplay is very similar. In reality, the control system is identical, with its four standard shots and the same number of enhanced shots (which are performed by pressing another key simultaneously with the first ones), accompanied this time by some special shots. These combinations allow you to make all the classic shots of this noble and fascinating sport and their variations (forehand, backhand, volley, smash, drop shot, top spin, plus various others that we won't list for encyclopaedic decency). those who have already enjoyed the first chapter of the series will find themselves at home But how is it on the pitch? The game action has remained dynamic and pleasant, with quick and precise exchanges that become, in some cases, truly spectacular. The possibility of specialization of tennis players then allows them to face matches in a personal way, perhaps becoming very strong in a single field leaving out the others, or trying to balance all the characteristics without excelling in any. But how is it on the pitch? We said above that improvements have also been made at the AI level and, finally, some holes have been ~closed~ which allowed you to win matches by repeating certain movements ad nauseam. Of course, some naiveties remain, but the overall situation has definitely improved and, finally, the slower but more powerful players will not be completely at the mercy of the fast players as was the case in the past. Is it all gold? All this idyllic picture is partially spoiled by some frankly avoidable problems. How not to mention the very long loading times even on machines equipped with 2 GB of ram? Tried on a computer with 1GB the situation got a lot worse. Frankly, we don't understand what causes such slowness which is very annoying especially between the training phases which are rather quick to carry out. In some moments we spent more time spinning the globe with descriptions of the locations where game tournaments take place (it's an extra that appears during uploads), than actually playing. the long journey that separates a newly created brocco from a player capable of competing among the greats is punctuated by the need to train continuously Is it all gold? Another big flaw is the lack of shots: during the game you can only select two (the classic one from above, and a second one from behind the player) which are not sufficient to meet all the needs that the player may have . It would have been appropriate to add a few more, since it shouldn't be a big problem to do so and we don't understand why limiting ourselves to just two. The shots allow us to talk about the third major flaw of Top Spin 2: the heaviness of the graphics engine already mentioned above. In short, the three-dimensional models are excellent and seeing even the t-shirts animated in an excellent way can be nice... but seeing the framerate drop, especially if you select the shadows, at 8/9 FPS or seeing it hesitant even with all the effects deactivated (the system on which it was tested is a P4 at 3.4 GHz with a GeForce 7800 GT and 2 GB of ram), quite annoyed, especially in the face of some questionable choices such as inserting a strong blur that makes the game visually buttery ( maybe you wanted to hide some bad texture?) Is it all gold? But we left the worst for last, and it concerns the career mode. The long journey that separates a newly created pitcher from a player capable of competing among the greats is punctuated by the need to train continuously. Nothing wrong, you say unfortunately the system designed by Indie Built forputs you to face only one event for each period and, therefore, if you choose to train (an obligation, especially at the beginning) you will lose the tournaments or special events. Unfortunately, training is necessary due to a slightly confusing balance of tournaments: in some of the theoretically simpler ones, you risk meeting very strong tennis players able to beat an untrained character without too many problems. In short: either you train (speeding up the improvement process) or you participate in tournaments (earning money and fame). This cumbersomeness is not good for the game and gives the player the perception of risking losing something, especially when you see entire seasons go by where you had to constantly choose what to try your hand at. It wouldn't have hurt to split the two phases (training and competitions) so as not to overlap them and to make them selectable separately at any time... which was the system used successfully in the first chapter. Conclusions It is not possible to define Top Spin 2 bad but it is clear that we did not really like some choices made by the developers and, above all, some defects could have been easily avoided. However, there is no doubt that the tennis genre is going through, at least on PC, a period of severe leanness (not counting some well-made shareware products) and that the Indie Built product manages to fill this hole that has existed for two years (i.e. from the first Top Spin not counting some bad titles released in the meantime). To conclude, it could have been done better with little, but we have to settle for it. Pros Excellent playability Good control system Definitely long-lived Cons Badly set career mode Graphically heavy A few more shots would have been nice History of transfers The first Top Spin managed to shake the throne of Sega's Virtua Tennis by becoming the direct competitor with more credentials. The Xbox version obtained unanimous acclaim which decreed its success. The PC version, while maintaining the same characteristics and the same playability, was afflicted by some problems due to the conversion from the console version but it was still a very good product and certainly indispensable for simulated tennis lovers. Now, after a troubled period in which the developers have disbanded (PAM guys it's not a supermarket chain, don't make that face) due to the premature death of the XSN (Xbox Sports Network) project, due to agreements between Microsoft and EA, where the brand remained vacant, took 2 and took it over, giving it new life. First of all, the original was also converted for PlayStation 2, then the sequel was commissioned to the newborn software house, Indie Built, formed by many of PAM's exiles, in order to enrich the nascent and very promising line of sports video games of Take 2. From all this chaos, worthy of a night spent with Rubbini naked and drunk in Trafalgar Square, Top Spin 2 was born which, after being released for Xbox 360, GBA and DS, has finally landed on our hard discs, ready to amaze us with special effects and ultra-vivid colours.", "date": "2006-11-13", "grade": null}
