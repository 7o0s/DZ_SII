The work was entrusted to Dimps Corporation, which on the Nintendo laptop had already had the opportunity to work with Super Monkey Ball 3D and Sonic Generations, indeed not obtaining exciting results: let's see, therefore, if this new title can represent a positive turning point not only for the hedgehog blue, but also for the Japanese team. Same and different As expected, Sonic Lost World on 3DS not only shares the same title with the Wii U version, but also offers the same offer in terms of settings and story. With regard to this last aspect, it cannot necessarily be said that it is a positive factor, given that the story behind the adventure is extremely thin as per the tradition of the house, moreover narrated through an immoderate quantity of films characterized above all by a poor visual quality resulting from excessive compression. Excluding this, Sonic Lost World at first seems serious about positioning itself as a real younger brother of the product developed on Wii U, putting on the plate a gameplay offer substantially similar to that proposed by Sonic Team. Each of the seven scenarios is therefore divided into four levels that alternate different playful perspectives, which are often mixed even in the context of a single stage. Alongside segments that pay homage to the origins of the series by proposing an action that develops on a two-dimensional level, we therefore find other solutions that contribute to giving a good structural variety to the title. The most convincing are those that briefly trace the experience of Nintendo with Super Mario Galaxy, with Sonic wandering around on some species of planetoids that can be explored at 360 degrees, capable of offering stimulating exploratory cues and also of satisfying the eye thanks to a undoubtedly remarkable technical achievement. Then there are sections that push more on speed and quick reflexes, with the camera moving behind the protagonist busy darting along paths paved with enemies, rings, trampolines and so on. The parts inspired by the most classic styles of three-dimensional platformers close the roundup, with Sonic having to move within open scenarios defeating his opponents and solving environmental puzzles and various skill tests: this is undoubtedly the least successful component of the whole package, due to a very uninspired design that is based on hackneyed ideas - when not exactly ill-conceived - which however clash with the much more dynamic approach adopted by the rest of the production. If the first part of the adventure still flows away honestly, without highlighting great merits but not even macroscopic defects, the second half of Sonic Lost World denotes a drastic deterioration of all the elements put in place by the developers, causing the title to slide towards a condition of absolute mediocrity from which he will unfortunately never be able to recover. Sonic Lost World on 3DS has good intentions, but betrayed by an unsatisfactory implementation 3D effect Even if the sense of depth recreated by the developers is quite convincing, playing Sonic Lost World in 3D certainly causes more harm than good, especially in the faster stages characterized by rapid shot changes. Then the activation of the slider during the interlude films is completely inadvisable, dramatically poorly defined and not optimized to be enjoyed in three dimensions. Once upon a time Sonic Leading to a truly questionable choice, in fact, as the stages progress, they rely less and less on the characteristics of speed and frenzy typical of the series to embrace a terribly unsuccessful experimental component. So you end up spending far too much time tackling boring environmental puzzles or transforming into a whole series of bizarre creatures by exploiting the powers of the Wisps, contending with an unsatisfactory control system, a schizophrenic camera and confusing level design that showcases amnesia and sometimes even serious naivety. To make matters worse, a completely off balance of difficulty intervenes, with incredibly frustrating sections often placed in the final parts of longer levels and forcing the user to repeat the entire scenario all over again if they lose all their lives. The technical component of Sonic Lost World also givesthe impression of degrading as the adventure continues: therefore the solid graphic realization that distinguishes the first stages soon leaves room for bare and uninspired settings, sometimes even afflicted by macroscopic clipping defects and frame rate drops. Considering how the developers have not been able to properly refine the game structure of the title, it is not surprising to note that even the surrounding elements show obvious problems. This is the case of the bonus levels, characterized by an approximate exploitation of the gyroscope, but also of the crafting component that forms the background to the action: by completing the levels, in fact, you get resources that can be used by Tails in his laboratory to build power -ups or RC airplanes for use in the game or for sending to the Wii U version of Sonic Lost World. Everything is beautifully deprived of any form of tutorial, leaving the user perplexed in the face of dynamics whose usefulness is difficult to understand and which precisely prove to be completely incapable of enriching the playful experience in any way. Paradoxically, there would even be room for an interesting multiplayer component, characterized by two-player races that can be enjoyed both locally and online, but penalized like all the rest of the production by a chronic lack of care. In short, Sonic Lost World fails to give substance to a mass of content that would certainly have been considerable, if only the developers had taken care to work more on the value of the offer than on its mere quantitative aspect.", "date": "2013-10-18", "grade": "5.0"}
