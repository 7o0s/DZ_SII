{"name": "Flower - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/flower-recensione.html", "text": "Having overcome the impasse and sterility of the first months of life, Sony's PSN on PS3 is finally starting to mesh above all by favoring the offer of alternative titles, far from the schemes and constraints imposed by marketing and cold numbers; if therefore products such as The Last Guy and Noby Noby Boy would probably have been destined for the basket of games on sale if sold in a classic way, through online distribution instead they find space and a market. And within a particularly intriguing beginning of 2009, this Flower also slips in, a work created by thatgamecompany and purchasable on PSN at a cost of 7.99 euros. Say it with a flower Zen experience, alternative product, unconventional game; many ways to describe Flower, but which are hardly able to represent exactly what is in front of you once you hold the pad. What you are definitely NOT faced with is a conventional title based on objectives or scores to obtain, dangers to avoid and challenging passages to face. There is no game over or the concept of defeat. Instead Flower is so simple that it does not require tutorials, text screens, key configurations or options menus; just select one of the flower pots, each tied to a level, to be transported inside it. Very little passes between the experimentation phase and that of total gameplay control, because all you have to do is tilt the dual shock 3 (or sixaxis of course) to take advantage of its much-maligned detection sensor, finally used in a sensible way and not forced. This interface determines the direction of the wind, which will then start blowing as soon as any key is pressed. And precisely the wind, a constant and robust breath, allows the player to carry the flower petals, to be collected in ever greater numbers by crossing the settings and going to pass right on the multicolored plants scattered within them. That's all? Almost, because in reality there is a purpose; going to reach different areas in which to bring back, thanks to one's passage, colors and flora that have obviously disappeared. The strong ecological theme that supports Flower is suggested by the short intermezzo sequences, which describe a modern metropolis where concrete and smog have practically suppressed every expression of free and uncontaminated nature. The player is therefore highlighted the saddest and grayest expression of man's work as opposed to the Earth's possibility of revenge, with the incredible energy it transmits; in fact, the delicacy of a simple petal is enough, the one with which each level begins, to explode an apotheosis of colors and scents (obviously only imagined, but so real as to be perceivable) in a bombastic and emotionally engaging colorful crescendo. The result is a relaxing but at the same time anything but boring experience, on the contrary engaging and sincerely exciting; despite the lack of real incentives in repeating the levels or deepening their exploration, with the exception of the trophies whose presence, however, clashes a bit with the product philosophy, simply the pleasure of playing is more than sufficient, supported by a technical component really lush. Each of the seven levels available has a different theme, and going through them all takes no more than a couple of hours; the brevity is probably Flower's only real flaw, but one willingly overlooks it when faced with such an artistically successful and coherent product. The thousands of blades of grass that move caressed by the wind, the use of colors, the poetry of the settings really fill the eyes and the heart, as well as the fabulous interactive musical accompaniment that is enriched and modified as you collect the several petals. Comment Flower is truly one of the best titles available on Sony's PSN. With thatgamecompany's product, Ps3 finds a splendid expression of the capabilities of the motion sensor of its much-maligned controller and a robust testimony to the great technical virtues of the Cell processor. But Flower is above all a work of great value in its own right, poetic , delicate and incredibly engaging. Or more correctly, Flower is beautiful. A simple adjective, but which reflects the simplicity of a product that we would like to recommend unreservedly to anyone able to appreciate it.
