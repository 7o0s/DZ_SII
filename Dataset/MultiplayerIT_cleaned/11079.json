{"name": "Disaster: Day of Crisis - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/disaster-day-of-crisis-recensione.html", "text": "An unexpected disaster With a rare but not unprecedented ~European~ choice, Nintendo has chosen to guarantee the Old Continent the exclusivity with regard to the marketing of the product in the West; in fact, for the USA we are talking about 2009, even if Fils-Aime does not seem to have the intention of betting much on this Disaster on US soil. A series of therefore not very comforting premises that would lead to prematurely labeling the Monolith title as a mediocre game if not to be forgotten. On the contrary Day of Crisis, while certainly not revealing itself to be a masterpiece of the caliber of the great Nintendo pearls, represents a pleasant surprise and -no less important- goes to flesh out the otherwise rather dry ranks of dedicated Wii products, or at least suitable for that famous ~hardcore~ audience that seems to feel abandoned by the big N. The substance of Disaster basically goes back to the 3 game styles that make it up: a third-person adventure, a first-person shooter on tracks ~like Time Crisis~ and a racing game. The protagonist is Ray, a former member of the International Rescue Team, a sort of organization specializing in rescue in extreme situations; just during a mission on the edge of an erupting volcano, Ray witnesses the death of his brotherly friend Steve. A tragedy that shakes him particularly leaving him in apathy, until the moment when a group of terrorists kidnaps Steve's sister thus forcing his return to action. It is a pity that, in a sort of Fantozzian and incredible apotheosis of bad luck, a series of natural catastrophes such as earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, landslides and so on are added to this problem which force the young protagonist to recall his own original attitudes, thus also dedicating to the rescue of citizens in need. This is basically the objective of the third-person adventure section, in which you have to go through the various levels using the nunchuck cross to move Ray and the keys to interact with settings and characters. The goal is basically to lend a hand to the wounded; once identified through a kind of ~intuition~ available to the protagonist, you will be called to solve a variety of mini-games through which to clean wounds, splint fractures, practice cardiac massage and so on. An excellent variety that is enhanced by the shooter sections, which occur on various occasions along the various missions and which require a completely different approach, very similar to Time Crisis as already mentioned; by pointing the Wiimote at the screen it is necessary to eliminate a whole series of enemies, taking care to take cover behind whatever is suitable for the purpose and reloading in order not to run out of ammunition. There are several firearms with different characteristics, which can be purchased or upgraded between levels thanks to the points earned. The last big section of the game is the one represented by the driving sections, in which by holding the Wiimote horizontally you have to escape from dangerous situations aboard different vehicles. Disazutaaaa When just described, it helps to give Day of Crisis a typical American disaster movie feeling, with the hero alone against everyone and always ready to face an escalation of situations to the limit of human possibilities. Unfortunately the script, especially as regards the dialogues, is more often found in the field of trashy b-movies, not to mention (in this case involuntarily) comic films; trivial, flat and obvious, the plot proves to be completely incapable of giving a sense of realism to the events. But precisely because of this absurd and over the top setting, typically of ~Japanese doing Americans~, for some reason Disaster turns out to be really fun, hilarious and engaging. He tries to take himself seriously without success, and is so ~ignorant~ as to be irresistible. But how does the gameplay work? Pretty good, really. Without a doubt if we were to imagine games entirely based on the individual sections of this Nintendo production, none of them would reach the sufficiency. The third-person adventure is plagued by woody and not very modern controls, the shooter has an outdated mechanics and which in the long run can only be repetitive, while at the wheel of the vehicles, despite the wiimote working more than satisfactorily in In this context, one can come across frustrating sections that have to be repeated a few times before having a positive outcome. But it is precisely the idea of mixing everything together that allows Disaster to remain fresh and fun, prompting the player to turn a blind eye to most of the defects just mentioned. It is the classic example of a game where everything is betterthe sum of the individual parts. As for the technical component, Monolith's fatigue suffers above all from the limits of the console, attributable to the low resolution of the textures and the lack of cleanliness of the image. The settings are in fact in most cases well done and full of details, and the dynamism linked to the continuous succession of disasters of all kinds brings with it a great level of spectacularity. Too bad for the animations, decidedly from the older generation, which clash with the good modeling of the characters, Ray in the lead. The sound could have been definitely better; apart from the hilarious dialogues (in English subtitled in Italian), some effects turn out to be really bad, above all the noise of the car engine in the driving sections. On the other hand, the musical accompaniment is positive, capable of following the action in a convincing way. Comment Disaster: Day of Crisis is an unexpected and pleasant product that probably no one will buy, thanks to a mechanic and an atmosphere that is now far from the attitudes of the Nintendo console and dejected by an almost non-existent advertising boost. A real pity since the effort of Monolith Soft, although not without flaws, often manages to turn a blind eye to its shortcomings in the face of a varied, engaging and fun gameplay, well supported by a plot so trashy as to be irresistible. Pros Variegated and fun gameplay Wonderfully trashy plot More than decent longevity Cons Mechanics always imperfect Graphically improveable Sound effects often bad", "date": "2008-11-07", "grade": null}
