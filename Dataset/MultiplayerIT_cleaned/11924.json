{"name": "Half-Life 2: Episode Two - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/half-life-2-episode-two-recensione.html", "text": "Orange Box The Orange Box is THE ultimate package for Xbox 360 and PC (a PS3 version is also planned, but will be released later and we don't know if it will contain any extras due to the delay). By purchasing it, you take home the following titles: Half-Life 2 (Review - Score: 10) Half-Life 2: Episode One (Review - Score: 8.7) Half-Life 2: Episode Two (Review - Score: 9.2) Team Fortress 2 (Review - Score: 9.0) Portal (Review - Score: 8.5) In addition to the ~major~ products, the package contains several Extras including Half-Life 2: The Lost Coast, an additional level released for free by Valve a few months later the release of Half-Life 2 in stores and Peggle Extreme, a fun puzzle game from Popcap Games capable of captivating for a few hours with its extremely ~casual~ gameplay (you have to throw a ball hoping it hits the various buffers distributed for levels). The product is available in PC and Xbox 360 versions. Note for the PC version: Anyone who has previously purchased Half-Life 2 or Half-Life 2: Episode One can give a copy to anyone, as long as the recipient does not already have the two games registered on Steam. The procedure to follow is explained by Valve itself (look in the package sheet). For the rest, the quality of the titles speaks for itself: Half-Life 2 and Team Fortress 2 are masterpieces, the two episodes of the serial trilogy are excellent games while Portal is a great extra (let's hope that in case of a sequel they opt for greater longevity) that is worth a try to understand what a group of students supported by a great developer can come up with. The Orange Box, from any point of view you look at it, is an essential purchase that you must not miss. Details matter The initial sequence is a brief summary of what happened in the previous episode (it seems to be in a TV show). Back in the role of Freeman we find ourselves in the carcass of a train from which we must be able to get out. Alyx comes to our rescue and clears the way with the Gravity Gun. We find ourselves wandering through an unknown area while being able to admire the tragic and spectacular fate of City 17, completely reduced to rubble by the opening of the Combine portal. It is immediately clear that the setting of the game is absolutely identical to that of its predecessors, as well as the interface, weapons and enemies (apart from some additions which we will discuss). We pick up the thread of what was left unfinished and continue along the plot, once again linear, which unravels along seven levels, the last of which acts as an epilogue. On a technical level there are no major upheavals and you soon realize that the graphics engine has remained almost unchanged from the previous episode. Probably we didn't want to overload the game too much, by inserting latest generation effects, in order to make the title fully usable by all those who have been able to play Half-Life 2 and who, since then, have not changed computers. In fact, the minimum requirements are the same. The result is that Episode Two runs smoothly even on older machines and the beauty of the maps is still very high, thanks to the skill demonstrated by Valve's level designers in the composition phase. Once again the rule applies that it is not only necessary to have a latest generation graphics engine to create splendid scenarios, but it is the attention to detail that makes the difference. Each element is artfully positioned and it is impossible to find anything ~out of place~. The result is that, as was also the case in the previous chapters, the places are always extremely plausible and full of details. Novelty But let's go back to our two heroes and their vicissitudes. The initial purpose of Gordon and Alyx will be to get to the White Forest, where the secret base of the rebellion is located. Alyx must take the stolen data from City 17 to her father Eli to have it decrypted, but doing it will not be easy as the dangers on the road are many. Starting from the destroyed train, it will be necessary to cross various scenarios, including a mine, some wooded areas, resistance outposts, small urban centers, rivers and others, before arriving at your destination. From here the final chapters will begin, which will culminate in a spectacular and difficult battle against... no, no, we won't tell you more. Just know that this will take place on an ~open~ map and will require skill in using the car as well as excellent aim. Just the car deserves a separate mention, given that you will find yourself behind the wheel very often. The driving phases have been spiced up compared to the past with the addition of a radar that shows the secret areas in which to find thesupplies left by the resistance. In addition to this, the terrains to be crossed will be of various kinds and, among others, there will be two levels dedicated almost entirely to driving (or in which, in any case, knowing how to master the car is essential). Novelty Among the significant innovations, two enemies should be noted: white insects that are encountered in the mines and which are able to launch corrosive slime at great distances; and the Hunters, Combine robots that move on three legs, capable of withstanding numerous blows and firing explosive bullets that really hurt. Another novelty is a new character who joins the list of members of the resistance, the grumpy Dr. Magnusson, characterized in a sublime way and capable of filming any person inside the White Forest base. Talking about him serves to introduce the only new weapon, namely the Magnusson Device. These are large anti-Strider spheres that are used using the Gravity Gun. Basically you have to grab them, throw them at the Striders' heads and pop them with another weapon (the basic pistol is fine). Despite the impracticality, they are capable of destroying these terrifying enemies with a single blow. Magnusson Devices cannot be accumulated in the inventory like other weapons, but must be retrieved from dispensers placed appropriately on the map. One of the levels of the game is focused on them, which is also perhaps the most difficult ever made for the series. Twists But I see many of you clamoring to know more about the plot. What is revealed? Are there any twists? Without going into too much detail so as not to spoil someone's surprise, we can tell you that there will be no shortage of twists and turns, as well as highly dramatic sequences. Almost all the historical characters of the series will return, the good Dog will return, who will be essential on some occasions and we will steal some more details on the Vortigaunts, with whom Gordon will have to collaborate closely, and on the cursed G-Man, increasingly mysterious and increasingly delved into the facts that are shocking the world. The shocking ending deserves a special mention, which makes you want to keep playing (Valve, don't make us wait more than a year for the sequel again...) and which is truly ~touching~. For the rest there is little else to say, except that finishing it took us 5.50 (counted by Steam itself) hours and that Valve has seen fit to insert some nice extras. By finishing the levels, in fact, it will be possible to unlock the developer's commentary, or the possibility of revisiting the maps by listening to their background, so as to understand the impressive amount of work behind Episode One. In addition to this, throughout the game it will be possible to complete objectives (both on Xbox 360 and on PC). If you are interested in passing them all, it is advisable to read them before starting to play, so that you know what to do. One last note concerns the localization of the game. Finally, the Italian dubbing has been eliminated. Great, given the poor work of the previous episodes. The subtitles in our language are present and allow even non-English speakers to play, listening to the splendid original voices. In fact it was a crime to play Half-Life 2 without being able to enjoy a good dubbing. PC System Requirements Minimum Requirements Processor: Pentium 1.2 GHz or AMD equivalent RAM: 256 MB Video Card: DirectX 7 compatible or higher DirectX 9.0c DVD Drive Test Configuration Processor: Intel Pentium 4 3.4 GHz RAM: 2 GB Video Card: NVIDIA 7800GT Comment The rating you see in the box refers to the entire Half-Life 2: Orange Box package while the rating for Half-Life 2: Episode Two is 9.2. Half-Life 2: Episode Two is better than Episode One in many respects, especially thanks to a more accurate direction of the levels. This preference is probably due to the alternation of the classic claustrophobic levels with others set in open spaces, where the previous episode took place mostly indoors or in much more restricted open spaces. A praise to Valve for the extreme attention to detail, which once again makes this series the flagship of the FPS. Pros Great character acting Plot thickens and there's no shortage of twists Some levels alone are worth the whole game Cons Short-lived We want Episode Three NOW! We want to break the G-Man's face Half-Life 2: Episode 2 is part of Half-Life 2: Orange Box, is available for PC and Xbox 360 and will be available for PlayStation 3. The version tested is the PC version. To play Half-Life 2: Episode Two at its best, you must have completed Half-Life2 and Half-Life 2: Episode One (in their order).And). Given some plot references, it would be better to have also played the original Half-Life (which is always good for health), but the latter is not strictly necessary. The story told in the game under review continues the one told in the previous episodes, so it is impossible to understand it better if you haven't played them both. Don't worry about the expense because they are both included in the Orange Box, whether you buy it for PC or for Xbox 360 and, in the future, for PlayStation 3. For more details on the two previous chapters, read the summary box of the entire offer , which you will find in this article and in those dedicated to Team Fortress 2 and Portal. To conclude, we specify that the votes cast in each article will relate to individual games, while for an overall vote for the whole package, you can refer to the box we were talking about above. This distinction is necessary because each product included in the offer can be purchased individually on Steam. But now we come to the game. The end of Episode One had left many loose ends, as well as strong doubts about the fate of Gordon Freeman and Alyx Vance. The escape of the two protagonists from City 17 had been resolved in a spectacular way as well as daring and explosive (don't worry, we won't tell you anything too specific). What will happen to our heroes? But above all, why did we have to wait so long to find out?", "date": "2007-10-17", "grade": null}
