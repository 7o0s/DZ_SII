{"name": "Monster Hunter Freedom", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/monster-hunter-freedom.html", "text": "Be aware of the Hunter The principle on which Monster Hunter Freedom is based is freely inspired by role-playing games, Capcom uses only some of the elements of the 'role-playing game' as it is classically understood, modeling them according to the needs of the game. The adventure begins with the creation of the character, an editor accompanies the player through the birth of his own hunter, in the customization of the usual parameters related to gender, hair, face and skin color. The introduction to the actual game is what can be considered a reference to the world of RPGs: the hunter wakes up in his hut, the day has come when he will become a monster hunter and the old man of the village is ready to give him a couple of useful tips on how to start his own adventure. Following this dialogue, he gives the neo-hunter a whole set of weapons ranging from the fast dagger to the cumbersome and slow broadsword. Choosing the weapon from the box/inventory inside the house is just a small taste of how the game will be formed: the hunter lives in a plausible and real world, made up of carnivorous and herbivorous creatures, each with a particular weak point which will be exploited by choosing - just before the mission - the right weapon. Immediately after selecting your weapon it will be possible to take a further look at the village, discovering where the vendors are located and above all getting started in the art of missions and therefore of monster hunting. The quests that can be selected will mainly be of two different types: in the first, the purpose of the mission will be to kill a specific monster within a certain time, the second will instead be group missions devoted to the search for a specific object. While the former can be considered as 'classic', the latter will require the player to use his survival instinct, as you will not be able to use items from your equipment and you will have to survive by feeding and equipping yourself with the drops of monsters encountered along the way . Contrary to what one might think, the structure of the missions which should justify the 'portable' existence of the game, is also one of the most limiting factors with quests that are sometimes decidedly too long with a duration that is even close to the whole hour. The quests obtained will be feasible both in single player and in wireless multiplayer, up to four players equipped with PSP and copy of the game, to play in this mode it will be enough to find yourself inside the tavern in online mode, in order to meet your friends, proceed to the selection of the mission and venture into the world of Monster Hunter. Cloak and dagger. When, a few lines above, reference was made to the free inspiration of the role-playing game genre, it was done to give an explanation to what is the main mode of Monster Hunter Freedom: the missions. The game, as you may have already guessed, is based entirely on quests that can be assigned both at the tavern and by the village elder. Monster Hunter Freedom has no real story, the pretext on which the whole adventure is based is the absolute will of the protagonist to become the best hunter in the world, all of which is resolved in a disconnected series of missions for third parties divided into different categories according to difficulty (there are five mission ranks, to which 'urgent' quests must be added). Once the mission (or contract, as it is called) has been accepted, the hunter will be allowed to leave the village and set off in search of his objective. Although the world of Monster Hunter is simplistically divided into thematic areas (forest, swamp, and so on...) it is probably one of the best things ever seen on a laptop, with excellent quality even in detail; the different areas of the map are divided between them by a fast loading time which is added to the other much longer in the start and end of the mission. Within the game setting, the 'Freedom' component of the game asserts itself: during one's mission it will be possible to kill a monster to obtain objects and perhaps items useful to be eaten which sometimes will require cooking to be exploited to the fullest. their chance. The battle phase is not linked to particular constraints, the hunter is free to move within the setting and to hit the monsters he encounters (or to avoid being hit, in the case of carnivores), with the triangle key it is possible draw your weapon and hit the opponent in combination with the circle key. The attack combinations, as well as the transitions from armed to unarmored, are decidedly slow reschest at the speed of monsters who often use escape as their main weapon. In addition to the obvious problems of slowness of the combat mechanics, the camera does not 'fight' in favor of the game and often creates unpleasant situations in which you are attacked by an unseen monster; the only way to control the camera is by pressing the back button L which allows you to reposition it behind the hunter's back. The freedom factor, both in the strategy phase and in managing one's energy, is amplified by the farming factor of the objects, or by the possibility of planting and growing particular plants useful for taking care of one's character or for being sold; in the same way the mining and fishing skills help to increase the hunter's skills and above all his bank account. Cloak and dagger. Graphically excellent and fluid, Monster Hunter Freedom undoubtedly represents a point of reference for the management of 3D graphics for all the games to come, and it is also the clear demonstration that it is possible to develop -well- a visibly complex game like a game of role. The music adapts perfectly to the tone of the game, with a whole series of tunes in all respects inspired by the world of modern role-playing games (especially the online one) with orchestral arrangements and epic songs. Monster Hunter Freedom is a good game that could have been excellent if it hadn't been spoiled by a series of flaws and limitations that it is impossible to overlook for a game like this. The long loads, the slowness of the combat mechanics, the inaccurate camera and the excessive length of some quests undermine the final vote of what remains, at the moment, one of the best PSP games. Definitely one of the most addictive and long-lived. Good hunting! Pros: Longevity Visually striking Quest structure is additive Cons: Loads really annoying at times Camera makes fights much more complex Some quests are too long for a laptop In the boundless universe of role-playing games, there are some who - often to the detriment of success - decide to overturn the rules or, alternatively, to use only some of them, creating something that is often halfway between role-playing and slash' em up. Part of this category is Monster Hunter, a highly appreciated brand by Capcom born on Ps2, which after having managed to create a loyal niche of gamers, set off to conquer the portable world with Monster Hunter Freedom, a remake of the very first chapter. The portability of the Sony console, on paper, could be the winning move to make the Monster Hunter saga better known to the public and satisfy fans who will be able to use every moment of the day to hunt for the rarest monsters.", "date": "2006-08-17", "grade": null}
