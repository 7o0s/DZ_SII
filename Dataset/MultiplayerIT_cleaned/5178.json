Before, there was only peace and quiet, but at some point, all hell broke loose! Atari video games seem to want to flee their coin ops, driven by an unknown force. What is going on? To find out if it's worth finding out, don't abandon our review of Atari Mania. Forgotten past The protagonist of Atari Mania is the custodian of the Atari museum: here we see him arriving at work A title like Atari Mania could only be set in a museum. After all, its purpose is to celebrate in a bittersweet way a decisive story for the entire industry, but one that has simply been forgotten by many. The title of iLLOGIKA is full of joy, but at the same time it is the bitter stake of the dissolving of memory, with the resulting sense of abandonment. The tones are light, indeed, very light, so much so that you can even ignore the entire dramatic subtext and live happily, yet it is clear that in this strange mixture between the skeleton of a Japanese role-playing game and Warioware there is a desire to go further thoroughly to, at least, remember that this past also existed and that it was largely more important than what we continue to celebrate every day, driven by those who have every interest in continuing to sell us their brands decade after decade. So we all celebrated not Mario's birthday, but his commercial success in Super Mario Bros., we peel our hands clapping as the candles go out of this or that franchise still alive, obviously when those who want to sell it to us remind us, but we we have forgotten that 50 years of Atari is also 50 years of the video game industry, in whose honor not an ounce of ink has been used and a lot of talk has also been spared. Minigames The minigames mix different Atari classics Thus, as already mentioned, an Atari celebratory game could only take place in a museum full of dust and videogame characters trying to rebel against their destiny, led by the bear Bentley, the protagonist of Crystal Castles, and by the frustration of to have been placed in a corner and forgotten like dead things. Our role is that of caretakers and we aim to set things right by finding the fugitives to beat them back to their coin-ops. To succeed we must visit all the rooms of the museum, collect old Atari game covers, solve some very simple puzzles and face some deviant characters in quick challenges to a series of linked mini-games, based on the classics of the company founded by Nolan Bushnell, rehashed for the occasion and blended together to increase the variety altogether. In Atari Mania there are big spikes in difficulty As in Warioware, each minigame lasts a few seconds and requires you to achieve a specific goal. For example, you may find yourself having to shoot the Gravitar spaceship while avoiding Pong's rackets, or having to destroy Millipede by shooting him with the protagonist of Outlaw. There are also reversals in the face, such as having to protect Millipede using Pong's racket, or running in the shoes of an athlete while avoiding being hit by some stray ball. It is not essential to win all the mini-games, but to get to the end of the series, where you have to face the boss on duty in levels that are essentially more structured mini-games, with at least one life left, so you can proceed towards the deviant character next or take on the bonus challenges, always expressed in mini-games, to obtain information material related to Atari (covers, manuals and so on). Lots of problems Can a dead pixel launch a revolution? Unfortunately, as much as we like it as an operation, Atari Mania is not without its problems. The most evident, but not the most serious, is in the sudden peaks of difficulty that plague him and which can create more than a few annoyances. A greater graduality would certainly have been better, in order not to discourage the progress of the players by placing them with seemingly insurmountable obstacles after, perhaps, a relatively easy series. Another major defect of Atari Mania, far more serious, is precisely the fact that it did not want to take the vision it bears to the extreme, indulging in a consolatory and telephoned ending. It was to be expected, given that it is an essentially celebratory and unpretentious title, but we kind of hoped that it would take away some satisfaction by trying to hit harder. After all, what would it cost him? We are certainly not talking about a work that can aspire to reach the masses. The last problem, also a determining one, is imprecisionand the control system in some mini games. You pass some edginess in the museum, but in circumstances where you have to do everything perfectly within a very tight time limit to succeed, finding yourself having to climb over invisible edges or being killed by bullets that apparently had gone at will is very annoying.", "date": "2022-10-29", "grade": "6.5"}
