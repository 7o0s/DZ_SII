We had already said it in his PC review, but we repeat that this little gem was created by two developers as humble as they are passionate about a game design concept capable of transmitting soul, warmth, emotion. Horace was conceptually born there, in that typical 80's garage where a person wants to make something of his own and share it with the world; the tools today are obviously different and it is no coincidence that what has been with us for days now is an extremely mature, satisfying, deep but visibly mirror of a limited production, but - attention - absolutely not limiting. We are playing it on Switch thanks to a perfect port, without frills (just a couple of slight drops in frames in agitated situations), competent and adapted to the portability of the console, the perfect bride of this union. The narration Horace gives Switch a platformer with strong progression hues, but not only that: he also gives a tender, warm story: that of a robot who tells his story in a modern universe but at war, with a bizarre but well-balanced cast of supporting actors. This is perhaps what is most striking in Horace: the narration, the delicacy, the strength of a character who draws from other works, but who despite this has his own unique vital impetus, excellently grafted into the many lines of dialogue of the interlude scenes . We wrote about it more than a year ago and the judgment hasn't changed one iota: the level design ideas are fully convincing, the physics of gravity works, the mini-games are a quick but enjoyable condiment, the dynamics of the jumps are immediately chewed, the response to commands is immediate and precise, the loads make failure a non-frustrating option. Horace is a title that captures the emotional strength of a world at war that spares no one but which, at the same time, is immersed in a well-calibrated vat of humor that sometimes lightens rather touching or raw moments. You understand that for such a title, based on speed, ease of control, retro soul, Switch is the ideal platform and the work done is excellent, both for command mapping and for the technical realization of the port. The game structure In reality there is also another reason not to lose Horace again: the personality of the developers has meant that the software is full of quotes and a very Nintendian structure as a perception. Mind you, we are not talking about ideas or style, but about a dry but profound playful transmission, precise but not frustrating, varied and correctly weighed in its administration. Almost every mini-game is studied, fun, but mostly unnecessary; yet, despite the surplus of material, the team has literally filled Horace with references to the past retrogames, arcades, arcades, a concept of exaltation and amazement that was typical of those places, in those golden times. Then we come out of the past and Horace is tinged with absolute relevance, with satisfying, complex platform sections, bosses that are not difficult - thanks to a loving checkpoint system - but nice for the playful ideas that make them up. A balance that has seized us from the first moment, always inserted in a narrative context that has rhythm and drags us, reviving the desire to know how this story of affection and trust continues. Playing all this creative flow on the Switch is trivially the ideal way to enjoy opera - this is clearly a portable-minded, immediacy, pause-and-resume, travel-and-earphone-minded title.", "date": "2020-10-20", "grade": "8.5"}
