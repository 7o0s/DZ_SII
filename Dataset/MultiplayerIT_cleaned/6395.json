In fact, you will find yourself cursing at her, guilty of standing there motionless and scrutinizing the environment, cursing her for seven glutinous generations after coming into contact with the new game by Bossa Studios, the development team to which we owe strokes of genius such as Surgeon Simulator and Thomas Was Alone. You will get angry and even bad, because maybe you have not been able to successfully hold on to the edge of the kitchen cabinet, ending up inexorably on the dirty floor without the possibility of finding a foothold, thus becoming inedible. You will then restart the level, starting from the same place for the umpteenth time to try to become a wonderful toast, duly toasted with delicacy on both sides. After putting us in the shoes of a surgeon, the English team returns to offer us a title bordering on madness and nervous breakdown, but with lots of fun to offer: despite some doubts in the Early Access phase, I Am Bread managed to convince us in its definitive form, which arrived a few months after our previous meeting to allow us to definitively taste the dish served to us by Bossa Studios. If you are looking for bread for your teeth, I Am Bread is definitely the one for you! Owned bruschetta To those still wondering what I Am Bread is, we answer by reminding you that it is to all intents and purposes a ~bread simulator~, in which we are called to take on the role of a nice, freshly cut slice. In the campaign mode, the goal is to manage to find a way to get toasted in each level: in the kitchen it will be possible to easily find the appropriate toaster, but when, for example, we find ourselves in the bathroom, the music will change, prompting us to invent something for being able to give us a nice toast. All this is even supported by a plot, which the player can follow before each level by reading the reports of a psychiatrist: summing it up in a few words, the owner of the house where everything takes place is convinced (rightly) that he is our possessed bread to turn every single poltergeist model room, but the doctor doesn't believe him and kicks off a series of treatments, destined to go on in a tragicomic way until the inevitable final confrontation. Each level of I Am Bread corresponds to a different part of the house, where the poor victim moves his objects to be able to overcome his stress syndrome and forget his theories about the terrorist loaf. As you complete the campaign mode, you also unlock the other game types offered by I Am Bread, quite different from the main one: in Rampage, you transform into a baguette to destroy everything in the room, accumulating points for damage inflicted; in Bagel Race, on the other hand, you improvise in the role of a little donut, busy running through the various checkpoints in a real home circuit, complete with a final record. In the Zero-G, on the other hand, our slice floats in the air without the force of gravity, to try again to toast itself as in the main mode. Finally, the Free Roam practically speaks for itself, offering the player the possibility to wander aimlessly to explore all that the seven levels of the adventure have to offer. Come on sandwich If you know Surgeon Simulator, the introduction of this review will not have surprised you: I Am Bread in fact follows the setting of its predecessor, making life difficult for anyone who thinks that moving a slice of bread is child's play. It does so by proving to be a gaming experience that is not at all approximate, able to offer a surprising remuneration in overcoming the various difficulties and the result of an indisputable in-depth design work by the developers. Although you are on a PC, the use of a controller is practically mandatory, in order not to go crazy between the commands that involve the use of four different buttons, each of which corresponds to one of the corners of the slice of bread: by pressing them, you so that it remains clinging to a specific surface, for a limited period of time after which it will let go. But ~all that glitters is not gold~, because the pitfalls are numerous: dirty floors, moldy walls, ants and everything that is unhygienic will be in our path to make our starchy alter-ego inedible, until game over constituted precisely by the arrival at 0% edibility. Instead, rub on jams, pats of butter, and other elementsn able to add flavor to our breakfast is something that allows us to increase the score assigned at the end of each level to our degree of delicacy. To succeed in his goal, the player must deploy a good dose of timing and skill, working hard to move the slice of bread (which obviously has no legs) by clinging to the elements present in the environment. In the first level, you can use a skateboard to jump off the kitchen table, reaching the stove area without touching the floor, but this is just one example of the alternatives offered by I Am Bread. Compared to the Early Access version, the presence of a tutorial with which to familiarize yourself with the control system is appreciated, but above all a special jam that appears after failing a level a certain number of times: thanks to it, it is possible to count on infinite grip and life, getting a huge help to move forward in the story. Bread and accompaniment We have already talked about the good level of design of the levels of I Am Bread, focusing mainly on its aspect related to the game mechanics. Also from an aesthetic point of view, the seven different locations that make up the various modes offer excellent variety to the player, thanks to the presence of different objects that we would expect to find in the various rooms of a house, including the outdoor stages in the middle of the garden or at a petrol station. The levels are also cared for in physics, given that our virtual slice will be able to overturn boxes and move plates and glasses, as well as turn switches on and off, and then launch himself from surfaces in height or moving with movements calculated to the millimeter in a precarious balance between the edibility and the wet bin. The I Am Bread engine isn't free from defects, such as the glitch that causes the slice of bread to suddenly move in the air, wriggling in a rather disturbing way: although it is a problem capable of destroying a level, we cannot deny that we even enjoyed watching these evolutions. However, the defect is found above all in the more advanced levels, to which perhaps Bossa Studios has had the opportunity to devote less time in terms of optimization; to note also some game crashes, following which you are thrown to the desktop without too many compliments. Moving on to the audio sector, the soundtrack is quite nice, differentiated in its songs based on the level faced.", "date": "2015-04-22", "grade": "7.4"}
