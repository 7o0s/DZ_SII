Well, if the answer is negative and you don't go into your thirties, we can't blame you: in fact, it is a Taito production dating back to 1981, when the very limited hardware resources of gaming machines forced developers to come up with concepts worthy of the best abstract art. Qix in particular wanted the player to try their hand at ~enclosing~ the entity of the same name in a small part of the playing area, claiming the majority of it by drawing closed shapes, which were thus prevented from moving the Qix, using a cursor . And Pac-Man, however, do you remember? Even if we go even further back in time, to 1980, surely you know the little yellow ball busy eating pills and avoiding ghosts in complicated mazes, right? And why this little videogame history lesson? Because history, as the greatest philosophers teach us, tends to repeat itself, and on the new digital delivery platforms many independent developers, faced with the obstacle of the necessarily small size of their works, often resort to the glorious past of media and reinterpret it, update it, innovate it: the result can be very pleasant. Trapped in the net escapeVektor could be described as a singular union between the concepts of the two games we have talked about so far. The premises and the story with which our sessions are interrupted perhaps too often speak of a ~something~ that is trapped inside a virtual universe at the behest of a mysterious entity that is presented to us simply as ~CPU~, which he absolutely wants to get out of this virtual universe, and to do so he needs our help. We will therefore have to guide him through ever larger and more complicated labyrinthine structures, the exit of which, however, appears, and hence the reference to Qix, only once he has completely covered a certain number of closed geometric shapes from which the same structure is composed. To hinder us various types of enemies, always controlled by the perfidious CPU, the contact with which is lethal: from the simple ones who limit themselves to patrolling only the section of the labyrinth entrusted to them, to the more intelligent ones who seek us far and wide and once they find us, they pursue us mercilessly; to help us conversely a whole series of bonuses and special features to acquire along the course of the levels, from the boost that allows us to escape the pursuit of opponents, to the detonation that eliminates them directly, up to the union of the two powers, which, accelerating, it also makes us invincible. All in all, therefore, a very simple concept, but which by virtue of its characteristics manages to appeal to both puzzle and action lovers: completing a complicated labyrinth, using the bonuses at the right time and producing spectacular plays such as it can be, for example, the combination of a last-second dodge using boost and then detonation to take out anyone in front of you around the corner requires no small amount of hand-eye-brain coordination. All with relative, enormous gratification of one's ego once the feat is completed, as any lover of this kind of game knows, perhaps inconspicuous but undoubtedly very satisfying. The 3D effect Useless. Due to the simple and schematic representation, made up practically only of lines, you will struggle to see the differences between the game with stereoscopy activated and the one without. It is true that the labyrinth is not fixed in the shot and always moves slightly in the four directions with respect to the backdrop, a purely aesthetic expedient implemented perhaps precisely to ensure that the 3D is noticed at least from time to time, but let us remain very low levels of exploitation, rarely touched in the history of the console. Zoom and escape Gratification that unfortunately escapeVektor will not grant to every type of player. First of all because, even in the eShop panorama, as we will soon see, it is an inconspicuous product; and then above all because it is a difficult game, very difficult, which already from the first level of the second area requires considerable doses of planning and manual skill, or alternatively a massive use of the evergreen trial and error. Such a difficult title (a category which incidentally seems to be gaining ground on the Nintendo DD) is always welcome in our opinion, but the patience it requires and the style of play made up of short sessions, moreover perfect for a portable console, which is advisable to adopt today as today it probably limits the potential audience a bit. To all those who feel readyhowever, escapeVektor offers you, in addition to all the talk about challenge and gratification, the beauty of 150 levels - 30 of which have already appeared on WiiWare in what was supposed to be the first chapter of an episodic series but which was then interrupted - and big boosts to replayability in the form of four different medals to be conquered for each level depending on the score and, icing on the cake, online rankings divided into categories: World, Country and Friends. All this testifies to the commitment made by the development team, and justifies the unusually high price for an eShop game, 10 Euros. We then spoke of the inconspicuousness: in line with the premises and with the name, we are faced with an elegant and clean graphic aspect, on the abstract/virtual theme, which reminded us a bit of Tron for the ~vector~ representation of every element, and which certainly does not make spectacularity its strong point; in the same way electronic music wanders between vintage and the most daring disco pieces, but they are not many and in the end the repetitiveness could even push you to eliminate them. We want to dedicate one last space to a particular flaw: the normally displayed play area is extremely limited, so much so that everything is practically unplayable since you won't see the enemies until just before hitting them. It is obviously possible to frame a much wider area, but only by keeping R pressed. the forefinger on the back is quite annoying; with the simple possibility of setting the desired zoom level, we would easily be half a vote higher in the overall evaluation.", "date": "2013-02-05", "grade": "7.3"}
