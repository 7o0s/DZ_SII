That's a shame, because LEGO games lend themselves particularly well to portable gaming: based mainly on the collection of collectibles, they allow you to enjoy even just short games in search of bricks and new minifigs. In this sense, albeit castrated, the portable versions of titles such as LEGO Harry Potter or LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean have proven to be pleasant pastimes. In the case of LEGO The Lord of the Rings, however, we are faced with a somewhat more complex situation which, unfortunately, does not play in favor of this conversion. Thumbnail of thumbnail LEGO The Lord of the Rings, in the PlayStation 3 version, struck us for the over the top care placed by the developer in the interpretation of the film trilogy by Peter Jackson and, consequently, of the novels by J.R.R. Tolkien, both from a technical and gameplay point of view. From the Wii version it was logical to expect something less, but all in all it was a noteworthy adaptation. Sadly, the same cannot be said of this Nintendo 3DS port. The epic and greatness of scenarios and situations, which differentiated the title from other LEGO video games by TT Games, have been lost, translated into a proposal that has nothing remarkable, if not the actual subject of the parody. Middle-earth remains in the hub version, freely explorable between one level and another, but further miniaturized and fragmented, not too different, although wider, from the typical hubs offered in the other games of the franchise. Setting aside that feeling of freedom and grandeur, we find ourselves faced with a series of internships that are themselves simplified and even more linear; the puzzles and secondary missions proposed are much simpler than the home counterparts, based above all on the recovery of objects and on some peculiar skills of the characters: elves like Arwen jump higher, Gimli can destroy some obstacles, Gollum can reach inaccessible areas, and so on. The number of characters displayed at the same time, however, drops from nine to two: the Fellowship of the Ring is never united, in fact, and all too often it is necessary to manually switch the controlled character to solve the riddle of the turn. Much more emphasis is placed on the fights, after all, but unfortunately we are faced with the usual problem of LEGO games, further accentuated by inexplicable technical problems: the fights always boil down to a frantic and random pressing of the attack button, but in the 3DS the frequent drops in the frame rate and the significantly slower than normal animations make the battles, in the long run, very little avvncenti, also due to our companion who continually tends to come between us and our targets, demonstrating an intelligence worthy of a hobbit who smoked too much pipeweed. The 3D effect Once activated, the stereoscopic effect does its duty, albeit without acute details: some passages have been clearly thought out in these terms, especially in the presence of objects or creatures in the foreground. The result is pleasant, but it doesn't improve the experience, inflicting a low blow on the frame rate and further slowing down the action during the most frenetic sequences (for example, in Shelob's lair). Low-budget As usual, the main objective of the game is to collect thousands and thousands of bricks to unlock every character, bonus and secret. In this sense, the TT Games title is fairly long-lived, although it lacks some features present in the home counterpart. If the levels already appear reduced both in content and in quantity (at least one level less per film, compared to the other versions) the way in which TT Games decided to introduce and conclude them is surprising and even a little baffling: only a few cutscenes have been preserved in the port, in low definition and often even shredded here and there. Others, however, have been replaced by sequences that use the raw engine of the game, with decidedly questionable results. In any case, the narration appears fragmented and often incomprehensible: only those who have seen the films will be able to understand exactly what is happening. The humor has thankfully remained unchanged: the contrast between the very serious original jokes of the film, in English subtitles, and the actions of the LEGO characters on the screen create an irresistible parody of some of the most iconic scenes of the trilogyto. Unfortunately, the audio compression leaves a lot to be desired: the dubbing seems to belong to a completely different channel and is unclear and metallic, as are the decidedly crude sound effects; nothing to say, however, on the excellent original soundtrack by Howard Shore (and God forbid!), however well reproduced and worthy of being listened to when playing with a good pair of headphones. The technical problems don't end there, unfortunately. The washed out textures and the lesser definition result in a general grime of the image which makes some passages bland and confusing. The developer tries, on several occasions, to reproduce realistic backgrounds and settings, but with little success: on balance, it is not easy to distinguish destructible objects made up of bricks from those that are simply part of the scenario. However, there are some visually gratifying moments, especially thanks to the 3D effect, despite its activation involving a noticeable drop in the frame rate.", "date": "2012-12-14", "grade": "5.5"}
