The development of the game went on for several months, proceeding a little quietly and without unleashing who knows what reactions from the gamer community, yet the Rare title is grinding extraordinary numbers, demonstrating the excellent work done by the famous English studio . Well, after our review of the Xbox One version, here we are also testing the Windows 10 edition of this original, captivating and evocative ~pirate simulator~. Boarding! Sea of Thieves was born as a multiplayer-based experience, to be carried out in cooperation, although the game also allows you to go on an adventure alone, to face the waves of the sea sadly, to moor sadly near some beautiful islet and to dig sad in the ground looking for treasure. Here, it is not even remotely the case to try to take advantage of the experience offered by the Rare title in this way; unless you want to be sad, of course. No, you have to be in company, toast with mugs full of grog, play the accordion hopping in front of a fire, on a splendid evening on the beach, celebrating yet another successful expedition. Between point A and point B, however, there is literally the sea. The start screen allows you to use matchmaking to join a crew formed by a total of four or two pirates, in the first case using a standard-sized galleon, with three masts, strings of cannons and more complex maneuverability; in the second case a sloop equipped with a single mast, smaller and more agile, which can be steered precisely by a couple of people. Whatever the setting of the game, it is clear that everything becomes more fun in the company of friends, even the little things; and it is possible to appreciate the many facets that the developers have introduced in relation to the control of the ship itself, which must be governed with great attention to inertia, distances, the flow of the wind that we will have to intercept by tilting the sails in the right way. You have to pull up the anchor, check the map and take the helm to reach your destination, without GPS-style indicators to make the journey easier, with the possibility of coming across not only adverse climatic situations, which in combination with the darkness of the night and with the fog can make us end up against the rocks; but also in other pirate ships, whose crew will have no problem shelling us to take possession of the loot we may be carrying. From delivery missions to skeleton hunts, through to the traditional treasure hunt (complete with scrolls with a nice X where to search), Sea of Thieves offers a fairly rich set of things to do, although in the end ultimately it all boils down to more or less the same mechanics. It is also and above all for this reason that playing alone, or in the company of strangers without a microphone and/or who speak an incomprehensible language, does not do justice to the solid system developed for the occasion, particularly brilliant precisely in the rendering of the sea and its waves, as well as the evocative landscapes that we will find ourselves admiring during navigation. The rest, fighting included, remains a bit in the shadows for the moment, victim of excessive simplifications and a general lack of substance, with a view to a project that at this moment must still be seen as an open construction site and which could surprise us in the future. coming months with new and exciting content. Or not. The PC version From a technical point of view, Sea of Thieves boasts a large number of elements of absolute importance. In fact, turning a blind eye to the animations of the characters, devoted to functionality rather than quality, in particular as regards the connecting movements, everything that you will be able to observe during your crossings will be pleasant, at times suggestive. The rendering of the sea is probably the best ever seen in a video game, and despite the cartoonish style of the title Rare offers flashes of unexpected realism as the waves mount and crash against the hull of the ship, but also and above all when finds himself going through a storm, between lightning and incessant rain. Also in this case all aspects concerning the characters appear simplistic, just look at your companions while they swim, and this factor actually creates a clear break between the most successful and the least successful things of this production. However, continuing on frefore the first, the realization of the sky, with real polygonal models for the clouds instead of volumetric or two-dimensional solutions, appears absolutely guessed and works extraordinarily well in conjunction with the lighting system, capable of giving magnificent images in the transition from light to dark. The atmosphere of these scenes is great, particularly at night, when torches and lamps barely illuminate the scenery or the very gait of a distant galleon on the water. Is it time to attack him? Excellent details of the islands, designed in a traditional way and without resorting to procedural solutions, with dense vegetation that reacts to interactions but a rather limited fauna and an aspect that at a certain point appears monotonous, especially when it comes to small-scale scenarios . That said, how does Sea of Thieves fare on PC? Unfortunately, the game starts from a very serious, inexplicable lack: HDR. This is a feature that on Xbox contributes substantially to enhancing the panoramas, but which for the moment has not been implemented in the Windows 10 edition, perhaps starting from the assumption that most users would have used a standard monitor to play. However, the choice remains inexplicable, if we consider that supporting the high dynamic range would not have involved any extra work and made those who use the computer in the living room happy, keeping it connected to a television compatible with this technology. However, there are also various fine graphic adjustments, replaced by a simplified approach: in addition to setting the resolution, the frame rate limit and the vertical sync, Sea of Thieves only allows you to act on a general preset or on five specific items , which change the quality of elements such as shadows, polygonal models, textures, water and lighting. It is clearly possible to make do with even these few options in order to scale the experience in the presence of underperforming hardware, but settings freaks may not like such superficiality. The rest, however, is only good news: on the test configuration it is possible to play at 1080p and 60 frames per second or at 2160p and 30 frames per second without ever encountering an uncertainty, while keeping all the settings at maximum. However, the consistency of the frame rate is surprising, which in both cases seems to offer perfect pacing, so much so that during our tests we preferred to give precedence to detail and remain anchored to the thirty frames, without experiencing any shooting sensation. even in the most complicated situations. The game natively supports controls via mouse and keyboard or the Xbox controller, and its cross-platform nature allows Xbox One users to join games in a completely transparent way, without any limits beyond the Windows 10 interface .", "date": "2018-03-29", "grade": "7.6"}
