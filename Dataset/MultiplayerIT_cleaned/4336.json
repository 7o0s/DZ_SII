In short, a different project than usual for the guys at Climax Studios, authors some time ago of the three episodes of Assassin's Creed Chronicles and, years before, of Silent Hill: Origins and Silent Hill: Shattered Memories: titles that make a curriculum, and that say it long on the ability of the English team to produce quality games. In this case we are faced, as mentioned, with an inertial-based shooter, with a campaign consisting of ten levels (including the prologue) gradually more complex, full of really mangy enemies to eliminate, turrets, traps and so on. My spaceship is gone The RiftStar Raiders tutorial, if we want to call it that, offers a non-trivial challenge in itself and introduces us to the mechanics that regulate the gameplay, based on an inertial context in which moving with precision is not always easy, even and above all when dozens of hostile ships are shooting at you. You can move the ship using the left analog stick and use the right to aim, while slowing down at the same time. This last function represents both an advantage and a disadvantage at the same time, because moving slowly it will be difficult to avoid enemy fire; and this is where the ability to make a quick leap forward or lateral swerves comes into play which allow you to avoid damage, provided you perform them with the right timing. The maneuver is triggered by the left backbone, while the right one is used to operate a magnetic hook with various functions: transport of objects, uprooting of panels that hide bonuses to be collected and even hacking operations for opening doors and so on. The triggers activate the two weapons that we can equip, and which of course will be enhanced by spending the money raised during the missions, in a very well thought out, gradual and interesting growth path, although not very malleable: some choices will significantly affect our offensive capacity , therefore it will be necessary to think carefully, for example, about preferring a precise focus to one that branches out, because then it will not be possible to go back. The boost we mentioned earlier are also subject to enhancement, with two possible variants (clear sprint or normal acceleration), and the energy shields, essential for avoiding damage to the hull but quick to take down as soon as someone starts to target us. Playstation 4 trophies There are fifty Trophies obtainable by playing RiftStar Raiders. Some are obtained simply by completing the missions of the campaign, but most of the achievements are linked to specific actions to be completed during the stages, some particularly difficult. Parked in the garden The ten missions that make up the RiftStar Raiders campaign must be tackled in order, since you have to complete them to unlock the next ones, but nothing prevents you from replaying already completed levels for the purpose of unlocking specific objectives or for simple grinding, a practice that can actually make things easier for us. As mentioned, in fact, the new Climax Studios title is characterized by a considerable degree of challenge, a clearly hardcore approach that pushes you to try each stage several times trying to find the right strategy for each new event, perhaps taking advantage of the distance to start to hit a turret that has not yet perceived our presence, or by anticipating the terminals from which the enemy ships, quite varied in their types, emerge. The inertial context complicates things, of course, and in the hectic phases it becomes really difficult to avoid taking damage, but fortunately the most important opponents release objects capable of partially restoring the integrity of the hull and shields, as well as credits which, as said, it will then be possible to spend on vehicle upgrades. After some hesitation and the time necessary to measure the gameplay, the RiftStar Raiders experience literally takes off and shows itself in all its solidity, even if unfortunately there are negative aspects. The most sensational one certainly lies in a cooperative multiplayer mode without matchmaking and limited to inviting friends, therefore without the possibility of looking for open matchesand by anyone: a limit that could mean the complete renunciation of this interesting feature. Then there are several more or less annoying bugs, such as for example the respawn indicator from an elimination that remains imprinted on the screen even after the respawn has been carried out, or the alarm of a homing missile that continues to sound although the enemy has already been destroyed. Finally, on PlayStation 4 Pro we have encountered frequent unjustified slowdowns: the graphics of the game move various objects and boast good effects, but nothing that could worry the hardware of the Sony console in its standard model, let alone the most performing one. Small and large uncertainties that unfortunately affect the overall evaluation, but which shouldn't discourage you if you are looking for a roguelike shoot'em-up with a hardcore approach.", "date": "2018-03-20", "grade": "7.0"}
