Certainly this is not a permissive title: one of its limits is the rigidity of not admitting alternatives to control via accelerometer, so you have to come to terms with this system and spend some time before mastering it. To our rescue we have a series of adjustments that increase or decrease the sensitivity of the controls, but in the end it all boils down to a matter of mere practice. The trajectory indicator present in the introductory stages soon disappears and we find ourselves dealing with gravity and inertia, chasing a multitude of colored balloons, passing through a series of checkpoints or facing cunning and determined opponents with machine guns, missiles and flying mines. In the blue painted blue The ~campaign~ mode of Aera sees us face a sequence of stages in which three types of mission basically alternate. The first revolves around the simple control of the plane, and in fact we are asked to hit a minimum number of balloons within a time limit, following sometimes complex trajectories and avoiding the traps represented by floating mines and so on. The second type of missions are focused on speed and on precision: we have to follow a certain route making sure to pass the plane through the checkpoints present in the stage. The third type concerns real combat, so in addition to tilting the iPhone and controlling the power of the engine, we have to touch the screen to fire bursts of machine guns, launch remote-controlled missiles and drop bombs in the air. The combat system is perhaps simplistic, but it is difficult to think of a thicker alternative that could be reconciled with the already demanding management of the aircraft. The more stages we complete, the more planes are unlocked: each of them boasts specific characteristics and therefore presents more or less marked differences in terms of speed, power, maneuverability, etc. When we are knocked down during a mission, the game performs a quick ~rewind~ similar to that present in some racing games, therefore it does not force us to restart the stage from the beginning but shows the side to potentially frustrating situations in which, for example, a wrong maneuver prevents us from surviving despite the ~rewind~. Three attempts are all we have to bring home the achievement, otherwise we will actually have to repeat the mission all over again. Low clouds over the city The design of the planes is convincing and the models appear to have a decent level of detail, but above all the locations convince thanks to a good use of colors and the presence of a good number of objects. Our flight sessions are always smooth and fast, without uncertainties even in the most complicated situations, while the management of the view perhaps winks more at the spectacular than at the practicality, but there is still a button to instantly center the camera. The controls via accelerometer are very delicate and sensitive, and in fact represent the cross and delight of the iChromo title: some practice is required to master them, one should not be discouraged by the initial difficulties. The action is accompanied by a not very rich sound and perhaps too ~soft~ in the effects, which therefore fail to be incisive. The tested version is 1.0", "date": "2009-10-05", "grade": "8.0"}
