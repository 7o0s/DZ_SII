The certainly not splendid situation of the Square Enix productions, combined with the desire to fish out the foundations of that original Final Fantasy which in 1987 had saved the software house from bankruptcy, was however sufficient to put a flea in the ear. To attempt the coup, Square has also chosen to put the project in the hands of a well-established and experienced team, that Team Ninja which in recent times has dedicated two excellent titles to us such as Nioh and its sequel Nioh 2. Now that Stranger of Paradise has arrived and we have had the opportunity to play it all, sift through its mechanics, long-term potential and taste its history, let's find out how all the good premises have given rise to a solid product but very far from that explosive potential which could bring the union between Final Fantasy and Team Ninja. In this review of Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin we tell you what we think works and what doesn't, but above all why this experience remains an excellent idea from which to start, but not the best point of arrival it could have reached. Chaos here, Chaos there Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin - Tiamath, one of the four elemental demons Let's start immediately from a fundamental point: Stranger of Paradise is not an action remake of the first historic chapter of Final Fantasy. On the contrary, it represents a free interpretation of a period prior to that history, which recalls most of the archetypes of the progenitor, but which modifies relationships, connections, even some elements of the lore. In this sense it could be comparable to the same concept with which Final Fantasy VII Remake has turned ideas and moments on itself to obtain absurd twists. Not surprisingly, behind the narration of Stranger of Paradise there is always the hand of the Nomura / Nojima couple, although in this case we do not believe that the upheavals at the origins of the saga will be able to generate the same stir and the same discussions as Final Fantasy VII Remake . Amazon offer Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin - Playstation 4 74.99 See Offer Without too many advances, the story is set in an unoriginal way in a world that has lost its light. Four Crystals govern the four main elements, and the city of Cornelia is governed by a royal family who have maintained a tenuous balance of forces for generations. The entity Chaos desperately tries to bring darkness to our world and an ancient prophecy states that it will be the four Warriors of Light who will restore peace by defeating Chaos. In this classic Japanese jumble of crystals, light and darkness, we meet Jack, who for some initially not well defined reason perceives within himself the need to defeat Chaos. He is in possession of one of the four crystals of the elements and within a matter of seconds he forms a solid and mutual friendship with Jed and Ash, both crystal holders who will follow him wherever he goes. Unfortunately Stranger of Paradise is a title with clumsy writing, often mediocre, accompanied by dialogues of certainly not high caliber and by a direction that alternates discrete moments with total confusion. The whole narrative arc is resolved in a handful of twists that are launched with a dropper during the adventure, but which then explode all together from a certain moment on. For this reason, net of forgettable writing, the plot still manages to interest and generate some wow moments. During the twenty hours needed to complete the main missions you will have to force yourself to ~believe~ in the set of little clear and sketchy that pour on the screen, waiting for the main revelations about Jack and his group of friends, soon to be joined by Neon and Sophie. In short, net of references and winks to old fans of the series, you will not play Stranger of Paradise for the quality of the narration. Final Fantasy x Nioh Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin - the pirates, famous in the first Final Fantasy, also return here In an attempt to expand its audience and attempt new experiments, the choice to entrust a pure action in the hands of Team Ninja already represents an important and shrewd vision on the part of Square Enix. The renowned Japanese studio, historically linked to some series that marked the market between the late nineties and early 2000s, is also the only one able in the recent past to generateand a valid alternative to FromSoftware's souls like. Nioh and its direct sequel represented for some the solution to certain bizarre problems of the management of Hidetaka Miyazaki's titles, combining the souls setting with infinite replayability and the customization of a Diablo-like action RPG. We too have praised it on several occasions and have therefore been genuinely attracted by the experiment of Square Enix. Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin - Jack has only one goal: to defeat Chaos! A substantial difference with other similar games (and descent into hell for soulslike purists) is the ability to choose the level of difficulty from the initial menu. This in itself would certainly not be a problem, but unfortunately it is the balance of the experience that is far from successful, putting us in front of an action that is on average very easy and has sudden and sporadic peaks of difficulty. As for the structure, Stranger of Paradise is a video game based on a substantial amount of missions, disconnected between logos and reachable via a globe that shows the different regions of the continent. Just like Nioh, these missions immediately suggest the recommended level to be tackled, a detailed series of conquerable rewards and a description of what has happened up to that moment and of what our protagonists will face in battle. endless series of opponents taken from the history of Final Fantasy until you complete a map that inevitably leads to the boss who concludes the mission. Conquered the victory, you return to the globe and so on until the end credits. Nothing open world, no central hub, nor other characters to deal with - if we exclude a rather anachronistic mechanic that allows you to entertain some dialogues with the inhabitants of Cornelia directly from the globe menu. Loot management In Stranger of Paradise the amount of armaments and armor that can be found in the game is almost overwhelming, especially in relation to one's statistics and the time it would require to study them properly. For this reason, within a matter of minutes, you will find yourself using the key dedicated to optimizing the paraphernalia. The forge, present in the globe, instead allows you to decompose hundreds and hundreds of useless objects and recover materials to be used to increase the unique characteristics of the objects we are using. Joys and (many) pains of gameplay Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin - the settings do not make a miracle cry Coming to the actual combat system, this derives by weight from the experience of Nioh, with some substantial differences, however, which represent its cross and delight. First of all, there is no classic character growth. Wanting to fish from the history of the first chapters of Final Fantasy, Stranger of Paradise brings into play the jobs, more than two dozen to tell the truth, which represent the real elements of differentiation of the gameplay. Basically in your inventory it is possible to equip two different interchangeable classes with the simple pressure of a button and which, if you really want to try to find a combination, can be approachable to the postures of Nioh. These classes use ever-changing combinations of weapons and skills and are divided into several categories such as basic and advanced. The release of new jobs is linked to the growth of the jobs themselves. In fact, they will be the ones to gain experience and level up, up to 30, when all the skills and new classes connected to them will have been unlocked. To understand each other: the magician allows access to the white magician and the black magician, consequently the white one to get to the paladin and so on, in an infinite dance of new combinations. Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin - ~Final Fantasy~ design is well reproduced Everything works wonderfully, the fights are engaging and entertaining, but the more you play the title, the more you realize its limits. An example are the only two quick-choice slots for classes, which almost always force you to maintain a magical class and a melee, limiting (or simply making it too cumbersome) the possibility of really varying your offensive. It doesn't help that the gameplay is based on state affinities and on the resistances and weaknesses of the opponents, on several occasions putting the player in the position of having to open the menu and change his choices, often breaking the pace of the game. Was it so difficult to add a third slot to cover every possible situation? Working on fenticing real spells, Stranger of Paradise plays its joker, capable of adding spice to the clashes and a pinch of strategy - in this sense we advise you to play at a higher level of difficulty. There is no stamina bar and this translates into the ability to attack without any effort and to perform dodges and parries as if there were no tomorrow. In its place, however, the mechanics of the MP and the attrition bar have been inserted, the latter taking weight from titles such as Sekiro and in some way from Nioh himself. Let's start from this: it is a bar, present and visible both for Jack that for the opponents, which represents in all respects the balance and resistance. Once that of our alter ego is exhausted, we will find ourselves helpless and vulnerable for a few seconds; while for the opponents it will almost always mean certain death, allowing Jack to destroy them with an attack useful for creating damage also to nearby opponents, but above all that will reload and increase his maximum MP. Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin - three inseparable friends In classic Final Fantasy style, PMs are useful for casting spells. Whether they are offensive related to the elements, or healing as energy for HP recovery, as well as regen and rebirth. In short, the whole story of the saga is present in the form of spells, which are cast by spending the corresponding amount of MP and using a keystroke. In fact, Stranger of Paradise uses the right backbone for basic attacks, whatever class is equipped, while with the right trigger it is possible to perform all those magical or physical skills that drain Jack's MP reserve. The management of these points is what really makes the difference in the game and some choices during the mission can bring you in front of bosses without magic points, a significant problem at high difficulties. As if that weren't enough, precisely because it is impossible to lose experience on death, Team Ninja has seen fit to affect the MPs when restarting from a prism (provided you don't put the assisted difficulty). These can then be recovered with physical attacks and with the shield, which allows you to absorb and also send back some of the skills to the enemies themselves, as if it were an instant copy system of the opposing offensive. Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin - ready to fight for the salvation of Cornelia? There would still be a lot of elements to discuss, but let's spend just a few lines on the Lux mechanic. This, so praised by the tutorials at the beginning of the game, should represent a sort of last resort capable of thoroughly wearing down all the enemies in the area, so to speed up the offensive and change the tide of the challenge. In practice we have really hardly ever used it. Thanks to the low concrete effectiveness and the sacrifice of maximum MPs, we have always avoided abusing them. For the rest, the game is exactly what it seems: you advance from room to room until you find the next prism which acts as a checkpoint and which, in classic soulslike style, restores opponents on the map and usable potions. Companion and multiplayer In the game it is possible to modify your team, which is almost always made up of three characters and which allows us to manage equipment and classes, even of the supporting characters. During the fights, the resonance can then be used: it is nothing more than a sort of battle call that increases the aggressiveness of the supporting actors and which can be used every certain amount of time. In practice, here too there is very little in terms of depth of mechanics and, really wanting to pull the strings, one could even say that it is a totally abusable detail. Most of the bosses, if it weren't for the need to always inflict the coup de grace with the circle, could be killed easily by making excessive use of resonance, without ever getting close to inflict a blow. It is obviously also possible to play in coop, up to three players, making the NPCs disappear and tackling the missions together with your friends with a matchmaking system very similar to Nioh, but without the need for consumables to spend to summon. A simplification of gameplay. Visually listless Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin - Astos gives some interesting moments Graphics aren't everything, we often say it, but it's sad to see that a game that could draw heavily from the Final Fantasy series ends up being very anonymous from an aesthetic and artistic point of view. Poorly detailed textures and omnipresent aliasing do not help, which in some settings tends to be really annoying. Unfortunately, inspiration is really lacking, and here too", "date": "2022-03-14", "grade": "7.0"}
