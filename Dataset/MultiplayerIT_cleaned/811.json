Told like this, the plot of the film seems extremely banal. The fact is that the individual in question is a tiny concentration of evil (Plankton), and that the two heroes intent on stopping him are respectively a sponge (Spongebob) and an obese starfish (Patrick). To complete the picture there is an undoubtedly demented humor, which distinguishes the Spongebob cartoon as well as this tie-in. At the command of one of the two characters, depending on the case, you will have to go through a large number of levels, face increasingly dangerous enemies and huge bosses, often participating in speed races or obstacle courses characterized by a certain degree of difficulty . The watchword is the upgrade: Spongebob and Patrick have the imperative to learn new moves to continue in the game, and to do so they must necessarily obtain a certain number of special coins. Coins that are earned by completing stage platformers as well as various course challenges. The control system, extremely simple to master, is gradually enriched with new functions and allows even very young players to juggle rotating attacks, special uppercuts, etc. etc. The game structure allows you to move from one level to another, from one trial to another, at any time. If it becomes necessary to obtain a particular skill to continue towards new stages, then you can select the failed tests from a menu (there are several in each level) and try your hand at them until you get the tokens that will allow you to acquire the new power. Everything is managed in order to increase the difficulty gradually, without sudden changes.

Spongebob Squarepants  The Movie proved to be a surprise in both substance and form. In fact, the game boasts a respectable graphic design: the characters are identical to those seen on TV and boast some really nice animations, while the settings are exactly what one would expect from such a production, with a good use of colors and a style that is very reminiscent of the various Crash Bandicoots, with a hint of Rayman. The thing that amazes most, however, is the solidity of the graphics engine, which very rarely goes into crisis and which gives its best in the course sections, managing to manage thrilling landscapes without problems very quickly and without skimping on special effects. The soundtrack is enriched by the original voices (the version we tested was the English one, but in all likelihood there will be translations for the Italian release) and by a musical commentary that finally stands out for the sympathy and quality of some tracks. All in all, there's really nothing to complain about. To top it all off there is the presence of some nice extras: film trailers, drafts, extra costumes, etc. etc. Comment Given the tradition of tie-ins, in particular those taken from films and/or feature films, as is the case with Spongebob Squarepants  The Movie, it is a pleasure to be faced with products that do not base all their appeal on the acquired license, but which rather offer substance (the game is decidedly long and demanding) and do not forget the aesthetic aspects. The new THQ title, therefore, is proposed as a fixed point within the inevitable merchandising related to the film and not as an anonymous ~more~. Indeed, it represents a good choice for anyone, young or old, who wants to try their hand at a fun, engaging and well-crafted platformer. Pros: Excellent technical realization Some even spectacular sections Very long and demanding Cons: Can transform an altar boy into a crazy blasphemer Collision detection not always impeccable Some rare visual blunders Released in the USA about a year ago, Spongebob Squarepants  The Movie is one of several tie-ins produced by THQ. The settings and the cutscenes naturally recall the plot of the film, which arrived here with a little delay; delay that also affected the release of the video game. Which, it should be clarified, presents itself from the outset as something atypical: from such a title one would expect something mediocre, and instead", "date": "2005-10-13", "grade": null}
