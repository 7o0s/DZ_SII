The driving game developed by Gameloft arrives at the appointment with the fifth episode without disappointing, maintaining the classic arcade approach and adding to what has already been seen really interesting numbers: more than thirty cars, twelve locations, six different events and the support of Gameloft Live for multiplayer and online challenges. Nothing seems left to chance, starting with the control system: we can steer by tilting the iPhone, using its accelerometer, or by touching the edges of the screen. The accelerator is always automatic, while the brake is activated by acting on the relative icon. Similarly, the interface allows us to operate the nitro on multiple power levels (just press the button several times, when we have collected enough boost on the track), pause the race and possibly access our personalized playlist to replace the default music, really not very engaging. Scratch and win After getting to grips with the game through a ~fast run~, we can tackle the career mode and all its facets. Asphalt 5 offers a prize system which, based on our successes, gives us new cars, new girls (yes) and a certain amount of money that can be spent to buy upgrades and customizations. Once on the track, there are six events in which we will have to take part: ~escape~, ~elimination~, ~duel~, ~drifts~, ~chase~ and ~timed race~. Our goal can therefore vary from simply crossing the finish line first to eliminating opponents by rear-end collision, from checkpoint-based racing to skill tests, etc. The twelve available locations are characterized by a massive presence of interactable objects and shortcuts. The latter constitute a very important element in the economy of the game, as they allow us to go less far and therefore to decrease the gap with respect to the opponents who lead the race, or to increase our advantage if we are in the lead. Some of these shortcuts are really fast and spectacular, just think that in one case you find yourself jumping from one building to another and then falling back onto the asphalt. As mentioned above, one has the clear sensation that the scenario bends to our need for speed and satisfies it, in fact it is really rare to stop for any reason: the arcade character of Asphalt 5 translates into rear-end collisions and even violent collisions which, however, they never stop us from competing for the win. Those who prefer simulations must take all of this into due consideration, and add the poor characterization of the individual cars: driving a Mini Cooper in the Gameloft title is not very different from getting behind the wheel of an Audi R8. One, none, one hundred thousand Leaning on a wi-fi network, you can register for the Gameloft Live service with just a few steps and try your hand at the interesting online multiplayer to challenge players from all over the world. We did some tests and unfortunately there are problems related to lag, even if this is probably due to the quality of the host connection. In any case, the potential is considerable and the ~social~ aspects have not been neglected: you can manage a list of friends, compare scores, etc. Speaking of scores, a challenge is announced every week in which you have to drive a certain car on a certain track, trying to achieve the best possible time. The results are then classified from a global perspective. On a technical level, Asphalt 5 is really good: the cars are well made, there is a lot of stuff that moves on the screen and the locations manage to be well differentiated, equipped with a great lighting system and characterized by good use of colors. The jerky problem that afflicted Asphalt 4 has been resolved, so now the frame rate is stable and does not suffer from any uncertainty, even if it cannot be said that it is very fluid: we are probably around 20 fps. More than anything else, the excessive ~glow effect~ that brings out the lighter shades and takes away definition from the graphics in general is a bit annoying: an unfortunate choice. Finally, the sound effects are unfortunately mediocre. The tested version is 1.1 App Store links", "date": "2009-11-09", "grade": "8.2"}
