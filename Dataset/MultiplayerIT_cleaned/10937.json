The so-called ~party games~ proliferate like never before thanks to the intuitive Wii control system, within the reach of the whole family, so much so that practically every software house has created its own line dedicated to this kind of entertainment. The developers of LEGO Star Wars II, the English studio TT (branch of the most famous Traveller's Tales) has created the official video game of the Guinness Book of Records, a title that sees us take on the role of the most incredible characters on planet earth, athletes capable of businesses bordering on the surreal and men gifted with extraordinary qualities. The heterogeneity of the records serves as a pretext as well as inspiration for the very nature of the game: a collection of tests to be overcome and constantly improved, in order to be able to beat the fateful World Records. There are those who balance a bus on their heads, characters who smash watermelons with their heads, there is the greatest number of sheep to be sheared in the shortest possible time, or to reach improbable heights with a mountain bike. All the tests take advantage of the remote control-nunchuk combination, some better than others. It's certainly weird to mimic your legs on the bicycle by swinging your arms, for example. Many of these games are fun, such as the one in which we have to build a building as tall as possible by fitting the pieces that compose it together like in tetris, or another where a sort of modern asteroid is recreated which works by pointing the remote directly at the screen to shoot. Many others, on the other hand, are decidedly uninspired and limit themselves to making us repeat an action sequentially and with the greatest possible speed, in order to cut off any possible discriminant at the origin other than that of mere physical speed rather than any ability manual. Around the world, chasing records! As soon as the game starts, we are asked to customize an avatar that we use to subsequently perform each test. The style and potential are roughly those already appreciated on the new Xbox 360 dashboard: you choose your gender, change your face and hair, and finally choose the type of clothing to wear. Perhaps a useless process, given that Nintendo Wii already has our Miis and it would have been easier to import them. It is also important to change the character's name, because it will be the one that will have to appear on the online rankings and that will allow us to be recognized and appreciated all over the world. After this brief introduction, the real game starts. With our digital alter ego we find ourselves at the center of a three-dimensional globe on which we can appreciate various characteristic elements of the most famous places in the world: the statue of Liberty in New York, the Eiffel Tower in France and so on. The map is used to be able to move from one city to another, where once we arrive we can choose from a range of four challenges, which can be progressively unlocked and all linked to the geographical context we have chosen. Obviously, the maximum potential of the Guinness Book of Records game can be reached by connecting the Nintendo Wii to the internet and thus updating the real world rankings. The real committee that records the records has also promised a special page dedicated to who will be number one in each respective mini-game present, publishing their name in a special section of the book. Whenever we get an excellent time or a satisfactory performance we can call up the Wi-Fi connection menu, send our data and compare them with those already present on a regional, national and world basis, checking the names of our challengers and their records. Want to be number one Both while moving around the map and before the actual games we can read various information on the screen about the real primates existing in the book, faithfully reported in the game. The Guinness Book of Records has been cataloged as a party game not by chance. Although its primary nature is to have the player repeatedly try the same test to try to break records, there is a multiplayer mode that supports up to four people who can battle each other simultaneously, or one at a time in some tests special. It is also possible to play in versus, one against one against a friend on our side. As for multiplayer, there are no online options but you can only challenge friends ~live~. Technically, the game is donewith a pleasant and colorful style, even if once again, sad to say, the real potential of this console has not been exploited in the slightest. Most of the mini-games are two-dimensional, with animations that are often sketchy or badly drawn, even if the characterization of characters, settings and elements on the screen is very captivating and fun. The audio sector is accurate and effective, with cheerful and catchy tunes, and makes good use of the Nintendo Wii remote control speaker, recreating many audio effects directly from the microphone mounted on it. The longevity of this game is guaranteed by 36 very different challenges, the multiplayer options and above all the online rankings. The desire to see one's name on the official Book of Records is a driving force that will push many to remain glued to the TV in the constant attempt to improve and beat the strongest in the world, wherever he is. The Nintendo DS version The Nintendo DS version follows in all respects that of the older brother Wii. The structure is almost identical: characterization of your character, globe on which to move, 36 tests to face and online ways to send your results and compare them with the rest of the world. Most of the mini-games are exactly those of the Nintendo Wii, with the difference that the controls have been adapted to the specific capabilities of the portable hardware. The double screen is used to constantly monitor times and counts, while the touch screen is delegated to the actual game by touching the stylus. Even in the portable version the strengths and weaknesses of this title are the same as the home version. Many games lend themselves to being tackled with the touch screen, while many others simply make us repeat an action endlessly, without being able to affect performance with any manual skill. The beauty of being able to set a Guinness Book of Records while sitting comfortably on the train, or on the bus going to work, however, is too tempting an offer to be dismissed a priori. SCORE: 7.4 Comment The opportunity to be able to set a Guinness Book of Records comfortably seated in our armchair at home (or on the bus going to work, on Nintendo DS), is too tempting a proposition to be discarded a priori. Even those who don't particularly like mini-game collections will have to change their mind: the Guinness game launches a worldwide challenge through 36 competitions in which to compete and where you can prove that you are number one in the world, in your own country or in the belonging region. The games are often fun, sometimes less so, but the colorful and cheerful characterization is always perfect for the genre, while not squeezing the graphic potential of the Nintendo Wii in the slightest. Pros The competition is high, thanks to online Many challenges to face, alone or in multiplayer Colorful and fresh style Cons Not recommended for those who do not play online Many games are not very fun Technically it is very poor", "date": "2009-01-06", "grade": null}
