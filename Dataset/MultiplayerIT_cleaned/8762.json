Gotham City Impostors is a tribute to Monolith Productions, former creators of F.E.A.R. and Condemned, to this franchise, but what you are faced with once you download the gig and nine from Xbox Live is crazy. In fact, you don't play as Bruce Wayne or the Joker but you play one of the many fans of the bat man, the Batz, or the mad criminal, the Jokerz. The protagonist is therefore an ordinary person, perhaps overweight and badly dressed, with a haphazardly assembled costume and wearing a hood made with a cardboard box. Not to mention the weapons: in addition to the classic rifles and machine guns, there are also strange bombs, bows and bottle launchers. But that's nothing, because in reality the real richness of this first person shooter is the excellent possibility of customization that it offers to users. In fact, your alter ego can be customized in a thousand different ways: in addition to choosing the standard and predefined classes (such as sniper, stormtrooper, etc...) you almost feel obliged to indulge yourself with a warrior, man or woman, more or less fat or agile and snappy, and above all heavily armed and made incredibly lethal by the various gadgets available. We are not talking about Batman's latest technologies but about something that comes close to him: capes to flutter between the ledges, roller skates on which to shoot from one side of the board to the other, spring boots to jump higher but also the perfect glasses as a sniper, capable of identifying enemies and signaling them to all their teammates. Great online challenges Starting the game is a bit slow and cumbersome since after downloading the online package you have to register on the Warner Bros site, accept the conditions and privacy and receive an email to confirm in order to enable the display of statistics and rankings. Once this is done, a clear and simple tutorial in a few minutes explains the main gadgets by making them try out in a small arena, and at this point the single player game ends - apart from a challenge mode - since Gotham City Impostors is dedicated exclusively to clashes online. It is therefore necessary to jump into the matchmaking which places us in teams of six players each. And here the joys and sorrows begin. Initially as real rookies it is possible to choose only basic and predefined classes but advancing with the number of games and by starting to kill per kill, perks and new gadgets are unlocked. One of the much mentioned characteristics of Impostors is precisely the high variety of customizations (many exclusively aesthetic) which increase the number of downloadable and purchasable contents. The matchmaking works fairly well, provided however that you face Italian or at most European players. The times we happened to collide with American gamers, the games proved to be intractable due to a lot of lag. The problem is that in the options there is no way to select some geo-location of the game, just as for now it is not possible to deactivate the voices of other users in the lobby (it has been guaranteed that this function will be included in the update foreseen for next month). In addition to the classic deathmatch there are variants of King of the Hill and Capture the Flag, called for the occasion Suffumigation and Psychological Warfare. Xbox 360 goals The 200 canonical points are divided into 12 objectives that are not impossible to obtain but which will surely keep you nailed to the game for some time. Winning games in every map and in all modes, but above all ringing long killing streaks will quickly lead you to complete the required challenges. Crazy customization The maps present have been well made, it is clearly noted that the design has been specifically designed to be able to make the most of all the gadgets available to the protagonists. The six-on-six matches thus prove to be a continuous struggle between open-air clashes, fluttering of fat men who fall from the ledges and sudden assaults. The settings are very successful and reflect the surreal and alienated look associated with the protagonists who populate them, with degraded structures and colors with very bright contrasts. The real problem is that there are only five selectable levels (a new free map has been announced for next month) and after long sessions you feel a bit the need for some new levels to tone downthe monotony. The gameplay is frantic at the right point, it seems like a cross between Unreal Tournament and Call of Duty, you move a lot on the playing field and you die a lot. Dead times are zero. The controls work perfectly and mirror those of the Activision blockbuster: perfect for fps and leaving no doubts about how to move between fights. If, as mentioned, a good part of the fun lies in customizing your player to the maximum, it is clear that this becomes possible by accumulating experience points, unlocking rewards on the field and climbing the level little by little. What turns up their noses is the possibility of facilitating this customization with in-game purchases, which certainly make the character more characteristic and absurd. Function that however we do not appreciate because it seems to us an invitation to ~cheat~. For example, it is possible to take a mascot, absolutely useless for gameplay purposes, which is nothing more than a little creature that flutters around the fighter making it much more visible to opponents. The intent is clear, players who feel strong can unlock it to stand out thus attracting the attention of enemies much more. Well, this mascot is unlockable upon reaching level 100 or simply purchasable. From a technical point of view, peaks of excellence are not reached but the Monolith game does its duty well. It is possible to compete against the other opponents without too many problems, but for our part we would like disconnections to be punished and it is clear that the problem of sporadic ~laggates~ will have to be solved with some tweaks to the net code. Gotham City Impostors is available for purchase on Live Marketplace for 1,200 Microsoft Points. Purchase links", "date": "2012-02-14", "grade": "7.5"}
