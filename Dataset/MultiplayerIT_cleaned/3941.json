{"name": "Sega Heroes", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sega-heroes-recensione.html", "text": "We say it with sadness in our hearts but Sega Heroes, as we will see in this review, is just another example of how Sega sometimes has difficulties in profitably exploiting the real treasure it possesses, with the historians gaming brands that it may have. To add further scorn, it makes even more evident that increasingly substantial difference with the organizational and strategic capabilities of Nintendo, which instead has been able to launch itself into the mobile market and moreover into highly competitive and risky sectors (in terms of the company's image) like gachas and free-to-play. While on the one hand we find ourselves with million-pounding titles such as Fire Emblem Heroes and Dragalia Lost, Sega presents itself with this Sega Heroes which is placed in the most absolute mediocrity due to an abused game structure (although still valid for capturing attention over a few sessions), a rather anonymous graphic characterization and a repetitive mechanics tending almost immediately to grinding. We also reiterated on the occasion of the recent Epic Seven review that some of the fundamental elements of gachas and the like are the construction of an interesting world and an art direction that gives a certain sense to the continuous search for new characters, two elements that in Sega Heroes they have practically not arrived. It is true that this title is based on different principles, focusing entirely on Sega's historical licenses and on collecting linked to the enormous pantheon of videogame heroes in the company's history, but if everything is to be limited to an excuse to collect stickers, you should look for at least to create a frame around it that is pleasant to look at and perhaps avoid making the progression towards the infinity of characters that make up the game universe frustrating. Let's play fig A not inconsiderable problem in building such a game is trying to give a certain stylistic coherence to a universe of characters drawn from deeply different titles, in terms of genres, atmospheres and graphic traits. The same challenge was tackled in a rather convincing way by Disney Heroes: Battle Mode, a game with which Sega Heroes has several points of contact, but which in this situation has achieved much better results than the Sega title, which resolves everything with a style all too linear and anonymous, not even helped by an exhausting repetition of the few scenarios that form the backdrop to the clashes. Where, on the other hand, it succeeds better, even compared to the previous one mentioned, is in the mechanics of the clashes: Sega Heroes bets on the safe side by relying on the good old puzzle game based on the association of colors in full Candy Crush style, with combinations that are reflected in the party's special attacks of fighters illustrated at the top of the screen against the team of enemies. There is nothing particularly innovative in the game mechanics, beyond the characteristics related to the special blocks and the way these are reflected with particular effects in the combat in RPG style, but it's a solid and always effective mechanism to immerse yourself for a few games. The problem emerges in the slightly too slow pace of progression, which combined with the enormous amount of characters to discover translates into a fairly immediate grinding in search of gems and fragments necessary to advance the characters and unlock new ones beyond the simple smooth progress from level to level. This obviously can easily trigger the usual free-to-play traps, also because the base loot is never particularly generous. It is not an energy bar problem, because this is quite large to allow a good number of games even in close sessions, but the continuous repetition of the levels can push even the most tenacious to choose to spend something to get some more substantial rewards and it is not exactly a pleasant practice for the user.", "date": "2018-11-21", "grade": "6.2"}
