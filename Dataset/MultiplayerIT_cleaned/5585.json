Reasons that have discouraged publishers from investing capital in the acquisition of the expensive rights of the US Major League, also considering the economic commitment in producing a high-profile title. 2K Sports held out as long as it could, 2013 to be precise, but the sales didn't give it enough reason to justify the investment. Electronic Arts has instead closed the issue for many years, and it's a shame, since historically it is the one that has produced the best exponents. Therefore, if we exclude minor productions such as R.B.I. Baseball, Sony San Diego Studio remains largely without competition in the continuation of its MLB: The Show sports franchise, which has been in business for a good ten years. If quality has never been lacking since 2006, the efforts made to make the series ever better, sophisticated and with a high simulation rate are surprising, so much so that at home the title represents an exclusive capable of pushing hardware sales. However, Sony has also shown interest in Europe, deciding to distribute the series digitally here too, and at a very attractive price (49.99 euros). If you don't let the wall scare you over, it could be a great opportunity to discover and maybe fall in love with this franchise on PlayStation 4. MLB 16: The Show is probably the chapter of consecration on PlayStation 4 The king of the diamond MLB 16: The Show presents itself as usual in great style, with an introduction made using the game engine, adequately exciting and able to load us at the right point to launch us on the field. Compared to last year there are also changes in the graphic interface, completely redesigned on a style very similar to that of EA Sports products. It is now becoming a standard in sports simulations and we accept it, but the unpleasant feeling remains that those of previous years had more personality, moreover the experience gained by Electronic Arts is now such as to be difficult to replicate by the competition, in fact the design fails to best contain the overwhelming amount of options available, making navigation often confusing. There are several screenshots recycled from the past, a sign that the interface is still an issue for San Diego Studio. The music offers the now consolidated indie set, appropriate to the context and excellent for preparing for the match. The team rosters are obviously updated, as is the possibility of connecting to servers to synchronize the database with the US championship, a paradise for purists. The major innovations of this year are addressed to Road to The Show, the most famous mode and which has in a certain way consolidated the saga, which adds new features such as Showtime and skills. The first, optional, is a slow motion mode that can be activated with the R2 key, which greatly facilitates both serving and receiving tasks. Skills work similar to perks in an online shooter, some can only be used once after unlocking them, but at the expense of the Showtime bar. Resources must therefore be managed with some caution. Other interesting additions arrive within the Diamond Dynasty mode in the form of Battle Royale, which is inspired by the player stickers now standardized by EA Sports and which could almost be a separate release. Also not to be missed are the various mini games, including the Home Run Derby. Contents in industrial quantities The generous 50GB occupied by the game are already indicative of what we should expect from MLB 16: The Show, a disproportionate amount of content obtained from an almost perfect balance between novelty and accumulation work from previous iterations. The things to do and see are practically endless, so much so that it is very easy to get lost in the mountain of menus and customizations, an advantage which however exposes you to potential risks, it is easy to feel overwhelmed by the amount of material on offer, but dedicating a certain effort and attention to options it is just as easy to find that the title tries to adapt to every need. You can truly modify everything, starting from the shots for the hitter and the pitcher, totally independent, but also choosing between different control modes: starting from the classic power bar, now historic, to the Pulse method already experimented in the last chapters, while the choice whether to lean towards a batting system based on the analog stick, or the keys alone remains at the discretion of the user. The sliders are also present, completely modifiablethere. The aid system and the general difficulty move on the same level; there's even a beginner mode that drastically simplifies match management. The purpose of this boundless choice is precisely to gradually introduce the player to the mechanics of the game, a task managed with great precision by Sony San Diego, so much so that the controls all have an invaluable tutorial section. Regardless of all this MLB 16: the Show remains in essence a deeply simulation title, which requires a certain dedication. Even the English language could represent a difficult obstacle for someone, the menus are many and it is difficult to extricate oneself from the various technical terms without at least a minimal basic knowledge. Those who know the series very well will appreciate the improvements of this latest iteration, which resolve many of the flaws found in the previous chapters, leading to a truly commendable general balance. Playstation 4 trophies MLB 16: The Show presents a total of 24 Trophies, to obtain them it is necessary to achieve certain results in the various modes present, such as the Diamond Dynasty and the Battle Royale, but also by carrying out particular actions, such as obtaining a double play, or the simultaneous elimination of two runners, without using the assistance. You can also win some Trophies using the new ShowTime mode, introduced in this chapter. Body and soul A more thorny side of Sony San Diego production is the technical one. Once you take the field, you are amazed by the maniacal care of the presentation, it really seems like watching a game on television thanks to the use of cut scenes and a highly spectacular dynamic direction, supported by a high-level commentary. The stadiums are detailed and the dynamic representation of the timetable allows you to play matches that are truly relevant to reality. You really see everything from the players killing time in the breaks, the mascots and the various roundups in the stands. Particularly striking is the physics of the ball, increasingly sophisticated, and the graphic rendering technique, capable of giving intriguing nuances in the interaction between light and surfaces. On the other hand, defects that denounce the cross-gen nature of the engine, which probably fails to make the most of the PlayStation 4 hardware, cannot be overshadowed. Some textures leave something to be desired, the realization of the players is no longer as impressive as it once was , among other things being dangerously exposed by the excellent definition conferred by the native 1080p, and certain expressions seem lifeless. The aspect that causes greater concern is that of the frame rate, the engine is unable to maintain the standard of 60 frames constant. This is not a significant problem as it could be in a racing title, mind you, but it is a pity to see slowdowns that somehow affect the visual experience. On the other hand, the possibility of using a personalized soundtrack in the game is excellent, beating a homerun with your favorite song makes the game even more exciting. We have encountered a few too many problems online due to the instability of the servers, even if the problem seems to have improved thanks to the 1.02 patch, released in these days.", "date": "2016-04-11", "grade": "9.0"}
