Even just mentioning Steam, everything is really coming out, with an eye very wide open on the thriving youtuber market, the ideal vehicle to give rapid relevance to a production. With this in mind, games such as Emily Wants to Play are developed, a first-person strategic survival that takes some ideas from the highly successful series of Five Nights at Freddy's titles, already small classics in the streaming universe thanks to simple mechanics, rapid executions and great scares, known in the jargon as ~jump scares~. Weapon of excellence in the entertainment horror genre, it consists of a scene meticulously orchestrated to release the viewer's adrenaline after a more or less prolonged period of tension, the infamous ~phone calls~ sequences, or exploited in such a way as to be completely unpredictable. Video games have quickly adopted the technique of jumping on the chair, already tested in the first Resident Evil (who remembers the dog that breaks through the window?), and Emily Wants to Play also manages to make extensive and wise use of it. The most impressive thing is that this tiny but scary game was developed by one person in just four months, using the Unreal Engine. Scares are guaranteed with Emily Wants to Play, will we be able to escape the cursed house? I just wanted to deliver a pizza The incipit of Emily Wants to Play is extremely simple: in the role of an unfortunate pizza delivery boy, we find ourselves trapped in a gloomy house, right where we had to make the last delivery of the day. The entrance door closes behind us, revealing for a moment the disturbing figure of a little girl with white hair. There is no way out, all the windows have been boarded up, while we find moving boxes scattered throughout the house. The suggested idea is that the owners were about to leave the house, and unfortunately during our tragic adventure we will have the opportunity to discover the reasons. Having no choice but to explore the environment, we quickly witness a series of sinister events: doors opening by themselves, subliminal apparitions, strange noises, figures moving in the shadows and the presence of dolls and puppets placed everywhere. Reading a note in the kitchen, we discover that starting from midnight we will become the protagonists of a deadly game: the rule is to survive until six in the morning, if we arrive unharmed at the first light of dawn, the mysterious entity that dominates the house will allow us finally get out. The purpose of Emily Wants to Play is precisely that of pure survival, once we arrive in the house we have an hour to explore it in relative safety (but not tranquility), once midnight strikes, however, the dolls begin to come alive and we will have to understand quickly the right strategy to evade them, considering that there is no combat system. Otherwise instant death will follow after a scary scene. Every hour the difficulty grows with the combined attack of the puppets, to which is added later the Emily of the title, a very dangerous ghost girl who challenges us to a bloody interpretation of hide and seek. We have a limited amount of time to find the baby, after which we will suffer its attack. There is no way to react to the assault, the only way is to find Emily before time runs out, unfortunately also trying to keep her three lethal companions at bay. Easier said that done. Playstation 4 trophies There are only a dozen trophies that can be conquered in Emily Wants to Play, but fortunately (or not?) Most of them can be achieved simply by completing the adventure. However, there are some trophies related to the secrets of the house, including areas that the player must discover to find the recordings of Emily's parents, which provide valuable clues about the story. Good luck! Sleepless night Emily Wants to Play rigorously follows the rules of classic horror, at the same time lending itself to a long series of quotations, including film ones, which demonstrate a true passion for the genre. References to The Blair Witch Project, Sam Raimi's Evil Dead, Stuart Gordon's Dolls and Child's Play are obvious, including the classic haunted houses and ghost girls. On the videogame side are invThere are clear references to the aforementioned Five Nights at Freddy's, P.T. by Hideo Kojima, Outlast and also Gone Home by Fullbright Company. From this, Shawn Hitchcock's title recovers the idea of environmental narration. Even if it is not the focal element of the production, by analyzing objects, reading notes or listening to recordings scattered throughout the house and the basement, it is possible to recover some clues useful for understanding the events prior to our arrival. Don't expect Oscar-winning screenplays, it was certainly not the developer's intention to propose an articulated story like Gone Home, in fact it is possible to play the entire title avoiding these details, which also include secret areas, simply focusing on mere survival. The title is short but intense, each hour has a duration equivalent to 5 real minutes, so it is technically possible to complete the adventure in half an hour, but considering the deaths (you die so much) and the fact that every Game Over At the beginning of the last conquered hour, the bet settles down to around two hours. Despite its brevity, the non-linear structure of the game means that each match is always different, with randomly placed enemies. Even the events of the first hour, those most related to the atmosphere and exploration, are characterized by a dynamic trend that facilitates a new round, even if only to discover some secrets or unlock trophies. Once the house clock strikes midnight, the action begins and the mechanics adapt to what is a real test of survival: the three dolls attack in turn for each hour, then all together and in the final as already mentioned in combination with Emily herself. The puppets consist of a slightly oriental porcelain girl, a clown and the classic ventriloquist puppet. Of the three, the most successful is undoubtedly the first, not only for its disturbing appearance, but above all for the fact that it does not make any noises, except for a sinister giggle, which indicates its presence. As mentioned, the aim is to identify the right strategy for each puppet, suggested by the aforementioned blackboard in the kitchen, but not without a certain irony, since it is clear that the main entertainment of the title remains that of scaring the player to death. In any case, the only way to save yourself is to follow the rules that characterize each of the dolls, all variations of typical children's games, obviously we leave you the pleasure of discovering them. The use of audio is truly commendable, of crucial importance for the gameplay and which requires the use of headphones, obviously amplifying the fright factor. Not everything always works as it should, the random nature of the appearances can lead to situations that are impossible to manage, and the truly essential technical realization does not entirely favor identification. Finally, the level design of the rather small house is designed above all for interaction with the dolls and ends up, after the player gets used to it, to harm the exploratory aspect. The VR potential of the project is undoubted, and in fact, also on the advice of the fans, the developer subsequently included support for HTC Vive and Oculus Rift.", "date": "2016-10-26", "grade": "8.0"}
