{"name": "Worms W.M.D.", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/173149-worms-wmd-vermi-a-pezzi.html", "text": "Although it has existed for twenty-two years and has more than twenty titles to its credit, the Worms series today has far fewer fans than in the past: there are fewer and fewer players online, but it's not a big problem if you have some friends to share the couch, since Worms is basically one of the best elbow-proof party games ever made. The fans who have remained faithful to the franchise had to deal with the innovations that the British boys of Team 17 have tried desperately to implement in an attempt to regenerate a formula that is adored, sure, but a little stale. After having tried the path of 3D, clans and specialized classes and after having fiddled with physics in next-gen consoles, Team 17 has decided to go back to its origins, stripping Worms of all the more complicated frills and focusing the gameplay of W.M.D. about gadgets, weapons, and unbridled customization. Worms W.M.D. it goes back to the roots of the series, and it's an absolutely step back for the better L.O.L. In the approximately thirty stages that make up the single player campaign, to which are added a dozen thematic challenges, Worms W.M.D. struggles to properly explain the functions and purposes of all the gadgets available to our invertebrate guerrillas. Perhaps because they are more than seventy and make up the largest arsenal of the entire series. Unmissable are the explosive sheep, the bandana that transforms the worms into Ryu, the bananas, the kamikaze donkeys; gadgets and historical devices are added to oddities such as the flatulent old lady (sic!) and the cell phone battery that explodes on impact. The weapons are just too many to list them all, and perhaps this represents a little problem in terms of gameplay, since sometimes we find ourselves experimenting with potentially self-destructive devices, risking losing a battle just because we don't know what we're doing with a new one, glittering toy of death. Worms W.M.D. after all, it plays like any other Worms released from 1995 to today: during our worm's turn we can directly control its movements, take aim and use weapons and gadgets to hit enemy targets, reposition ourselves or, even better, destroy the scenario in the attempt to cause some devastating chain reaction that inflicts irreparable environmental damage. The level design is obviously state of the art, even if the unpredictability of the players always risks stranding a stage after reducing it to a slice of Swiss cheese. Interestingly, in Worms W.M.D. practically every action accumulates experience points, and every level up unlocks new gadgets, voices or costumes with which to customize our worms, which we can obviously rename at will. The game allows many possibilities - to say, it is also possible to choose the tombstones that our worms will leave behind after a departure - and Team 17 has really indulged, leaning on a splendid 2D realization that recalls a Sunday morning cartoon. Despite fighting for life, the stages are always very colorful, the animations excessive, the explosions dazzling: if war were fun, Worms W.M.D. would be able to capture its essence better than any other strategy on the market. Playstation 4 trophies Worms' 30 trophies W.M.D. they are divided into 17 bronze, 5 silver and 7 gold awards to which the coveted platinum trophy can be added. Unlocking them won't be easy: you will have to complete each mission with the best rating but also all secondary objectives, defeating enemy worms in particular ways to prove that you are real worms. O.M.G. On the novelty front, Team 17 has found the ideal point of balance between tradition and innovation without unbalancing the classic appeal of the series. Set aside the classes into which the worms were divided in the last few episodes, the Anglo-Saxon developer preferred to focus first of all on the interaction with the environment and then on the possibilities of actual combat. Maps now feature buildings where you can hide from enemy worms. However, it is a risky choice, because inside a club we could find a new weapon or maybe a nice mine ready to send us to the other world. Furthermore, there are weapons capable of penetrating buildings or razing them to the ground, so we are talking about occasional and temporary shelters that serve more to have a moment of peace while planning a new move against the opponent. If the introduction of the buildings has only partially convinced us - also because it is often difficult to distinguish them from the background, with the risk of not being able to find the entrance in time and remain at the mercy of the enemy - we are mmuch more positive towards the brand new artillery emplacements and, above all, the vehicles. At first there is little to say: they offer an exceptional advantage, as long as they know how to exploit them at the right time. And of course they explode too, dealing splash damage. Vehicles, on the other hand, are a feature that we absolutely want to review in the future, perhaps expanded and balanced a little better. Helicopters provide sensational freedom of movement, as long as you remember to land them between turns or else crash. In addition, they allow you to bombard enemies with volleys, and many greetings. Even more devastating are the tanks, capable of moving on any type of terrain and firing deadly broadsides: they have little ammunition and are particularly easy to hit due to their size, but their destructive power is over the top. Mechs are the vehicles that have pulled the short straw, as their melee attacks are the hardest to land if a cunning target is able to defend itself using the right gadgets. In this regard, the most innovative feature of Worms W.M.D. is the crafting: we can consume the materials collected in the maps or obtained by disassembling the gadgets to build other weapons and devices. While crafting is now a ubiquitous element in video games in 2016, in Worms W.M.D. takes on a very interesting strategic substratum. Beyond the somewhat awkward interface, it allows you to keep your opponent on your toes who will know that we are skipping the turn to manufacture something, but not what it is. Thanks to the excellent map editor and the ability to set the parameters to our liking, the multiplayer games of Worms W.M.D. there actually appeared among the most strategic and rewarding of the series.", "date": "2016-08-29", "grade": "8.1"}
