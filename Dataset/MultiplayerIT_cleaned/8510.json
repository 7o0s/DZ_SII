Among all the genres on which this sort of experimentation has been carried out, that of racing games has probably been the path less traveled, for a whole series of reasons: now, the here present Slingshot Racing tries to break this taboo... Slide away The first work of the newly formed Snowbolt Interactive, a small company formed by four former members of Frontier Developments, Slingshot Racing immediately starts off on the right foot, winning the bizarre distinction of being the only racing game for iOS that is controlled using only the tap of a finger . Objective achieved thanks to a truly winning basic idea, whose originality does not end after a few games but keeps its vigor substantially intact throughout the course of the playful experience. The absolute protagonists of the gameplay are some kind of sleds equipped with automatic acceleration that whiz along icy tracks marked by the presence of rotating poles in the center of each curve: the user's task is precisely to press his finger on the screen at the right time to shoot from car a hooked cable which will attach to the structure allowing you to face the turn. Surprising in its simplicity, the Slingshot Racing concept could have become stale after a few games if it had been developed by an incompetent team, a definition that evidently does not suit Snowbolt Interactive: the four English programmers have in fact been able to combine a considerable amount of content to an excellent design, squeezing it all into an application that is really difficult to advise against at the price at which it is offered. To begin with, the game is a small jewel from an exquisitely aesthetic point of view (which reaches its maximum splendor when viewed on the Retina display of the new iPad) and puts steampunk-style settings on the plate with bright colors and attention to the most microscopic details, framed from a bird's eye view and sprinkled with a real plethora of light effects, all made to perfection. The single player career includes the beauty of 64 competitions divided into various categories, ranging from classic races and time trials to more exotic challenges such as those that require the user to collect the gears scattered along the track in the shortest possible time or survive the pursuit of a terrible Chomper. All complete with support for the Game Center and the inevitable Facebook and Twitter, through which you can post your best scores. Having the possibility of accumulating credits to spend on improvements for your car or on extras of various kinds would have been the icing on the cake, but Slingshot Racing is perfectly fine as it is. There is also a multiplayer section exclusively locally, through which a maximum of four users can challenge each other by tapping each one on a corner of the screen: a solution that, for obvious reasons, works much better on the iPad than on the iPhone. But the gameplay in the strict sense is undoubtedly the greatest strength of the Snowbolt Interactive title which - while relying on an extremely simple basic mechanics - does not lack depth, seen and considered how the best results can only be obtained by outlining perfect trajectories and therefore after careful study sessions and practice of the tracks. In this sense, one can only consider as an added value the fact that the tracks have a sophisticated design, that the application lends itself very well to hit and run sessions and that in general the races are all very fun and enjoyable. In short, Slingshot Racing not only represents the execution of a good idea that exhausts its potential once the novelty effect has vanished, but it is in all respects an arcade well made in all its components, capable of involving single player and to ensure some good challenge with friends. Any future updates will only improve an already decidedly rosy situation.", "date": "2012-05-30", "grade": "8.7"}
