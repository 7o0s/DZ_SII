It's a 3D platformer developed by Playful, one of the teams that has supported virtual reality since its inception, with dozens of projects and prototypes. Founder Paul Bettner was among other things one of the five thousand dollar bakers of the Oculus Rift Kickstarter campaign. A fact, this, which allowed him to visit the headquarters of Oculus and to establish relations with the team of Palmer Luckey. Lucky's Tale is also one of the games bundled with the first version of the headset and should therefore be one of the best calling cards of the new technology. But in this launch line-up the problems always seem to be the same. Lucky's Tale is a very nice platformer, but not immune to the typical flaws of the VR launch lineup Friendship? A matter of interests Wanting to talk about a plot in a platform is a bit like looking for psychological insight into a porn. But Lucky's Tale, weak as it is, has one and it would be impolite not to consider it in the slightest. It all started from the friendship between a fox named Lucky and a piglet. However, this is not just any pig and it happens that it is also the personal piggy bank of our dog. The two live happily in their home, until an evil three-eyed octopus kidnaps the punctured animal, leaving Lucky in despair. Now, which of you wouldn't go out of your way to recover such a precious friend, to whom you have entrusted all your savings ... um, dreams? As a good friend that he is, Lucky then sets off in search of his companion, following the trail of coins that the kidnapper has left behind him through the twelve levels of the adventure, which lead to the inevitable final showdown for the recovery of the loot. No, sorry, friend. Could anyone see in all this a veiled criticism of friendship ties based on mutual interest? Perhaps. However, the story is really all here and, despite the title of the game, the fact that the levels are cataloged in a book divided into four chapters makes it rather bizarre. But given that Mario has been there for more than thirty years to demonstrate that it is certainly not the plot that defines the genre, let's move on to see what level design intuitions the developers have managed to derive from virtual reality. Boxes, what a passion! At first glance Lucky's Tale looks like a mix of three-dimensional platforming, with a bit of Super Mario 64 here, a bit of Banjo Kazooie there and, while we're at it, even a sprinkling of Crash Bandicoot. The control system is very simple and is based on a few main actions: jump, double jump, kick and jump with belly bump. So the little fox moves freely within the levels, followed by the camera, looking for lost coins that can be in plain sight or hide inside boxes to be destroyed of ~Peramelian~ memory, be planted in the ground or be invisible until gets close enough for them to show through. The latter mechanic works in collaboration with the viewer and we can only see the coins when we direct our gaze towards the area where they are hidden. The same goes for gems, which help determine your end-of-level score. If the coins are in fact the equivalent of the apples in this specific game world, and allow you to earn a life every time you reach one hundred units, the gems contribute to increasing the final points, together with the number of monsters killed and the way which we reach the rope of the balloon that awaits us at the end of each level. Just like in Mario, the point at which Lucky manages to grab onto the rope gives a bonus, which increases as you reach the highest point. However, there are no scores to beat and in this sense it would not have spoiled an online ranking or base references to get more ~paws~ when a higher score is reached. Clearly inserted to lengthen the so-called broth, these are used to access the more advanced chapters and enough can only be obtained by replaying a few levels in the two additional modes, time trial and red coin hunt. If the second is rather boring, since it creates a parallel level littered with special coins that would have made more sense to look for in the main run, the timed mode is quite interesting. Following a checkpoint route, three time limits must be beaten: bronze is very simple, silver is obtained with a little effort while gold is something bordering on the impossible. There is also a gift package hidden in each of the canon levels, thanks to which a god is obtainedthree-dimensional branch that portrays characters and monsters, to be admired in the main menu. Few but good? As we have already had the opportunity to write, the levels of Lucky's Tale are twelve, plus two boss fights. This means that, despite the extra modes, the game takes about five hours. If the brevity were accompanied by a good overall realization, we certainly wouldn't have anything to say about a game that is offered free to all Oculus owners. Unfortunately, however, this is not the case. In the face of clean and colorful graphics, reminiscent of the aforementioned Nintendo masterpieces of the end of the millennium, the guys at Playful have failed to distinguish themselves from any point of view. The character design is nice but too generic, and Lucky is simply a Tails with one tail less, one more cloak and no specific powers. The levels also don't offer anything innovative and some mechanics are recycled too often, so much so that they can be repetitive even in such a short game. There are small sections in two interesting dimensions, but it's really too little to compensate for the reuse of monsters and the insistence on inserting areas that are unlocked after hitting some targets with bombs. Yes, because the first time it's nice to aim with the head to destroy targets, the second time it can fit and even create a monster, to be killed by throwing its own bomb at it, it is still part of a fun reuse; but if you recycle the mechanics in all levels of the last chapter without increasing the difficulty, then it becomes all too easy to defeat the final boss. And a platformer that's too easy is boring, like a puzzle whose solution you already know. Even the integration with virtual reality in the level design of the title does not go further and we have to deal with it. Lucky's reactions when we approach with the head (and the camera), for example, are in fact a simple side element, which is pretty in the first bars but which adds practically nothing to the experience. Finally, the movement of the camera should also be improved, which causes a slight motion sickness (but you get used to it soon) and which in some phases is too slow, making it frustrating to face the levels in time trials.", "date": "2016-04-11", "grade": "6.3"}
