{"name": "The Journey Down - Chapter One", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/103390-the-journey-down-rasta-power.html", "text": "In 2010, we covered an issue of the Underground column about a game called The Journey Down: Over the Edge. It was a pixelated graphic adventure, one hundred percent old school but traversed by a flash of narrative originality that promised very well. On the other hand, it was only the beginning of a story to be told. Today the SkyGoblin development team offers us a completely revised version of that first successful experiment: thus The Journey Down - Chapter One was born. We'll talk later about what has changed since the first version, available for free on the developer site. First let's get to know the protagonist, Bwana, an idle laggard who, together with his brother Kito, runs a debt-ridden petrol station that also offers charter flights, if the necessary parts are not lacking to get the only plane available to take off. However, the two do not seem to take it badly and postpone the search for a solution until better days. One night, however, Lina, an intriguing university researcher from the nearby city of St. Armando, shows up to them, interested in an ancient book which, coincidentally, possessed Captain Kaonandodo, Bwana and Kito's mentor and former owner of the filling station. Thanks to that book Lina could reach the mysterious Underland, of which even the law forbids to speak. Sensing the possibility of making money and finding the missing Kaonandodo, Bwana offers to accompany Lina to the borders of Underland in his plane. But as in all good plots, there is always a villain ready to throw a spoke in the hero's works. And in this case it is precisely the owner of the electric company that holds the city of St. Armando hostage and has almost bankrupted the business of Bwana and Kito which, let's be honest, was already leaking petrol everywhere. Jamming down at the dock The whole adventure of The Journey Down - Chapter One revolves around the search for the pieces needed to get Bwana and Kito's ramshackle plane back in the air by rummaging around Kingsport Bay. Compared to the freeware version of the game, some screens with new puzzles have been added, but above all we have gone from pixelated 2D graphics to high-definition hand-drawn backgrounds on which the splendid 3D models of the characters move, embellished by an impeccable cell -shading and smooth animations that are rarely seen in this genre of games. After all, the characters are the main attraction of the game. Looking closely at many of you will bring to mind the death masks of Grim Fandango. In fact, it was precisely that splendid, melancholy adventure that ignited the idea of using African masks for the faces of the protagonists in the minds of the developers. The result is surprising: the research done on this kind of tribal accessories has made it possible to create faces that are very different from each other and all equally fascinating. Added to this is a fabulous English dub that finally gives voice to each character's unique speech, with accents and cultural references that make their way around Africa passing naturally from Jamaica. Then add to each character tics, fears and obsessions and we will have a memorable cast like that of the old Lucas adventures. The great merit of the developers was that of not neglecting any of the minor characters, not even those entrusted with a single joke, and of restricting the field of investigation to a few screens, so that everyone can tell their story and offer Bwana the opportunity to reveal his personality. We therefore find ourselves in a very restricted but well-defined, light-hearted and light-hearted world, where tension is defused by the irony of Bwana and Kito, who succeed in the difficult task of eliciting a few laughs aloud. The unusual alchemy of The Journey Down - Chapter One however owes much to the good integration between the vibrant setting and an original game system that dates back to the dawn of graphic adventures. So off with the puzzle in the next paragraph. When it ends like this, it doesn't end like this Sadly though, once you've earned the sky and experienced the thrill of venturing into a forbidden zone, the first chapter of The Journey Down - Chapter One comes to an end. And we only spent two hours in his world of offbeat types and African rhythms. When the second episode will be released is not known. This can only penalize an otherwise powerful game, full of memorable characters and promising adventures in places on the edge of reality. At this point it is also fair to underline that for a game that leaves us speechless as soon as it takes off (in every sense), less clumsy and grounded cinematic sequences could have been madethem more detailed. On the other hand, in many cases this is the price to pay for being independent developers; we are convinced that such a stylish presentation with such ambitious voice acting squashed the SkyGoblins time and energy. Probably the success or otherwise of this first chapter will decide if not the future of the adventure, at least the times with which it will be completed. Whether or not to shell out the requested money and dive into two hours of play and then shelve Bwana and associates until further notice, is a choice that only you can make. However, let us say that if the shopping does not weigh you down, these are hours spent in a great way.", "date": "2012-06-01", "grade": "7.9"}
