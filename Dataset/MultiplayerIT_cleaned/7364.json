{"name": "The Banner Saga", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/127410-the-banner-saga-linverno-e-arrivato.html", "text": "The success of The Banner Saga on Kickstarter has now been talked about on several occasions, including the one that was offered to us by our recent trial of the game, dating back to about three weeks ago. For those who may have connected only now, we briefly recall that the effort of the newborn Stoic Studio team was financed with 723,886 dollars through the crowdfunding platform, to which the trio made up of Alex Thomas, Arnie Jorgensen and John Watson decided to resort in the planning stage. After working on Star Wars: The Old Republic, the three have in fact left the sweet waters of BioWare, a company in whose payroll they appeared, abandoning a slice of the gaming world dominated by publishers to launch themselves into the independent scene; a leap into the void in many ways but, as they declared, also the possibility of breathing new air that would allow them to set all their inspiration in motion, with the obligation to respond only to the backers who have decided to finance the title . After being impressed from the very first moment by his unmistakable style, we followed the development of The Banner Saga with curiosity, until its arrival on the market: the time has finally come, given that today the work created by Stoic is coming to Steam. After all this preamble, we didn't want to miss the appointment with our caravan and its long journey, from which we return to tell you how things went. The fight The battles of The Banner Saga take place through a fairly classic turn system, within which the active phase provides for the possibility of moving the controlled character and then launching any attack. The latter involves two parameters: armor and strength. The first allows you to limit the damage suffered, while the second has the dual function of identifying the amount of remaining hit points, as well as the damage points that the same character can inflict, in the final count determined by the formula ~damage = strength - armor ~. Weakened characters thus end up making attacks that are not very powerful, but they are useful for continuing to scratch the opponent's armor: in fact, with each attack it is possible to choose whether to direct the blow towards the armor or the life points. The basic system is then accompanied by the so-called will points, on which depends the possibility of using the special skills given to each character, who can also spend the same to travel a greater number of squares or enhance a normal attack. However, the early stages of the game explain everything in a comprehensive way. For the common good Heavily inspired by all things Nordic, The Banner Saga universe is populated by three races: humans, varls, and dredges. Obviously there is very little to say about the former, while the latter are a cross between normal men and animals, carried out by a divinity to give life to real giants with human features, but equipped with two long horns on the forehead, as well that of extraordinary strength and the ability to live hundreds of years. Especially in some cases, humans and varls actually barely tolerate each other, but the story of The Banner Saga tells of an alliance born to face the threat of the dredge, beings similar to robots equipped with strong armor. After being confined for a long time to the farthest reaches of the north, following their defeat in one of the Great Wars remembered by the older varls, the dredge are back in charge, flooding the south like a raging river with all their forces: this, together with the onset of a freezing winter caused by a pale sun, seems to portend the end of the world imagined for us by the Stoic. These pre-apocalyptic events intertwine with the story of Rook, a village chief from the east intent on defending his daughter Alette at any cost, along with all his loved ones. As announced by the developers, the development of the plot of The Banner Saga is able to change according to the choices made by the player, who through the 12 hours of play (also confirmed by our experience) is faced with choices of all kinds, some capable of influencing minor events among those about to happen, such as the possibility of gaining resources, others capable of saving lives, or vice versa of leading someone to die. Beyond what is left to the will of the player, rather than following the story of a single character, the story ends up involving whoever is in front of the monitor in its entirety, enticing right from the start to complete everything in one long breath: from this point by sight, the game mechanics are reminiscent of those of the fashion game books a few years ago, agoalso leveraging on the impossibility of saving the game at will, to encourage the player to accept the unfolding of events without the impulse to go back. From this point of view, the choice to also make defeats in combat a part of the story should be read, making them pivot points of the plot: only in some cases, losing a crucial battle will the game be restarted from the last automatic checkpoint. Strategy on the road The Banner Saga recounts a journey of over 100 days, made by the caravan led by Rook and populated by every type of individual that can be encountered along the way. Unlike what was initially thought, the vast game map can only be consulted by the player, who therefore does not have the one relating to exploration of the various areas among the various choices available to him. The story developed by Stoic guides the caravan towards very specific destinations, leaving instead to us the task of organizing the journey, to feed the mouths of the entire retinue, made up of warriors as well as women and children. A perennial hunt for supplies therefore takes place, which are essential in order not to lose the same units that we then find ourselves using in battle: in fact, there are many encounters along the way, as well as the occasions in which we need to put our hands on arms. In case of clashes between groups made up of particularly high numbers, it is possible to choose the type of approach to adopt for the clash, reflected in the different level of difficulty for the clash that we will face in first person. Once in battle, the time comes to get down on what is a real chessboard, on which it is possible to place one's pawns by choosing from the various characters following the caravan at that moment. Compared to the trial version previously tested, it is now possible to also take advantage of the possibility of training in the camp, thus properly testing the amalgam between the components of the chosen formation. The same occasion is also useful for familiarizing yourself with the combat system, to which dynamics we have dedicated a special box. While being able to count on some role-playing mechanics such as leveling up, those who are looking for a certain freedom to customize the characters will be a little disappointed, given that the weapons they possess cannot be changed or upgraded in any way, while there is a single slot intended for items capable of modifying statistics. The latter can be found or purchased, spending the same points that allow us to buy supplies and level up the characters. With The Banner Saga, Stoic Studio shows that real jewels can come from Kickstarter With open mouth The Banner Saga is a real feast for the eyes. The hand drawing created by Stoic's artists really leaves nothing to chance, taking care of every single detail of the various characters, from the main ones to the most insignificant ones. Although most of the events are told with non-animated drawings, the lack of moving images is not felt at all, often leaving the player in awe of the artists' ability to represent a given scene. The movements of the caravan are instead shown on a two-dimensional scrolling level, where backgrounds of various kinds alternate according to the territory visited: also in this case, the work done by Stoic was practically perfect, giving life to what is certainly one of the most visually striking titles in quite some time now. Equally applause is the soundtrack, created through orchestra and voices: it could not be otherwise, given that it was composed by that Austin Wintory able to triumph at BAFTA and VGA 2012 with his work on Journey, as well as get a nomination for the Grammy Awards. While waiting to find out if and when there will be an Italian translation, keep an eye on the texts, because their length (and at times complexity) could make even those who know enough English miss a few passages.", "date": "2014-01-14", "grade": "8.9"}
