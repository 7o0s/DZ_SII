The game in question represents a return to the classic meaning of the genre, complete with destruction applied to the race, rather closely recalling the late Split / Second and something of Burnout, even if everything is dropped within closed circuit races very traditionalist on the track design front. It is basically a question of competing for first place by focusing both on driving skills and on the ability to exploit contextual destructive traps and events, because any means is legitimate to cross the finish line first. A crazy championship Some explosions of Detonation Racing can significantly change the course of the race Dr. Boom is the bizarre figure who is in charge of organizing the Detonation Racing event and who welcomes us on this glittering journey to fame on the track, first explaining the fundamentals of racing and then accompanying us in the various ~seasons~ made up of different races towards the top of the ranking. The rules are simple: it is necessary to finish first and to achieve the goal driving skill is not enough, but considerable cynicism is also required in exploiting the particularities of the tracks. Instead of the classic power-ups, Detonation Racing takes advantage of a system of contextual events that can be activated directly by the players once the appropriate bar has been loaded, exploding stretches of track or activating traps that can hit opponents or open up new roads and shortcuts, making the particularly adrenaline rush. The current season is made up of various episodes, each including a sequence of races supported by a weak narrative track that sees us compete against the main opponent on duty, through races that also allow you to collect experience points to invest in car customizations and upgrades. The single player is certainly the most structured and convincing part of Detonation Racing, which however also offers the possibility of multiplayer for up to four players, which in most cases are reduced to two given the matchmaking system that practically starts the game as soon as he finds an available opponent. Driving skills and destruction Detonation Racing allows you to trigger various ~traps~ along the track, which are particularly spectacular and explosive The driving model is particularly elementary, all based on drifting and the ability to exploit the slipstream of the opponents, trying to set the curves in the best possible way and load the bar for the use of the attacks. In a similar way to what happens in Split/Second and Burnout, Detonation Racing also rewards reckless driving by loading the ~strike~ bar between contrails and controlled drifts, leading to different power levels and thus allowing a slightly reasoned use of these . Unleashing an attack as soon as possible results in a medium-sized event that can damage the opponent nearby, but if the full power of the strike is exploited, it is possible to witness particularly destructive events, which also modify the scenario and can open new paths. but always being careful not to fall victim to the traps thrown on the courses ourselves. With such an approach, the design of the courses is clearly an element of fundamental importance for the game, also because the use of attacks is only possible in certain points of the track, where traps, explosions and various destructive elements are set up. This is a rather limiting feature for those used to strategic use of power-ups according to the more classic Mario Kart-esque tradition, but it is closely linked to the heavy effects these have on the entire race. Once the strikes have been activated, they can significantly change the course of the race even for the one who launched the attack, by inserting obstacles or new roads that cause important changes in driving. This is the only characterizing element for the Detonation Racing tracks, which otherwise don't shine for particular inventiveness as regards the scenarios or the construction of the tracks, remaining rather anonymous and without focusing too much on the ability to take curves and trajectories. Added to this is also a generally simple, cartoony and well thought-out graphic to be able to scale optimally between devices withdifferent capabilities but far from the spectacularity seen in other titles of the genre. The control system is not particularly sensitive but is calibrated for the use of the touch screen: for a game of this kind, the controller remains a highly recommended solution, but the guide does not seem to focus too much on analog subtleties, so it is a fully enjoyable game through normal mobile use. The lack of a rear-view mirror and the map makes it a bit difficult to orientate yourself on the situation of the race, but also given the possibility that this changes in a radical way in a few moves, this can be part of the general randomness of Detonation Racing.", "date": "2021-08-07", "grade": "7.0"}
