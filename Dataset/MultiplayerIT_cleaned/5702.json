{"name": "Le guerre segrete", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/163585-project-x-zone-2-le-guerre-segrete.html", "text": "Released three years ago, the first Project X Zone was also quite successful in the West: the merit was certainly of the brands that crossed paths in what was a somewhat incoherent turn-based strategic RPG, but certainly spectacular and fun. In Japan, crossovers are the order of the day, so much so that the developer of the first Project X Zone, Banpresto, has also and above all become famous for the Super Robot Taisen in which the Gundams and the most disparate super robots of the world fought together. Japanese animation. In the bizarre multiverse of Project X Zone, however, the most popular characters of Bandai Namco, Capcom and SEGA appear: from Ryu to Jin Kazama via Akira Yuki and KOS-MOS. We liked the first episode, albeit within certain limits; some aspects had left us perplexed, in fact, and now that the ball has passed to a new developer - Monolith Soft, the same of the highly decorated Xenoblade Chronicles and Xenoblade Chronicles X - we just have to tell you if Project X Zone 2 has corrected the errors of its predecessor. The universes of Bandai Namco, Capcom, SEGA and Nintendo collide again in Project X Zone 2! Battleworld! Anglophobes can breathe a sigh of relief, because one of the most important novelties of Project X Zone 2 is the Italian adaptation: all the texts and the very long dialogues have in fact been translated into our language with a discreet skill that respected most of the puns and quotes we came across. The location, however, does not save the plot from the pit of nonsense into which it plunges already in the very first minutes of the adventure, even if we have to admit that this time we found ourselves faced with a decidedly more coherent and reasoned script compared to the absurdities proposed in the prequel . The context is always the same: parallel universes have begun to collide with each other and the Shinra agency has run to investigate the new phenomenon, fearing that there is once again the hand of the Ouma. Meanwhile, heroes old and new meet, collide and are forced to form a common front against all the villains that cross the dimensional boundaries: if you dreamed of a game where Jin Kazama and Kazuya Mishima team up to fight the Black Face of Xenoblade Chronicles , Project X Zone 2 satisfies you. Yes, because the new cast says goodbye to some of the heroes that appeared in the first episode - such as the protagonists of Valkyria Chronicles or Shining Force EXA - to welcome new ones, including the stars of some of the most famous Nintendo RPGs of recent years: it is the case of Chrom and Lucina from Fire Emblem: Awakening, for example, while the android KOS-MOS is now paired with none other than Fiora from Xenoblade Chronicles. They are not the only new entries, of course, and many of the old pairs have also been restructured or completely distorted. Morrigan is now paired with Demitri while Estelle from Tales of Vesperia has become a single unit, and these are just the first examples that come to mind. The dynamics of the new couples is quite interesting, and Monolith Soft has renounced some iconic characters to offer greater variety in terms of franchise, touching a negligible narrative depth that is based above all on the interaction between the heroes and the most diverse ~villains~ and on the countless jokes and quotes from video games, comics and cartoons that follow each other at a rapid pace between one mission and another. In this sense, Project X Zone 2 is a title dedicated also and, perhaps, above all to nostalgics who will recognize details in the maps and enemies that dot them that sometimes even date back to old arcades such as Captain Commando. This does not mean that the script would have really needed a streamlining, given that the interlude sequences often go on for too long, taking the player to exhaustion when the characters go around and around the same concepts. Considering that only a small part of the dialogues are fully spoken - in Japanese - and that for most of the time you are reading endless exchanges between small and rough immobile sprites, you have to admit that you have been a bit too often tempted to press the Start button to skip the turn sequence and move on to the next mission. The 3D effect As in the previous episode, once again the stereoscopic effect is limited to highlighting the interface and the sprites of the characters during the most spectacular special shots. For the rest it offers a decent depth when framing isometric maps. It almost looks like a fighting game On the gameplay front, not much has changed, but Monolith Soft has well thought out to bring dethe far from marginal improvements to the game dynamics, making them significantly more intricate than the first episode. The watchword is customization: between one mission and another, in fact, we can micromanage our units, equipping them with objects found - or purchased at the brand new shop accessible at any time - or perhaps by changing the single units that accompany the couples. If you prefer Heihachi Mishima to accompany his son Kazuya and grandson Jin instead of Kazuma and Goro, feel free to change the pairing. Now it is also possible to enhance individual normal and special attacks by spending the points accumulated by fighting, as well as try a kind of training mode that allows you to test the various combinations and learn the timing and special properties of each attack. Also in Project X Zone 2, in fact, it is important to attack at the right time to keep the enemy off the ground for as long as possible, inflict more damage and charge the Cross energy indicator faster, even if the latter has stopped to be the crucial resource of every mission. Apart from the fact that now you only need to reach 100% instead of 150% to unleash super attacks, field skills such as boosts and healing now use a completely different meter that recharges over time, offering the player a greater variety in terms of actions and reactions. The Cross indicator is still used to defend and counterattack, however, and in combat it can be partially discharged to perform a new technique called Mirage which slows down the enemy's animations, allowing us to chain our attacks more easily, especially if the screen has become a triumph of explosions, particle effects and sprites that jump from all sides. In this regard, Monolith Soft has also implemented a very simple mechanic: if you don't use a certain attack during a fight, that same attack will inflict more damage in the next fight. It is a dynamic whose importance begins to feel only after a few hours of play, when all the key combinations have been unlocked and you can take advantage of a greater variety of attacks: even if at the beginning it seems like an idea all in all superfluous, over time we begin to come across increasingly tough enemies who require the strategic use of attacks that inflict anomalous states and the intervention of support units that can be recalled by pressing the back buttons. In those cases, deciding the order in which to attack during our turn, so as to enhance a certain attack of the unit that will face a certain opponent, can make the difference between victory and defeat, and it is then that Project X Zone stops to be a kind of fighting game to take on the contours of a real strategic RPG. In this sense, the guys from Monolith Soft also felt compelled to patch up one of the biggest flaws of Project X Zone, even though they didn't completely succeed: we are obviously referring to the excessive length of the advanced missions, unfortunately inherited from the Super Robots Banpresto's Taisen, which ended up taking the player to exhaustion, deploying dozens and dozens of very strong enemies on several occasions. In Project X Zone 2 we were pleased to see that the missions are much shorter and more balanced and that the maps often offer pitfalls and simple puzzles to be solved between one battle and another. Monolith Soft, however, has also weakened the various enemies in general: on the one hand this change has made the missions smoother and less frustrating, but on the other it nullifies the importance of all the other game mechanics for many hours, since the Weaker enemies fall within a couple of attacks at most. If it is true that the advanced missions are decidedly more demanding, it cannot be denied that to get there you have to go through a much milder concrete portion of the game.", "date": "2016-02-17", "grade": "8.2"}
