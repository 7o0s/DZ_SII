{"name": "Blacktail", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/blacktail-recensione.html", "text": "The charm of fairy tales survives the passing of time and changing tastes. Today as centuries ago, they enchant children, adolescents, adults and the elderly. Those who choose to delve into the genesis or folkloric roots will also notice that the original versions are very different from the current ones. Many fairy tales, at the beginning, were much more obscure than today; we basically read a sweetened version of it, often keeping only protagonists and contexts. But there are also enemies who were born evil and remained so, such as the witch Baba Yaga. The presence of Baba Yaga is a constant in Eastern European popular literature. Inspired by such a famous character, the developers of The Parasight - many of them veterans of Bloober Team - have seen fit to weave a story around it never told before, even setting it in an open world, now available on consoles and PC: Blacktails. ~Even~ not because there are laws to prohibit it, but because The Parasight is to all intents and purposes an indie team and we know how much care, work and resources open-world titles require. think of the recent Assassin's Creed Valhalla, probably to date, due to its vastness, the greatest exponent of the genre. The following is the review of Blacktail, the result of about twenty (or so) hours of play on PlayStation 5. If they seem few to you, continue reading, so as to understand the nature, dimensions and structure of this curious incursion into the lands of Fantasy. The story: Baba Yaga and a mystery to unravel The world of Blacktail will be able to enchant you in minutes Blacktail narrates the origins of the witch Baba Yaga. A vague sense of uncertainty and disquiet hovers over the whole story, and this is good because both guarantee the unexpected charm of the entire production; the narration itself in the first moments is not entirely convincing, but after a couple of hours you will be literally glued to the screen because you will want to know more about this strange girl, Yaga, and the fate of her sister Zora. obscure points of the story. Yaga has manifested strange powers, and an incident has occurred in the village where she lives with her sister; Zora then disappeared from circulation. In order to return to her home, Yaga is therefore looking for her, but the girl seems to have evaporated into thin air. In all this, Yaga continues to wear a disturbing mask on his face all the time, and to make matters worse he hears a Voice - they are the constant advice of a real supernatural being, of a witch of the woods, who does not seem have a physical consistency. We can't tell you more, but know that the whole adventure consists of this: in the search for Yaga's sister, who along the way will decide, as they say, ~what job she wants to do when she grows up~. That is, whether to embrace the path of light, acting for the good of the world of the forest, or of darkness, thus showing itself to be unscrupulous and exploiting every living being in order to achieve one's goals. The choice will be up to the player, who will have to select certain options during the dialogues or perform certain actions. Even small, even seemingly insignificant: if a bird gets trapped in a carnivorous plant, do you prefer to hit the plant by killing both or find a solution that allows you to free the trapped creature? The game world is then full of more or less relevant secondary characters: Gnolls (sort of fairy-tale trolls), gigantic mushrooms (as creepy as they are... talking!), bloodthirsty ants, larvae that manage the local market, honey-hungry dragons and every other possible oddity. The setting is absolutely perfect and coherent with the fairy-tale world of Eastern Europe, disturbing and constantly oscillating between sunny and nocturnal atmospheres. The story can be completed in around twelve to fifteen hours, depending on how far you want to explore the surroundings. The game world: an open world? In Blacktail you will find enemies everywhere, so be careful while exploring The Blacktail game world may seem to all intents and purposes an open world, and in a certain sense it is, since you can explore in (almost) absolute freedom an extensive game map, well-finished and pleasantly full of characters, events , items and missions. However, continuing the adventure a little, one also realizes the limits of the offer: the map is not exceptionally vast, it takes just a handful of minutes to cross it from one end to the other and above all to continue it is sufficient to follow the indications moving from point A to point B. In short, one immediately gets the impression of being faced with an indie production, or which in any case cannot in any way andmatch the results of true triple AAA in the open world. This is not necessarily a bad thing: the developers wanted to recreate a fairytale context in which the player could immerse himself. Sometimes recycling a little too much the same settings, natural elements, and enemies. Immerse yourself, but don't ~get lost~, that's the point. In Blacktail you are really always driven: the main offering is the story and this story is the common thread between places and events, the constant reference point that the developers never want you to lose. Everything else is a pretext, it's an accessory: the item creation system, based on the accumulation of resources, has none of the depth or possibilities you might expect. Any useful element is literally everywhere: opening the inventory every two by three, because the arrows are finished and therefore you have to put those damned twigs together, it's more annoying than anything else. The witch's black cat-based fast travel also left us a bit perplexed: it's almost worth it on foot, it doesn't take long anyway. The only really important place is Baba Yaga's house, because in that giant cauldron it is possible to unlock the protagonist's new abilities, bringing special recipes and ingredients. Gameplay: A first-person adventure If you like archery, Blacktail is the game you've been waiting for a lifetime Blacktail, as we said, is a first person adventure (it is not possible to switch from first to third as in Skyrim or Fallout). What's more, the protagonist has only one weapon, the bow - the types of arrows can change, magic tricks can be added with the glove provided by the Voice, and other gadgets can also be used in battle such as the Broom, useful for lure enemies to one spot. But the bow reigns supreme: the arrow is nocked, the arrow is aimed, the string is stretched, the arrow is shot. You get used to it, even on consoles, it just takes a little practice. And yet there are some really unbalanced spells: at a certain point, taking advantage of the ~obscure~ moral choices, we unlocked a technique for absorbing the energy of the enemies. It is sufficient to hold down a command, and the beam automatically steals life force from them to give it to us. From that moment on, we kept it in action throughout the exploration, no longer caring about the minor monsters, who agonized on the ground in a few seconds. It's just an example, but it gives you an idea: not even the skill tree is cured who knows up to what point. On the other hand it guarantees different approaches based on the style of the equally different players (provided that you are satisfied with the bow, because there is really no remedy for that). The exploration system on many occasions has shown itself to be fairly punitive, and this is a good thing, because it favors sensible progress within places where you venture for the first time; game over is also quite frequent. The survival elements require that you find resources in every place to create your own tools (above all the indispensable arrows) and that you hunt wild animals to restore vitality and health. Not even this is fundamental - not with the magic that steals life from enemies, not with the berries that grow everywhere - and therefore we return to wondering why introduce mechanics that can be safely ignored.", "date": "2022-12-19", "grade": "7.0"}
