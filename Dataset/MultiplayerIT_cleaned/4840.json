The franchise created fifty years ago by Gene Roddenberry has always experienced a fame studded with multiple ~high~ phases often followed by thunderous falls in interest. And so if on the one hand the Disney saga is now back in the limelight with a new series of annual film episodes, accompanied by a couple of respectable videogame productions, for Star Trek we are all waiting for the new TV series produced by Netflix, Discovery , which shouldn't make us miss the best times of Kirk and Picard. In the video game field, however, it must be admitted that the brand has not fared very well in the last decade. If we exclude a handful of unsuccessful attempts on mobile platforms, the disputed Star Trek by Digital Extremes from a handful of years ago and the surviving Star Trek Online, which still enjoys a decent fan base to be honest, it is really hard to think of some really exciting title. It is also, but not only for these reasons, that we have always looked with interest at Ubisoft's attempt to return to exploiting this brand by adding, among other things, the virtual reality variable and after a handful of opportunities to try the game in a controlled environment, taking advantage of the various trade fairs, the time has finally come to get your hands on the final version. Armed with PlayStation 4, PlayStation VR and high hopes, we then donned our skintight, colorful suits to play as the crew of a Starfleet ship. Follow us to find out how it went. Playstation 4 trophies Star Trek: Bridge Crew offers 33 trophies. The golden four require quite complex conditions to fulfill such as rescuing 120 people in the Kobayashi Maru challenge or successfully completing a battle with at least three opposing ships at the same time. There is also a trophy that requires completion of the campaign and each type of Ongoing Voyages mission. The thirteen silver trophies require other specific conditions to be met, generally simpler and the same goes for the fifteen bronze ones which can often be unlocked even just by carrying out the most basic tasks of each station. Then there is the classic platinum trophy. Captain's log The game concept of Star Trek: Bridge Crew is really basic and immediate. We are aboard the USS Aegis (codename NX-1787) and at the controls of the four main roles of the crew, we will have to face a narrative campaign and an endless series of procedural missions. The key element of the gaming experience is virtual reality since the title can only be played with a viewer; on consoles this means that the title is available on PlayStation 4, while on PC we can switch from Oculus Rift to HTC Vive at our discretion. The adventure is set in an unspecified period of Star Trek continuity, by eye we would say that we are moderately close to The Next Generation era. Our mission is to explore and chart an unknown area of space called The Trench in search of a livable planet to transport the now decimated Vulcan population. We are well beyond the neutral zone and the main threat is represented by the Klingons, who are also interested in setting up in this area, probably to build an outpost of the empire. Specifically, we will be faced with a campaign consisting of a prologue, complete with a Kobayashi Maru challenge that is impossible to complete and can be repeated as many times as you want, and five incremental unlock missions. Let it be clear that we are not faced with a particularly developed narrative or engaging interlude sequences. The missions have a very simple incipit told verbally and act as a pretext for us to familiarize ourselves with the controls of the ship and with the situations in which we can come across and flank the short tutorial composed mostly of texts and indications for specific tasks. The real heart of the game is in fact represented by the Ongoing Voyages mode. It is a fairly classic system of procedural missions that can be carried out indefinitely and which belong to four specific strands. In fact, we find defense missions, where we will have to line up in defense of some Starfleet ships, recovery, where we will be asked to intercept and capture a fugitive Klingon, rescue, with the aim of recovering as many survivors as possible from a catastrophe and research, the simplest and ~lightest~ missions since we will only be required to scan planets and anomalies. Unlike the campaign, this mode can also be tackled on board the original Enterprise which will allow us not onlyto have access to a particularly faithful and fascinating reproduction of the command bridge of Kirk's ship, but also to significantly increase the difficulty of the experience given that the ancient NCC-1701 has very few screens and a sea of big buttons with no visible indications. Helm, set a course to Voktar system. Engage! But how does Star Trek: Bridge Crew actually work? In fact, if from a point of view of setting and history Red Storm Entertainment, the developer, limited himself to doing his homework, it is certainly in the gameplay that the title takes on its own distinct personality. The title can be played with up to four players, in cooperatives, and offers a fairly responsive drop-in, drop-out system with computer-controlled bots that quickly take the place of companions who ended up offline or who decided to leave us in space. We will therefore be able to put on the role of the captain, a key figure on the bridge and the only essential element for setting up and starting a game, and then managing the objectives, targets and above all commanding the other team members. This will be our obligatory role if we decide to play alone since the computer, in fact, cannot (or is not able) to perform this task, probably representing the main limitation of the experience if you want to play a quick solo match . Then there is the helmsman, in charge of setting the routes for impulse and warp navigation and of concretely commanding the ship during movements within a sector by acting on the controls and acceleration. Another position is that of the tactician who is responsible for managing the shields, phasers and photon torpedoes, but also the scan and probes and obviously the targets to frame. The engineering that will have to manage the division of power between weapons, shields and engines closes the circle, possibly acting on the manual upgrading of the various systems, but also the repairs and the activation of the warp core in view of long-range movements. As you can imagine, there really is something for everyone and it's quite easy to get caught up in the situation, especially if you are a longtime Star Trek fan. But right here lies the main criticism of the experience. Criticism obviously inherent in the entire play system. Bridge Crew is a title that is based on shared experience to the point of requiring a constant mandatory connection even if you decide to play alone. It is essential to communicate with other players by voice and obviously the quality of your teammates determines the enjoyment of the match. Having people who don't speak or don't listen, haven't played at least the prologue or simply sat reluctantly at their workstation, means getting ready for at least twenty minutes of frustration and boredom (this is the average duration of a mission). On the contrary, playing with a group of friends or with people who perhaps even embark on healthy role-playing recovering official expressions of command and accepting orders, means finding yourself in an instant in an episode of one of the many TV series based on the series . However, there remains a certain imbalance between the positions: being at the controls of the ship has enormous charm while the engineering position seemed the ~sadst~ to us since, until we find ourselves in battle or in some really critical situation, you will spend most of your time looking at the energy distribution icons, without having anything concrete to do. A real holodeck? There are also a couple of additional activities that can be performed from all posts except the Commander. The first concerns teleportation and does not require much explanation, the other instead allows you to sneak into the defensive and offensive systems of previously scanned enemy ships to temporarily disable weapons, engines, shields, sensors or transmissions. This is an interesting element of the gameplay, sometimes required by some missions, because it allows you to perform very interesting tactics if you are within a close-knit group. It also allows you to take advantage of a peculiar element of the Aegis: the possibility of reducing emissions so as to enter a sort of stealth mode and get as close as possible to the enemies without being identified. In fact, it can be useful to synchronize to send the shields of a Klingon bird of prey offline to immediately hit the ship's paraphernalia with a long phaser discharge (yes, it is possible to target specific systems) so as to disable it and quickly render a threat harmless. From a technical and graphic point of view Star Trek: Bridge Crew never manages to stupire. While offering nice exterior views and a great depiction of the interiors of both ships, complete with uncommanded crews holding conversations, acting on their panels and going ashore during the most dramatic combat, everything feels graphically dated. The animations are basic, the models woody and chalky and the textures bordering on the acceptable. This speech also joins the customization of the avatar made up of gender, race (human or Vulcan) and a handful of faces and hairstyles to choose from. On the other hand, the management of the virtual reality helmets is excellent with the movements of your avatar which are reproduced in a very faithful way including even a fictitious movement of the lips when we speak with the microphone. During our test we used two PlayStation Moves for hand management but the title can also be tackled easily with a DualShock (or any controller on PC). It is obvious that for greater immersiveness, using the Move or the 3D controllers of the Vive or the Touch of Oculus is highly recommended, also because the only action that can be done is to press the various touch screens or buttons of ours with your fingers. location. We also thought the netcode was very good since, although the game had yet to hit the market during our test, we always found someone to join for a quick match. From this point of view it is essential to point out that the title allows you to choose in which region to carry out the matchmaking (America, Asia, Japan, Europe) and also to select the preferred language for communications. Unfortunately, Italian is completely absent, including the game interface and dialogues, and therefore if you don't speak English, get ready for sound figures of silence, unless you have friends equipped with everything necessary to keep you company with Bridge Crew. It is also important to point out that the title implements cross-platform: this means that you can play easily even with friends who own a PC and Oculus or VIVE. A choice by Ubisoft that must be absolutely rewarded and that demonstrates once again how much the market could benefit from it if all the software houses followed this path.", "date": "2017-05-29", "grade": "8.0"}
