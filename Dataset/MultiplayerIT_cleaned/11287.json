{"name": "Prison Break", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/prison-break.html", "text": "With the fourth series in the pipeline, ~Prison Break~ is confirmed as one of the most interesting television series of recent years, also in Italy. The plot of the show revolves around the story of two brothers: the first, Lincoln Burrows, is unjustly accused of murder and sentenced to death; the second, Michael Scofield, finds a way to get locked up in the same penitentiary, with the intention of organizing an escape. Numerous other characters end up in the story, who learn of the plan and want to contribute to earning themselves an exit ticket too. In this mobile tie-in we will see more or less a transposition of the first season, with Michael having to find his brother first and then figure out a way to escape. The game is an adventure interspersed with action sections and small puzzles. Right from the start we will have to interact with the other inmates to obtain information about the prison and useful tools for organizing the escape, which can also be created with the combination of several objects. The control of the character is entrusted to the joystick, while the 5 key is used to interact with the environment, a setting that varies during the action phases and when it is necessary to solve small puzzles. In this mobile reduction of Prison Break we will find many textual contents, which try to faithfully reproduce the story narrated in the show, and a structure that takes the player by the hand and leads him towards the various objectives each time, without the possibility of making a mistake or to run into dead phases, even at the expense of the challenge and playability. We will therefore find ourselves almost as spectators while a very simple and very linear adventure unfolds on the screen, the monotony of which is broken by alternative situations which, however, are not always managed in the best way. The interface gives us the possibility to check, at any moment, the objects present in the inventory, the map of the area (if available) and our current mission. Michael's ~day~ is divided between the hours of air, in which he has to talk to the other prisoners and define the escape plan, and the night, when he can take advantage of the absence of the guards to dig channels and physically approach the objective. The technical implementation of the game is excellent, in particular it demonstrates the ease with which the Vivendi developers engage with the design and animation of the sprites: the characters in Prison Break are all well done, with a good level of detail and, above all, , smooth and convincing animations. The interface always appears very legible and it is possible to navigate among the objects without problems, while the locations, in spite of what one might believe, are quite numerous and very different from each other. The sound sector consists of a small selection of MIDI music, unfortunately very anonymous. Finally, as far as the control system is concerned, the response to commands is always immediate and precise, even when timing is essential (as in minigames in which you have to press the right key at the right time, for example). PRO Great graphics Very faithful to the show Numerous ~action~ phases AGAINST Too easy Limited structure Where would the fun be?", "date": "2008-07-23", "grade": "S.V."}
