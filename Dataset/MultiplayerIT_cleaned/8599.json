An RPG originally released on PC with an immersive and irresistible atmosphere, a dense plot full of twists and turns, graphically with very few rivals on the market and a gameplay with a clear action twist, especially when compared to the original, but capable of giving great satisfaction once you try it firsthand. Already in the ~distant~ May of 2011, when the title arrived on our computers, the decision of the Polish developer was evident to wink at a more mass audience, perhaps oriented to console gaming through a series of design choices that initially they frightened the fans of Geralt the witcher, but which very soon proved to live up to expectations and able to rejuvenate a gameplay which, in the first chapter, lacked dynamism and immediacy in the combat phases. During our review we had pointed out how much The Witcher 2 was even more pleasant to play with a joypad rather than with the combination of mouse and keyboard, getting a good number of criticisms for this bold statement. Now this choice is no longer available given that on Xbox 360 the game can obviously be controlled only with the pad but a whole series of small improvements and tweaks that the software house has implemented in this poor year of work are immediately noticeable and , we are not afraid to be proven wrong, they are able to make The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings, a gaming experience that all RPG lovers absolutely cannot miss. Where were we? It is not easy to review a title about which we have already written a lot in the past, which is why we have decided to readapt our original review to take into account all the changes made over time by the developer on the PC version and obviously dedicating ample space to the full-bodied news of the 'Enhanced Edition reviewed here. This, we remind you, in addition to arriving for the first time on the Microsoft console, will also be released on PC in a dual format: on the one hand as a normal physical or digital package that can be purchased at a truly competitive price, on the other in the form of a free patch, downloadable by those who already own the original release. The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings perfectly follows the story told in the first chapter of the series by taking advantage of a small time gap of just six months. Geralt, the protagonist, is no longer human raised with magic and mutations whose goal is to hunt and kill abominations and monstrosities, also thwarting any curses. All in the pay of regents and wealthy families who request it. He is a witcher, Italianized with the word strigo, extremely competent in the use of swords, strong and resistant to wounds and with the ability to handle a particular form of magic, the signs, which populate the imagination of a fantasy world with particularly dark. Dwarves and elves are ghettoized, kept away from city life by humans while wizards are barely tolerated within an ecosystem held up by weak balances and ruthless power games where a huge empire rules with an iron fist the southern lands as five different kingdoms compete for the management and domination of the northern part of the world. The Enhanced Edition finally offers a real tutorial that can be tackled optionally and which allows you to become familiar with all the game controls and menus, also offering a microscopic narrative substratum to the arena mode, the other substantial addition of this edition (actually already seen with patch 2.0 for the PC version). This is CD Projekt's interpretation of the inevitable Horde, selectable from the game's main menu and completely untied from the single player campaign. Through rounds of increasing difficulty we will be able to upgrade Geralt's equipment, level it up, buy equipment and even hire battle companions (there are three different ones with increasing costs based on their power). The game action of the Arena is obviously frenetic and allows on the one hand to properly master the fighting style of The Witcher 2 and on the other to demonstrate to the whole world, or at least to one's friends through an online ranking one's competence in battles through a score that takes into account the speed of killing, the variety and even the use of the scenario since using the signs properly will be possable to throw one's opponents into the void. Story Boosts The narrative plot of the game is divided into a prologue, three acts and a short epilogue that will guide us by the hand through the upheavals of the world of Temeria and the slow but inexorable return of Geralt's memory. But we tell you right away that the abundant thirty-five hours of play that were necessary for us to complete this new Enhanced Edition will not be enough to answer all the questions concerning the witcher, the beautiful Triss, her sorceress travel companion and all the gang that rotates around the protagonist given that a third chapter of the series appears absolutely inevitable once the adventure is completed. The plot, as in the predecessor, is extremely adult in tone, language and scenes represented (there are numerous and daring sexual encounters as per tradition) with the indisputable plus of putting the player in front of numerous behavioral and moral choices where there is no never a clear division between acting for good or for evil, but rather on the basis of one's mood and the empathy that is created with the various supporting actors that Geralt will meet along his path. There are sixteen different endings that we will be able to witness and on many occasions we will find ourselves faced not with simple plot crossroads with different quests, but even with differently explorable areas and completely different situations in terms of activities to be carried out. We can therefore guarantee that you will not disdain to start the adventure at least a second and maybe even a third time to admire a different point of view of the narrative canvas. Fundamental addition of the Enhanced Edition of The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings and therefore the real spearhead of the Xbox 360 version is the presence of a handful of new secondary quests that will enhance the third act of the game, the one most criticized by those writes in the course of the first review. As a result it no longer seems to be faced with a hasty epilogue but most of the final events will be better told and above all some narrative implications will be more easily understandable. CD Projekt's decision to implement even a handful of new interlude sequences to better explain what actually happens between one act and the next and in the vicinity of some crucial quests is commendable. A lack that we had previously pointed out and which could leave all those players stunned who did not have any book by Andrzej Sapkowski, the creator of the Geralt saga. Xbox 360 owners obviously won't be able to notice this change but, luckily for them, they will find themselves faced with a story that is now much more fluid and coherent even if the developer's decision to end the sequel with such a powerful cliffhanger still does not convince us. Xbox 360 goals The game offers 50 achievements for the classic total of 1000 obtainable points. A small part are related to completing the single player campaign with the largest quantities unlockable by completing the adventure on the highest difficulty level and reaching the 35th experience level. Three objectives are instead related to the arena mode but the vast majority of achievements are obtained with particular actions such as killing multiple enemies without ever being hit, using bombs to take out opponents or destroying all monster nests . Talk and punches The title is strengthened by a huge number of dialogues, all strictly multiple choice and where it is always clear which answer will make the adventure go on and which ones instead serve as insights for the player hungry for insights. There are some timed responses especially in situations of greater ~anxiety~ and a handful of additional options represented by the use of persuasion, force or deception that will allow you to resolve some more complex situations sometimes by quickly killing an opponent or on the contrary avoiding of the fights. And since we mentioned them, let's talk about the most action aspect of The Witcher 2: the clashes. These are managed through two different types of blow, the classic slow but powerful and the fast but weak one, with a button to perform the somersault that also acts as a dodge, another for the parry, a button to launch the selected sign and another again for the use of thrown weapons and traps. All this is joined by another command that leads to the appearance of a particular radial menu that allows the player to select the predefined sign and ranged weapon, to unsheathe one of the two white weapons or to access meditation. All rigorously in real time with only a slow motion effect to allow for a slightly more reasoned selection but miles away from the typical tactics of the tactical pause that we find in the most classic RPGs. This aspect of the game highlights most of the improvements implemented with the Enhanced Edition which obviously will be immediately evident to those who have already played the ~smooth~ version on PC. First of all it is now possible to lock the opponent by holding down the left trigger. In this way you enter a sort of Z-Targeting of Zeldian memory (even if the view remains freely rotatable) which allows you to precisely target a single enemy both through the signs and with the slashing of the swords. Through the lateral movement of the right analog it is then possible to move from one opponent to the next. All this is then combined with a significant increase in the response speed to Geralt's commands which is now much more reactive and less wooden in animations than previously experienced. The result is a much more frenetic experience, probably less tactical, but which certainly manages to make the player feel more in control of the situation and of his avatar, especially when the situation becomes more complicated in terms of the number of opponents on the screen. There is still a certain lack of feedback in the blows but at least, now, our attacks are not frustratingly interrupted by the actions of the enemies and the ricochet effect that was felt every time Geralt ended up on the ground and tried to get up has been greatly reduced in front of an enemy of generous dimensions and blows. Similar positive words can also be spent on the level of difficulty finally implemented consistently throughout the experience. Now the game is able to offer a lasting challenge that takes into account the enhancement of equipment and talents in the long term and above all that manages to be more permissive in the first hours of the gameplay. Dying is certainly more difficult than in The Witcher 2 of the past but absolutely not impossible, especially if you venture into danger without first preparing for combat with potions and ointments. The title thus maintains its bite when unknown territories are explored for the first time and often manages to keep the player in suspense thanks to both an automatic and manual save system which cannot, however, be used during a fight. Where, on the other hand, the gameplay clashes loudly is in the clashes with the larger monsters, fortunately a minority within the gaming experience and managed in part with boring and obvious quick time events. The same also applies to the fistfights in which we will sometimes find ourselves involved (they are one of the three mini-games included in the title, together with arm wrestling and dice, all frankly forgettable) and which will be resolved by pressing the indicated key at the right time. Frankly redundant and completely unrelated to the rest of the gameplay. So it's an RPG?! The Witcher 2 presents itself as a rather atypical RPG. The protagonist, Geralt, is set in stone: his physical appearance cannot be customized and there is no class system. The witcher is in fact a rather classic warrior capable of using two white weapons, in particular two two-handed broadswords (even if theoretically it is possible to wield axes, hammers and maces, which is never recommended due to the low power of these weapons), not competent in the use of the shield and with the ability to cast five different spells. As a result of this, the choice and management of equipment are rather limited even if they are very versatile thanks to a system of runes and upgrade slots for swords and armor and a rather deep and extensive crafting system. Through the recipes and creation schemes it will in fact be possible to forge your own weapons, sew pieces of armor or obviously indulge yourself with potions, bombs and traps, the real flagship of the series, essential to get the better of when the fights start to get complicated. Returning instead to the management of the character, we find a system of talents divided into four branches: one rather short and generic and the other three focused on combat with white weapons, on the use of magic and on enhancing Geralt's alchemy skills. Each of these feats can be upgraded twice by spending the points you earn as you level up (with a level cap set at 35th level) and in some cases can be ~mutated~ by applying genes collected from slain enemies so you have access to further upgrades.
