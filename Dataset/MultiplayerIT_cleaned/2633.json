{"name": "Aqua GT", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/aqua-gt.html", "text": "We go down to the water The game control is very simple: with the X key you will accelerate while with the Square you will brake and with the R1 key you will choose between three game views. Vehicle control is very simple and precise and only high speed can cause stability problems when cornering which can be corrected with good braking dosage. Your opponents have a decent artificial intelligence that will make the races very exciting since your small mistake would immediately put one of your pursuers back into play for the final victory. The catamarans are well made and have both captivating lines worthy of the best spaceships and very engaging colors that are a feast for the eyes of the players. However, on the course they lack luster and have fairings that are a little too dark even if you will be able to recognize all the writings and drawings that characterize them. The routes are very simple to memorize even if they are too repetitive and many times you will find yourself facing the same route twice in a row and even at night for a total of three times, really too much! A little technique doesn't hurt Graphically along the rivers you can easily recognize some buildings that characterize the cities where the race takes place: for example along the Thames you can admire the reproduction of Big Ben. If some parts of the background are taken care of, others lack details that could surely have given a more real atmosphere to the game. The water raised by the catamaran translates into a wake left by it without the presence of splashes or abnormal waves. Collisions have little impact on the outcome of the race given that there is no slowdown in the pace of the rear-ended vehicle and of the one causing the collision. All in all in terms of graphics Aqua GT stands at good levels. The sound requires a greater effort on the part of the player to understand its existence above all. The rumble of the catamaran underway and the change of its noise due to the downshifting drowns out both the noise of the water and that of the background music. However, perhaps it is a good thing that all this occurs also because there are some really boring songs that it is better not to listen to so as not to lose the desire to play. Finish Among the defects of this Aqua GT there is the lack of a multiplayer mode in which to compete against friends. This means a serious flaw in terms of longevity in terms of playability. Once you've finished the game that will take you at most an afternoon, I don't know if you'll want to pick it up again. Furthermore, the lack of very varied tracks will shorten the time it takes for you to acquire the necessary experience in order to have no problem finishing first in each race. If you want a fast, easy, immediate and pleasant title to drink in one gulp Aqua GT is definitely for you. Shall we take a catamaran ride? Are you tired of the usual races aboard the boring cars that have capitalized on the production of titles concerning the racing world in recent years? So as an alternative, I can suggest this Aqua GT that will put you at the wheel of a very fast catamaran in an attempt to beat your opponents on courses carved out of rivers throughout Europe. From this premise you have already understood how Aqua GT presents itself as a concrete innovation of its kind. The Pal version that I was able to try allows you to choose from six languages, fortunately including Italian too. However, we only have two game options: either start a new game or continue a saved one. Limiting my choice to the new game now finds me having to compete in the Bronze League. Once you have selected your catamaran among the first six available, you can immediately access the first tender. However, before starting a race you will have to undergo a test lap in which to establish a time that will give you a starting position: in any case the races take place between six opponents. We have three alloys, bronze, silver and gold, plus a final special alloy. Every time you win a league you will enter the second and unlock the new catamarans.", "date": "2001-02-13", "grade": null}
