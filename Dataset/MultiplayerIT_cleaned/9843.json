{"name": "Sturmtruppen!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/79983-tank-battles-sturmtruppen.html", "text": "Behind the invention of tanks there was the need, at the time of the First World War, to overcome the treacherous trenches thanks to a vehicle capable of withstanding machine gun bursts and breaking through the barbed wire networks without problems. Almost a century has passed since the dark years of that bloody conflict, but tanks in their continuous evolution (unfortunately it seems that the opportunity to use new weapons never fails, in this world!) have never abandoned the collective imagination, becoming also featured in a number of video games. In the case of Tank Battles, one of the arcade titles that the French Gameloft has created for the PlayStation 3 (available exclusively in digital form, purchasable on the PlayStation Store for 4.99 euros), the tanks are more of an excuse to introduce an action game based on timing and small-time strategy. Using a top view, within five different types of scenario, we find ourselves driving a tank that must eliminate all opponents in order to access the next stage. An initially trivial operation, but which becomes more complex as important variables are introduced into the gameplay, such as the presence of obstacles (unbreakable or not), traps, upgrades and so on. The last wheel of the wagon As you can easily imagine, Tank Battles does not present a realistic interpretation of driving a tank, yet the control system is based on two elements that have always been associated with tanks: movement via tracks and independent management of the cannon. The first factor substantially influences our freedom of action, especially when we have to move quickly to avoid being destroyed by enemy bullets: the vehicle does not respond immediately to our inputs, but precisely aligns the tracks and only at that point does it start to move. It is no coincidence that during the battles it is better to find safe shelters and expose yourself as little as possible, dosing the movements and trying to plan our routes in advance, at least until the situation becomes calmer than the ~four against four~ that characterizes the start of each internship. The second factor, i.e. the independent movement of the turret (via right analog stick) allows us to shoot at a target while moving in a completely different direction. If during the first few games you simply shoot ~forward~, following the motion of the armored vehicle, as soon as you become familiar with the controls, it is precisely this independent management that makes the difference. The game action is really simple, after all: there are three tanks on the map, in addition to ours, and you have to eliminate them by hitting them with the cannon or by blowing them up with a proximity mine. The single player campaign, in this sense, offers us the beauty of fifty stages characterized by a gradual increase in difficulty, the introduction of various upgrades and a structure of the scenarios that often plays a strategic role of primary importance. In fact, the projectiles we fire do not exhaust their motion as soon as they encounter an obstacle, but rather perform a ~bank rebound~ which a bit like billiards can allow us to eliminate an enemy even if we don't have him directly within range. The speed of the shots is not very high, but it is compensated by the limitations in the movement we mentioned previously: during a shooting it is possible to think for an instant about which is the best evasive maneuver for that particular situation, then give gas to get out of the way trouble while we in turn unload a small flurry of blows against the opponent on duty. Playstation 3 trophies Tank Battles allows us to obtain thirteen trophies: ten bronze (unlockable by knocking down the first enemy, completing the single-player campaign, winning ten games in a row, etc.), two silver (completing the game in less than sixty minutes and succeeding never losing) and a gold one (destroying a whopping ten thousand enemy tanks). Carramba what a surprise! Depending on the objectives unlocked and the level of experience achieved, Tank Battles gives us up to five ~skins~ to customize our vehicle, especially in view of the interesting online multiplayer mode, which together with the aforementioned ~campaign~ and the ~battle fast~ completes the Gameloft product offering. It is possible to host a game or join a pre-existing match, with a total of four human players who can still be replaced as needed by decent quality bots. You compete in classic deathmatches, team deathmatches and an adapted version of ~stealflag~. Unfortunately, during our tests we didn't find many people willing to play, snatching just a couple of deathmatches that turned out to be fairly fun while reporting some lag problems (which for a four-player multiplayer, frankly, we wouldn't have expected) The presence of real opponents on the one hand can only make the challenge more engaging, on the other it ends up highlighting the limits of an immediate but simplistic gameplay, which quickly becomes repetitive. The high resolution graphics (1080p) are nice and discreet detailed, with a good variety of locations surrounding the ~fence~ in which you fight.The textures of the ground are unfortunately decidedly anonymous and repetitive, but in general we cannot complain about the technical realization, perfectly functional to the action.", "date": "2010-08-25", "grade": "6.0"}
