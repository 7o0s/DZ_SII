Well, now it's your turn to iOS and Android devices too. Pop songs with synthetic voices? Engaging choreographies? Rhythm mechanics of a certain thickness mixed with a visual novel-style narrative structure? The new title developed by Colorful Palette offers this and more, as we are about to tell you in the review of Hatsune Miku: Colorful Stage! History Hatsune Miku: Colorful Stage!, one of the protagonists is projected into the virtual world We mentioned a visual novel-style formula not by chance, because Hatsune Miku: Colorful Stage! puts first a plot that sees twenty-five characters (of which twenty unpublished), divided into five different formations, face their difficulties in the real world and solve them in some way thanks to the power of music. Set in the cities of Tokyo and Yokohama, the story of the game is told through mostly static sequences, completely spoken in Japanese and subtitled in English, which are unlocked as we complete the purely playful part of the package, i.e. the music shows. Structure Hatsune Miku: Colorful Stage!, the in-game shop for purchasing songs The main screen of Hatsune Miku: Colorful Stage! it is rather crowded with content to access, but it always remains clearly legible and does not lead to the chaos typical of, for example, Asian MMORPGs. It is possible to continue the story by witnessing the new sequences for the various characters and groups involved, try their hand at the solo shows, in five-way cooperative or participate in special online events. An editor allows you to change the protagonists' clothing based on the objects obtained up to that moment, while it is always possible to consult the rich list of achievements and receive the related rewards, which can be used to purchase new songs to add to the tracklist . There is also an option related to gacha elements, which however are limited to aesthetic customization. The game is available in freemium format, with a series of possible microtransactions, but it adopts a very elastic approach: there is an action energy indicator that regulates the number of shows we can play with, but it recharges very often and does not it is consumed in case you decide to interrupt a session for any reason, for example a connection problem. There are other problems, in this case a management of separate downloads which at a certain point becomes exhausting: already after the introductory phase you're prompted to download almost 1GB of data that the system could have easily pulled down while we were busy with the tutorial, but the same prompt appears for much of the content as you progress through the story, so you skip quite a bit of time to wait. Gameplay Hatsune Miku: Colorful Stage! rhythm gameplay with choreography in the background The played stages of Hatsune Miku: Colorful Stage! they come in the form of a traditional rhythm game, with different levels of difficulty that determine how many notes to tap on the screen in time with the music. Let's say that the easy level is really trivial and offers very few ideas, while the normal one returns a decent introductory experience. The other two degrees of challenge, on the other hand, should only be tackled when the characteristics of the songs are well memorized, on pain of a rapid collapse. In this regard, the starting tracklist has eighteen songs, each available in two versions, interpreted by the vocaloid or by the characters. The list will undoubtedly be enriched shortly with new additions, after all the Japanese edition contained almost thirty at the debut, but we are talking about pieces that a casual audience could easily not know: a very different approach than the one described in the review of Taiko no Tatsujin: Pop Tap Beat, for example. Graphics and sound Hatsune Miku: Colorful Stage!, one of the protagonists in a Tokyo shopping district Hatsune Miku's Wealth: Colorful Stage! extends to the technical sector, really nice and very pleasant. The many characters are well drawn and all the visual novel-style sequences boast an enormous amount of valuable artwork, but it is the choreography during the shows that literally steals the show, with the various members of the bands playing, singing and dancing giving life to a very pleasant show. On the sound side, as already mentioned, all the dialogues are spoken in Japanese, strengthened by a stereotyped interpretationbut solid, and then there's the matter of the tracklist: the songs are nice, but you have to like the genre and it's certainly not about famous pieces. Discovering them one by one is undoubtedly a potential strength of the game, but it is inevitably a very subjective matter.", "date": "2021-12-14", "grade": "8.0"}
