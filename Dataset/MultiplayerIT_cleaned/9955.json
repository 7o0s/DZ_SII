{"name": "Bright Memory: Infinite", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/bright-memory-infinite-recensione.html", "text": "At the time of the announcement for the Xbox Series X|S, about a year and a half ago, Bright Memory: Infinite was presented as a fast-paced and spectacular first-person shooter experience, topped off with sophisticated technologies such as ray tracing and a system of multifaceted combat, which allowed for alternating lethal blows and bursts of machine guns. A very interesting project, all the more so since it was developed by a single person, Zeng ~FYQD~ Xiancheng. Originally envisioned as part of the launch line-up for the new Microsoft console, the game is actually not yet landed on Xbox, opting for a simpler debut on Steam, where it will be available for free to all users who have purchased the prequel, Bright Memory, which costs just  8.19. Too good to be true? Let's find out how things really are in the review of Bright Memory: Infinite. History Bright Memory: Infinite, Sheila answers a call at the beginning of the game Barely mentioned, the story of Bright Memory: Infinite revolves around Sheila, a fighter with extraordinary abilities, probably linked to cybernetic grafts, who offers her services to the Science Research Organization. It is a group born to counter the aims of a military organization, the SAI, which wants to take possession of an ancient relic which, according to legends, would give its owner the power to resurrect the dead. Identified in a sort of floating island on the arctic the epicenter of an anomaly linked to the mysterious energy, Sheila is instructed to travel to the location and deal with the SAI troops before they reach their objective. Waiting for her, however, she finds not only teams of ruthless mercenaries, but also something different: an ancient force that has been awakened and which must absolutely not be underestimated. Gameplay Bright Memory: Infinite, a sword fight sequence Net of some uncertainty with the quick time event controls exploited in the introductory phase, the gameplay of Bright Memory: Infinite appears immediately exciting. Merit of the repertoire available to Sheila who, as mentioned, can not only take up four different firearms and shoot enemies, but also use a high-tech sword and a module that channels kinetic energy to release it in a way as spectacular as devastating. The result is a mix of mechanics that add a surprising depth to the experience, especially in the most difficult battles. The password is ~variety~: you can eliminate some targets with bursts that give a Call of Duty feeling, activate stasis to block an opponent in mid-air like in Bulletstorm and then slice him with the blade before he even touches land, or perform one of the maneuvers that can be learned throughout the campaign. In fact, by collecting some relics you access an upgrades screen that allows you to make the tools at your disposal more effective, add extra modules to firearms and unlock disruptive shots, such as a running energy punch or a crash from above . That's not all: Sheila can use her sword to deflect attacks and break through the defense of the enemy on duty, or quickly dash to the side to avoid blows. If we add to this system the four firearms that are obtained during the campaign (the initial assault rifle, the shotgun, the sniper rifle and an automatic pistol with electric bullets), the picture emerges of a truly multifaceted combat system, which expresses itself at its best against common enemies but knows how to also apply in boss fights. Bright Memory: Infinite, one of the boss fights However, FYQD-Studio also wanted to introduce a series of experimental sections into the game, so to speak, starting with a platforming based on double jumps and a grappling hook that works fairly well, at least until we are asked to perform a wall running that goes successful once yes and three times no, often causing us to crash to the ground innocently. Then there is the driving sequence that was seen at the time of the first trailer, in which you get behind the wheel of a custom-built vehicle equipped with a missile a certain route is covered, even if the sensations in this case are not exciting. Finally a boring stealth phase in which, it is not known why, Sheila decides that she has to hide from the enemies rather than face them openly, proceeding crouched and brandishing a cleaver to eliminate them silently by coming up behind them. Bright Memory: Infinite, the stealth phase in which we have to hide from the sight of enemies and finish them off with a cleaver Fortunately, these are parentheseswhich run out quickly and bring us back to the main focus of Bright Memory: Infinite, while the ranks of enemies are enriched by new and menacing units, whose poor artificial intelligence is masked soon enough, and by ever bigger and nastier bosses, ready to round off a campaign which however has an extremely short duration: it can be completed in just two hours.Considering the negligible selling price and the fact that the entire project is the result of the work of a single person, who moreover carried on basically in my spare time during the last three years, it all adds up. In concrete terms, however, the game is just a sort of pitch, a simple taster in view of something more structured and important, which we hope will materialize in the future. Graphics and sound Bright Memory: Infinite, a scenery enhanced by ray-traced reflections Among the things that immediately struck us about Bright Memory: Infinite there is undoubtedly the visual sector, extremely full of effects. Driven by the Unreal Engine 4, the game does not spare itself in this sense, aiming to embellish its scenarios thanks above all to ray tracing and taking inspiration from real places to be able to create a certain type of atmosphere. There is no doubt that the solutions fielded by the author work, giving us some truly suggestive glimpses, but alternating them with elements that are not exactly splendid, first of all a decidedly old-gen polygonal model for the protagonist in terms of geometry and animations, laid bare in particular during the critical stealth phases of the campaign. Bright Memory: Infinite, one of the first scenarios of the campaign In general, we encountered some glitches and oversights typical of a production that, inevitably, has not been granted scrupulous quality control. What annoyed us the most, however, are the important episodes of stuttering that occur in certain sequences, with big slowdowns that then settle by themselves in the next scene: let's hope that the inevitable updates will resolve the issue. It would be nice to rethink the audio sector: the soundtrack is valid and engaging, but the effects are really mediocre and not very relevant to what is shown on the screen. The graphics options allow you to scale the experience even on less demanding configurations: the ray tracing which necessarily performs a central role in the weighting of the graphics, but the use of DLSS can solve the situation and allow you to maintain the output at 4K and 60 fps with everything at its maximum, even if you come down to some compromises in terms of definition.", "date": "2021-11-11", "grade": "7.0"}
