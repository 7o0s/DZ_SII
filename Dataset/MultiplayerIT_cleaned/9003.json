The skepticism of the detractors, who considered the work as a simple theoretical demonstration or little more, was partially mitigated by the first real game based on this development platform, Infinity Blade. However, the link between the powerful graphics engine and the Apple platforms has definitively bonded over time, thanks to titles such as Dark Meadow and the very recent announcement of Infinity Blade 2; however, the Unreal Engine was historically born as a support for the classic first person shooters and it was therefore right (as well as desirable) a ~return to origins~ also on the iPhone and iPad. In fact, Warm Gun brings Epic's versatile tool back to the area that best suits it, that is, in a terrifying fire pit. The four of the Ave Maria The story that revolves around Warm Gun is, as can be easily guessed from the context, totally taken from the dozens (and perhaps hundreds) previous productions of the same genre and can easily be summarized in a few words: a phantom Third World War fought without criteria, irreparable ecological damage , depleted natural resources and, as a consequence, a return to the most dangerous and least civilized period in American history (a sort of new Wild West). The end of civilization inevitably coincides with the decadence of customs, laws and social conventions: therefore values change, one does not kill for money but for food, petrol or water, the only goods that really matter in such extreme situations . Within 5 day and night settings (towns, cities, valleys, canyons, deserts in full Wild West style) excellently reproduced thanks to the repeatedly mentioned (and repeatedly awarded) Unreal Engine, it will thus be possible to clash in furious battle at weapon rounds fire in a style very similar to that of typical Unreal Tournament arenas. The full touch control system, perfect in everyday use, however suffers a lot from adapting to a pure FPS title like Warm Gun: although there are three choices offered to the player, none of them is ideal in light of the facts for making the most of of the game. The virtual three-stick method (with the usual two lateral ones for movement and view plus one for fire) as well as the two-stick method (which incorporates the possibility of shooting with a simple ~tap~ in the second stick) suffer from a particular problem , linked to the movements of the camera: in fact, when shooting, the weapon also continuously shifts the view of the fire, making the target miss but above all causing rash and unpredictable movements. In particular situations, annoying phenomena of Motion Sickness, more simply known as Video Game Nausea, may occur (and it happened to this writer during testing). The situation improves slightly with the single stick configuration, which delegates the movement of the camera to a random slide of the finger on the right side of the screen; in this way, however, the weapon remains totally immobile during use, preventing even the slightest aiming adjustments (unless after having stopped shooting). The 4 characters that give the title to the paragraph are also those that can be selected both in offline and online mode and each of them has a particular load of fire: ranging from the Preacher-gunslinger to the old man with a heavy shotgun, all the way to the Shaman with the assault rifle and the rough Blacksmith leisurely walking around carrying a tank revolving machine gun. Scattered in the scenarios there are also various explosive or incendiary traps as well as, obviously, the points of care for restoring health. Speaking of technique, it is impossible not to notice how all the productions based on the successful Epic engine are in fact a cut above the others present in the App store; in particular, the graphic style chosen for Warm Gun quite clearly recalls that of another great title, Borderlands. Although we cannot speak here of Cel Shading in the strict sense, the citations to the successful Gearbox production are numerous, starting with the life points lost which are shown with each successful hit. However, looking for the traditional hair in the egg, it is possible to notice some textures of lower quality than the others and, especially in the night levels, a fairly static lighting management. Finally, little to say about the multiplayer sector: every time we tried to enter online through the account Gamespy (required), we didn't find anyone on the game servers, so we hope for an increase in population over time.
