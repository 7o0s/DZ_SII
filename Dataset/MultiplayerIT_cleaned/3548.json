{"name": "Forged of Blood", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/forged-of-blood-recensione.html", "text": "In this hot August, fans of RPG and strategy games can pass the time with Forged of Blood, the classic disciple of Heroes of Might And Magic with XCOM-style battles, made by an Indonesian team, Critical Forge, made up of only eight people. The genesis that brought this title to light is troubled: the funds initially allocated (it runs in 2017) for the acquisition of the Unreal Engine 4 license had compromised the entire project structure and the team had to resort to a failed Kickstarter campaign, in which 747 contributors donated a paltry $15,000 of the $110,000 requested. Nonetheless, our Asian friends managed to complete the feat, albeit with results not up to their ambitions. The plot Let's start from the beginning and then from the plot, not original but pleasant. Attention because the Italian is not even present as subtitles. Set in a fantasy universe, in Forged of Blood the Neshlan are the race that is ruling the world after subjugating humans; with a coup the rebels wipe out the royal family and it is up to the eldest son Tavias Caenican to put the pieces back together to restore the ancient order. The game is divided into two phases: from the main board, where the action takes place in real time, the hero's pawn moves by visiting the hotspots that gradually continue to appear following pre-established routes and reconquering the lost regions, while in the background the rebellion continues to change the geopolitical conformation of the continent. This is not a simple walk in the park because a counter indicates how much time is left for the following ~twist~ and completing all the side quests means compromising the outcome of the main one. Each meeting is a pretext to deepen the plot and forge Tavias's personality according to three alignments: altruistic, rational and hedonistic which correspond to the canonical good, neutral and evil personalities. The consequences of the decisions are not as marked as one might think, because some key points of the script remain immutable regardless, but some battles can be unlocked or the number of enemies changed. It is essentially a system that we had already seen in Banner Saga. Soon you will come to have a fortress in which to build the inevitable buildings where you can make upgrades for weapons and armor; however, the diplomatic part and that of espionage are missing, and the economic management is too facilitated by the large amounts of money that can be recovered at the end of each battle. Strategy The strategic component is by far the most difficult to digest. The attempt to enrich the offer with a strong personalization can be commendable, but three screens with relative submenus dedicated only to the units honestly seemed too many. From the first you manage the inventory, equipping the collected loot and distributing the strength, agility, dexterity and resistance points that govern the soldiers' abilities. Navigation is not complicated, but not very immediate because most of the icons look alike and to distinguish the relevant objects you have to rely on a simple frame of a different color. The second and third concern the skills: those specific to the type of weapon and the general ones such as reflexes, robustness, combat posture (with trees that come to have two levels of ramifications). There are no classes in the Creative Forge game, so you can create a sword archer or an ax mage. Points are earned based on what you wield, so if only the sword attack slot is used in a battle, that will be the only branch that earns points. We have deliberately kept the spells chapter for last, because if what we have described so far has seemed complicated to you, to master the spells you need a manual of nuclear physics. They are divided into two macro-categories (those that expel and those that absorb), and for each there are the beauty of 24 modifiers. On paper, the combinations are exciting, but in practice, the effort required to create a spell is not adequately rewarded by the effects during battle. Mouse in hand Everything described so far should have scared most readers, yet Forged of Blood often manages to be funny. The turn-based strategy, while not in the least reaching the level of depth of the XCOM heavyweight, engages without being trivial. However, there are some slips due to a sometimes unbalanced level of difficulty: already in the fourth battle we were forcedi have to reload the game several times before getting the better of a group of angry peasants (theoretically easy to kill), before realizing that the only possible strategy to get the better of it was to barricade yourself behind a house and wait for them to come to get massacred. Same reasoning for a herd of monsters that attacked us in the middle of a wood: also in this case there was only one tactic to defeat the overwhelming opposing forces. The impression we got is that, despite the exaggerated depth of the units, there are times when the only option is retreat, at least at the normal level. The build betrays the tight budget, with some questionable design choices. Among all the movement of the camera, entrusted to the WASD keys and not to the mouse, and the display of the grid which, not being permanent, sometimes disappears, preventing you from understanding how far you can move the pawns; moreover, the isometric view is scarcely usable because it frames too small a portion of the screen. In this way you end up using almost always the shot from above which is not as detailed and does not make you understand the line of fire well. To this we add the lack of interactivity with objects and the almost absence of cover, the very small battlefields and often made in an amateur way, and we wonder if the brute force of the Epic Games engine was really necessary to create a title that in complex fails to stand out in comparison with other indie games. The first game takes about 15 hours to complete, but there is good replay value.", "date": "2019-08-16", "grade": "5.5"}
