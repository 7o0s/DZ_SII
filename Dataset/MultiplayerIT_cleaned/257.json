Like any serialized video game, improvements and novelties are expected with each release, and it is therefore with ill-concealed curiosity that we are going to review this game: let's find out together how EA tries to draw our attention to Need For Speed! Carbon or Underground 3? The supporting structure of Carbon recalls that of Need For Speed Underground 2, more than Most Wanted released a year ago. The game takes place in complete freedom for the player, who can plow the length and breadth of the city streets in the name of a free ride spirit that now hovers in many driving games and beyond. However, the entire map is divided into four main areas, each of them controlled by one of the bosses of the clandestine races. Starting Carbon we will take on the role of a complete stranger who must practically earn a certain fame and notoriety in the environment, starting with a humble Alfa Romeo to win the respect of rival gangs. we will play the role of a perfect stranger who must in practice earn a certain fame and notoriety in the environment By participating in certain events you have the opportunity to win them and consequently gain control of the area in which the race takes place. Each large area is in turn divided into twenty events, once all of which are completed we will finally have full control of the neighborhood. The challenges usually take place between eight participants, among which our previously hired allies can compete. Add a seat at the table! The possibility of having allies on our side has been taken from the NASCAR series, and it is one of the most consistent innovations of the series. We cannot have less than one friend and no more than three on our side. Through the Y key we can issue the order to help us in the race: there are various types of allied machines. The first are those that stop the opponents, just like a basketball block, allowing us to recover lost ground; the latter help us thanks to the trail that we can exploit to our advantage, while the last type of help consists in finding secret roads, streets and alleys as shortcuts. The latter have actually always been included in Need For Speed, with the only difference that before it was us ourselves who had to find them. The peculiarity of our crew is that we can only use it up to a certain point, just like the nitro in fact has an energy bar that once it runs out it no longer allows us to use it. Cute as a system, but somewhat bizarre in logic: why should a friend help us with the dropper? Like Pokemon? Unlocking items, companions or cars is linked to the collection of particular cards, each of which is linked to a specific event: a race, a chase, a speed challenge and so on. Through a kind of board it will be clear how many and which cards are needed to obtain a particular reward. Each card is in fact part of a quadrant, unlocking four quadrants we get the object. The system is very ingenious and fun, almost like a Pokmon-style collecting title, and encourages the player to get as many cards as possible. This also helps Carbon's replay factor a lot, as we will be called to carry out tests already faced until we can unlock them. Also included in this chapter are American muscle cars such as the Mustang GT, the Dodge Charger SRT8 and the old Dodge Charger RT, all new to NFS. Everyone in sculpture and modeling school Another interesting novelty included in this edition of Need For Speed is the possibility of creatively customizing our racing car. Obviously the option to modify the car was also present in past years, but with Carbon here comes the so-called ~Autoscultping~. Each physical piece to be applied to the car can now be modified, enlarged, lengthened, thinned, enlarged, and finally applied. In practice, we will be called upon to do some 3D modeling on the polygons: obviously in a not totally free but ~guided~ way, so as not to generate walking monsters instead of racing cars. After that it will be possible to apply stickers, neons, logos and anything else the kit of our little ~Pimp My Ride~ allows us to do on the hull. Places and settings There are numerous differences with the previous chapter. Starting from the setting, in this new chapter purely nocturnal and dark. Where Most Wanted took place purely in open environments, mountains and countryside, the action of Carbon rimostly in city locations, except for sporadic appearances on the ~Canyon~ from which the game takes its name. The races in the Canyon are also the most exciting as in case of going off the road we would have to start the whole race all over again, all of which adds a decent pathos to the competition. Luckily, there's also another difference with last year's game: its unstable frame rate has been improved. But let's find out how much, speaking precisely of the technical sector. Graphics? The first thing that catches the eye is how much Carbon is a video game with very, very colorful and flashy graphics, just as often happens in those games found in economic series. The feeling is that to improve the general fluidity, compared to Most Wanted, numerous elements such as textures, polygons and effects have been sacrificed, moreover with a questionable final result. Carbon's graphics engine is unsatisfactory. The excessive coloring of the cities gives the overall look a strong sensation of plasticity and little realism. The number of polygons moved by the engine is not enough, especially given the results obtained by other developers with PGR3 and Burnout. The number of polygons moved by the ~next-gen~ engine is absolutely insufficient, especially given the results obtained by other developers with PGR3 and Burnout Graphics? To aggravate all this there are also numerous shots that persist during the race, especially in the vicinity of curves or descents, or when the open scene swings in front of the camera displaying a few more polygons. In itself, moreover, the sensation of speed is frankly not exciting and it is not a positive factor for a racing game. During the online game there are sporadic further slowdowns, and in any case it is not clear whether Carbon loses its shots due to the lag or the graphics engine: in fact these very short shots are very annoying in every mode. Online Powered. Could an Xbox360 game not take advantage of the online component thanks to the Live infrastructure? Of course not. But fortunately Electronic Arts has undertaken to add online multiplayer modes to Carbon worthy of the console on which it runs. The game makes it possible to challenge up to 8 participants simultaneously, in two fundamental challenges: Pursuit Tag and Pursuit Knockout. The first consists of a race of a civilian against all the policemen, and our goal will be to remain unpunished for the longest possible period of time; the second mode instead allows anyone to be a police car, even if they are in last position. Electronic Arts has pledged to add online multiplayer modes to Carbon worthy of the console it runs on This person will have to be able to buffer, stop or otherwise hit as many ~thieves~ as possible, eventually totaling a score based on his performance as a ~hunter~. The latter is precisely the funniest and funniest online option, as everyone wants to be a policeman but at the same time nobody wants to be hit, generating situations bordering on the comical. Through Xbox Live it is also possible to show the Xbox community our machines and play cooperatively up to 4 people just as if they were part of our ~Crew~. EA Tracks The audio sector is completely convincing, unlike the video one. Electronic Arts can afford big names, big bands and great songs with the never too praised EA Tracks. The sound effects are excellent as well as the 5.1 multi-channel audio in game which gives pleasant positive vibes during the game. Especially when the police cars are chasing us and thanks to the surround sound it is possible for us to ~hear~ which direction they come from. Thanks to the online component and the good game progression given by the card system and the map to be conquered as if it were a car hazard, Carbon's longevity is more than excellent. The main story takes place entirely in 12-14 hours maximum but the replayability factor is high. Comment Carbon is a different game from the previous Most Wanted, and it will certainly be more appreciated by lovers of the old Underground. Electronic Arts has added a great online component this year that extends the fun for a long time. If we also consider the system of ~cards~ to unlock and the modeling options of the cars, it is easy to understand how much the developer has tried to innovate something again this year: an attempt that is more than appreciated. But it would also be time for EA to update its graphics engine, given that among its ranks it includes talents of the caliber of Criterion with their Burnout; technically Carbon is inadequate and behind most of the competition. A game thatenthusiasts must necessarily keep an eye out. Anyone who doesn't like the series will not change their mind with this Carbon. Pros Online game mode Extreme customization of the cars Sound Cons Little fluidity Unsatisfactory polygonal structure Poor sensation of speed Goals 360 Need For Speed Carbon has 50 achievements to unlock. Many of them are quite difficult to obtain and require a fair amount of time. The online component is predominant in the collection of achievements and it will be essential to play the largest number of ranked races. Everything else ranges from the classic ~complete your career~ to the particular ~Get a victory without ever hitting another car~ and the annihilation of as many police cars as possible. An objective is secret and you will need to go to the game's official website https://www.ea.com/nfs/carbon/ to find it. Carbon, once completed in each sauce, gives the player the canonical 1000 points.", "date": "2006-11-24", "grade": null}
