The French company has undoubtedly experienced a difficult period full of uncertainties, which has directly reflected on its productions, and one of its flagship franchises, Asphalt, has also paid the price. Experimented with moderate success on the road of endless runners, followed by the inexplicable exclusive for Android with Asphalt Nitro, the series finally seems to have returned to its former glory with the launch of Asphalt Xtreme. The title plays the offroad racing card to refresh the experience, introducing seven new vehicle classes (buggy, rally car, SUV, muscle car, pick-up, truck and monster truck) and offering the usual, rich campaign in single player that will see us compete in scenarios in which alternative routes are the rule rather than the exception, transforming into the strategic element of a gameplay where the terrain counts in terms of final speed and control of the vehicle, both that opting for shortcuts flooded or full of obstacles can actually represent a handicap from the point of view of the race. There is also a fun real-time multiplayer sector, with two types of events for eight participants and a quick and effective matchmaking, capable of offering an extra gear to the package. Asphalt Xtreme plays the offroad racing card for a renewed experience, full of races and vehicles To the extreme Although characterized by a nebulous upgrade system at first, due to an unclear interface, the single player sector of Asphalt Xtreme undoubtedly represents the fulcrum of Gameloft's production and uses the usual, tested progression system that unlocks new events and new categories as you get the traditional stars. The career, supported by special timed challenges, is made up of five increasingly complex classes: rookie, beginner, semi-pro, professional and master. Each one is divided into several multi-event seasons, for a total of over four hundred races that will ensure a considerable duration to the experience. In terms of numbers, Asphalt Xtreme therefore fears no rivals, also strong in almost fifty vehicles which, however, often require the use of real money to be unlocked, forcing those who do not want to spend to limit themselves to the starting models, although very valid and upgradeable like the others . Beyond this aspect, it must be said that the freemium model is not stringent, as it lacks the classic fuel indicator, replaced by an ~oil change~ which, however, is carried out using the abundant virtual currency and therefore does not constitute a large problem for those who love long uninterrupted gaming sessions. Once on the track, the default control system, which uses the accelerometer for steering, automatic acceleration and manual brake via touch, proves to be particularly precise and well implemented: the best solution among those available, considering that the touch alternatives are a bit too confusing due to the small buttons close to each other. The result is an engaging and spectacular arcade gameplay, made up of overtaking at the limit, jumps, obstacles that are thrown into the air by our vehicle, the inevitable and abundant use of nitro and the already mentioned, numerous shortcuts that characterize each path. The locations are naturally devoted to off-road and guarantee a good variety, going from sand dunes to expanses of ice, developing vertically as never before and alternating different moments of the day. What is missing, somewhat surprisingly, are the performances: on the iPhone 7 the game fails to guarantee a granite frame rate, and those occasional jerks are unfortunately reflected in the precision of the controls, generating frustrating blunders that we hope will be resolved with an update. Nothing to say instead about the sound sector, not unforgettable in terms of effects but equipped with a very valid signed tracklist.", "date": "2016-11-07", "grade": "8.5"}
