{"name": "Silent Hill", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/silent-hill_a.html", "text": "In the beginning there was Alone in the Dark. Authentic masterpiece developed by Infogrames (now Atari), the game was basically set up as an adventure, characterized by an innovative visual system that helped create claustrophobic atmospheres as well as moments of real tension. Detective Edward Carnby had to discover the mysteries of a huge cursed house, facing zombies and creatures of all kinds following a plot clearly inspired by Lovecraft's novels. Then came Resident Evil, which took the mechanics and shots of Alone in the Dark to put them in a context much more focused on action and inspired by the films of George Romero. Finally, Silent Hill. The Konami series, born on PSone, distanced itself from what had previously been seen and focused on the surreal, on the nightmare, on stories that had to do with human wickedness in the first place. After several very successful episodes and a cinematic film, Silent Hill also invades our mobile phones with its fog. Will we be lucky enough to emerge unscathed? ~My name is Ben. I'm not from here. Thirty years have passed. I was sparedbut why did I come back? I want to understand. Please help me understand. What is wrong with me?~ This is how the mobile reduction of Silent Hill begins, transformed for the occasion into a sort of ~point & click~ adventure in which Ben is controlled, who finds himself in the orphanage where he grew up without explaining how he got back there. And without understanding how he survived the extermination that saw all his companions die thirty years earlier. Almost. We will have the task of revealing this and other mysteries, therefore, moving between the locations via a pointer that changes shape in contact with an interactable object and then present four possible options: look, touch, speak or use another object. At the beginning we will find a map of the orphanage that will make it easier for us to explore, but we will soon learn by heart the order of the rooms and the places we need to reach. As in any Silent Hill, at a certain point we will be divided between two distinct realities, passing from one to the other via a magical symbol drawn in blood: the rooms will change radically, and we will be able to use objects collected in the other in one context. There will be hostile presences, from which we will be able to defend ourselves using a pistol (the pointer can turn into a viewfinder, if necessary), while it is possible to recover the lost energy using the first aid kits collected previously. As with any such adventure, it's clear that it's all about finding key items and figuring out how and where to use them. In this sense, Silent Hill on mobile manages to be very cryptic, so much so that we will often have to go round and round the map to understand where the game is going with Moving on to a purely technical discourse, the game boasts an excellent realization. In this case, however, having a powerful terminal can significantly improve the experience, not so much for the graphic resolution, but for the speed of the uploads. In fact, every time you move from one area of the map to another, there is a loading that can become annoying where you have to cross the whole orphanage to get to the point that interests us. For the rest, we have very well done locations that are occasionally accompanied by the animated sprite of some repulsive creature. Even the sound sector has its say, with some music that contributes to creating a certain atmosphere and rare but effective effects. Finally, the control system is absolutely immediate and sees the use of the joystick to move the pointer, the FIRE button to access the action menu, the 1 button to switch to the viewfinder and the 3 button to use the first aid kit .
