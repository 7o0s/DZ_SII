{"name": "My Time At Portia", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/my-time-at-portia-recensione.html", "text": "It took a whole year in early access to get it ready, but we can finally confirm it: My Time At Portia has done it. It is, we recall for the latest arrivals, a valid hybrid between Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon and Fantasy Life: one of those games in which apparently all you have to do is enjoy the desired life, while (without realizing it) you are working hard to build it brick by brick. The developers belong to the practically unknown Pathea Games team, but the publisher behind them is the much better known Team17: the same Team17 that in recent years has believed in the success of many unknown indies, which have thus managed to gain attention of a good number of fans of their respective genres (the same fans who now adore them). We have a feeling that the fate of My Time At Portia will be more or less similar, happy and lush, especially considering that at the moment the competition on current generation consoles - with the exception of Stardew Valley - is not at its level. Let's try to understand with this review who should give My Time At Portia a chance, and for what reasons. Plot: adventure, workshops, mysteries After just a couple of minutes of play, My Time At Portia immediately brings to mind Animal Crossing, perhaps one of the most important exponents of a genre that we could define as ~disengaged life simulator~. Yet the first of the two basic differences between the productions immediately imposes itself, namely the game plot (the second will be the RPG component). Where Animal Crossing has never really had a plot, a main narrative or a purpose, My Time At Portia instead has them, and points it out right from the narrative incipit. The protagonist arrives on the island of Portia to inherit his father's shop, given that his parental figure at one point decided to disappear to wander around the world. The mayor welcomes him willingly, takes him to his new home (a shack that will be duly restored) and gives him the few (but precious) things that his father left behind before leaving, i.e. the tools for crafting. From here on, a slow but detailed tutorial will follow which will gradually put the player in a position to know everything (but absolutely everything) what he needs to know to get the most out of the Pathea Games title, with commendable expository clarity. The plot of My Time At Portia, however, will not end up abandoned shortly thereafter; the player will indeed have the opportunity to determine his life in the new city as he sees fit, to make the choices he prefers, to marry or remain single, to weave social relationships or to become the obnoxious of the area, but always within a delicate framework storytelling. Among the main protagonists, apart from the over 50 non-player characters with whom it is possible to chat and interact in various ways, there are representatives of science and the local church. Soon the player learns that My Time At Portia is a delicate post-apocalyptic world: there have been some wars related to certain artifacts with enormous power that have devastated it. The church therefore believes that only some of these tools should be used: those capable of making the life of the inhabitants better; in itself science is instead moved by a healthy interest in any tool from the past. However, there are no extreme positions on both sides: the game remains perfectly usable by a vast range of users, from the youngest and very young to the most elderly adults. The immediate approach to My Time At Portia remains fundamentally casual and the title is configured as a full-bodied indie suitable for everyone and all ages. Completing the main narrative will require several hours, which may increase or decrease slightly depending on the player's approach; in general, however, it will take a really long time to explore Portia and the neighboring regions in every corner, since various secrets and mysteries are hidden everywhere. You never know around which corner, for example, you might find a dungeon that you hadn't noticed before. Playstation 4 trophies As if all the basic content weren't enough, My Time At Portia also has a large number of valuable trophies on its PlayStation 4, including the coveted Platinum Trophy. Unlocking it will not be particularly complex, but it will take a very long time: apart from completing the main game plot, in fact, you will have to dedicate yourself to a very large number of side missions and satisfy all particular conditions. Reading the complete (spoiler-free) trophy list is a good start. Gameplay: crafting and RPG component My Time At Portia draws on its elementsgives you immediately recognizable and intuitive games: Harvest Moon, the aforementioned Animal Crossing, Stardew Valley, Dragon Quest Builders and Minecraft. If the main objective is to enjoy a healthy life in the countryside, relaxing and exploring the surroundings at your own pace, a more dynamic direction comes instead from the components related to crafting, exploration and combat. In My Time At Portia there is always something to do, mainly building, building and building, with what appears to be one of the most fleshed out, detailed and precise crafting systems in recent years. Noteworthy is the fact that the player is not left to himself after the first few minutes of the game: there are menus that are as detailed as they are easily readable, and everything is rigorously translated into Italian. The building possibilities of My Time At Portia are managed on various levels of complexity: it starts from the simple axes, maces and pickaxes that can be easily assembled with a little stone and lumber to arrive at bridges, vehicles, houses and much more. To build the most complex tools, just pay attention to the indications in the projects menu left to the protagonist by his deceased father: it clearly indicates how many and which materials are needed, and also the methods to follow. The island and the surrounding areas abound in these raw materials, provided you know where to look for them: and this is where the exploratory component of the game takes over. But if you want, you can always choose other ways, based on your style: for example, you could evaluate the purchase of objects directly from the city market. To integrate the component linked to crafting, undoubtedly the best and most accurate of the title, there is the more purely RPG one, based on the exploration of dungeons and combat. These are never really challenging challenges, and after all these are definitely the aspects that will make Animal Crossing fans turn up their noses, who would never dream of putting on a pair of boxing gloves or assembling a club to fight monsters in caves , complete with real boss fights. Obviously exploration and combat provide essential bonuses to facilitate one's adventure: coins, rare materials, and above all experience points (but the latter are obtained in many ways, even in different quantities). The protagonist can thus level up, unlocking new skills divided into sectors such as crafting, combat and ~social~ (relationships with other inhabitants). To describe the functioning of the city of Portia, all the characters present, their professions and the possibilities of interaction with them, a separate article would be needed: try to imagine an enhanced version of Fantasy Life or Harvest Moon, to get an idea . In Portia there really is an adventure, a mission, a task that awaits you around every corner, and they are all different: you can choose to fight the creatures of the dungeons, to take care of your property and personalize everything customizable, to dedicate yourself to history, relationships with the neighborhood, or to simply enjoy a solitary life by taking your time. After all, isn't the game called ~My Life at Portia~?", "date": "2019-04-16", "grade": "8.0"}
