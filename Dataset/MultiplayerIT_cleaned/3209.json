{"name": "Black Mesa", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/black-mesa-recensione.html", "text": "Finally, after years of waiting, the review of Black Mesa is the occasion to talk about version 1.0 of the game. How much time has been talked about the development of this commercial remake of Half-Life, built with the engine of the sequel and authorized by Valve? Our first try of the game, then just arrived in Early Access, dates back to 2015, but the project itself is much older, since we have been talking about it since 2005, i.e. a few months after the launch of Half-Life 2. A 'eternity. Was it worth waiting so long? A few centuries ago one of the most popular ways of getting to know the most famous pictorial works was to look at the reproductions made by other painters. Traveling wasn't as easy as today and accessing certain places wasn't so obvious. Reproducing was therefore not considered plagiarism, but a way of spreading pictorial culture by bringing it throughout Europe, as well as a tribute to those who were universally recognized as masters. Being imitated was a privilege reserved only for a few. Obviously a copy of Lippina was not Lippina and, for the sake of truth, it must be said that many copied and then passed off the works as their own. This does not mean that the principle from which the need to redo art arose was very noble and ultimately useful: for a budding painter, copying was a real school, which allowed him to learn from the best. History Black Mesa is first and foremost a tribute to Half-Life, because without a deep admiration for Valve's title, such a large group of people would never have worked on it for so long. However, it is also a way to allow the new generations to get to know the original without having to force themselves to accept all those limits that a game from the last millennium brings with it. Finally, it represented an exceptional school for the development team, which during the long process was able to understand what it means to go from creating an amateur project to a professional one. Black Mesa tells exactly the story of the first Half-Life: on his first day at work in the secret Black Mesa facility, scientist Gordon Freeman is involved in an accident that causes aliens from another dimension to break into our world. The funny guys, instead of trying to get to know humans, start eating them. Freeman runs off to get help, only to discover to his horror that what he thought were friends are actually not: the military wants to stop the alien menace, but also erase all traces of the accident, including the survivors. The only way left for Freeman to save himself is to keep running and try to figure out how to stop the aliens himself. Gameplay Like Half-Life, Black Mesa is a classic first-person shooter in which the player, in the role of Freeman, must overcome a series of linear levels by killing all enemies, whether alien or human, and solving simple puzzles, mostly composed from levers to pull and passages to unlock. Despite being the remake of Half-Life, Crowbar Collective's title tries to improve the original in every way, while using more modern 3D models for the enemies, many of which are taken from Half-Life 2, as well as for the scenarios completely redone from scratch. In addition, the Havok physics engine included in the latest versions of the Source Engine is used, which allows you to make the presence of crates, barrels and other game objects more realistic. The final result is very similar to its source of inspiration, but at the same time it lets itself be played as if it were a completely autonomous title: we are faced more with a re-reading than with a carbon copy. However, the key moments of the first Half-Life are all there, from the fight with the alien tentacles, to the escape on the rails of Black Mesa, up to the final confrontation with the Nihilanth in the Xen levels. There are also all the side characters that fans love so much, like the mysterious G-Man. As already mentioned, the setting is that of a classic FPS. Freeman can therefore carry all the weapons he finds around the levels: from the iconic crowbar to the powerful RPG, passing through the Tau Cannon, the crossbow and the Glock 17, just to name a few. What changes compared to Half-Life are the reload times, the rate of fire and other technical characteristics of the weapons, as well as the tactics of the enemies, which make the shootings different from those of the original, bringing them closer to those of Half-Life 2, i.e. enriching them with a tactical nuance that can be appreciated. Note that the artificial intelligence of CPU-driven creatures has also been improved with the latest update. No miracle, but now cases of pleasant behaviorthey are rarer. In total Black Mesa is made up of twenty chapters, the latter of which are the most retouched part compared to Half-Life. We are talking about the Xen levels, excellent in construction, mediocre in puzzles. Crowbar decided to redo them because the originals were so bland. Overall now they perform much better, but some naivety could have been avoided. Was it worth waiting so long for Black Mesa? The answer is undoubtedly yes, because it is a quality remake, very capable of standing on its own legs. We also hope that it will be the beginning of something bigger, that is that the developers can now start working on a completely their own project, which will detach them from the breast of Valve. Who knows, maybe it will be the latter to entrust him with a new project related to Half-Life, given that with Half-Life: Alyx it seems to want to revive the saga.", "date": "2020-03-06", "grade": "8.9"}
