With Ashes of Outland, Scholomance Academy, and the review of Madness at the Darkmoon Faire you're reading, the Year of the Phoenix of Hearthstone comes to a close. A year made up of several changes, announced precisely on the occasion of its start by Team 5 working on the card game published in 2014. Six years of life therefore, after which Blizzard has decided to take several steps to give a new look in Hearthstone, starting with the introduction of a new class, the Demon Hunter, for the first time since the launch of this title. The appearance of Illidan Stormrage among the selectable heroes has given way to a series of changes that have touched all aspects of Hearthstone, starting from the game dynamics to get to the available modes and finally (as we are about to see today) to the rewards system for players. A week after the unpacking dedicated to the Follia envelopes at the Darkmoon Fair, let's go and find out what are the new features introduced on the occasion of this expansion that closes the year, waiting to know what Blizzard's plans will be for 2021 of Hearthstone. New Cards: Welcome to Darkmoon Madness at the Darkmoon Fair is made up of one hundred and thirty-five new cards as per tradition, starting in its original idea from the setting offered by the Azeroth traveling fair known by all World of Warcraft players. Supernatural wonders and exotic beasts are therefore the basis of the new cards included in this expansion, accompanied by some figures that even Hearthstone players (at least long-time ones) know very well. Madness at the Darkmoon Fair brings back to the fore the ancient gods already protagonists of the expansion dedicated to them in 2016, thus making us meet again C'thun and various colleagues. To ensure you don't know everything you've already seen, the God Cards are clearly different from Whispers of the Old Gods, while retaining the same basic design features seen four years ago. This is how C'thun is divided, for example, into four pieces corresponding to as many spells, with which to reassemble it to inflict thirty damage to enemies, N'Zoth resurrects minions as usual and Yogg-Saron once again makes RNG his own battle horse. Speaking of ancient gods you will have noticed that one is still missing, but we are about to find out why. The New Dynamic: Corruption The new incarnation of Y'shaarj leads us to talk about the new keyword introduced by Darkmoon Faire, Corruption. When in your hand, cards with this ability can get a boost if you play a card with a higher mana cost. An aspect that in the decks born after the release of the expansion has obviously proved to be the object of experimentation by the meta, also thanks to figures such as Bigtittus who immediately gave life to a Sorcerer deck which, with the sound of removing cards from the deck of the opponent tries to remove any important cards from the top and at the same time to send him into fatigue. However, there are numerous effects obtainable thanks to the Corruption, among which we also point out that of the Clown of the Fair which allows you to fill your side of the field with a 4/4 creature equipped with Taunt, or the Master of the Pits dedicated to the Shaman who with three mana gives the possibility of dropping up to three creatures to evolve. Beyond the most striking effects, the new Corruption dynamic opens the door to a strategic approach to its use. In fact, the player can evaluate based on the situation whether it is worth using the basic version of the card in his hand, or wait for it to get the boost, thus adapting to the situation presented by the current game.As regards the meta, at one week after the launch of the expansion we are still in the process of adjusting. The current condition seems to favor faster decks, for which Madness at the Darkmoon Faire doesn't lack alternatives. One of these is undoubtedly the Winner of the Mystery dedicated to the Hunter, thanks to which at one cost it is possible to find a secret, thus also preparing the game for the following round. Just the Hunter at the moment seems to be the most successful class, divided between its Face variant and the Highlander one (which in any case gives a nod to the first). After the acclaim obtained thanks to the cards of the latest expansions, the Pure Paladin enriched by the legendary Grand Exarch Yrel remains in vogue, while the Demon Hunter also continues to go strong, also in the double variant Aggro and Soul. To keep seight eye is also the Shaman, together with its evolutions. New rewards, old problems? Even if technically the new reward system studied by Blizzard is not part of Madness at the Darkmoon Fair, its arrival is still linked to the new expansion given the timing. In a diametrically opposite way to the positive opinion on the expansion and on its cards, in this case the impression is that Team 5 could study something better to avoid unleashing player protests. In fact, the choice was to abandon the old mission system, enriching it with weekly quests which, together with the daily ones, allow you to accumulate experience points to use to advance on the Reward Path. The latter can be dealt with more quickly if the player purchases the relevant pass, which increases the experience provided by the quests at the price of 19.99 euros. A figure to possibly add to the price of the packages dedicated to the expansion envelopes. The absence of the legendary quests that guaranteed extra packages and some calculations on the convenience of the new reward system have in fact led players almost immediately to clear themselves against the solution implemented by blizzards. The development team thus had to intervene with a post from game director Ben Lee, who apologized both for the way in which the new rewards were implemented and for the lack of adequate communication from Blizzard in presenting it, promising changes intended to make the rewards more profitable for players. We must say that the idea that there may be seasonal events from which to get experience boosts does not drive us crazy, since not everyone can guarantee the same presence in terms of games played in Hearthstone during the various months. However, the immediate reaction of the developers to the protests of the players remains to be appreciated, waiting to find out what will happen in the coming months.", "date": "2020-11-26", "grade": "7.8"}
