{"name": "La recensione di Okami HD", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/192373-okami-hd-la-recensione-di-okami-hd.html", "text": "That of Clover Studio is an unfortunate story: this team financed by Capcom - and made up of some of the greatest talents of the Japanese giant - has created some exceptional titles during its short existence, from the Viewtiful Joe (it is, to all effects, born during the development of the first of the two chapters) in Godhand, and laid the foundations for what would later be the Platinum Games. Outside of the adventures of the bombastic Joe, however, every Clover game has been a flop in stores, and this despite possessing qualities that allow them to become small cults over time. Okami is one of these forgotten pearls, and if we're bringing it out today it's not to forcefully rediscover it, but only because Capcom has decided to re-propose this magnificent video game to the public with yet another remaster, this time dedicated to PlayStation 4, Xbox One and pc. Just think, this is even the fourth chance given to what is considered by many to be the great work of Hideki Kamiya (yes, the director of Devil May Cry and Resident Evil 2), mainly due to its ability to remain visually wonderful regardless how long has it been. We obviously can only advise you to play it if you haven't done so yet, because the title is truly a masterpiece, the cost of this version is far from prohibitive and the passage from platform to platform has certainly not made it worse; however, we also want to warn you about some of the reasons why we believe that Okami has never broken through and analyze the actual quality of the latest port, to see if it really is the definitive version of Kamiya's baby. Victim of a curse? Okami's storyline has roots firmly planted in the mythology of the Land of the Rising Sun and Shintoism, and sees you battling a terrible curse that has fallen on the land of Nippon due to the liberation of the eight-headed monster Orochi. However, the story written by the good Kamiya is not limited to taking a single legend and turning it into the basis for an adventure: it soon increases in complexity and scale, shaping an epic full of memorable events and characters. Overall Okami is therefore an extremely extensive title and capable of capturing attention starting from the narrative, also thanks to its ability not to take itself too seriously; however, we must warn you about a specific aspect of the game, which could daze many users and lead them to give up after a while: it has a frighteningly slow start, and it takes a few hours to properly fuel, to the point of requiring almost twenty minutes only to get through the initial set of cutscenes. Anyone who decides to take on the hairy clothes of Amaterasu - the sun goddess reincarnated in the body of a wolf to fight Orochi - must therefore absolutely take this obstacle into account before starting everything. We assure you that after some time the experience is completely transformed, offering a series of brilliant and very unique mechanics, and some of the most beautiful views ever seen in a video game. From a mechanical point of view, after all, Okami is nothing short of an ingenious title, centered on virtual ~brushstrokes~ with which the player can activate powers of various kinds: it starts with the simple ability to launch slashing buckets (however very important for much of the campaign), but from there we move on to reviving vegetation, partially controlling watercourses, reshaping objects and creating vines, with a long list of other goodies that can be used both to complete puzzles and to fight the many demonic enemies that populate the maps of Nippon. Howl, howl When we talk about puzzles then we do not mean simple objects to collect or buttons to press, as is usually observed in most products that make the action their fulcrum. Okami is in fact a creature born from a director specialized in action, but its curious structure springs from Hideki Kamiya's love for The Legend of Zelda and therefore it is a title where exploration, puzzles and the sense of discovery are fundamental, very close to the works of Miyamoto. For heaven's sake, the fights are still an integral part of the equation, yet they take on a particular form to say the least, with enemies that can be eliminated with the witty use of Amaterasu's special moves or the aforementioned brush. The ~signature~ of the director can be seen in some slightly immature double meanings, in hilarious moments placed at random here and there, in the post-battle evaluations and in the presence of extra moves that can be learned in specific areas; outside of these characteristics, however, Okami is a creative leap for manyaspects unattainable even within the incredible list of games created by the rude Hideki. In short, Okami is the absolute proof of the artistic and professional maturity of one of the most controversial (grumpy) and brilliant authors on the scene, and as such it should be played by anyone. With this we do not mean that the title is perfect: apart from the initial slowness already described, some of its internal quests are far from brilliant, and despite a splendid soundtrack, the choice to make the voices of the characters a strange repeated muttering turned some cutscenes into mind poison. We normally get used to the ~way of speaking~ of Ammy's supporting actors during the campaign, but if you don't make it, we advise you to silence the speech audio from the options; trust me, you will thank us. Now that such beauty has once again been described, however, it is time to evaluate the actual port, and its characteristics. Well, indeed this is not the best possible edition, because while on the one hand the game still boasts a magnificent appearance due to a graphic style that closely resembles Japanese paintings, on the other hand there are no tweaks of any kind to its structure . The loading minigame can be deactivated or activated as desired, but this is a factor of little importance: the text of the dialogues cannot be speeded up properly, there are no additional options worthy of note and the only real gem of the operation lies in the support at 4K resolution and in the impeccable fluidity of the whole (we saw a couple of scatterelli, but these were really isolated cases). The beauty of this game doesn't lie in the resolution, so we would have liked more in-depth work in the other aspects, despite the more than affordable selling price.", "date": "2017-12-11", "grade": "8.8"}
