{"name": "Deliver Us Mars", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/deliver-us-mars-recensione.html", "text": "Deliver Us The Moon was a solitary journey of the protagonist, tasked with solving an energy crisis caused by an unidentified problem on the Moon. He was practically alone for the whole adventure and the story was told through the holograms that were around and some documents that had to be read. The filmed sequences were few and quite limited and the other human beings were practically absent. Be that as it may, the game must have sold quite well, as KeokeN Interactive has managed to find a publisher for the sequel, which comes accompanied not only by a bigger marketing campaign, but also by higher production values, which translate into a large number of films and in a richer and more varied cast of characters, as well as constantly present on the scene. The resulting experience is extremely different in terms of atmosphere and the story itself, as we will see in the review of Deliver Us Mars. Fundamental game systems Kathy Johanson is the protagonist of Deliver Us Mars Kathy Johanson's adventure begins with a flashback of her as a child going swimming with her sister. This is the classic introductory sequence that takes us to discover the essential game systems, between basic controls and environmental interactions. It is also the way in which the Deetman brothers, the authors, introduce us to the main theme of the adventure, namely the relationship between the protagonist, her father Isaac Johanson and, more marginally, her sister, a relationship that will be the subject of numerous flashbacks in the over the nine or so hours it takes to get to the end of the game. The different ambitions of Deliver Us Mars compared to Deliver Us The Moon are also evident from the length of the introduction: while in the previous title the arrival on the Moon was quite rapid, here there is a large introductory section, divided into different sequences which precede the Martian mission. Deliver Us Mars is full of Deliver Us The Moon reference In the first three hours of the game we therefore learn how Isaac stole three Arks, i.e. three large ships equipped with highly advanced technology that should be able to save the Earth from the ecological disaster that is destroying all life forms, to take them to Mars, we know other characters , which will accompany us for the rest of the game, and we are introduced to all the major systems, including the two fundamental to the experience, as well as the more playful ones: the alignment system of the MPT antennas, which are used to energize the various systems with which we will find ourselves operating, whether they are the openings of simple doors or of the gigantic power supply devices of the Arks; and the wall climbing system, which avoids the automatisms of the various Uncharted and Tomb Raiders and focuses on greater physicality, which translates into more active participation on the part of the player. But let's go in order. Storytelling at the center of everything The main facts of Deliver Us Mars are learned by watching holograms, as in Deliver Us The Moon The introduction is also notable for another reason: it shows the developers' love for space exploration, much more than they managed to do in Deliver Us The Moon. As? For example by recreating the launch sequence of a space rocket, the Zephyr, making the player experience it in first person through a series of unique actions, i.e. placing him in front of the command bridge to make him perform the operations necessary for departure, including the release of the modules once you pass the atmosphere. In its simplicity (the actions are guided and you can only interact with the required commands), the sequence of actions that the player is called to perform is particularly suggestive and conveys the importance, almost solemnity, of the moment well. Who knew we'd lead the launch of a space rocket? Something like this will also be found in a very advanced section of the game, but the departure is certainly the moment in which we are most strongly asked to share the protagonist's emotion for the journey, also because it is lived with a strong sense of detachment and arrives after a series of narratively important events, which provide the right motivation for identification. Of course, here we can already see how Deliver Us Mars is an incredibly linear and guided adventure, but in reality the weight of it is not felt too much, given the importance that is immediately given to the story, moreover told very well. After all, the narrative is the fulcrum of the entire experience, with the authors who have decided to give the player a more marginal role, as a simple witness of the inner drama that Kathy experiences for the entire adventure and which will find fulfillment in the finale. The narrationthe action itself is handled quite classically, using cutscenes and holograms, as was the case in Deliver Us The Moon. The latter are linked to a decryption minigame, in which you basically have to position Ayla, Kathy's pod that follows her wherever she goes, so as to align three pieces of a circle, connected to movements on the X, Y and Z axes. for the various environments there are also elements to be scanned to obtain general information (machinery, particularly interesting objects and so on) and some documents, in particular dialogues recorded on tablets. There are also collectibles, like comics, that serve as extra content and push you to explore the environments more carefully. Cutting, scaling and using the meninges Ayla watches us as we scale a wall As mentioned, there are essentially two main play systems, to which others are linked. In general, the developers have tried to make the part played perfectly consistent with the narrative. Kathy is not a warrior and does not fight. She is equipped with a wrist laser with which she can cut metal objects (only those decided by design), wears a suit with a limited amount of oxygen, which is recharged every time you enter any building, and carries two ice axes climbing surfaces, which are used to climb and descend some walls (the climbing surfaces are always easily distinguishable). The system itself is designed to make climbing more ~physical~ than other titles in the genre, giving the player control of both Kathy's arms, which can be moved one at a time to find the best holds and which have autonomous. Most of the time is spent inside large, labyrinthine structures Incidentally, leaving both buttons connected to the arms causes the protagonist to fall. In this way the player almost feels the weight of the action he is carrying out and finds himself holding the controller tightly as if by letting go he risks ending up like the protagonist. The sense of danger therefore remains constant and the player is motivated to keep his attention on what he is doing throughout the climb. It should be noted that the gameplay never abuses this system, maintaining its consistent and well-dosed use until the end of the game, while regularly introducing small, sometimes almost imperceptible, variations. However, don't expect Deliver Us Mars to become very difficult or impossible, because that is not its purpose. The challenge is in a certain sense functional to the narrative and above all serves to make the danger of the mission perceived, rather than to block the player. Sometimes a rover is also driven, but for short distances, on linear paths and with no real obstacle to overcome The same goes for the other fundamental system, i.e. the alignment of the MPT antennas, which basically requires connecting energy beams to generators, using dividers and deviators to be able to give the device to be activated exactly the amount of energy it needs. If you have played The Talos Principle, you more or less know what awaits you, although it must be said that in Deliver Us Mars there are never situations in which the puzzles become difficult to the point of blocking the player for more than a few minutes, where the Croteam title instead became extremely complicated in the more advanced stages. Let's say that to find the solution to the puzzles, between bulkheads to raise, walls to overcome and generators to activate in a certain sequence, you don't need much more than a good spirit of observation. These puzzles also aim to make Ayla's presence more active, which we can send inside conduits in search of out-of-the-way appliances, or to place some of them in points that Kathy cannot reach. There are also icy patches on Mars We also mention the presence of a drivable rover, but only because it is shown in some videos and images. Let's say that in reality it is an underexploited feature, since it is essentially used to move, but without any obstacles or risks. Just follow the road to get to your destination... also because if you don't do it and try to deviate, you are immediately brought back into line. Probably if the trips had been automatic they would not have allowed to admire the surface of Mars recreated by the developers. Sure, they could have been made more interesting. Technical considerations Some moments are truly evocative, although built around a well-established iconography From a technical point of view Deliver Us Mars is a good title for its price range and its production level. Let's say that it performs very well in thelandscapes and in some details, such as the dashboards or the characters' suits, while it is much poorer in the human 3D models, in some cases really crude, and above all in the animations, a fact that is particularly noticeable in some filmed sequences. Be that as it may, the game often produces very beautiful landscapes, which can be admired willingly and in general the visual style is very suitable for the genre and to make the feeling of being in a remote and inhospitable place. On the other hand, the soundtrack is excellent, full of ambient sounds and embellished with songs by the composer Sander Van Zanten, which accompany the most dramatic moments of the game with great conviction, giving it great expressive power.", "date": "2023-02-02", "grade": "8.0"}
