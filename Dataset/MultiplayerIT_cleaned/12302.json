{"name": "Metal Slug Anthology - recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/metal-slug-anthology-recensione.html", "text": "The original game Metal Slug was certainly one of the most representative video games of the second half of the 90s on the Neo Geo platform. It was, in practice, the evolution of the concept of two-dimensional action game, enriched in every respect by the presence of usable vehicles, weapons to collect as well as really huge bosses. On Wii the game is reproduced perfectly, even in the slowdowns: we can throw ourselves into the fray with our alter ego and eliminate many enemies with gunshots, in a series of horizontal scrolling stages. The game mechanics are extremely simple: you can hit your opponents by aiming horizontally or vertically, while you have to crouch or jump to avoid shots fired in your direction. When an enemy is very close, the character takes out a knife and attacks them in this way. In the scenarios there are some prisoners of war who need to be freed and who give us special weapons with limited shots: machine guns, missile launchers, flamethrowers, etc. etc., in a variety of attacks that until Metal Slug 6 becomes really embarrassing as it is vast. Unfortunately, our guerrilla does not have an energy bar: every hit suffered implies the loss of a life but it is possible to continue indefinitely as in the best tradition of arcade video games. On a home console, this feature loses all its charm, allowing you to finish the game with little effort by continuing an unknown number of times until you are right even the most fearsome bosses. Metal Slug 2 and X The success of Metal Slug convinced SNK to immediately produce a sequel, inserting a series of interesting innovations. First of all, the possibility of selecting one's own character among four available: Marco Rossi (the one from the first episode), Tarma (faithful companion in adventures) and the shrewd Fio and Eri. There are no substantial differences in choosing Marco instead of one of his friends, but the background of Metal Slug 2 is immediately different from that of the first episode. The ~standard~ war scenario is replaced by exotic locations, in this case Asian deserts dotted with regular soldiers but also with dangerous mummies, who with their own breath can also transform you into their own kind for a certain period of time. Not bad: the transformation makes it much slower and the normal attack is affected, but the grenades become powerful Molotov cocktails and wipe out enemies with ease. Instead of armored vehicles (which actually give the name to Metal Slug...), we will often find ourselves riding camels: good for the firepower, really high; bad for the character's vulnerability, which is not protected by any shielding. The consensus of the enthusiasts led SNK to the subsequent creation of Metal Slug X, to all intents and purposes a review of Metal Slug 2 with the same scenarios and the same enemies, but some elements of differentiation (night landscapes instead of diurnal ones, different position and greater number of opponents, etc.). Metal Slugs 3 and 4 With Metal Slug 3 we are witnessing a real new episode of the series. The four selectable characters are always the same, but the scenarios and enemies change radically: this time we will fight on beaches or in any case near the sea, also because we will find ourselves facing giant crustaceans and insects. Then, at a certain point, the zombies will also arrive, in droves, who can spit a substance on us that transforms us into the living dead similar to what happened in MS2 with the mummies. And also in this case the mutation has its merits: the throwing of the grenade is transformed into a ~vomited~ of blood that reaches even the most distant enemies and exterminates them mercilessly. That into zombies is not the only possible transformation: once a certain amount of food has been collected, in fact, our character becomes a huge fat man who is slow to move, but who kills nearby enemies with forkfuls and has a more powerful than normal machine gun . In Metal Slug 4 for the first time both the character design of the characters, in the selection screen, and some of the characters themselves are changed: Tarma and Eri give way to Trevor (the hot guy on duty) and Nadia. However, this change does not affect the game's economy. The setting this time is urban, with some sections in motion and the presence, as usual, of huge and very resistant bosses. Metal Slugs 5 and 6 Metal Slug 5 is the last episode of the ~old guard~, that is, it introduces novelties that are limited to the presence of new scenarios (in this case a jungle near Aztec temples) and new enemies, or rather dangerous Zulus who are then enhanced by the intervention of aalien race. The usable characters are always four and we return to the configuration of the second episode (therefore Marco, Tarma, Fio and Eri), while new weapons are introduced (above all the double machine gun, truly devastating). However, it is Metal Slug 6 that represents a real break with the past. The seventh and final episode of the series, in fact, presents itself with a series of substantial innovations: two are added to the four basic characters, and they are none other than the Ikari Warriors, Ralf and Clark (present, among other things, in the most editions of King of Fighters). The graphic resolution is higher, which at first makes you turn up your nose (also the fault of the first scenario we will be dealing with) but then reveals a series of features of sure impact, such as the numerous zooms that the view performs especially during the boss fight. The game structure is also different: at the beginning you are asked to play at an easy or hard level, with the difference of always having a heavy machine gun as a basic weapon or starting from scratch and facing a greater number of enemies. This time the weapons can be carried two at a time and switch from one to the other with a button, while there are some alternative close attacks (in particular for Ralf and Clark, who perform respectively in a flurry of punches and in a grappling with launch). The enemies, in this case, are very bad aliens... Features of the Wii version While technically perfect, the conversion of the seven Metal Slugs for Wii suffers from the peculiar control system of the Nintendo console, mainly because the developers seem to have gone out of their way to complicate things. There are several possibilities, which see using only the Wii-mote horizontally, a combination with the Nunchuck or even just the latter. As an alternative, the GameCube controller can be connected but the character must be controlled via the D-pad and not the analog stick. It is also not possible to use the Classic Controller, which is absurd. In the end, the best solution is that of the horizontal Wii-mote, with the only problem of throwing the grenade, which unfortunately must be done not with a button but by ~shaking~ the remote control, with all the inconveniences of the case. For the rest, the extras must be unlocked by completing the games. And the ability to continue indefinitely is aided by an instant save that allows us to pick up any of the seven games where we left off, all at the expense of an already stripped-down challenge factor. Comment It is clear that we are dealing with a product designed for enthusiasts, a collection that celebrates ten years of Metal Slug by offering perfect conversions in a ~seven in one~ package whose convenience must be carefully evaluated, based on one's appetite for comparisons to the ultimate SNK action game. Therefore, if you are a fan of the series, and maybe you haven't played it a little or only for the first few episodes, this product will allow you to take home seven games that you will be enthusiastic about. If, on the other hand, you are not interested in retrogaming and Metal Slug has never struck you in a particular way, forget it. Pros: Seven games in one A must for Metal Slug fans Perfect conversions, unlockable extras Cons: Poorly designed control system Limited longevity Only for fans of the series After the recent news of Neo Geo games coming to Virtual Console, we all knew that we could play Metal Slug on Wii. However, SNK caught us off guard, creating a compilation that includes all seven chapters of the series as well as some unlockable extras.", "date": "2007-05-08", "grade": null}
