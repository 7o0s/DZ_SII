{"name": "Bolidi inattesi", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/158398-driveclub-bikes-bolidi-inattesi.html", "text": "Postponed for several months one step away from publication, involved in one of the most catastrophic launches in recent videogame history and inundated with criticism for the management of the infamous PlayStation Plus version, DRIVECLUB is a title born under a very bad star, loaded with a burden despite itself of negativity that has literally destroyed its image in the eyes of users. A real disaster for the exclusive Sony, able to suffocate the good things the Evolution Studios guys had achieved. Despite the pigeon shooting they were subjected to, the developers coordinated by Paul Rustchynsky still did not give up, and in the months following the nightmarish debut they constantly rounded off the edges of their work, adding numerous features and transforming it into what should have represented from the beginning. Today, fortunately, DRIVECLUB is a solid arcade racing game, technically splendid, very rich in content and above all followed by a close-knit community, the beating heart of a product that feeds on online competition and which paradoxically, due to serious problems related to the servers, was about to decree his premature departure. The noisy BIKES expansion also fits into this virtuous rehabilitation path, presented by surprise during the Games Week in Paris and, even more surprisingly, published on the PlayStation Store on the same evening as the announcement. After testing its dynamics during the Paris event, we got our hands on the final version, and these are our impressions. Dream bikes and adrenaline-pumping head-to-head in the DRIVECLUB BIKES expansion Challenges in the saddle of powerful racing cars Before diving into the analysis of DRIVECLUB BIKES it is necessary to underline the interesting distribution method adopted by Sony. It is in fact a stand-alone expansion, which can be purchased for 14.99 Euros by those who own the original game and for 19.99 Euros by all the others. Despite its ~standalone~ nature, it is still intimately integrated into the DRIVECLUB infrastructure, and whether you have it in your library or not, you still need to download the full package to use it. In the main menu screen, by clicking on Guide, it is now possible to decide whether to focus on cars or motorcycles, with the new category practically comparable to four wheels in terms of accessible modes, except for some exclusive features. The Tour, or rather the single player career of DRIVECLUB, offers about fifty different challenges for a total of 162 gold stars to be conquered, equally divided into the six available settings, namely Canada, Chile, India, Japan, Norway and Scotland. Since the twelve motorcycles present are all attributable to the ~Superbike~ category, with the exception of a couple of higher-class monsters such as the Ducati Desmosedici RR and the Kawasaki Ninja H2, the campaign does not offer the classic sense of progression present for the car category ( from Compacts to the so-called Hypercars), but allows you to focus on two specific models in each of the six phases in which it is set. To conquer the gold stars, as happens in DRIVECLUB, it is necessary to place among the top three in the races, detach a specific time in the sprints and indulge in a whole series of secondary challenges, ranging from brushing a trajectory in blue up to passing at high speeds in front of speed cameras, passing through clean laps, average times and so on. The main novelty consists of the so-called Abilities, specific for two wheels and which take the place of the Drift section dedicated to cars. In these challenges the tracks are divided into colored sections and it is necessary to perform wheelies and ~stubble~ (the so-called jamming by lifting the rear wheel), to be alternated with fast passages to obtain the required score. Proceeding on the Tour, which ends with a very tough championship in Canada, the objectives to be achieved are increasingly complex, and some gold stars can only be conquered by hitting two at the same time, such as for example setting a fast time and launching a wheelie for a few hundred meters. In addition to the Tour, random events and single events are also accessible, consisting of Races, Time Trials, Sprints, and the aforementioned Skills. All challenges can be fully customized in terms of weather and time settings, being able to intervene on time compression, cloud cover and spectacular rainfall. The Multiplayer sector, intimately connected to the management of the Clubs, is similar to that of all four-wheeled racesvia at the moment the playlists only include team races and not single races and timed events. In our tests against eleven other players we have never suffered from lag or delay in organizing the challenges: the problems related to the launch of DRIVECLUB are fortunately only a distant, bad memory. Playstation 4 trophies DRIVECLUB BIKES offers a total of twenty-eight new trophies, of which twelve are bronze, eight are silver, seven are gold and one is platinum, which combined with those of the original title make DRIVECLUB the title with the most trophies in PlayStation history. The bronze ones are related to customization, winning specific championships and participating in some single events; the silver ones are related to winning more demanding championships and performing some reckless maneuvers, such as a wheelie of 500 meters and beyond; the golden one is unlocked by unlocking all bikes, earning all stars and other completion factors, while the platinum one is unlocked by achieving all other achievements. Unedited trajectories Translated from an exquisitely arcade racing game, the BIKES expansion certainly could not change the register of the Evolution Studios title, consequently the driving experience with two wheels is practically superimposable to that of cars from the point of view of the physical-dynamic model. making it even more basic at times. The absence of simulative ambitions and the impossibility of falling from your racing car, with the exception of certain crashes that simply reset the position, allows you to perform maneuvers that go beyond the laws of physics and launch into hilarious duels at crazy speeds. The narrow streets of DRIVECLUB have always posed some problems when overtaking, but motorcycles transform tracks like the Chilean Putre or the Norwegian Holmastad into wonderful playgrounds, where you can paint perfect trajectories and always battle to the limit. Head-to-heads, especially online, are much tighter for the full benefit of the fun, with continuous overtaking and counter-overtaking that follow one another until the finish line is crossed. However, in a deeply arcade production it is curious not to be able to combine the front and rear brakes, respectively delegated to the L2 and circle keys, an option present in more simulation titles such as Ride and the MotoGP series. Pressing the R1 key scrolls through the six available views, and the internal ones, which show the painstaking reproduction of motorcycle cockpits, require more time to be managed, but offer a galvanizing experience and an impressive sense of speed. Since the twelve bikes present have more or less the same performance, the differences in behavior are rather limited, and beyond some models that accelerate and wheelie more violently, the main distinguishing feature is the ease with which they let ~go~ the rear, a very useful maneuver in the most demanding curves. In this sense, the Ducati 1098 R, the MV Agusta F4 RR and the wicked Ducati Desmosedici RR are the most likely to drift, while the BMW S1000RR is among the most ~docile~ of the lot. The garage is made up of the main icons of the Superbike class, such as the KTM RC8 R, the Bimota BB3, the Honda CBR1000RR Fireblade SP and the Yamaha YZF-R1, however the Japanese Suzuki is missing. From a technical point of view, the polygonal models are excellent, translated from the official CADs of the manufacturers, exactly as was the case for Ride. In addition to the motorcycle liveries, it is also possible to customize the rider's overalls and helmet, the latter available in eight models and fifteen different designs. Sometimes there is a hint of aliasing on the fairings and helmets, furthermore, driving with an external view, on certain surfaces it seems that the rear tire is not perfectly adherent to the asphalt, but it is a generally bearable defect. At certain speeds the thirty frames per second are felt, however in an arcade game that offers such an amazing visual spectacle, embellished with dynamic weather and cutting-edge lighting effects, it is an acceptable limit and that absolutely does not undermine usability of the product. The sound of the engines is also excellent, faithful to the original one and perfectly recognizable by enthusiasts: on the Kawasaki H2, for example, even the characteristic effect has been implemented which recalls that of the pop-off valve on rally cars.", "date": "2015-10-30", "grade": "8.5"}
