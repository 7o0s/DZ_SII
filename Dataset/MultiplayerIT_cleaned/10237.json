That Nintendo, that Sony and, now we can say it without fear, that of Apple. The Way of the Dragon Needless to repeat for the umpteenth time the plot and setting of Chinatown Wars, now more than known; for the few who still have gaps, we refer you to the reviews of the DS and PSP editions. We will therefore focus in this article specifically on the iPhone version, and therefore consequently on the goodness of the conversion work, especially comparing it on a technical and control level with that of the other editions. As far as the technical component is concerned, the version present on the App Store is approachable in all respects to that on Sony hardware; only a very attentive eye can see a slight advantage of PSP in terms of textures and effects, with more saturated and bright colors, but these are really minimal details that don't call into question the visual quality of the game. Also on the iPhone Chinatown Wars is a very satisfying GTA chapter on an aesthetic level, thanks to a more colorful and ~comic book~ style compared to the home console counterparts; the bird's eye view, despite slightly compromising the player's involvement as a real inhabitant of Liberty City, still proves to be excellent for supporting the game mechanics in each of its sections, whether on foot, by car, by motorbike or during a firefight. On the other hand, the strange exclusion, in this edition, of the voices of passers-by should be noted; if in other cases these in fact resulted in insults, screams and things of this type in front of the actions of the protagonist Huang, on the contrary on the iPhone they were sadly silenced. Fortunately, on the other hand, there are 5 radio stations to entertain yourself with during your travels, each featuring a different musical theme. As far as the control system is concerned, obviously the solution for this version was that of the virtual keys; their arrangement and implementation leaves room for very little criticism, and in most cases the result is proven to be more than enough not to regret the physical buttons too much. Having said that, it is clear that the control system on PSP and DS is undoubtedly more precise and valid; nevertheless, considering that it is a conversion and not a product designed around the capabilities of Apple hardware, in the end Chinatown Wars remains very playable even on this occasion. On the contrary, the touch screen proves to be excellent both in the mini-games and in navigating the menus partially redesigned for the occasion; in this sense the origin of the game on the analogous technology of the DS helps, but the greater precision of the iPhone screen and the absence of the stylus (which forced you to take it and put it away as needed) makes this solution more practical and enjoyable. Finally, where the Apple edition excels is certainly in the quality / price ratio: 7.99 euros are really a trifle, a figure much lower than the other versions while maintaining a very large part of the same contents.
