{"name": "NBA Street Vol. 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nba-street-vol-3.html", "text": "It's on fire! Nba Street v3, as per tradition, abandons any simulation ambitions from the beginning to offer an arcade experience that is immediately enjoyable by anyone. The latest exponent of the genre founded at the time by Nba Jam, the Electronic Arts game maintains the 3 against 3 challenges but moves the setting away from the gyms and arenas, preferring the urban locations so fashionable in recent years. From the pitch behind the house to the one complete with railings and the audience in the stands, the effort of US programmers undoubtedly finds one of its strengths in the graphic design. Despite being a multiplatform product, Nba Street v3 takes advantage of a good portion of the characteristics of the consoles on which it runs, proving to be fully a latest generation game in all respects. The athletes, obviously faithful reproductions of the most famous components of the NBA teams, are characterized by a high level of detail down to the smallest detail, and even once in motion they are appreciated thanks to a truly excellent variety and quality of animations, albeit with some detachment from one to the other. The same goes for the settings too, whose care in making them is enhanced by a top-level lighting system. More generally, the 12 courts of NBA Street v3 give the sensation of being authentically ~alive~, real, with lots of people passing by or spectators who get excited in front of the most spectacular plays. More generally, the EA production is a game that is simply beautiful to look at, and which testifies once again to the great skills of the Big team from this point of view. The Gamecube version also has an exclusive extra content of sure attraction, namely the presence of a team made up of Mario, Luigi and Princess Peach. Although it is fun to observe the 3 Nintendo heroes grappling with real athletes, in a sort of videogame Space Jam, it is really difficult not to find an excessively strong gap between the graphic style chosen by EA Big and that of the big N. Likewise, one gets the impression that with this kind of operation the characters in question are perhaps being inflated too much, distorting them from their original contexts in search of appealing but not always valid all-round solutions. I wanna be a star Among the main novelties of this third version, the Street Challenge mode undoubtedly deserves a place of honor, a sort of career in which it is possible to create one's own athlete from scratch to take him, game after game, to earn such a reputation as to become a name in the ~tour~ and thus afford to sign ever better teammates. Together with the reputation, winning the proposed challenges also allows you to improve the characteristics of your basketball player, gaining skills and buying clothing. But the customization possibilities do not stop there, since Nba Street v3 also allows you to create your own personal pitch, adding and managing the elements of the backdrop as you like and inserting a whole series of ~ornaments~ that can also be purchased. The game mechanic obviously maintains a good part of the characteristics that have made the series appreciated since its debut, without skimping on some modifications and additions of sure interest. The first in importance must certainly be sought in the new trick management, through the so-called ~trick stick~. In other words, now the realization of special moves and juggling tricks is entrusted to the inclination of the analog lever which, associated with the pressure of the back buttons for the turbo, allows an enormous variety associated with a truly remarkable immediacy, already after a short phase of learning. Speaking of keys, it is clear that the control system has been designed with the Ps2 pad in mind, especially for the use of all 4 backbones; this factor that makes the interface of the Xbox and GC versions slightly more complex and less natural. Nothing but the net The spectacularity of Nba Street v3 is not only an accessory element, but a fundamental one in the game system studied by EA Big. The creation of combos made of passes, special moves and tricks in fact produces a number of points that fill up the gamebreaker bar. The latter has also been modified, now allowing for real series of stunts under the basket involving all team members; the interesting thing lies in the fact that the more elaborate gamebreakers not only gratify the player with spectacular actions that are completely out of any logic, but they even allow you to increase the number of points obtained to fill your score. Once you get the hang of it, it won't be difficult to get used to itand dunks of the gamebreaker 3 or even 4 points, thus obtaining an important tool for managing the result of a match in your favor. The fact remains that the impossibility of blocking this kind of special moves in any way could be difficult for many to digest, but in the purely spectacular and ~noisy~ economy of NBA Street v3 it is a choice that makes sense and fits perfectly credibly within the game economy without creating major imbalances. Which unfortunately cannot be said of the artificial intelligence of the CPU-controlled opponents, rather poor and managed by basic and extremely mechanical patterns. Precisely in the face of this not insignificant defect, the multiplayer mode acquires even greater value. Offline multiplayer, mind you, because EA wanted to eliminate the online mode present in the American versions, thus leaving European users without an addition of undoubted thickness. Playing with your friends in the flesh therefore remains the only possibility to challenge human opponents, and it is precisely in these challenges that Nba Street v3 shows its best, confirming itself as the best exponent of its category. A note for the sound, decidedly subdued with a really annoying DJ and banal and repetitive musical accompaniment. Comment Nba Street v3 is certainly a title that fans of the genre will really like, and that won't struggle to establish itself as the best exponent of the arcade basketball game genre. The progress compared to the previous chapter are evident, as are the technical advances that place the EA production among the best titles of the last few months from an aesthetic point of view. Having said that, we certainly cannot turn a blind eye to a really poor CPU artificial intelligence, which clearly invites - or obliges - the user to rely mainly on the multiplayer mode. From this point of view, the total exclusion of online gaming from the European version is therefore incomprehensible and unacceptable, an all too heavy cut that questions the respect of the American giant towards users of the Old Continent. The same goes for the total absence of an Italian translation of even the textual menus, which remained on the contrary in the original language. Pros: Fun and spectacular Graphically excellent Exceptional offline multiplayer Cons: Total absence of online mode Artificial intelligence too incomplete Complex control system on Xbox and GC When it comes to Electronic Arts productions, it's really hard to find a successful game that hasn't become a series. Nba Street is obviously not the exception: despite being a relatively young brand, the EA Big creature has already reached its third chapter in the space of three and a half years. Triumphantly welcomed in the United States where basketball is an institution, NBA Street v3 finally reaches our shores to make every lover of the sport in question happy.", "date": "2005-04-29", "grade": null}
