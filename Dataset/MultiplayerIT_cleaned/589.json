{"name": "EuroCops - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/eurocops-recensione.html", "text": "Power attack Listening to how much the creators of EuroCops worked during the two years of development of the game, it was possible to gallop with the imagination and expect something really cared for down to the smallest detail. The twenty Dutch boys, in fact, not only availed themselves of the advice of real special forces agents, but they even immersed themselves in various soft-air sessions with some professionals of the discipline, for a total of eighty-four hours of simulated battles (for who does not know, in soft-air we divide into teams and battle each other with compressed air weapons, often using real war strategies). Using original weapons to reproduce their noises or the effects on the silhouettes or making use of military consultants for development is one thing  declared EuroCops project manager Erik Pieters  but going into action directly alongside a series of professionals simulating a guerrilla action is very different! For example, thanks to soft air, we understood the importance of covering fire and the strategy to be adopted when engaging. All situations that we have translated into the game thanks to a truly engaging direct experience ~. Unfortunately it must be said that, judging by the final results, Crazy Foot have not really managed to transport their real involvement into the virtual world: it is more engaging to go to the zoo and throw peanuts at the monkeys than to play EuroCops. Let's find out why The twenty Dutch boys even immersed themselves in various soft-air sessions with some professionals of the discipline Give it to the terrorist Wanting to summarize, the title sees the player in command of an elite counter-terrorism team, of which he can control any element he wishes. As the title itself suggests, the missions will take place in Europe, more precisely in the scenarios of Russia, England, France, Spain, Germany and Italy. When it comes to shooters, whether they are in the first or third person, among other things, the emphasis is on the degree of identification that the title can give, on the quality of artificial intelligence and, in recent times, also on physics. Let's get it over with right away: in EuroCops there is absolutely none of this. In particular, the non-artificial intelligence and the almost absolute lack of scripts that can give a minimum semblance of realism to the behavior of terrorists deserve a mention. Since an example is worth a thousand words, I can say that on ~normal~ difficulty you can quietly stand in front of an enemy, at a short distance and without moving, and see that he will miss about eight shots out of ten, never going to sign. Still getting closer, up to melee, the music does not change: most of the machine gun shots fired by the terrorist are magically lost in thin air, and in the meantime you can shoot him down with the butt of the rifle (stuff that not even Chuck Norris at the time of 'gold). As if that weren't enough, other things also make the feeling of realism fall vertically, such as the number of shots needed to kill an enemy and, above all, the number of those needed to be killed, which is excessively exaggerated: shooting purposely at an teammate, it may take more than one hundred (100) machine gun rounds to kill him. In addition, there is no trace of a system sensitive to the parts of the body hit, so shooting in the head or the toenail causes the same results. Because of what has been said, and also much more that it is now superfluous to mention, interest in Eurocops begins to fade from the first moments of the game, and soon runs out completely. Graphics and sound Already from the first level you can ascertain the graphic paucity of the Crazy Foot Games game: textures of the lowest quality, polygonal complexity worthy of a game from three or four years ago, often unnatural animations; and the whole is topped off by an inexplicable overexposure (present in some levels) which makes you seriously consider the hypothesis of using a pair of sunglasses to play. As if that weren't enough, the graphics engine is, if compared to the quality offered, absolutely too heavy: just to give a practical example, the game has an on-screen rendering close to Counter-Strike (smooth, not Source) and, for the same settings, requirements similar to those of Quake 4 (in any case the minimum requirements stated are P3 1 GHz with 128 MB of RAM and a Dx9 video card). From the sound point of view, things improve slightly, not so much thanks to the effects, which are gloomy and unconvincing, but to the music, which, although repetitive already in the medium term, is perhaps the only aspect of the game that is close to sufficiency. Thegraphics engine is, if compared to the quality offered, absolutely too heavy Final comment Sorry for the young team of programmers and for the equally young publisher of the title, the very Italian Rainbow Games, but Eurocops should be elected as the emblem of a video game on which not to spend your money. Mediocre from a technical point of view and bad from a purely playful point of view, in Eurocops you really can't find anything to save even if you put your effort into it. My advice is therefore to leave it where it is: on the shelves. There are no possible compromises with terrorism, no meeting point, no point of dialogue. Only one choice: Defeat them or you will be defeated.~ It might seem like yet another press statement by George Bush after a testosterone overdose, but no: it is what the Dutch team of programmers Crazy Foot Games wrote on the back cover of their latest effort, ~Eurocops~. Driven by an irresistible raptus of originality, the young Crazy Foot have decided to develop a shooter in which terrorism must be fought.
