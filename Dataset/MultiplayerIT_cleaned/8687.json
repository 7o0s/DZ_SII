{"name": "Una vita fra le stelle", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/100335-super-stardust-delta-una-vita-fra-le-stelle.html", "text": "It was back in 1993 when the Finnish team Bloodhouse (which later became Housemarque) brought the first episode of Stardust to the Amiga, a clone of the classic Asteroids in which you put yourself in command of a spaceship engaged, in an inertial context, to destroy the numerous meteorite rocks that surrounded it. The series returned to the limelight with the Super Stardust HD remake, released on the PlayStation Network digital platform in 2007, able to make the franchise current thanks to a new control system based on the two analog sticks, the presence of different weapons and a spectacular high definition graphics. Super Stardust Delta, available in conjunction with the launch of PlayStation Vita, stands as an effective reinterpretation of the same title and offers some exclusive features based on touch devices and the integrated gyroscope, as well as excellent quality gameplay, capable of conquering fans of shooter in a matter of moments. Housemarque's twin analog shooter also positions itself, together with the fun MotorStorm RC, among the low-priced titles for the new Sony console which on paper have the task of shortening the distance between Vita and smartphones, creating an ideal bridge that can attract the numerous casual players, addicted to the offers available on the App Store and Google Play. For just 7.99 euros, Super Stardust Delta offers three game modes (arcade, planets and minigames), two styles (~purity~, which harks back to the original, and ~delta~, designed to take advantage of the unique capabilities of PlayStation Life) and five scenarios full of meteorites and hostile units of various kinds, which once eliminated give way to huge bosses for the final showdown. It is possible to spend a little more, 9.99 euros, and directly take the bundle version, which includes four additional modes, or buy the DLC separately for the price of 2.99 euros. Easy, normal or hard? The degree of difficulty is undoubtedly one of the characterizing elements of Super Stardust Delta, which at the easy level proves to be quite simple to complete in its five planets, but which already at the normal level puts a considerable challenge on the table even for those who eat bread and bullet hell, given the presence of only three ~lives~ as opposed to the (quite right) absence of ~continue~. The experience can therefore be enjoyed at various levels, trying to gradually memorize the threats we will have to deal with during the five stages that make up each scenario and which are crowned, as already mentioned, by an exciting boss fight. Our spacecraft is in orbit around a planet and has the task of destroying a certain amount of meteorites and / or hostile vehicles, with particular attention to the high score, which is obtained by chaining the eliminations and taking advantage of some multipliers. The score obtained in each match is compared with that of our friends on PSN, lighting the flame of competition in place of a real multiplayer mode. The control system is typical of dual analog stick shooters, so the left stick of PlayStation Vita is used to move the ship while the right one activates and directs fire. The right shoulder key switches between fire and ice. The first weapon emits a sort of powerful red flame that burns hostile units and rocks of the same color almost instantly, and which we can ~distribute~ almost as if it were an energy whip to free the immediate surrounding area from dangers. The second weapon, on the other hand, is of the traditional type, with a shower of blue bullets which, based on the upgrades, can become wider and increase its range. Tone issue Although limited to the weapons (therefore not as in Ikaruga, where the color also influenced the sensitivity of the spacecraft to enemy fire), the obligation to alternate the two shades produces a substantial increase in the thickness of the experience, creating a whole series of situations in which we may have to quickly switch from one attack to another in order to survive and extricate ourselves from the dozens of hostile units that surround us. Furthermore, when things get too complicated, you can use special attacks. The EMP bomb, which can be activated by pressing the X button, eliminates nearby threats and is the only extra we can have if we select the ~purity~ style, whereas the ~delta~ style also allows us to generate a devastating black hole, capable to suck in enemies and make them collapse on each other, or to launch a myriad of missiles in all directions. These last two maneuvers are performed by default using the touch pad respectivelyback and to the touch screen, but the excessive sensitivity of both devices often triggers one or the other attack inadvertently. Fortunately, the controls are fully customizable in the options screen as well as the view, which in the starting setting moves following the inclination of the console thanks to the integrated gyroscope, but which can be moved away and made fixed if you prefer a traditional approach. Playstation 3 trophies There are twenty Trophies made available by Super Stardust Delta, and many can be obtained in a relatively simple way, or by completing the various planets and completing the single player campaign. The more complex Trophies are those that are unlocked only by reaching a certain high score and obtaining certain multipliers. star star... The single player mode, composed as mentioned by a total of five planets, is supported by a series of minigames that exclusively exploit the touch screen, the rear touch pad and the gyroscope of PlayStation Vita. The first minigame, Disintegration, sees us destroying asteroids on the screen by pressing our fingers in the same place on both the front and back of the console. Disco Spaziale instead is based only on the touch screen and asks us to conduct a disc with the possibility of destroying the blue elements but not the lethal red ones. Orbital Bombardment takes advantage of the gyroscope: our goal is to move the console to aim and open fire with the back keys, eliminating any unit that approaches the device placed in the center of the scenario. Rock 'n' Roll instead works via an accelerometer and sees us lead a meteor rock by tilting PSVita according to the direction in which we want it to move. Finally, the trucker brings attention back to our spacecraft, which however is without weapons and must use a tractor beam to launch the asteroids on the enemies. The minigames represent more of an amusement with respect to the fulcrum of the game, therefore their specific weight with respect to the global evaluation of the Housemarque product is low. Much more significant is the technical sector, which shows off splendid graphics, with spectacular light effects and a frame rate anchored to 60 fps. The sound accompaniment is less brilliant. We would have expected it to be more incisive.", "date": "2012-03-12", "grade": "8.5"}
