Five hundred, not as the perfect number of fights for Vin Diesel or even as the price of the game (for heaven's sake, twenty-nine euros is a bargain for so much good material), but we said, five hundred as the number of pages that make up the manual. Luckily for you, not for me who lost my eyes on the pdf version, the Italian package will contain the entire naval warfare course printed on paper. If you are not one of those who are already speculating on the new possibilities offered by a diesel-engined Kilo submarine, then you will need many hours even just to perform the most basic operations, but thanks to the guide that contains the answer to every possible and imaginable question, you will succeed in the enterprise. Let's hope so. However, we can assure you: it is a satisfaction that repays you for all the time spent. More than wasting two days trying to get a +1 monkey bandana for your elf. Yo no soy Marinero Scrolling through the preview of Dangerous Waters written by my beloved colleague Tagliaferri, I noticed that there was talk of an alleged film of mine without clothes, which actually exists but which will not be re-proposed here. Instead, what has been faithfully reproduced as an obsessive espionage task is the compilation of an immense database, which includes all sorts of marine vehicles with warlike relevance in the naval field and which constitutes the resource for the missions that will engage you in reconnaissance maneuvers , interception, escort and of course, drum roll, eliminating an enemy target. Despite the familiarity acquired with the splendid Silent Hunter III, we preferred to take advantage of any help provided to us by Sonalysts, in this case a one-hour video tutorial, non-interactive but well designed to teach you the basics of naval warfare. Added to this is an option of enormous value for all beginners, which allows you to lighten the load of responsibility by entrusting all the control rooms of which you do not yet feel masters to the CPU, leaving you alone to grapple with the crucial decisions. It goes without saying that the game is all in the radar rooms or navigation charts, and sooner or later you'll have to take the plunge and master the necessary knowledge, so the answer is yes, it's a hair-raising affair, but thanks the tutorial you will enter just enough to find the courage to advance further. the level of simulation is simply excellent; there is not a single control panel that has not been faithfully reproduced in the range of functions for which it was designed Yo no soy Marinero Well, you may therefore wonder what the captain should do once he decides to stop with the seagulls. First of all, he must dismiss the CPU and go below deck, where the decisive choices must be made with astuteness and foresight: the war between the seas does not consist of separate passages, each maneuver must converge in one point in order to successfully conclude an interception. The first thing to understand is that each vehicle is different from the others, even if once you have mastered the first it will be much easier to pilot the following ones. The key to the game lies in calculating the distances within which you will be intercepted, as identifying the enemy without being discovered is everything in this kind of clashes. However, radar and sonar are not enough, you need to learn to play in pairs with aerial reconnaissance vehicles and know the buoys settings in depth to hunt down your opponent's units. Of course programmable weapons are a whole world to discover, requiring new hours of learning to be able to accurately choose when to shoot and what to shoot. The possibility of using a microphone to issue orders to the crew in real time, relying on your voice, is interesting, a bit like in SOCOM. If you want to give it a try, you have the best simulator of the naval genre at a price below its value Yo no soy Marinero The level of simulation is simply excellent; there isn't a single command panel that hasn't been faithfully reproduced in its graphic layout and above all in the range of functions for which it was designed. We mustn't forget that Sonalysts also produces war simulators for the army and consequently has access to the entire military range of powers such as the United States of America. This is precisely what makes Dangerous Waters exciting: the pleasure of playing lurks in the steep difficulty curve that will make you sweat in the dark, while you take responsibility for every little choice, moving towards thearch of the enemy. Many times since Silent Hunter III I've been on the verge of quitting, and while I've never become a great expert, the satisfaction of completing a mission is something that other game genres will never be able to convey in the same way. Are you still on the bridge with binoculars looking at the horizon?! Come on, the campaign (no, not that one) awaits you and doesn't bode well! The tough design of the navy Indeed, the campaign, set in a hypothetical modern Cold War naval crisis, is very demanding. Rich in missions all linked together by a historical trace that makes us feel on the verge of an imminent conflict, with the task of foiling the worst. Every means available has been employed in the campaign, and the gameplay experience varies greatly as you go above and beyond. A submarine is very complex and delicate, between depth charges that could easily damage it and the constant risk of producing too much noise, while the warship has to deal with its immediate visibility, even if it can rely on reconnaissance aircraft and on the aforementioned helicopter. It goes without saying that this is a long and extremely complex mode, but that you can also set aside the early days by trying your hand at the Quick Missions, in which you can experiment with all the main war maneuvers, from reconnaissance to attack. If there are still special needs, Sonalysts has made available an Editor to let the user customize his naval battle. So let's come to the graphics sector, which as you can see from the photos is reduced to the bare minimum to allow each machine to easily render three-dimensional models with visible blocks and somewhat approximate textures. This of course is not a defect, as no enthusiast really doesn't care about the graphic rendering of a simulator, but a little attention to the special effects relating to damage and explosions would not have hurt anyway. The situation improves slightly as regards the surface of the sea and the aquatic effects during the dive, instead giving the maximum in the two-dimensional rendering of the displays, in front of which you will lose sight for most of the time: rough but well defined they are the most alluring for a real marine simulator. On the other hand, we have a completely different opinion as regards the sound: setting aside the faint music, even the effects are of low quality. It might be the needle in the haystack, but when you're alone deep down, sounds are your only companions. Instead, we close with a flourish with a note on the multiplayer option, which beyond the support for over 30 users allows you to participate in a cooperative with other navy fanatics. Someone could get behind the wheel of the aircraft while others share the various control rooms. Surely an attractive hypothesis but one that will find little practical confirmation; imagine the difficulty in finding other people like you willing to spend hours in front of a sonar. However, trying does not hurt, and this also applies to non-enthusiasts. If you want to give it a try, you have the best simulator of the naval genre at a price below its value. In short, it's now or never and if you start to like it, don't forget Silent Hunter III, the perfect shelf companion for Dangerous Waters. Ecological predators Kilo-class submarines are powered by a diesel-electric hybrid engine. This forces a complete review of the strengths and weaknesses associated with nuclear models. Kilo submarines are normally employed on routes adjacent to the coasts rather than in the open ocean, due to the short range that the diesel engine allows. Unlike nuclear submarines, these vessels cannot afford long periods at sea and have to deal with their limited energy reserves. On the other hand they boast an area of over 300 meters of vacuum which allows them to hide and to exploit the many noises of the seabed to confuse the detectors of magnetic anomalies. Final comment Dangerosu Waters is a simulator in the most intimate sense of the term, which leaves aside playability and entertainment factors by focusing on the charm that already accompanies the experience of mastering a marine conflict. However, this makes it an extremely complex, closed and challenging game. The rewards are high but require effort that far exceeds the availability of most players. However, it boasts numerous exciting and detailed missions, in which to take part in all sorts of maneuvers. You will be the captains in command of all the rooms that allow the reproduced media to actually work in the mari. Compared to the titles that preceded it, Dangerous Waters implements the diesel-powered Kilo submarines and two aerial reconnaissance vehicles to be explored together with the FFG-7 warship. The challenge is one of those set at the highest levels, even if a 500-page manual will be as inseparable for you as the sacred scriptures for a monk. Dangerous Waters costs little and offers enthusiasts a range of vehicles that covers every aspect of naval warfare, with a level of reproduction of reality at the limits of possibilities. If that's not enough, just enlist. Pros Comprehensive in every respect An excellent naval simulation Introduces submarines, warships and aircraft at the same time Luxurious manual Cons Inaccessible for a casual player Technically the sound could have at least been improved Table Air Force There are groups of developers like Sonalysts who don't compete for the headlines, because they are engaged in the creation of games that enjoy a very limited but always lively and passionate market. The true, irreducible fanatics of simulations with a capital S will remember the previous Sub Command which with Dangerous Waters evolves to cover a wide range of modern naval warfare simulation. The already tested SSN 688(I) and Seawolf SSN 21 are now joined by the Kilo submarines, to which we have dedicated an in-depth box. I forgot that even the Akula are once again at your disposal in the depths of the sea, while the real novelty sails the seas on the surface, cutting the waves like a predatory hawk: it's called Perry FFG-7 and it's the curse of every submarine, thanks to the aerial means reconnaissance aircraft MH 60R and P3-C Orion. The first is a helicopter equipped with advanced technologies for the identification of submarines and underwater vehicles, while the second is a modern reconnaissance aircraft capable of easily identifying anything that surfaces on the surface. Both of these aircraft are user-pilotable but these are simple controls that would take you unnecessarily away from the heart of the simulation and needless to say, this sounds as cold as sonar in the deep sea.", "date": "2006-05-02", "grade": null}
