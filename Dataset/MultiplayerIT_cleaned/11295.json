{"name": "Hidden Expedition: Titanic", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hidden-expedition-titanic.html", "text": "Stories and legends of all kinds are wasted on the sinking of the Titanic. The huge ship, which set sail on April 14, 1912 for its maiden voyage, after a few hours ended up colliding with a large iceberg and sank halfway through its journey to New York. More than fifteen hundred people were killed in the disaster, almost three-quarters of the entire crew. Only after seventy years were the first attempts made to recover something from the submerged wreck: a search which, to date, has brought to light more than six thousand finds. And it is precisely on this idea that Hidden Expedition: Titanic is based, that is to dive inside the Titanic to recover a series of objects that are marked on the screen from time to time and that must be identified through an increasingly intricate scenario. The start screen of the game allows us to create a profile and then move on to action, which is set up like this: each ~zone~ consists of two or more rooms to check and in which to collect all the objects that we find written in the lower part of the display, usually crowned by a bonus stage with different rules from time to time. For the whole ~zone~, we will have to use a single oxygen bar, which empties as seconds go by and in which minutes can be ~spent~ in exchange for help. The control system is extremely simple: we will have to use the joystick to move the pointer on the screen, then press FIRE for the framed object to be recovered (if present in the list, of course). With the left function button we can take advantage of some help, in this case of the visual signaling of the next object to be collected. This is a welcome possibility, especially when we are unable to ~read~ the scenario well, but which is paid dearly: every time we resort to it, minutes will be deducted from the oxygen bar. In case of game over, we'll have to start the ~area~ all over again, but looking for different objects from those in the previous list. Luckily their absolute position does not change, so the teddy bear will always be in its usual place, as well as the ring or the wrench, and so on. As an extra, we will also have to try to recover emeralds, which can give us interesting bonuses. Generally, in puzzle games the graphics count up to a certain point, as long as they are functional to the action and barely pleasing to the eye. In the case of products like Hidden Expedition: Titanic, on the other hand, the aesthetic aspect not only matters a lot, but it is the key that determines the degree of playability. In each stage we will have to probe the scenario in search of more or less hidden objects, so it is clear that the graphics must be well defined and the objects drawn appropriately. Unfortunately this does not always happen, proof of this is the fact that we will often have to proceed with attempts to understand what a certain find looks like, referring to the second attempt. As for the controls, however, nothing to say: the management of the pointer using the joystick is intuitive and works quite well, with a good speed of movement and a good precision. PRO Good number of internships Simple and precise control system Very detailed graphics... AGAINST ...but not always very clear Mute sound on some terminals Very limited gameplay structure", "date": "2008-07-16", "grade": "S.V."}
