If we exclude the various remakes of episodes already released on other platforms, the lion's share is still played by a new series of spin-offs in FPS sauce on rails, inaugurated in 2007 by the discreet The Umbrella Chronicles. Although light years ahead of certain similar questionable experiments operated by the Japanese software house on the franchise (read: Gun Survivor), the room for improvement was not lacking in this first work: let's see, therefore, if this awaited Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles will be able to establish itself as something more than just ~more of the same~. Historical revisionism Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles is divided into three campaigns, each of which is divided into eight scenarios which in fact constitute the game levels. The first section, entitled Memories of the Lost City, is inspired by the facts narrated in Resident Evil 2, and therefore sees Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield as protagonists in the maze of a Raccon City infested by zombies. Next we find Game of Oblivion, relating to the events of Code Veronica and in which it is possible to impersonate Claire or Steve Burnside. The roundup is closed by Operation Javier, the only unpublished piece of the package: set in a remote village in South America, this part takes place in 2002, with Leon and Jack Krauser engaged in the search for a mysterious man connected to the ubiquitous Umbrella Corporation. From a narrative point of view, Capcom's work denotes ups and downs: if therefore the changes made to the storylines of the first two chapters to adapt them to the gameplay of the product are appreciable, on the other hand the CG cutscenes as well as the in-game dialogues prove rather disappointing. game, often unnecessarily redundant and boring. Graphically, however, one can only commend the work done by the developers of Cavia, the studio responsible for the project. The improvements compared to The Umbrella Chronicles are evident, and concern almost every aspect visible on the screen: first of all, the polygonal models are excellent, with fluid and varied animations, but also the scenarios boast great care, both as regards the complexity of the structures and for the amount of detail present. To be honest, between the various levels there are significant fluctuations in the visual impact, but the average is still more than good. Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles is therefore an absolutely noteworthy work, especially if we consider the limited capabilities of the Wii: and precisely the limitations of the hardware are the cause of the only real defect of the cosmetics, or rather a low definition that inevitably it ends up partially scaling the developers' efforts. Everything must then also be evaluated on the basis of how much the typical style of the series meets or does not meet one's personal tastes: therefore, where character design and music could appear extremely dated to some, others could only be pleased. Target shooting Fortunately, Capcom's work was not limited to the technical sector alone, but involved the entire play structure of the title, which proves to be decidedly more complete and attractive than the prequel. To begin with, there is much more meat in the fire in terms of longevity and replay value: completing the three campaigns takes much longer than in The Umbrella Chronicles, and we find ourselves encouraged to repeat the various stages (perhaps using the convenient system multiplayer drop-in) in order to unlock all the secrets and collect money needed to upgrade weapons. This is another interesting aspect of Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles, as at the end of each level it is possible to spend the money obtained to increase the statistics of each firearm in various respects (power, capacity, reload speed, etc.) , with actual battlefield feedback. The same offensive tools have undergone a numerical increase: in addition to the classic pistol with infinite ammunition, we find machine guns, shotguns, crossbows, hand grenades, Magnums and even grenade launchers and bazookas. A respectable arsenal which, however, must be exploited sparingly, given the general scarcity of ammunition available during the adventure. All these elements make Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles an extremely enjoyable experience, even if there are some negativities that can be more or less annoying depending on the attitude of the player. The control system -although improved compared to the prequel- still suffers from a pointing that is not too reliable: the Remoteit is not a light gun (and it shows), and there is no shortage of rather frustrating sections in which one is called to hit specific points without being able to count on a sufficiently precise instrument. Again, the dynamic movements of the camera are as enjoyable from the point of view of pure entertainment, as irritating when it is necessary to fire on distant or small enemies.
