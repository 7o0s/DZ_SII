{"name": "Sonic Lost World", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/124428-sonic-lost-world-nefastissimo-me.html", "text": "In the gaming world, Sonic has always been synonymous with speed: it is therefore natural to welcome a new chapter in the series such as Sonic Lost World here with a mixture of curiosity and fear, which aims to revolutionize the franchise by putting a stop to hedgehog racing blue and adopting a more reasoned and almost multidisciplinary approach to gameplay. Was SEGA right to abandon the virtuous path traced by the recent Sonic Colors and Sonic Generations to try a new path? Work slowly Even if the plot has never been a particularly strong point of the games in the series, Sonic Lost World's desire for change is also evident from this aspect: instead of proposing the usual contrast between Sonic and Dr. Eggman (still present), the title features an authentic handful of villains, the Six Nefarious, which the protagonist will have to defeat during an adventure that will take him through seven different scenarios. If the initiative to change the cards on the table in this sense is commendable, the same cannot be said of the decision to tell a trivial story through an all too substantial number of filmed sequences which, being neither particularly passionate nor amusing, become soon a slowness to go through between one internship and another rather than a pleasant glue. Fortunately, things are going better from a strictly playful point of view, for a product that does not hesitate to shoot its best cartridges right in the early stages of the game: it is in fact here that Sonic Lost World stages fun, articulated stages with a remarkable structural variety. Thanks to a flexible gameplay setting, with perspectives that constantly change from one scheme to another or that alternate within the same level. We therefore go from two-dimensional scrolling sections to phases in which the camera moves behind Sonic and you have to dart along paths full of obstacles, bonuses and enemies, to get to more open scenarios in Super Mario Galaxy style where the exploration becomes the predominant element. The comparison with the Nintendo masterpiece applies to the particular structure that characterizes the settings, of the species of planets suspended in the void which, however, in most cases develop in depth in order to still allow those who wish to face them at a fast pace. What is certain is that Sonic Lost World has an average more relaxed pace than the standards of the series, and this is confirmed by the fact that it is necessary to hold down the right backbone to activate the hedgehog run. However, this is not the only novelty of a control system enriched with a series of moves that go beyond Sonic's traditional skill set, who can now crouch down and proceed slowly to avoid spikes, triple jump to reach greater heights high, run up walls and even perform a flying kick that complements the classic homing attack. In all of this, the touchscreen of the Gamepad plays a marginal role after all: if you don't use it to play with the TV off, the display shows a simple graph of the progression in the level, while by tapping it is possible to display the aids or activate the power-ups and the powers of the Wisps. Absolute protagonists of Sonic Colors, the latter make their return without however excessive conviction, allowing the protagonist to assume different shapes and abilities for a short period of time in strictly pre-established places of some stages: apart from very rare cases, one can continue even ignoring this feature, fueling the impression that the developers have inserted it as a trivial pretext to exploit the Nintendo controller rather than for a real importance in the game economy. Sonic Lost World attempts the arduous task of renewing the franchise, unfortunately only partially succeeding A handyman porcupine In its attempt to act as an ideal bridge between the classic gameplay of the series and a more open 3D platforming approach, Sonic Lost World offers an undoubtedly enviable variety, which however is counterbalanced by the palpable feeling that the various playful components are a bit too much unconnected and foreign to each other. So if the SEGA mascot appears decidedly at ease in the sections where speed and spectacularity are the masters, on the other hand it is difficult not to recognize some more or less profound embarrassment when the blue hedgehog tries to be the Mario of the situation. The fundamental problem is that the Sonic Team designers are not the same as Nintendo, and it shows: after an initial part at full speed, with a series of really successfuliti, Sonic Lost World almost seems to get lost in the enterprise of presenting something different at all costs, ending up losing its edge and thus obtaining the exact opposite effect to that hoped for. Especially in the more advanced stages, the title tries with increasing frequency to insert Sonic in contexts unfamiliar to him in the name of variety, however effectively sacrificing the enjoyment of the experience: for example, we are faced with 2D sections marked by millimeter leaps that the control system is unable to guarantee, or daring excursions into other videogame genres that leave a little bitterness in the mouth at the thought that in their place there could have been sequences more inclined to the attitudes of the protagonist. Even the clashes with the bosses (to tell the truth never memorable in any exponent of the series) appear unbalanced when not downright ill-conceived, often showing the side to obvious design deficiencies. Some of the good intentions of the game are therefore reduced by an implementation that leaves more than something to be desired, in fact making the SEGA product globally less valid than its two previous releases, which compensated for a lower originality with a more solid underlying coherence . When it works, Sonic Lost World proves to be a title capable of giving some great satisfaction to fans of the series, alternating furious accelerations in honor of the good old days with sections that require a more exploratory approach, made possible by levels with open environments or equipped with various forks and bifurcations. The obvious intention of Sonic Team is to push the user to repeat the same stage several times to see everything it has to offer, providing in support a couple of tricks dedicated mainly to lovers of 100% completion: each scenario contains therefore five red rings to collect to have access to bonus sections, there is a Time Attack mode complete with online rankings, a list of objectives to be met to unlock power-ups to be called up at any time via touchscreen and finally a co- op unfortunately very weak, with the second player who has to limit himself to moving a radio-controlled airplane useful for collecting rings and inflicting laughable damage on enemies. The multiplayer sector fortunately offers a more valid alternative constituted by the Race mode, in which two users (one turning to the TV and the other to the Gamepad screen) challenge each other to see who reaches the finish line of a stage first or who collects the most number of rings within the time limit. If you don't take advantage of the features listed above and you aim exclusively to finish the campaign in single player, Sonic Lost World is not destined to be an extremely long-lived title, given the not exorbitant amount of levels present in the play package: this despite the not very commendable attempts by the developers to slow down the progression in the final stages of the adventure by lengthening the duration of the stages, filling them with traps and reducing the number and frequency of checkpoints, all elements that do nothing but make the last portion of the game much more frustrating than the due. At least from a technical point of view, Sonic Team's work appears impeccable, starting with a colorful and very pleasant graphic, which does not save itself in spectacular shot changes without ever losing even a crumb of frame rate. Obviously we are not talking about a title characterized by extreme polygonal complexity, but above all in the more open scenarios the glance is remarkable: played on the Gamepad, then, the title maintains an excellent visual impact and almost gains in terms of mere comfort, since you can access all touch content without taking your eyes off the screen. The sound accompaniment should also be promoted, with a more than decent Italian dubbing and a pressing and well-assorted soundtrack.", "date": "2013-10-18", "grade": "7.0"}
