Initially you will be offered a map screen, which is the starting point where your progress is recorded in the eight themed worlds of the game, but only one of these will be available, namely Lost Kingdom: Prehistoric World. Later, if you manage to achieve your goals and win Gold Tickets, the other islands and their theme parks will be opened to you. As already mentioned before you will have to decide in real time what to do with time looming as the main opponent and the money going down every time you build something. You will have to be very skilled in not squandering your capital with useless shares because it is very easy to go into the red on the balance sheet. Obviously the most fun thing is building the roller coaster because you will be completely free to choose any track, raising or lowering every single support pylon and adding all kinds of virtuosities such as loops and reverse rides: stuff that will make even the most daring of visitors pale ! This does not mean that preparing other attractions is not interesting on the contrary... it is possible to do everything, from the classic Ferris wheel to the more ~quiet~ house of ghosts, obviously passing through the inevitable gadget and souvenir shops. However, you will have to pay close attention to the comments of visitors who will give you valuable information on the weak points of your service, thus allowing you to improve it in order to increase the number of presences, which in simple terms is equivalent to an increase in earnings! Among the various things you need to check is the maintenance of the games: it's not very nice in fact to see part of your park collapse or set on fire due to lack of staff ... You will also have the opportunity to see the progress of your game through a simple menu. park so as to understand if everything runs smoothly and in the right order. The part relating to the search for new attractions to compete with other amusement parks is very nice, perhaps thus giving you the exclusive on new attractions that lead the public to choose your park over another A game for children? I do not believe Moving on to the technical aspect and talking about the graphics, we are faced with a title that certainly does not shine in terms of complexity or the potential graphic effects of the PS2, but this is certainly not what is asked of a game like this. The graphics are functional, even if sometimes everything seems confused by a very strong and too overlapping use of colors. Furthermore, a greater detail of the textures would have been more appreciated, given the capabilities of the machine on which it runs. All in all, however, everything is on discrete levels. The sound is a bit poor, with little music that in the end gives a little annoyance due to the repetitiveness, and not very incisive effects. Fortunately, the game has its strong point on playability, as it will be able to keep you glued to the TV for hours and hours without you realizing it. What is certain is that this Theme Park World is not a title for everyone, especially it is not a game for children, given that it is also all in English. Ultimately a good game of immense playability but with the graphics / sound department a bit lacking, which will satisfy the hunger for management games of new PS2 owners. [photo taken from the official site of the game] The boss at... the beginning of the level The game in question, now in its umpteenth edition, this time with the suffix WORLD, projects the gamer into the exciting world of modern theme parks, but this time you will not be simple users of a service, on the contrary you will have to offer it yourself , because you will be the Boss; you'll have to make all kinds of decisions, from where to build the spectacular roller coaster to who will have to clean the toilets, so the progress of the park will be in your hands alone! Don't worry though, it's not that difficult, given that there is also an exhaustive initial tutorial, which allows you to become familiar with the commands as long as you don't skip everything due to too much enthusiasm to play. I forgot that there is also an Advisor, or a helper who will follow you throughout the game and who will come to your aid, sending you massages whenever things go wrong, advising you on what to do.", "date": "2001-01-09", "grade": null}
