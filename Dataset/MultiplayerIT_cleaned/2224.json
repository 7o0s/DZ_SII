{"name": "Undawn", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/undawn-recensione.html", "text": "On the one hand great promotional intuitions, see the trailer with Will Smith and the official collaboration with Io Sono Leggenda; on the other hand, an old-fashioned, slow, rough, limping survival MMO structure like the zombies we'll find ourselves facing during the campaign: there's no doubt that Undawn moves between ups and downs, but it carries forward an oriental approach to the genre that results still difficult to digest, especially on mobile. You know the guidelines for films produced by Netflix, according to which if something does not happen within a few minutes of starting, users tend to switch off and switch shows, so the directors feel in somehow forced to set the narrative to have a strong initial peak? Here, Tencent evidently has not yet understood that the same thing happens on iOS and Android devices, and it is normal that this is the case given the portable and often impromptu nature of these experiences. We explain everything to you in the Undawn review. history and structure Undawn, our character grappling with a camp manager A zombie invasion has plunged the world into the abyss, devastating the cities and forcing the survivors to hole up inside fortified settlements: a rather traditional incipit, which Undawn does without posing any major problems, however seasoning it with human events and attempts of frankly bizarre romanticism: think that in the initial stages at a certain point even a song starts. The developers of Lightspeed Studios have tried to leave some kind of mark on the narrative level of the experience, but it is clear that from such a product there expect more and that's where the proverbial donkey falls. Yes, because after the promising character editor (which can also use one of our photos to automate the traits) and a crackling start, the campaign ends up stranded in a sea of insignificant tasks that weigh down the progression. The structure of Undawn should in fact be based on the exploration of certain scenarios, the unlocking of connected settlements and access to missions in which a certain amount of zombies and mutants must be eliminated, using equipment that is gradually enriched with new weapons and tools, but which remains tied to the survival mechanics of collecting and creating resources even just for the management of ammunition and upgrades. It therefore happens that after a few hours you find yourself tiredly following the inevitable objective system, using fast movements from one area to another in an attempt to find the right point of interest, when instead this type of operation should be much faster and more accessible: we are still talking about a mobile game, but Tencent seems to have forgotten it. Gameplay Undawn, can you count how many icons are on the screen? The consequences of this approach translate into a slow and heavy system, which literally drags itself to provide us with some modest content, hidden among a myriad of conceptually very dated collection missions. From this point of view there is really everything, but basically imagine a mix between the mechanics of PUBG and those of Fortnite. The good thing is that the interface, initially so crowded as to limit visibility, can be adjusted to reduce essentially the distractions and elements that we consider less important, see for example the chat or the many icons that bear as many notifications relating to the rewards obtained up to that moment, with an inevitable reference to the microtransactions. Undawn, a fight sequence From this point of view the experience proves to be relatively malleable, although it is reasonable to imagine that at some point in the campaign the degree of difficulty undergoes a surge for monetization purposes. However, the banality of the phases played (just saved by the autofocus option), but above all the woodiness of everything around you could make your enthusiasm wane very quickly. Which is a pity, because it would have been enough to review the ambitions of the project, making it more compact and immediate, to avoid wasting the energies and ideas of the development on many operations that leave the time they find, focusing instead on making the clashes with the zombies more lively and fun. The technical realization of Undawn Undawn boasts some undoubtedly suggestive views There are certainly some sequences and glimpses of Undawn that manage to surprise for the quality of what is shown on the screen, together with a degree of optimization slightly above the average if we consider that on the iPhone 14 Pro the game manages to runare practically at its maximum potential while maintaining 60 fps and avoiding overheating the device. The investments are there and can be seen, for example in the dialogues spoken in English (although the interpretation often leaves something to be desired) and in a soundtrack capable of hit unexpectedly with some good track. However, the geometries, the effects and the animations are dated, as is the design of the various scenarios that we will be able to visit in the game.", "date": "2023-06-23", "grade": "6.0"}
