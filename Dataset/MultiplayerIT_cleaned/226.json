{"name": "Unmaze", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/unmaze-recensione.html", "text": "The Unmaze review tells of a particular narrative adventure for mobile platforms based on labyrinths, modernized Greek mythology, light and shadow. It is above all a narrative experiment, one of those artistic digressions in the field of videogames which often offer very little from the point of view of gameplay and focus above all on ~experiences~ in terms of storytelling or simply aesthetic contemplation, and all in all also this ARTE Experience title (the name already says it all) does not escape this cataloging that much. However, there are undoubtedly interesting elements in all of this, starting from the subject of the story, to get to some game mechanics that take advantage of unsuspected old-school Nintendo gimmicks, making the necessary proportions. In any case, it must be kept in mind that it is above all an interactive story, on the development of which we however have a certain degree of influence, through various choices. The story of Ariadne, Theseus and Asterion The story is freely inspired by some figures from Greek mythology, but placed in a completely different and modern context, while remaining suspended in a mysterious dimension since the one represented in the game is clearly not the normal earthly world. The player assumes the role of Ariadne, a girl who has just lost her mother and finds herself having to guide two boys, Asterion and Theseus, out of strange labyrinths into which they have mysteriously ended up. The introduction explains practically nothing and the various relationships between the characters, as well as the different characters and various backgrounds of each of the three, emerge only over the distance, through the constant dialogues in what is in all respects a sort of visual novel. Thus we come to discover that Asterion is Ariadne's brother, with a somewhat grumpy and gloomy character, tending towards pessimism and victimhood and with possible outbursts of anger, while Theseus is the boyfriend of the protagonist, more cheerful but no less ~rough ~ in several respects, above all because there seems to be bad blood between the two boys. Unmaze's black and white drawn graphics are somewhat reminiscent of Escher's figures Ariadne can see the two through a crystal and is the only one who can guide them out of the labyrinths, choosing for them (with the player's touch on the screen) the path to follow and the goal to reach. All while trying to understand how we found ourselves in this situation, what these labyrinths are and in what dimension the two are, and at the same time also trying to resolve the evident fractures that exist in the relationships between the three protagonists. The story essentially unfolds through alternating dialogues between Ariadne and the two boys and allows for a certain degree of interaction in the choice of phrases to say, which imply different attitudes from time to time: one can choose to be more energetic or more protective, thing that can have slightly different consequences also due to the practically opposite characters of the two young people, but what actually changes the course of the story is above all the time spent in the company of one or the other, which directly depends on the game mechanics . Light and shadow Unmaze incorporates elements of Greek mythology but filtered in a modern and decidedly disturbing key The gameplay of Unmaze is based on a gimmick that takes us back to the times of Boktai for Game Boy Advance: the fact of addressing one boy or another, who are in different settings or perhaps even dimensions, depends on the exposure of the smartphone in the light. After a quick initial calibration, we can orient the smartphone to expose it to light to be able to drive Theseus, or keep it in the shade to interact with Asterion. This solution, although initially pleasant, soon turns out to be decidedly inconvenient in various situations, because it is often necessary to quickly switch from one condition to another, requiring a net variation in light exposure which is not easy to find at any time. For the rest, there are no elaborate mechanics: it is simply a question of advancing through the labyrinths, which have different paths but practically no element of challenge, and continuing in the dialogues. In some cases, the boys encounter particular structures that trigger interlude scenes capable of revealing something more than the story and the setting and this represents a good basis for the replayability of Unmaze, because depending on the chosen paths, you can find different settings within the five main levels, thus discovering different scenes and information. The greatest influence that the player has on the developmentpart of the story is given by the amount of time spent with one or the other boy, which involves their different evolution. Based on how one progresses in this respect, one of the two boys finds himself losing parts of humanity and partially acquiring beast characteristics, ending up resembling more and more the minotaurs and the various disturbing figures that roam the labyrinths of the game. This too can represent another element of replayability, given that the different concentration on Theseus or Asterion leads to different endings: ultimately, the tricks in question make it possible to clearly lengthen the duration of the game which otherwise is rather meager, since you can get to the end of the five levels in about three hours. Theseus and Asterion are lost in two opposite dimensions of light and shadow There is no shortage of original ideas, but to be one of the typical titles that first of all try to offer a particular ~experience~ rather than just a game, there are some elements that can be critical. There is no translation into Italian and the English used presents some inconsistencies in qualitative terms: in general, the writing is rather far from the poetic lyricism that the reference to Greek mythology might suggest. On the one hand, this aspect has nice elements, such as direct references to popular culture that make everything particularly close to the players' reality, but on the other it tends to get lost in rather futile dialogues, with characters that in some cases seem anything but intriguing. The graphic style drawn in a black and white comic style could be a bit rough, but it has a remarkable evocative power that recalls the works of Escher in the architecture of the labyrinths and helps to decisively mark the particular identity of Unmaze.", "date": "2021-06-29", "grade": "7.0"}
