However, unlike the previous titles, in this case the Japanese team preferred to frame the episode for Wii in a key of greater accessibility, through a level of difficulty truly calibrated downwards and an exaggerated support in determining the accuracy of the shots. What follows is a quality product, but which finds its ideal target more among casual gamers and novices than among longtime fans. Pros Immediate control system Colorful and nice style Fun especially in multiplayer Cons Too easy for those with experience Classic modes and without particular originality Non-existent challenge level Golf, I love you The Japanese giant, aware of the difficulty of the undertaking, chose to rely on one of the historically most expert teams with the discipline in question for the occasion; we are obviously referring to Camelot, authors of the Mario Golf and Everybody's Golf series. In short, a kind of guarantee of quality. And in fact, the Japanese programmers have tried to focus above all on a valid control method suitable for the qualities of the Wiimote; in this specific case it is a fairly original system that is above all well suited to the limits of the remote control, still unable to reproduce a 1:1 movement at least until the arrival of the awaited Wii Motion Plus peripheral. it must be held like a golf club, with the tip pointing downwards; to perform the actual launch, hold down the A button, and lift the controller backwards until you reach an on-screen indicator that represents the ideal power. Once this phase has been overcome, it is then necessary to proceed with the movement to hit the ball, however by launching it with the timing such as to stop the indicator again this time in the center of a small bar which constitutes the precision. Further depth is provided by the ability to tilt the arc of trajectory left or right, simply by twisting the wrist and thus the Wiimote to one side or the other. On the other hand, to provide the topspin or backspin effect, keys 1 and 2 must be pressed, while obviously, as per tradition, there is the possibility of giving a power bonus from the shot by further raising the controller at the time of the shot, with the awareness that this makes the phase of determining the precision is more difficult. This solution intelligently crosses a fairly classic system with the capabilities of the Wiimote, without indulging in flights of fancy that certainly would have had to deal with the current limits of the controller, waiting for the Motion Plus. The result is therefore fluid, concrete and rather satisfying, even if the programmers have chosen to offer a probably exaggerated help to the user; indicators of all kinds in fact allow to obtain practically perfect precision right from the preparation phase, with the result of making life too simple for videogame golf veterans. All this, combined with the general scarcity of elements of effective disturbance in the various courses and the frequent flatness of the ground especially in the green area, makes We Love Golf a particularly suitable product for occasional players or children, categories who will greatly appreciate the linearity of the progression and simplicity in obtaining results. On the contrary, those who have a little experience will not be able to do anything but ring birdies and eagles, leaving an abyss between themselves and the opponents controlled by the CPU. A partial mitigation of this fortunately contributes the large amount of material to unlock, which includes 8 paths and a whole series of costumes that allow the available characters to do authentic Cosplay by impersonating a series of historical Capcom heroes such as Ryu, Morrigan and many others that we prefer not to reveal to you. As for the available modes, in addition to practice and tournaments, you can also find challenges based on who gets closest to a target with a shot, and that of the now trademark rings of Camelot. We Love Golf! is available for Nintendo Wii. We are all Tiger Woods A product as accessible, simple and immediate as We Love Golf naturally performs very well in multiplayer, and the Capcom title is no exception, allowing up to 4 players to challenge each other locally even with a single Wiimote. The potentially most interesting addition, however, is undoubtedly the online mode, now taken for granted in 360 and Ps3 titles but not yet fully integrated into the Nintendo philosophy; in this case Camelot has given it all by offering a valid infrastructureda and a good number of options, but the lack of voice chat and the need to use the ever-quite reviled friend codes defuses the matter considerably. From a technical point of view We Love Golf does its job with dignity, without surprising but offering a pleasant, colorful and cartoony cosmetic. The good animations and the variety of environments, ranging from deserts to pirate islands to ~mushroom kingdoms~ or something like that, are among the strong points. The integration with Miis shouldn't be forgotten either, even if the solution adopted (in practice the Mii's head is glued onto the body of a character) makes the result a bit disturbing.", "date": "2008-09-10", "grade": null}
