In fact, it's usually the worst way: no matter how smart you are, the possibility of ending up in jail or on a morgue table is very high. Pedro knows this well, but he can't help it if his only aptitude is to commit crimes. Steal, kill... anything to earn bread and live another day, never ceasing to look over his shoulder, cultivating not so secretly the dream of scraping together a nice nest egg and then running away from everything and everyone. Arrived in Los Angeles with his best friend, he puts himself at the service of a local boss to make some easy money, while waiting for things to calm down. Between punitive expeditions, illicit transports and speed contests, our friend will really have to work hard to become a successful criminal... and survive enough to enjoy the fruits of this position. All mine the city The Gangstar series was born in 2006 on Java compatible mobile phones, and in just three years has enjoyed an evolution very similar to that experienced by Grand Theft Auto, passing from two-dimensional top-down graphics to the polygonal 3D of this new iPhone episode. What hasn't changed over the years is certainly the developers' attention towards the variety and duration of the experience, with the protagonist who in this case has to face the beauty of fifty missions divided between six chapters that lead to as many turning points in the plot . The city that serves as a sandbox in Gangstar: West Coast Hustle does not pretend to be a realistic recreation of Los Angeles, it is clear, but it offers an extensive and convincing tangle of streets and buildings, which lends itself well not only to classic shootouts but also to the numerous clandestine races that can be faced between one mission and another to round up the income. The story told by Gameloft is simple and direct: while offering some interesting twists, it has little to do with the harsh social criticism that we find in GTAIV. Pedro finds himself working for various underworld bosses and is sent from time to time to right wrongs, eliminate rival gang members and pull off some adventurous heist-for-hire. We can check our position on the map, as well as that of the ~sensitive areas~ through which we can access missions, buy weapons and equipment, rent and repair cars. Tangible crime The touch screen control system appears really well done and offers ample customization possibilities: we move by acting on a virtual stick, while just pressing the icon located under the energy bar to change the weapon we are holding between those available. The pointing during firefights is semi-automatic: the closest target is framed, but you can change it by touching the enemy we want to ~engage~ on the screen. When we are close to a vehicle, we can tap its icon to take possession of it (throwing out any owner) and then start driving by choosing the controls we deem most convenient for steering and accelerating/braking in the options screen: in the first case, you can opt for the accelerometer (therefore you have to tilt the iPhone right or left), for a horizontal bar or for a virtual steering wheel, in the second case a vertical bar or two separate pedals can be used. The accelerometer solution, although activated by default, does not appear the most comfortable or the most precise, while the pedal-shaped buttons are well suited to managing the speed with which the vehicle moves. By playing with the virtual steering wheel and the pedals, you get a good feeling and a little experience is enough to be able to move through the streets of Los Angeles without crashing into anyone in front of you. The developers have made the light poles and traffic lights intangible to make the experience more fluid, while you can bump into guardrails and fences, moreover without ever having the opportunity to force them. Technical realization The graphics of Gangstar: West Coast Hustle set a benchmark for this genre of iPhone games. Tested on a 3GS device, the game was always smooth and fast, even if there is a marked pop-up effect from a certain distance. The characters are well drawn and have a decent level of animation, but in close-up shots you notice the ~angularity~ of the polygonal models. There is a good number of different vehicles that roam the streets and that we can use for our purposes, moreover the physics of the clashes appear quite convincing, thanks above all to the implementationntation of the shock absorbers. Each car can take damage and be destroyed, with a number of intermediate stages well represented on screen. The same cannot be said of the buildings, which are quite bare and often subject to rendering defects. The sound is quite rich between music (the famous radio stations that we can change while we are in the car) and effects. The tested version is 1.0.3", "date": "2009-09-09", "grade": "8.8"}
