Not that J.R.R. Tolkien needed no introduction, mind you, but it was the film that cleared customs for a sort of real commercial exploitation of the brand, including gadgets of all kinds and, of course, video games. The latter, unfortunately, have not always hit the mark and apart from some commendable exceptions (such as the MMORPG The Lord of the Rings Online) they have limited themselves to being the usual ~tie-ins~ without art or part designed only to ride the fashion of the moment. Having concluded the trilogy in 2003, videogame appointments with Middle-earth have become increasingly rare and disappointing but, now that filming of The Hobbit has begun, the interest of publishers in Tolkien's mythology has once again intensified. After last year's tragicomic Aragorn's Quest, our expectations of War in the North were decidedly frosty, despite the very promising photos and videos. Now, game in hand, we can say that the Snowblind Studios product is a little gem, imperfect yes, but definitely worthy of attention... In three you are in company Rather than telling us the adventure of Frodo and his companions for the umpteenth time, The War in the North only touches on the whole matter of the Ring of Power, relegating it to a mere appearance together with the traditional Company. The story actually concerns the war in the north of the title, started by Sauron at the hands of one of his dark lieutenants, the sorcerer Agandaur, whose purpose is basically to subjugate the northern regions of Middle-earth to expand his master's domains. For this reason, the evergreen Aragorn will entrust three valiant characters with the task of tracking down Agandaur, discovering his plans and defeating him before he manages to provide the Enemy with a decisive advantage. Thus begins an adventure parallel to that of the Fellowship of the Ring that will put us in the shoes of the dwarf Farin, the ranger Eradan and the elf Andriel: the story of their wanderings is definitely enjoyable, above all because it leads the player to some particularly famous locations of the Tolkenian literary universe, from Ettenlande to Mirkwood. The events barely intertwine with those of the original trilogy, allowing us to briefly meet some of the most famous characters (moreover modeled after the features of the actors who played them in Peter Jackson's films) during a visit to Rivendell; The War in the North is in fact full of references and goodies for fans, especially during the dialogues, completely dubbed in excellent Italian, which have a structure similar to that proposed by BioWare in Dragon Age or Mass Effect. In reality it is not possible to influence the development of the story through the options offered during the conversations, whose sole purpose is to provide us with tons of optional information and details on characters and events, often taken directly from Tolken's encyclopedic tomes, or activate side missions which will allow us to acquire valuables. Unfortunately, however, it must be admitted that the three protagonists do not have even a little of the charisma of the characters created by Tolkien, indeed to be honest they do not have any: their personality is in fact just outlined and stereotyped and we are not provided with any details about their relationship and their history, a lack that makes the plot less compelling, despite the greater characterization reserved for famous supporting actors such as the eagle Gwaihir or the sorcerer Radagast. Loot'n'slash! The Lord of the Rings: War in the North is a real action game in the third person, focused on the exploration of the various stages in which we will be attacked by hordes of enemies. Our goal will often be very simple: to proceed along a pre-set path that only rarely offers crossroads and alternative routes often limited to the discovery of a hidden area, defeating all the enemies that will block our way, collecting new objects and eliminating the occasional boss on duty. In practice we are dealing with a real hack'n'slash, although some elements try to make it less repetitive than it actually is. To begin with, the combat system is really simple but also very effective: with a key dedicated to light but fast blows, and one to powerful but slower ones, it is possible to chain simple combos to slice enemies, ending them with very violent smembragging in slow motion. A yellow dart will suggest when it is possible to launch a sort of devastating extra attack, for the rest we are talking about a mere button-mashing from start to finish, alternating with the use of some special abilities, obtainable by wisely placing the points earned at each level -up in a sort of triple talent tree reminiscent of the most common MMORPGs. In this way it is possible to further specialize each character: Farin, for example, melee fighter par excellence, can greatly improve his skill with two-handed weapons or his effectiveness in using sword and shield, naturally imposing styles of different game. The same also applies to Eredan, who specializes in ranged combat with bows and crossbows, and Andriel, whose proficiency in magic requires greater caution and positional strategy. The player therefore has multiple ways in which to approach the game, a variety that is however betrayed by a somewhat questionable game-design that prevents you from selecting the character to control on the fly: to go from Farin to Eredan, for example, you have to necessarily conclude the stage in progress, and only then will it be possible to change the character, modifying the equipment and distributing the points earned to his possible level-up during the previous game session. Playstation 3 trophies The Lord of the Rings: War in the North offers a total of 47 Trophies: 32 Bronze, 13 Silver, 1 Gold and 1 Platinum. Some of them will unlock almost automatically, perhaps by talking to a certain NPC or by reaching certain levels of experience, while others will require a little more consistent efforts, forcing the player to find all the secrets, complete the game on the maximum difficulty level and go on. saying. Apart from that, the game does a good job of supporting solo players: despite the limited control possibilities, limited to the order of attacking the same target or taking a defensive position, the automated companions will cooperate as quickly as possible possible, for example in case you are knocked down and remain helpless waiting to be revived (the defeat of the other two characters will lead to an unpleasant Game Over, of course). The modest artificial intelligence only betrays us in the more advanced stages, when the fights undergo a sudden and inopportune surge in general difficulty, hurling numerous excessively tough or aggressive enemies at the player: at that point one becomes practically addicted to the healing potions, fortunately purchasable or generously distributed from chests and chests. These problems are easily solved by the possibility of playing together with other human players, online or locally via split-screen, and it is certainly in co-op mode that War in the North offers the most fun, above all because of the whole mechanics of the loot which is basically the engine of the game. Practically any chest, chest or enemy offers some type of object, from simple ammunition to more or less powerful objects to improve the equipment of our heroes, divided into various slots relating to helmets, shoulder pads, armor and so on. The objects offer the usual defensive values but also bonuses to the statistics or to the effectiveness of our shots; some of them, although very rare, have slots in turn, in which to set gems that give further bonuses; still other objects are part of real ~sets~ and by wearing various parts of these series you receive exclusive and very powerful bonuses. Most of the weapons and armor have a unique graphical representation and it is clear that, in the face of the intrinsic repetitiveness of the genre to which the game belongs, it is precisely the variety and possibilities offered by the loot that push you to eliminate another enemy, to reach a new boss or a new chest. Playing alone these objects can be offered to our companions, who will wear them immediately, however they will disappear as soon as we change the character we use: this is only one of the various inconsistencies that prevent War in the North from reaching a higher rating. Rivendell, we have a problem In addition to the impossibility of modifying the equipment and statistics of our companions when we are not using them, War in the North is afflicted by some naiveties which, while not particularly harmful, make the experience less pleasant than it could be. The checkpoint system, for example, completely locks the player at the point where he arrived in the game, sometimes preventing him from taking a step back and perhapsaccumulate a few more experience points in the previous areas to face a particularly difficult battle. In that case, there's no escape: either you start over or you bang your head against the wall until a friend comes towards you in co-op mode. It's rare, but it can happen, and when it does it becomes particularly frustrating (Siege of Nordinbad, yes, let's talk about you). Another problem that goes beyond simple fussiness concerns the sometimes fallacious collision system: in the chaos of fights it is difficult to notice it but in fact they are often seemingly empty shots that inflict damage on our enemies or vice versa and greater attention would have led to a better management of more complex fights, especially in the face of the aforementioned surge in the level of difficulty. Fortunately, most of the problems end here and for the rest War in the North proves to be an extremely enjoyable game, also from a technical point of view: if it is true that most of the enemies look alike both from an aesthetic and a behavioral point of view, however, it must be said that the guys from Snowblind Studios have done an excellent job with the polygonal modeling of each creature, humanoid or not, inspired above all by the ideas of Peter Jackson. The settings are rich in detail and skilfully evoke the atmosphere of the original story, whether you enter the gloomy crypts of Tumulilande or run in the rainy stillness of Bree. The ~cities~ such as Brea, in fact, or Rivendell may perhaps appear excessively small and sparsely populated, as mere trading and repairing ~hubs~, but on the other hand they are full of details as are the vast areas in which the game develops, whose only demerit is that represented by the excessive linearity of the map, but certainly not by the glance, although undermined by textures that are not always up to the hardware. Finally, the soundtrack remains a bit anonymous throughout the adventure, perhaps trying to mimic the one composed by Howard Shore for the film trilogy without actually succeeding, but still offering an effective accompaniment especially during battles.", "date": "2011-11-07", "grade": "7.7"}
