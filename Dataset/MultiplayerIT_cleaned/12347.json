{"name": "Bird Flu", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/bird-flu.html", "text": "The situation that we find as soon as the first game of Bird Flu begins is that of some colored birds that inexplicably begin to fall to the ground from the top of a cloud; it is immediately clear that if we don't intervene in time their fate is sealed, as well as that of our video game. Let's try to explain how the gameplay of this simple game is structured which in reality after a few games takes on the characteristics of a real object of desire. On the lower part of the mobile phone screen, in the test we used our trusty Nokia N70, a bar with different colored sectors scrolls continuously; the concept is simple, we will have to land each bird on the box of the respective color (yes, even the birds have different colors). We will have to respect the objective by bringing a certain number of birds to safety in the established seconds; time is gradually less and less and is marked by the cloud which is initially located at the top of the screen, but which will go down as the seconds pass or as our errors increase. Instead, every time we manage to correctly match the bird to its sector, the cloud will rise again, thus giving us some breathing space and peace of mind to continue playing. There are two variants of the title developed by Herocraft that differ mainly in the management method, with one key or three keys, but not only. The difference is therefore given, as mentioned, not only by the controls, in the sense that the simplified mode can be used simply by simply pressing the appropriate key, but also by the fact that in the ~3-key~ mode we will be able to control not only the fall of the birds but also the scrolling of the horizontal bar, making our strategy more complex. From the point of view of gameplay, despite being a decidedly simplified product, it is appreciated, guaranteeing the right amount of fun while managing to keep our reflexes trained; our reaction speed will be, as it is easy to understand, fundamental to be able to move forward in the levels. Technically the product is decidedly good, with a valid graphics engine that does not suffer from any uncertainty, even if it is obvious that Bird Flu is certainly not the type of game that puts the power of our mobile phones to the test. However, we point out that the sprites are well defined and very colorful, suitable for the purpose for which they were created. The main flaw, turning a blind eye to some sporadic problem in managing the fall of birds, seems to be only that of repetitiveness, a problem that actually afflicts every puzzle game. For anyone who wants an immediate game, immediately engaging and damn addictive we can only recommend Bird Flu.
