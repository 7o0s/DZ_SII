Gravity Rush (Gravity Daze, in Japan) was born from a heterogeneous mixture of ideas, authors and influences. Part anime, part comic book and part video game, everything revolves around gravity: before Anne Hathaway's explanations and Sandra Bullock's hallucinations, there were the adventures of Kat, a blonde superhero forced to protect, despite herself , the steampunk town of Hekseville from the threat of the Nevi. While waiting for Gravity Rush 2, which will be released in 2016, Sony has well thought of converting the prequel for PlayStation 4, entrusting the remastering to Bluepoint. And with this we can say that the last nail has also been driven into the coffin of PlayStation Vita... Gravity Rush Remastered is the best way to enjoy Kat's first great adventure Cats and crows Kat wakes up in Heksevelle with no memory, in the company of a strange kitten who apparently gives her the power to alter gravity. At first, Kat is disoriented and frightened, also because the inhabitants of this strange steampunk town treat her with distrust: before becoming a true heroine, Kat will have to sweat the proverbial seven shirts and prove that she is not a mere troublemaker. And that means starting small while learning to use his new powers. The story of Gravity Rush is told to us through a mix of dialogues and comic strips: you have to be patient and read every line to get to know the characters better, also because in Hekseville they speak a fictitious and incomprehensible language that vaguely resembles French. In this sense, Gravity Rush surprises with a plot that is anything but obvious and delightful characters, starting with the sweet but feisty Kat. The aforementioned illustrations are already the first sign of a remastering with counter-flakes: the 1080p resolution allowed us to admire the details of the comic strips, embellishing the city of Hekseville in every detail. The heavy aliasing of the PlayStation Vita version is now only a thing of the past: the anti-aliasing filter cleans the image excellently, reducing the infamous ~stairs~ almost completely. This embellishment also intervenes doubly on the gameplay, to tell the truth. First, the image is now much less muddy. Exploring Hekseville is even more of a joy than in the past, also because the screen size allows you to see details and objectives better, especially when you are floating in mid-air looking for a surface to redirect the gravitational pull towards. Those who have already played Gravity Rush will surely remember how chaotic it can become, especially in the advanced stages, but this remastered version lets its peculiar gameplay breathe, thanks also and above all to the granite frame rate. Gravity Rush Remastered, in fact, runs at 60 frames per second at any time, even when splashing through the crowded streets of Hekseville, attracted by the force of gravity, among passers-by who may be dragged along with us. The constant fluidity not only embellishes the general visual rendering, of course, but clearly improves the gameplay, making the fights even more intense, especially when facing the gigantic bosses. Playstation 4 trophies The trophies are the same as in the PlayStation Vita version: 25 Bronze, 10 Silver, 4 Gold and the ever-present Platinum, plus 8 trophies for the DLCs that have been integrated into the game from the start. Most of it is easy to obtain, just complete the various chapters of the story or defeat all kinds of enemies, fully upgrade Kat's abilities and complete all the challenges. Look but don't touch Gravity Rush was designed to show off the muscles of Sony portable hardware from every point of view: the original version, in fact, made a lot of use of the touch screen and the gyroscope, integrating them into the gameplay between ups and downs. The player, for example, had to move the PlayStation Vita to orient Kat and establish her destination when she was suspended in mid-air and manipulating gravity. That mechanic worked well and made the experience decidedly original. Less convincing, however, the gravitational slide control system, which was performed by moving the handheld while touching the lower corners of the touch screen: it was an abstruse choice that made the skill-based challenges in question decidedly frustrating. By converting the game for PlayStation 4, developer Bluepoint had to adapt the control system to the joypad with perhaps a less original, but certainly more effective result. Now the orientation of thegravitational force is controlled simply with the analog stick ... or you can move the DualShock 4, using its integrated gyroscope: in any case, you have a much better mastery of each situation. Almost every input entrusted to the PlayStation Vita touch screen is now linked to the simple press of a button, but some features remain, such as the ability to move the joypad to tilt the comic strips during narrative interludes. Bluepoint has essentially thought of offering a new traditional control system and, when possible, an alternative that mimics the feeling of the experience on PlayStation Vita. The dodge, for example, is entrusted to the pressure of a backbone together with the analog stick ... but you can also touch the touch pad of the DualShock 4 to make Kat pirouette in the same direction. The infamous gravitational slide, however, is now entrusted to the simple simultaneous pressure of the backbones, and the player can limit himself to directing our blonde heroine with the analog stick. The challenges that we once abandoned in frustration are back within our reach, now, for another reason too: uploads. If the PlayStation Vita version took at least half a minute to load - or reload - a challenge, there is no comparison with the approximately five to ten seconds it takes on the PlayStation 4. Bluepoint have also integrated DLC missions into the game, so the division remains between main and side missions, which appear on the Hekseville map with different colored icons. The new control system, combined with the excellent frame rate, allows you to face even the last and chaotic clashes of the game much more serenely, eliminating the occasional bits of frustration that happened to be caught in the original version.", "date": "2016-01-26", "grade": "9.0"}
