Maybe this will happen one day, yes, but not today; because the Kyoto house with the ~usual~ Links, Mario, Zelda, Samus, Luigi, Pikachu and company always manages, console after console, to create excellent titles, wonderfully playable and which seem to exist in a sort of space bubble- time in which the fun is recognizable, familiar, but equally incomparable. And going back to talking about longevity, there is an authentic icon of electronic entertainment now really close to turning 30, who was already a protagonist when instead the Italian plumber was only an anonymous ~Jumpman~ who supported him in his debut game designer of a very young Miyamoto. In the last pennies of a 2010 now ready to say goodbye, Donkey Kong returns with one of the best games ever for Nintendo Wii. It takes hair on the stomach Donkey Kong Country Returns, as the name suggests, takes up Rare's ~Country~ series, which from 1994 to 1997 with three chapters on Super Nintendo delighted the 16-bit, reaching exceptional technical peaks, flanked by excellent gameplay. They were the golden beginnings of the marriage between the English software house and Nintendo, which was later destined to break down in the face of the 375 million dollars paid by Microsoft for its acquisition in 2002. With the original authors out of the game, the leaders of the great N they therefore well thought of entrusting its development to another certainly no less talented team, namely that Retro Studios which reinvented the Metroid series with the Prime brand. In this case, however, the Texan boys did not give the ape the same treatment they had reserved for Samus; Donkey Kong Country Returns is not a revolution, but rather a continuation of what was left off at the gates of the new millennium. The thing in itself would already be interesting, in a period in which 2D platformers have become a niche genre, but it is the final result probably beyond the most optimistic expectations that makes the latest Nintendo production an authentic jewel. The plot, of course, is small: this time Donkey Kong's bananas have been stolen at the hands of a tribe, the Tiki Tak, capable of hypnotizing poor and unsuspecting animals to enslave them at their feet. And you can take away everything from old DK, but certainly not his favorite fruit. The result is a race through jungles, beaches, caves, factories, volcanoes and so on and so forth; environments divided into numerous levels, to compose a full-bodied, robust and long-lasting adventure. In the single-player mode, you take direct control of only the primate, even if the companion of a thousand adventures Diddy Kong is always available to lend a hand, provided you free it from its usually recognizable barrel. In this case Diddy goes to position himself on Donkey's shoulders, thus providing a double help which results in both doubling the overall energy and in the possibility of using his jetpack to glide more delicately after a jump. A facility that you will often be prompted to bless, especially in more complex platform situations; In fact, Donkey Kong Country Returns is not a simple game, or rather it is not contextualized to what we are usually used to finding in contemporary video games. The need to have good coordination and sufficient mastery of the platform genre is an essential foundation, which also in this case brings Returns closer to the chapters of the Super Nintendo trilogy. Let me be clear, this is not a criticism, and we would be wanting more given the times we have complained about the excessive casual and simplistic drift of Wii titles; it is a simple observation, which must be taken into account. Donkey Kong Country Returns is clearly a game for those with the handle: not so difficult as to become frustrating (although it can often be darn close, with lives lost one after another), but challenging, requiring reflexes and coordination, especially when you decide to go beyond the superficial level and aim for secondary objectives and 100% completion. The possibility of activating the notorious Super Guide, or in practice the automatic resolution by the CPU, is an ~innovation~ of which we still cannot be convinced and which in any case does not change the above picture. As 2010 winds down, Retro Studios returns to the Wii to deliver one of the best titles available We are descended from the monkey The systemThe control is practically perfect, as required by a platformer of this type, especially if branded Nintendo. There are actually two alternatives, which allow you to choose between Wiimote + Nunchuk or remote control only. The shares available are obviously the same, but their execution changes more or less significantly; in the first case, for example, the movement is delegated to the Nunchuk stick, while with only the Wiimote held horizontally the digital cross is used. The latter solution is undoubtedly preferable, as it is more precise, reactive and more compatible with two-dimensional gameplay. By shaking the controller, whether single or doubled, you can also activate some of the skills; alone to punch the ground, coupled with down direction to blow, or left or right to make a rolling attack. It goes without saying that each of these actions is fundamental within a whole series of situations that will arise, with a variety that is one of the great qualities of Donkey Kong Country Returns. The only small note that can be noted regarding the control system is precisely linked to the motion control solution, hardly recognizable as better than it could have been if replaced with a simple dear old key. And the countercheck can't even be done, since the Classic Controller is not supported. But it really is an absolutely minimal detail, a purist whim that in no way affects the playability of the Retro Studios title. We were talking about the various ~layers~ with which Donkey Kong Country Returns can be tackled, because reaching the end of the level is only the beginning, stuff for beginners. The second layer means collecting the letters that form the word KONG, scattered in more or less easily accessible places. Amateur stuff. The third layer, on the other hand, is something decidedly more complex, since it requires you to collect a variable number of pieces of a puzzle often positioned or hidden in such a way as to require considerable exploration effort and skill. Professional stuff with nerves of steel and the patience of a saint, but of course incredibly rewarding. And if that weren't enough, there is also the timed mode, which requires you to watch the stopwatch to get medals, the faster you are in reaching the end of the stage. But the qualities of the gameplay of the Nintendo production go far beyond, and what is surprising above all, as we said earlier, the variety of situations offered by the sublime level design, which goes hand in hand with that of the settings that accompany them. Racing on mine carts, or riding a barrel rocket, or more simply on the back of Rambi the rhinoceros are the norm in the world of DK, as are the always exciting battles with more or less large bosses. Getting tired of playing Donkey Kong Country Returns is almost impossible, and this is undoubtedly the most important milestone achieved by programmers. In the same way, the technical component also deserves applause, easily positioning itself from this point of view among the best games ever to appear on the Wii; graphically the amount of polygons and details is simply excellent, but in general it is the style that amazes for quality and touches of class, as in the case of the wonderful sections with the silhouettes and the red sun in the background. The only note that can be made is linked to the few ~effects~ applied, and in this sense with such hairy protagonists the absence of fur shading is quite evident. And remaining within the sphere of the defects, or rather of the less successful aspects, the multiplayer mode certainly proves to be weaker than the single player experience: too punitive and demanding, it simply fits in as an ~extra~ within a package that was born and raised for a single user.", "date": "2010-12-09", "grade": "9.0"}
