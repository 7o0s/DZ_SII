There was a lot of discussion about the versions (GC and PS2, of course) that should have broadened the potential user base of one of the best video games of last year like wildfire, discussing the undoubted capabilities of the Xbox and the obvious graphic opulence that Splinter Cell showed on the Microsoft console. We start from this point to ensure that the analysis can then branch out through different angles, interpretations and judgments of the case. If the greatest curiosity is linked to the graphic rendering, it is easy to say: Splinter Cell on Game Cube is excellent, simply excellent, the original Xbox version was, however, absolutely extraordinary and remains so today. What are the differences that inhabit the territory that separates the two definitions of ~excellent~ and ~extraordinary~? The answer lies in the (often forced) compromises Ubi Soft's Shanghai division made when adapting the game itself. This does not mean that the graphic impact on GC is poor, far from it. Analyzed without knowing the primary incarnation, Splinter Cell is a title capable of exalting anyone, for dynamism, fluidity, cleanliness and beauty of the extremely realistic context in which one is immersed. However, it must be testified that the changes are there and in many cases, evident. By simply facing the initial phase in which you are introduced to familiarization with the commands through the training phase, it is possible to notice how many background components present in the Xbox version have been omitted; the desks full of paperwork, chairs and pieces of furniture, in the offices where Sam Fisher dusts off his art as a silent Killer, have disappeared, the rooms are much more aseptic and linear while (and it must be repeated) remaining beautiful to see. It is this first impact that provides a clear signal of downsizing, given that, progressing in the actual game, the situation improves significantly. The immersion in the city of T'bilisi, in the narrow rooms where the germ of terrorism creeps in, as well as the buildings that house power, is very atmospheric, the plays of light have remained splendid (although less frequent) while all which gravitates around Sam Fisher's equipment (thermal vision, night vision and so on) is made with the same mastery. What probably annoys is the evidence of how certain compromises are not related to the hardware but borrowed from the need not to be able to work on two versions (GC and PS2) in an exquisitely dedicated way. Concluding the attention that was due to an important argument such as, undoubtedly, the one on the graphics sector, what was written above is authentic. The atmosphere is absolute, the overview is extremely satisfying and everything flows smoothly despite not having the blatant display of muscles that the Xbox version still sports with deserved pride. In Fisher's soul... As in any self-respecting ~moving~, even Sam Fisher's move on Cubo follows its unwritten laws. Something breaks on the way but we end up furnishing the new house with objects and goodies that can gratify us after so much effort. So, after analyzing the aesthetic aspect of Splinter Cell, here we are with the exclusive news on Game Cube, decidedly juicy. The narrative plot deserves the first mention, which becomes considerably deeper and more intriguing thanks to a massive amount of videos introduced by the incipit and skilfully mixed from mission to mission. The quality is already very high from the new intro (which tells the background that leads to the summoning of the old Sam), at first you get the feeling that everything is shot with real actors and not in CG. The even more cinematic cut gives the protagonist an important background and the player an even more enveloping immersion in the context. By dancing on the thread of this analysis, it is possible to step inside the dubbing and localization. The latter remains the one we have come to know and love on Xbox with our Sam Fisher who sports the most beautiful voice on the Italian scene, namely that of Luca Ward (who became famous for having given Russell Crowe ~the attributes~ in the famous Gladiator, ~I am Massimo Decimo Meridio, Father of a son killed etc ...~). Inside the game, the voice remains the same, while, in the new videos introduced exclusively, the protagonist relies on another voice actor, the same deep voice as the legendary Ward, perhaps less evocative but still of a good level. All the sound sector Wedengulfed in applause. Beyond the guest star who lends his vocal cords to our Sam, the arrangement does not have a note out of place, any musical passage and theme adapts wonderfully to any situation, giving that priceless feeling of epic protagonism that sinuously captures the player, with due slowness but inexorably. In this regard, inside the mini-dvd you will also find (in addition to the interview with Sam Fisher in ~meat & polygons~) a very exhaustive special dedicated to the composers and the making of. OPSAT, X-Ray and GBA! Continuing to move in the sphere of the innovations dedicated to the Cube, the most important is certainly the connectivity with the GBA. After the interaction and minigames in PSO and the brilliance of the link function with Zelda TWW, here is another convincing performance of the two consoles in symbiosis. It is known that Special Agent Sam Fisher is equipped with an embarrassing amount of technological jewels: optical fibers, viewers, microscopic cameras and the OPSAT that everyone dreams of. In this case, the GBA, connected at any time via link cable, becomes (without the need for any cartridge) a real palmtop. Through a decidedly stylish choice like that of the wireframe, a very detailed map of the area that you will find yourself exploring will be displayed on the screen of your laptop, including indications on the location of the enemies to avoid (or hit), the possibility of zooming and a very fine gem; even when you are busy seeing what is happening on the screen, it will be sufficient to leave the GBA on and as soon as the situation tends to become critical (enemies too close, active surveillance), your Nintendo PDA will emit signaling ~beeps~. All of this, mixed with the adrenaline tension of a title like Splinter Cell, is terribly satisfying but it doesn't end there. Always hand-in-hand with the use of the Game Boy Advance, a new exclusive weapon has been introduced: the Sticky Bomb which can be placed in some locations and then wait for the passage of your human objectives by viewing it on the GBA and taking advantage of this last as Remote Controller, kick off the explosion. A devastating lust. The controller behaves very well, both as regards the control of the camera through the yellow ~C~ stick (this analog also allows, with a rapid inclination downwards, to ~skip~ in the first person view with relative viewer equipped with zoom), and when the use of the keys becomes more complex and present as the adventure progresses, with the consequent increase in equipment that can be used. The transition to GC has also led to greater usability and access to the items, through immediate onscreen menus in which you have the opportunity to always choose the best option, if any, for an action of surprise or maximum caution. Comment The fact that Splinter Cell is a splendid game is widely accepted. This version for Game Cube does not deny what was good and innovative in its original DNA; fabulous gameplay, the suggestion of a world borrowed from Tom Clancy's books and the rare quality of immersing the player completely thanks to a skilful mix of adrenaline, style and captivating plot. The note that must be made and underlined is having converted the title without, evidently, thinking of adapting it to the qualities of the hardware that hosted Metroid, solving the problems by ~omitting~ rather than looking for certainly better and feasible solutions and it is only this to subtract half a vote from the overall judgment. Beyond having to place in second place, in the hypothetical graphic podium of the incarnations of Splinter Cell, the Game Cube brings into play the beautiful link function with the GBA and a massive dose of additional and captivating movies. It is natural that, also considering the late publication, this SC is proposed in a clear and direct way to the users of Nintendo fans who, from today, can get excited, freely, even in the role of Sam Fisher, through an experience that remains rare and unmissable. Pros: GBA link function that adds quality and depth New unedited movies that dot the game and deepen the plot Playability at very high levels Cons: Graphic resizing evident and in many cases, avoidable Last of the three versions to come out on the market, it may not help Flipping through the pages of a video game... The stereotypical image of Sam Fisher (a sort of intelligent Hollywood mix between the face of GeorgeClooney and the calm charisma of Harrison Ford) indelibly marked the 2002 vintage, forcibly imprinting itself in the collective imagination of those who wore it as a banner, intent on showing the way for a new generation of video games. Thanks to an infinite number of extremely innovative elements, inserted in a gameplay of the highest order, Splinter Cell has thus earned the palm of a real paradigm for what concerns yet another sub-genre born in these last years of convulsive and orgiastic market: the Stealth Game. The Ubi Soft title, inspired once again by the fervent and calculating mind of Tom Clancy, draws liberally on everything which, between international intrigues, political implications and diplomatic incidents, blends perfectly with the adrenaline lavished in moments of pure action; an amazing cocktail that makes the Maryland writer a constant best-selling machine. Splinter Cell was and is the electronic sublimation of this literary phenomenon; after having sparkled like the brightest of the medals of valor on the chest of the battleship Microsoft, it is ready to be pinned even on the less austere uniform of the merry brigade called Nintendo.", "date": "2003-06-04", "grade": null}
