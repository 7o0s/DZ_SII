{"name": "Little Town Hero", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/little-town-hero-recensione.html", "text": "Strange, curious but above all worrying the fate that befell Little Town Hero, whose review you read, the new intellectual property of Game Freak, the developer who in less than a month will bring Pokmon Sword and Shield for the first time on Switch. Announced simply as Town in September 2018, Little Town Hero then disappeared from the radar until the recent E3 Nintendo Direct, when it showed up again with the new title in a short trailer that revealed the release date. And on that date, last week, it got there unceremoniously, without big slogans or expensive hype: Little Town Hero is simply out and nobody even noticed. We played it these days and, within a few hours, we understood why Nintendo decided to keep a low profile despite the developer's sure appeal. A mysterious village To be a low-budget title - it costs only 24.99 euros in digital delivery - the first impact with Little Town Hero is decidedly splendid. The village where the game takes place is colorful and detailed; to be honest, it has more personality than its inhabitants, with the stream dividing the residential and commercial districts, the wind gently shaking the ears of corn making them glisten in the sunlight, the castle towering above it with spiers reaching towards the sky. It is an idyllic place where anyone would like to live. Anyone except Ax, the young protagonist who dreams of exploring the world, starting with the aforementioned castle: the law forbids the inhabitants of the village to trespass, so Ax spends all his time working in the mine and playing with his friends before returning home , where only mom is waiting for her since dad disappeared many years ago. The meeting with an old soldier who takes Ax as a pupil is the turning point: Ax finds a mysterious stone that gives him the power to fight the monsters who, all of a sudden, begin to attack the village. The story of Little Town Hero intrigues the player but struggles to engage. As much as you may have the fate of the village at heart, you hardly have the same feelings towards its inhabitants, starting with the stereotyped protagonists who certainly don't shine for personality or characterization. The other villagers are anonymous clones of each other - the models are a handful, copied and pasted even in the same rooms - who add nothing to the plot, limiting themselves to exchanging baffling banality with Ax, and who only sometimes serve to solve some simple logic puzzles. It should be noted that Little Town Hero has not been localized in Italian, therefore those who have difficulty with the English language may have some problems continuing in the game. Nobody expected the plot of a triple A JRPG, mind you, and in some ways the little story that holds up the game is also captivating, but Game Freak dilutes the plot with small subplots and assignments that have every appearance of filling in the twenty hours needed to reach the credits. Fighting ideas Well, having established that Little Town Hero is not a Final Fantasy or Xenogears type JRPG, but a fairy tale that doesn't even take itself too seriously, how does that particular combat system that we have glimpsed in the scanty trailers released so far behave? We cannot deny that we were rather saddened to discover that the Japanese developer failed to support the ingenious dynamics he had set for himself, also because this combat system is truly a small pearl in a landscape that has recently struggled to surprise players. The turn-based fights mainly revolve around two key elements: the Izzit and the Dazzit. The Izzit are the ideas of combat skills that we will be able to use only after having transformed them into Dazzit, consuming the special resources that recharge each turn and which increase as the battle continues over time, allowing us to implement more and more skills. Each Dazzit is characterized by an attack value and a defense value: our goal will be to make our Dazzit collide with those of the enemy, trying to destroy each of his Dazzit to induce him in a condition called All break. Only then, and only if we still have Dazzit available, will we be able to damage the shields that protect him, called Guts, and the three hearts that represent his life points. The most interesting thing is that most of the Dazzit grant particular bonuses. Some, for example, increase the attack values of other Dazzits, while others could damage all of the enemy's Dazzits or grant differentyes bonus. In short, the combat system of Little Town Hero is very reminiscent of card games, but clings to a shred of mathematical logic that forces the player to plan his moves very carefully and to rationally distribute the earned Eureka points, which allow to upgrade your Dazzits in the upgrade menu between battles. It's a combat system that doesn't end there, however, and which embraces a whole series of additional variables and conditions that change almost with each encounter. Moving is one of them. At the end of the turn we will have to roll a dice to move a certain number of boxes on the village map, and in some of them we will be able to learn new Izzit or we will be able to resort to the help of the other inhabitants. The displacements add an additional level of depth to the clashes that punctuate the story in forced stages, alternating new bosses with the repeated challenges of our tireless rival, Matock. On paper, Little Town Hero's combat system is a real strategic gem, but you soon realize that Game Freak hasn't balanced the difficulty in the slightest, entrusting a good part of its dynamics to chance and prolonging each battle unnecessarily. There are clashes, already in the very first chapters of the game, which can last for forty minutes and still end up with our defeat due to a mistake made only in the initial rounds. Now the problem wouldn't even arise if these fights were also beautiful to look at, but in reality they are horribly monotonous. Ax has practically four cross animations that are valid for dozens of different Dazzit, his enemies even less: the battles really last too long and the slowness of the animations or of the small kinematics that involve the inhabitants in the specific boxes make the clashes more demanding even longer and more boring. It is at this point that one realizes how tight Little Town Hero's budget must have been. The Game Freak title looks pretty much the same whether you're playing it on TV or in portable mode, and in both cases you experience noticeable dropped frames, saving animations, unexplained temporary freezes when interacting with some NPCs, and many other minor glitches that they don't make the title unplayable, mind you, but they highlight its wasted potential. The fixed point in the entire production, which never betrays the player, is the enchanting soundtrack signed by Toby Fox, the developer of Undertale: thanks to it and to the general glance, you can say everything about Little Town Hero but not that it lacks atmosphere. Too bad this time it's not enough.", "date": "2019-10-23", "grade": "6.0"}
