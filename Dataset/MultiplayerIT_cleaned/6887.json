The title, let's face it right away, does not offer any striking innovations compared to the last edition, for a gameplay that has remained almost unchanged in its highest points. Our feeling, after several games, is that the developers have chosen, at least on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, a different path than the competition, namely that of ~retouching without distorting~. And this not only due to the fact that from their point of view it will still be the others who have to chase, but also because FIFA did not need particular revolutions, but rather filings in some of its aspects. And perhaps, we add, because more probably cannot be obtained on the consoles of the older generation by now. Like last year, however, it will be the transfer market that decides who will be the public's favorite and whether or not the production is attractive, while we have the honor and the burden of telling you again about this umpteenth chapter in the football saga signed by Electronic Arts. With FIFA 15 EA improves, but does not overturn, a game structure that rests on consolidated foundations It begins again! Once FIFA 15 has loaded, the user finds himself as always in front of a series of window menus, using which he can access any section of the game in an instant. In this sense, as per tradition, there are the classic friendlies, the EA SPORTS Football Club, the Match Day, the official cups and championships, the skill challenges, the virtual footballer with the relative challenges to increase his characteristics, the online, with all the season in Co-Op, and so on. However, the Pro Clubs mode is missing, while Match Day Live is present, a service in collaboration with Goal.com that allows fans to get the latest news on what is happening in real football directly in FIFA 15. But as always, the modes are Career and FIFA Football Team to hold the bench in the EA branded production. The first has been the most important section of the single player component for years, and in the light of the feedback received from users, the Canadian team has taken steps to make some interesting changes. For example, thanks to a new search screen, it's easier and less ~tedious~ to hunt for a footballer to recruit. The system of scouts to be sent around to monitor the performance of the athletes of interest, and to provide a series of reports on their characteristics and potential upon request by the manager, is enriched this year with the automatic possibility, for observers, to identify the weak points of the user-managed roster and then to suggest the most suitable names to fill the gaps. Speaking of line-ups, we point out that the rosters are not updated on the last day of the transfer market, therefore on the one hand we have the various Evr at Juventus or Iturbe at Roma, on the other Fernando Torres still at Chelsea or Pandev still in Naples. Returning to the novelty speech, the title finally provides a more realistic system for the development of players, with those who can boast a certain potential which, if used with a certain frequency, will grow faster than other less gifted ones. Last but not least, older players with a high rating will not retire early, so that you can still enjoy them for a few more seasons, rather than losing them in many cases after the first one. Then there are, within the renewed team management screen which also has suggestions for substitutions, the so-called starting formations, available not only in Career mode, but also in Match Days, online friendlies and tournaments. What is it about? For each team, up to six different starting formations can be customized in the game, and up to five offensive and defensive instructions can be assigned to each of the ten outfield players. It is therefore possible to adapt the way of playing of any team to what are the tactical ideas and the way a certain scheme is used by a user. For the rest we have all those elements that have made this method increasingly intriguing in recent years, from the management of a transfer market characterized by various variables both in the buying and selling phase, to that of relations with the staff, the players and the media, up to the technical management in the field. To give more prominence to the empathy aspect, the developers have finally further increased the amount of news llinked to the teams, the champions and the tournaments, the expectations of the fans and those of the management. Moving on to the FIFA Ultimate Team topic, a mode that allows you to create your own ideal team by basing purchases and exchanges on a complex eBay-style system, there are basically four of the most important innovations this year: first of all, the new Physicality attribute, which actually replaces the Header and is the set of parameters Physical Strength, resistance and jump. Then the so-called Experimental Teams, or the possibility of creating a fictitious team made up of any player, in such a way as to test what the values on the pitch would be like and the connection with the other players, before a possible purchase. The third novelty is represented by the fact of being able to borrow some players from the EA Sports Football Club catalog for a limited number of matches (the duration of the loan is indicated by a special icon on the player's card). For example, for those who have pre-ordered, Messi is available for five matches, but the list of players available for loan is much wider. The latest addition for FUT is represented by the possibility of creating seasons with friends, in such a way as to challenge known people without having to run into the randomness of online research. The only ~annoying~ note, in our view, is the failure to raise the level, and in some cases also the downgrading in terms of technical value and therefore of card, of many athletes in our championship. Which clashes, especially when compared to unknown carneades of some Premier League team. Xbox 360 goals There are 38 goals offered by FIFA 15, for the canonical 1000 player points. To obtain them you must be able to overcome the challenges proposed by the title in all modes, such as winning some competitions both online and offline, making complex feints, saving three penalties during official matches, saving a goal on the goal line or even posting a simple commentary about the EA SPORTS Football Club. You touch and touch up After having dissected the game options, the time has come to talk about the actual gameplay, to test which we have set the controls to ~full manual~ as usual and to the Legend difficulty level, because with the assisted it becomes decidedly too easy. As we anticipated in the introductory hat, for this new chapter of FIFA, EA has worked much more to smooth out the defects of the past edition than to revolutionize its mechanics. Physicality, greater control over the movements of the athletes on the field, and a more realistic behavior of the ball are in this sense the focal points on which the developers have focused their attention most to enrich a playability that was already based on very solid foundations. In fact, once you take the field, the feeling with the players is immediately familiar and the feeling of continuity with the previous chapters is clear. The control is good and the response to the commands convincing, with players who in a reactive and natural way juggle with tighter and more precise dribbles, or manage to counter and push with the simple use of the left analog stick. In general, there is the possibility of replicating a considerable variety of manoeuvres, thanks also to the new animations that accompany the movements of the protagonists on the field, linked to the dynamics inherent in their running, the gestures of the body in the acceleration phase and deceleration, dribbling or changes of direction. In fact, the behavioral routines of the players managed by the artificial intelligence have been slightly retouched, which is why the athletes move more evenly on the pitch, both in the offensive and defensive phases, giving a greater feeling of ~team ~. In the first case, thanks to the more logical ~movements~ of the teammates, the user can count on a greater range of options when he finds himself managing the ball carrier. It is therefore easy, for example, to see overlaps on the flanks to suggest a pass, or to open up defenses with deadly diagonals capable of creating useful space for the insertion of a colleague. The opposing athletes in possession of the ball tend in turn less to seek impromptu solutions, preferring to dialogue with their teammates (sometimes in a sort of electronic version of the tiki-taka) while waiting for the right moment to kick on goal, attempt a dribble or serve a better-placed colleague inside the sixteen metres. To tell the truth, in a couple of circumstances we happened to see athletes stubborn in personal actions, but being Messi and Ibrahimovic respectively, it could have been a coincidence,or a factor linked to their nature and their technical specifications. Similarly in the defensive phase, the opponents cover the field better, play in advance or wait for the movement of the opponent depending on the circumstances, and if necessary they do not disdain to sweep the ball sending it into the stands. Obviously they don't even despise using the physique, when needed, to assert themselves. Using the body to protect the ball is also of fundamental importance in order not to lose possession of it, above all in the light of better general physics which makes control even more uncertain: in fact, a slight contact with another player, a rebound fouled by the foot of an opponent or a fortuitous impact, to change the rotation and trajectory of the ball, making control much more difficult. We also have small improvements with regard to the goalkeepers, who while not being able to ~boast~ the (alleged) improvements announced for their counterparts on next-gen consoles, overall perform their task well and only sporadically suffer from amnesia on low and low outputs sometimes on some pitches. In this sense it must be said that we have not encountered that bug complained of by some users relating to precision conclusions from long distances that often end up on the net: the problem, at first glance, would seem to afflict the next-gen editions, or the game with fully assisted controls. In any case, goal shots, such as offensive and defensive passes or headers, due to their power and effectiveness also depend very much on a series of factors, such as for example the pressure with the right timing of the relative command, the weight or the position in which the kicker's body is in relation to the ball at the time of the shot or assist. However on the ~gores~, especially those resulting from crosses from the back, we have noticed in some cases a certain tendency of the game to favor the attacker rather than the defender, even when the latter was perhaps better positioned than the opponent. Finally, in corner kicks, in addition to the possibility of calling up patterns like in FIFA World Cup Brazil 2014, the possibility of selecting the partner to whom to address the ball has been added with the analog stick. Ditto in throw-ins and free kicks. And the momentum, the number one ~enemy~ of any sports simulation and, despite the denials of EA, even of FIFA? We cannot say with certainty that it has completely disappeared, given that the ~phenomenon~ usually manifests itself over time. However, we haven't noticed anything particularly strange, so if there is one, it's not particularly intrusive as in the first editions. Pirlo faces FIFA 15 offers full coverage for many leagues, with official licenses for both the tournament and the teams that participate in it. This year the Brazilian championship is missing, but there is the Turkish Sper Lig. Even our Serie A Tim is finally represented with its official logo, and the various clubs that make it up boast the royal crest and the shirts of the season that has just begun. For Serie B however, only Catania, Livorno and Bologna enjoy this coverage, while the others have fictitious logos and names, such as Vicenza which has been renamed Borgocalcio. As for the faces of the athletes, EA shows a little more attention to the Italian fans. Of course, we are not yet at the levels of other tournaments, but some signs are arriving: in addition to those already present in past editions, now Pogba, Bonucci, Palacio with his tail, Destro, Insigne or Immobile also have their real faces, while players like Higuain and Pirlo finally have an updated look complete with a beard and, in the case of the national Andrea, also a new face more in keeping with the current age. As far as stadiums are concerned, the Canadian company wanted to go big this year, and in addition to the plethora of facilities already available in past editions, such as the San Siro or the Juventus Stadium, it has added all those of the English Premier League, which thanks to a wider agreement allowed EA to also use the real referees, chants and billboards of the tournament. Football like on television Proceeding in our analysis of the title, we cannot fail to mention its technological aspect. In this sense, the argument we have already made regarding the gameplay is valid, namely that in this version of the game there are no particular upheavals from an aesthetic point of view. In fact, on a graphic level, FIFA 15 does not differ much from FIFA 14. But on the other hand, and we repeat, the engine is the same, the hardware available to the development team ditto, therefore it is perhaps humanly impossible to expect who knows what changes in this generation of", "date": "2014-09-29", "grade": "8.6"}
