Is the running of players natural? Is the ball ~heavy~ or do shots feel ethereal? Are the goalkeepers responsive enough? Here is a summary of the questions that fans of football games regularly ask themselves every year. The gist of the speech is always the same: better FIFA or PES? From what we have seen since the 2009 edition, the Electronic Arts series seems to have something extra and has done nothing but continue on the same path with FIFA 10, improving what there was to improve and offering Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 owners a truly new generation product, both on a technical level and in terms of pure gameplay. Unfortunately on PC the situation is very different, and FIFA has in fact remained at the 2008 edition, which is the one that preceded the substantial improvement of the franchise. We could wonder for days about the reasons behind this choice. Is this an attempt to keep system requirements low while increasing the potential user base of the product? It's possible. Has EA lost interest in the PC platform, which also continues to give you satisfaction in terms of sales? Unlikely. Nevertheless... The coach in the ball Taking a look at the numerous game modes present in FIFA 10, there are no particular innovations. As usual, you can choose your ~heart team~ and associate it with the profile so that it is selected by default when possible. You can try your hand at a quick game to immediately taste the game and its mechanics, perhaps hunting for the differences compared to the previous edition, or go to the training ground to familiarize yourself with the controls and try out some schemes. The developers have included some interesting options that not only allow us to create a form and a team ~style~ from scratch, but also to develop schemes to be recalled when necessary during games. There is also the much talked about Live Season, or the possibility for the most passionate to update the statistics of the players according to an evaluation of the current season. Moving on to football, the classic ~tournament~ and ~season~ modes are joined by the equally classic ~challenges~ (a series of predefined scenarios in which we are asked to overturn the result of a historic match, for example) and multiplayer locally and online. From this point of view, no major changes: the EA infrastructure proves to be reliable as usual and guarantees games with little lag and a quick and intuitive search system. Finally, the ~professional~ and ~coach~ modes return, in the end those with greater thickness. In the first we have to create a player from scratch or select one from those available, then follow his career by completing a series of ever-changing objectives and challenges. In this case, the matches see us play a unique role, moving in the interest of the team and trying to come to terms with an artificial intelligence that is unfortunately not at the forefront, which on more than one occasion will make things more difficult for us. At the end of each match we will be able to reap the fruits of our work in the form of physical improvements: the player will in fact be enhanced. The ~coach~ mode, as everyone knows, is a bit FIFA's answer to the Pro Evolution Soccer ~master league~, even if in this case the figure of the technical commissioner is visually represented and you have to deal with the transfer market and sponsorships in direct way, trying to make ends meet in an attempt to make the team competitive. Almost like a manager, in this mode the matches can also be simulated. Everyone for hot tea Once on the pitch, the sensation is that of a solid football game, with no particular shortcomings or particular innovations. The introduction of 360 control, i.e. the ability to move the player in any direction instead of the usual eight, is noticeable but not that much. Performing complex dribbling remains a practice for advanced players, but in this sense the use of the right stick can help (we carried out our tests using an Xbox 360 controller) which causes a rapid deflection of the ball and therefore can disorient our marker . Passage management is fair, but it still happens too often that the ball goes to the least close player, sometimes creating paradoxical situations in which the receiver has to chase the ball when it has already passed close to three of his teammates without being blocked. For through balls, the situation is less serious but still not greatbut, that is, many times the suggestion goes the wrong way even though the direction in which we press the stick is unequivocal. The through ball in flight appears too ~soft~ and slow, therefore its use in crowded situations is almost always useless, while the situation of crosses is controversial: sometimes they are strong and tense, giving rise to clear chances to score; just as often they are weak and inaccurate, making us waste the maneuver. The sense of ~physicality~ of the ball carriers has been improved, who instead of being at the constant mercy of the defenders quite frequently manage to maintain control of the ball even after a tackle. Managing players without the ball is a bit problematic, and in this case we often find ourselves faced with the unfortunate ~slow-motion run~ that prevents us from hitting a greedy ball on the edge of the area. The goalkeepers are average in terms of skill, let's say they only let themselves be surprised in the most eventful situations and in general that's okay. It's a pity that long shots are too often weak and inconsistent: you reach thirty meters by releasing your leg and expecting a broadside, instead the opposite turns out. Ccccccccannavaro! As widely mentioned at the beginning, FIFA 10 on PC on a technical level has little to do with what good has been done on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. In this case, this version of the game probably uses the graphics engine of FIFA 08 and this is noticeable from polygonal models, from scarce resemblance to real players (apart from the most striking cases), from the desolation of the stadiums, from the lighting system, from the flatness of the textures. It can be said that we are dealing with a product with graphics that are two years old, far from avant-garde and far from spectacular. Nothing can compare with what can be seen on the new generation consoles, and this can only sadden those who dedicate money and time to upgrading their system, always expecting the best possible conversion from multiplatform titles. With all details and effects maxed out (tested on a decent Athlon64 X2 5000+ with 2GB RAM and ATI Radeon HD4870 graphics card with 1GB RAM), with v-sync on, FIFA 10 runs at a constant 60fps and without hesitation both at the resolution of 1680 x 1050 pixels and at the resolution of 1280 x 1024. The commentary is, as usual, entrusted to the duo Caressa / Bergomi, but unfortunately the quality leaves much to be desired: some names are pronounced with emphasis, others with an incredible flatness (and moreover at very different volume levels!). Very often we notice the fact that the sentences are ~glued~ together, and there is no reason to rejoice even from the point of view of variety.", "date": "2009-10-09", "grade": "7.2"}
