The cataclysm with which Deathwing would have upset Azeroth was still far away, forcing to rebuild many points of interest including Meccania itself which, from that point on, became a real port city. The latest expansion of Hearthstone, The Slums of Meccania, is set in this city. The universe of the Blizzard trading card game is already widely known for having put together many more or less well-known characters in the inn, taking inspiration from World of Warcraft situations (pace of temporal references or characters who have now disappeared for years); in addition, since patch 7.0 it has also lost the subtitle Heroes of Warcraft, opening up very different future scenarios in which it may not be excluded to see cards or entire expansions from other intellectual properties of the Irvine house such as Overwatch, StarCraft or Diablo. In The Slums of Meccania, the city was divided into neighborhoods controlled by three families, the Sgherri Torvi, the Kabala and the Jade Lotus, each of which has affiliates to itself, and therefore to its own game mechanics, respectively paladins, warriors and hunters in the first case, priests, sorcerers and wizards in the second and thieves, druids and shamans in the third. This translates into many new features, first of all the tri-class cards that will greatly upset the now stagnant post-Blizzcon metagame, so we can expect a last competitive season of the year in which decks of all types will take shape that will last at least until the next major change coincides with the start of the second standard year, in 2017, and with a new expansion. On tiptoe and with respect we visit the three families that populate the Slums of Meccania to better understand the new 130 cards available. The Mechanic Slums introduces tri-class minions opening up unpredictable scenarios in Hearthstone The Darkness of Aya Blackpaw and the Jade Lotus This family includes rogues, druids and shamans among its ranks and is led by the tri-class legendary servant Aya Blackpaw, a 6 mana 5/3 who both as a battle cry and as a death rattle summons a golem of jade; golems are the unique feature of the Jade Lotus, since each of them, when it comes into play, has attack and defense increased by 1. Each family can also count on two other tri-class minions: one maintains the unique characteristic of the clan it belongs to, as happens for the Spirit of Jade which for 4 mana is a 2/3 capable of summoning a golem when it enters the field , while the second provides a card from another affiliated class via the well-known mechanic of discovery and, for the Jade Lotus, it is Agents of the Lotus, a 5/3 at 5 mana: this ~tri-class discovery~ is already opening up really interesting scenarios. Each affiliated class has its own legendary and if that of the druid Kun the Forgotten King remains anonymous enough, from the top of its 10 mana cost for a 7/7 and the ability to have 10 mana or 10 armor points available again , the same cannot be said for that of the White-Eyes shaman, a 5/5 taunt that as a death rattle puts the Guardian of the Storm in the deck, which has the same cost but is a 10/10 taunt that is already in good shape shows in some decklists control N'Zoth (which returns all minions with deathrattle). Shaku the Collector is, on the other hand, the legendary thief and is a sneaky 3-mana 2/3 with stealth who, every time he attacks, gives you a card of the opposing class. One thing is certain: each of these three classes has developed an interesting new way of playing that can give a great advantage especially in a possible advanced stage of the game, thanks to the help of the golems summoned by new spells and minions. Not only that: thanks to the new Counterfeit Coin, the thief has added another very important piece to the ~miracle~ deck and his interactions, coincidentally, with the old Auctioneer of Meccania. Kazakus and the potions of the Kabala At the beginning of the expansion you will have 3 daily missions (to be unlocked in sequence) in which each head of the family will invite you to win 3 games with one of his affiliated classes, rewarding you, if successful, with two sachets of the new expansion. For the Kabala it is Kazakus who provides you with his missions and tries to convince you to side with his family; he is a legendary tri-class (definitely a troll seenhis vaguely Neapolitan accent) for wizards, priests and sorcerers that costs 4 mana and is 3/3 able to create ~custom spells in the form of potions~ provided that your deck has only monocopy cards. Here, you can find the table of Kazakus' potion creation possibilities but we anticipate that their cost can only be 1, 5 or 10 mana and, in all probability, his choice will depend on the moment of the game in which this will enter the field minion: in the one in which we used it, with the priest deck, we chose a 10 mana potion which, once played, summoned 3 minions who died during the game and put 3 random demons in our hand. Also for this clan, we have the Courier of the Kabala, able to find a card of the affiliated classes, and the Alchemist of the Kabala with his battle cry capable of providing a random potion chosen from the 10 possible ones of this expansion. The push of this family is towards the decks with single copy cards and, therefore, throughout the last part of the year of the Kraken, Reno Jackson will find a lot of friends to go with combinations: it is the case of the legendary of the priest Raza the Chained who, for 5 mana, is 5/5 able to make the priest's hero power cost zero for the rest of the game as long as the single copy condition of each card in the deck is met. The mage also has her own legendary that uses this particular condition, it is the Tattoo artist Solia who, for 7 mana, is 5/5 and makes a spell that is cast on the turn it enters the field cost zero (someone said Pyrosphere?) ; the sorcerer, who already extensively used this type of deck with monocopy cards in the ~Reno-Warlock~ typology, can add the legendary Krul the Freed which, for 9 mana, is 7/9 and puts all the demons present in your hand. As was the case for the thief, who reinforced the ~miracle~ deck, the priest heavily reinforces the propeium dragon deck as we already mentioned in the last special. Let's kiss the hands of Don Han'cho degli Sgherri Torvi The very first family to have been revealed, when we learned about the expansion, is that of the Sgherri Torvi who embraces (and we would even say kisses hands, given the reference of his clan leader to the Godfather) warriors, paladins and hunters. The main feature of the cards that side with the Grim Minions is that of increasing the attack and defense of the minions present in the player's hand through the battle cry or death rattle mechanics of the minions or with class spells: for the hunter, for example example, there's the new secret Hidden Chest which costs two mana and activates when your opponent plays a minion giving +2+2 to a random minion in your hand. The paladin, for only 1 mana, has the Weaponsmuggling spell that gives +1+1 to all minions in hand while the warrior with Stolen Goods has a spell that costs 2 mana and increases by 3 points in attack and defending a random minion with taunt. Of the tri-class cards, the one that retains the family characteristic is Notorious Trafficker, which is 2/4 at 3 mana capable of increasing the attack and defense of a random minion in your hand by 1, while the one with the mechanic of discovery is the Notorious Delator which for 2 mana is a 1/1. At the moment many experiments are underway with all three classes in order to give birth to a new deck archetype that takes full advantage of the characteristic of this family, however it is happening as naturally as with the Lotus and the Kabala. In these very early days only the paladin, thanks also to the legendary neutral Pinja the Flying Star, a 5-mana 2/4 stealth murloc capable of summoning two random murlocs from your deck when he destroys an opposing minion, is taking advantage of some cards that ~pump ~ the others: in the same deck we can find both the Notorious Receptor, which at 2 mana is 1/1 able to give +1+1 to all minions in hand, and the Rogue Scalescale which increases attack and defense only to a murloc . For the paladin, the legendary class is Bronin Trinciaflame, it costs 3 mana and is 2/2 with provocation and divine shield and heals you for an amount of points equal to the damage inflicted; the hunter has, however, the new Pugnitore beast which, for 5 mana, is 3/7 with a mechanic that resembles the ~overwhelm~ of Magic the Gathering and which therefore inflicts its damage not only on the minion but also on your opponent. If a road has not yet been defined for these two legendary ones, the same cannot be said for that of the warrior, Hobart Multivite, who at 2 mana is 2/2 and when he enters the battlefield he provides +1 in attack to all the weapons of the deck: This minion went straight into the new deck apirates, which is very strong in both standard and wild. The power of this deck is also increased by two new very strong neutral pirates, the Minute Buccaneer, which at 1 mana is 1/2 which takes +2 on attack if we equip a weapon, and by Sghigno the Pirate, which costs 1 mana and is 1/1 with charge but which enters the battlefield automatically from the deck as soon as a pirate is played: it is not so infrequent to see in the first turn Nostromo of N'Zoth (which gives you a 1/3 weapon), Sghigno the Pirate and , with the coin, also the 3/2 Minute Buccaneer! Hearhtstone, where are we going? Also for this latest expansion of 2016, the work done by the development team both from the point of view of the setting, the artwork and the animations of the cards is of the highest quality: a new game arena has also been added with 3 corners belonging to the three different families. Even the musical style is no less starting from the musical swing of the presentation video up to the jokes that characterize the entry into the game of the various minions. The mechanics of tri-class cards, especially those with which cards of other classes can be found, make the scenario of the different possibilities for changing the outcome of the game even more varied; Hearthstone is a game in which understanding what your opponent will play and predicting every possible variable makes the difference between winning and losing a fight, and being able to find cards of two other classes that are not the one you are playing makes this aspect even more complex. Really to be appreciated is the important and decisive step by Blizzard towards a reduction of the random factor in the cards which until now had been (actually continues to be a bit) the Achilles heel of this game according to many players who, sometimes, they can see a fight overturned by a factor ~coincidentally~ gone wrong. Obviously, the arena is updated by giving the sachets of The Slums of Meccania as a prize and, soon, we will find out which new cards will be part of the mandatory ~pick~. We end by saying that we have been clamoring for an internal tournament mode in the game for years now and Blizzard started, shortly before the release of the expansion, with a special brawl with fabulous prizes faced by many pro-players but with the cost of participation and from a level so high as to make it truly inaccessible to less performing players who, perhaps, were expecting something different: in any case, it is a start that bodes well for the future.", "date": "2016-12-06", "grade": "8.0"}
