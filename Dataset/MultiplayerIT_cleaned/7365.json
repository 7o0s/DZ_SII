The release of his ambitious sci-fi project is still a long way off, and actually, playing Joe Danger Infinity, one gets the feeling of being faced with a title created to fill this void and in the meantime put some money in the piggy bank. The similarities with the previous Joe Danger Touch are in fact enormous, and the same concept of infinity, suggested by the title, is not actually put into practice to offer an experience different from that of the previous episode. Yet, between small additions and a huge amount of levels, good Joe once again has a few cards to play before hanging up his helmet. Joe Danger as Buzz Lightyear: Soar to Infinity and Beyond! J-J-J-Joe Danger! At the announcement of Joe Danger Infinity, this time a very different approach was expected from the small English team. The developers themselves had anticipated a completely new and unedited experience, much more oriented towards the structure of endless runners than the more traditional Joe Danger Touch. In short, a very evident change of course was expected, which would have dropped the series into the same playing field as Jetpack Joyride and Canabalt. However, this was not the case: Infinity offers a decidedly classic type of progression, once again based on separate levels and areas to unlock. To make everything smoother and mitigate the feeling that the scenarios are divided into watertight compartments, the team led by Sean Murray has opted for two different tricks, the first of which consists in the self-advancement of the levels. If you do not press any key for a few seconds, the game goes independently to the next level, a good idea when you just want to play in a carefree way, but which cannot be deactivated and can occasionally cause some annoyance: it is not uncommon decide you want to change characters or repeat a previous level when it's too late to do so. The other little trick lies in the division of areas and levels, no longer in separate ~billboards~ as in Joe Danger Touch, but this time all arranged progressively on a long ruler that takes into account the centimeters travelled. Not kilometers or meters. Centimeters. The most successful novelty of Infinity is in fact in the setting in full Toy Story style: in this new episode Joe Danger and his friends are small toys that come to life once they come out of King Gumball, a large ball dispenser with a mustache and a big voice. As a result, each scenario is a scaled-down version of domestic locations, such as the kitchen, playroom, bedroom, and dining room. Jumping over a bowl of milk, dodging giant pencils or seeing your score on the screen of some kind of Game Boy (obviously called Hello Games Boy here) is funny and adds even more liveliness to each level, even if most of the elements with which interact are taken directly from Joe Danger Touch. Obstacles like spikes, mud or track-changing platforms are all present, in one form or another, and even if aliens to shoot down and helicopters to take out present an occasional diversion, the feeling of playing a full-bodied expansion remains strong. of the previous chapter. Once again you have to juggle the touchscreen to crouch, jump and perform tricks at the right moment, tapping the screen with the other hand to collect coins and medals on the seabed. More interesting is the addition of various unlockable vehicles: in addition to the classic motorcycle, in Infinity you can use airplanes, radio-controlled cars, crawlers and even a duck with wheels. In addition to giving a bonus in the amount of tokens collected, each vehicle has unique characteristics: for example, there is a rocket that is not slowed down by puddles, a car that bounces on water or an airplane that stays in the air longer , allowing you to pull off more stunts and skyrocket your multiplier. Finally, let's spend a few words on the microtransaction system, this time more present than Joe Danger Touch. Given that the game is well balanced and all the characters and vehicles are easily unlockable without resorting to any in-app purchase, the developers have tried to tickle the wallet of the less patient user through three different upgrades: invincibility, a magnet for attract tokens and a bonus to automatically perform stunts and get more points. It must be said that a (very) good player can still oobtain a score equal to or higher than those who use bonuses, but as usual it is never pleasant to see online rankings spoiled by the use of paid upgrades, not to mention the frequency with which the game tends to remember the existence of purchases in app.", "date": "2014-01-14", "grade": "7.8"}
