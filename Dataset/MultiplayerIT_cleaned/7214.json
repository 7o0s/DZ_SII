Off to a great start with two excellent products such as Icebreaker and Tiny Thief, this initiative by the Finnish team then suffered a setback with the anything but unforgettable Juice Cubes, which went basically unnoticed on the radar of the public and critics. Unfortunately for Rovio, this declining trend seems to continue even with the present Word Monsters... I eat the words Despite being packaged with all the necessary care, Word Monsters immediately denotes that it is not a champion of originality. The combination of monsters and cookies already highlighted by the introductory screen belongs to the collective imagination since the dawn of Sesame Street, while the gameplay is nothing more than a variant of the various Boggle, Spelltower and beautiful company that have always crowded the mobile title stores. The aim of the game is therefore to free the screen from all the letters, identifying the meaningful words that are hidden vertically or horizontally within this set. It is necessary to act quickly, given the presence of a time limit for each round and also considering how every second remaining at the end of the game is calculated as a further score. However, you must also pay attention to the order of the words that are eliminated from the grid: the constant risk is in fact that of finding yourself with a pile of incompatible letters and ending up prematurely closing your match with a reduced score. This is in fact the main variable that comes into play in the true beating heart of Word Monsters, i.e. the multiplayer games: it is possible to challenge random opponents or find friends via nickname or by connecting your Facebook profile, and a special mode is also available league in which you have to face a group of other human players aiming to win as many games as possible in order to rise in the rankings. It is also allowed to play alone in the appropriate training section, to aim for maximum performance in each of the available thematic categories (fruit, male names, kitchen items and so on) and thus be better prepared for multiplayer duels. Word Monsters is an honest puzzle game that lacks the personality needed to keep you entertained for a long time Being a free downloadable title, Word Monsters inevitably has aspects related to in-app purchases, which have the merit of not being too nagging but which in any case limit the experience to a certain extent for those who are not willing to spend money. As in many other freemium products, the medium of double virtual currency has been used here too, this time in the form of gold coins and biscuits: the former are earned (with very few units) at the end of each game round, while the latter are given very sparingly upon the achievement of certain objectives. Both serve to purchase content such as new categories of words or decorative elements with which to dress up the little monster that acts as an avatar, with the classic stumbling block consisting of the fact that the most attractive elements require the disbursement of large quantities of coins or a number of biscuits practically impossible to accumulate with simple game progression. The latter take on further importance considering how they also serve to obtain specific advantages during games against human opponents: by drawing on your own confectionary stocks, it is possible to stop time, obtain a hint or a combination of the two, and it is also allowed to repeat the round if you can't delete all boxes. It is evident that anyone who wants to invest in biscuits will have the road paved towards success at the expense of ~honest~ users, an aspect that seriously jeopardizes the duration of Word Monsters in the long run. However, this is not the only defect of the game: the detection of the inputs is not always satisfactory, the sound accompaniment is particularly repetitive and above all the categories with which to grapple are decidedly few and the words to compose end up being always the same.", "date": "2014-04-04", "grade": "6.5"}
