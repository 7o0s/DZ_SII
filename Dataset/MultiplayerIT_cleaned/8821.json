There is no shortage of customers, it's true, but the problems to be faced are different from those described in the most popular manuals. To say, it often happens that the patient on duty doesn't have previous traumas due to the difficult relationship he had with his mother, but because his mother exploded in front of him while they were having tea. Maybe every time he hears the word ~infusion~ he feels like killing himself or bursting into tears and you can't tell him anything other than: ~Your mother must have been a very good woman, at least that's what the mutant rats who ate her say .~ And no, the fact that post-nuclear women are particularly forthcoming doesn't help. It's true that the need to repopulate the planet has made them more uninhibited and the courtship ritual has reduced to a minimum, but you're the psychiatrist in a low-budget video game and the three-dimensional models of the girls look like something out of a PSOne game, So they don't pique you one bit... and you're also a little jealous of the asexual emo protagonists of the latest Final Fantasy, who are always flanked by attractive and almost naked three-dimensional female models. Moreover, it will seem strange, but you also do not have big topics for conversation with the fair sex. The girls spend their time telling you about sexual perversions and how many splendid handbag shops will have been destroyed on the surface, while you do nothing but dream of monstrous creatures devouring you, because mocking fate has also made you particularly sensitive to certain events that are about to manifest in the shelter. But the icing on the cake is being run by a crazed militarist who believes he can solve everything from teen acne to penis envy with one big bullet. You also tried to explain to him that characters like him always end up very badly, but there was nothing we could do. Tribute Afterfall: Insanity starts slow, very slow. The introduction lasts more than an hour, in which you acclimatize with the game world and have the first signs of what will soon happen to Dr. Albert Tokaj, the absolute protagonist. The control system turns out to be cumbersome right away and some design choices appear incomprehensible and counterproductive, especially when the actual action begins. We don't want to reveal too much about the plot, but we can certainly tell you that you will find yourself fighting against extremely aggressive zombie-like creatures, whose nature will be revealed to you during the adventure. The game is a third-person survival horror with no inventory to worry about. The Doctor can carry two firearms at once and can wield a melee weapon. It also has a PDA which is mainly used for orientation, in case you don't know exactly what to do to move forward. Exploration is very linear and there are no big forks to choose from, so you usually always know what to do. But we were talking about design issues. Afterfall: Insanity is the work of a group of fans who wanted to make an RPG, but finally decided to make an action game. We speak of ~fans~ not by chance, because their work is full of quotes and references to other famous titles, such as Silent Hill, F.E.A.R. o Eternal Darkness, of which the most important and famous mechanics have been aped. The problem is that often these seem to have been placed only as a tribute and have little impact on the game. For example, the psychological implications are also interesting, but they don't hold up until the end as happened in the first two Silent Hill and in the advanced stages we find ourselves dealing with a highly frayed plot compared to the interesting premises. Let's not talk about melee weapons. At the beginning we go in search of the most powerful instrument of death, trying different ones and trying to evaluate the differences. Unfortunately, it soon becomes clear that in Afterfall: Insanity an ax causes the same damage as a pipe. What's the point of scattering the levels with weapons that are different in appearance but identical in effect? Afraid of what? Another mechanic copied and treated superficially is fear. As was the case in Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem, even here the protagonist can be frightened by some events. But in Silicon Knight's masterpiece, fear had an important impact on the gameplay, altering it heavily, while here our psychiatrist loses only a little precision for a limited period of time. When you get used to it, i.e. at the second or third event, fear becomes almost routine and, apart from annoyance, the emotional impact becomes zero. It was better not to insert a feature of the gener if the result was supposed to be this. Just as it was better not to insert the interactive movie events, or Quick Time Event, if you prefer. The problem is only one: they are very buggy. Often the keys to press disappear from the screen, resulting in certain death. Furthermore, in the case of the first QTE, the failure can corrupt the save, forcing you to restart the game from the beginning and giving rise to the fear that the same could happen also in subsequent events (fortunately it seems not). Apart from the jokes about some female models, graphically Afterfall: Insanity is not bad, even if there are some big angularities, especially in the special effects, probably due to the inexperience of the development team. To be noticed in the negative are above all the filmed sequences, which present an often puerile direction and evident focus problems, as well as animations that are not quite at their best (some characters have deformed and disproportionate limbs compared to the body). Very bad, however, is the blur effect when running, which makes the scenario practically unreadable.", "date": "2012-01-09", "grade": "4.8"}
