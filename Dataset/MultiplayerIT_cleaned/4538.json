In the great shadow cast by the game of Aonuma and his companions, however, the small indie of SFB Games has been able to carve out an important space for itself, becoming a sort of cult in the increasingly vast audience of the Nintendo console. In fact, several elements fit together perfectly, playing to his advantage: the audio-visual characterization is simply perfect and has built a specific and well-recognizable identity for the game, which has remained particularly visible among many digital indies. The concept itself is original and fun, but even more it is perfectly built on the multiplayer potential of the Switch, relying above all on the two-player cooperative action with split screen, a perfect situation for use on the Nintendo console by exploiting the two detached Joy-Con . All this has contributed to the success of Snipperclips even beyond a defect unanimously recognized by all those who also greatly appreciated it: a rather skimpy duration, which made the game a little too weak in terms of longevity. The developers must have kept this weak point in their creation in mind and immediately got to work, coming to propose a solution now, eight months after the original launch. So here's Snipperclips Plus: Let's Cut It Off! An enhanced version that makes SFB Games' idea reach that completeness that was missing in the initial edition, thus remedying that single negative aspect that had been detected at the time of launch with a nice injection of additional content. Almost a new game In case you don't already know it, for the basic features of Snipperclips we refer you to the Review of the original version that we published at the time of the launch, since the basic structure is obviously the same. In practice, it is a particular puzzle game in which we find ourselves controlling two nice paper figures within fixed screens, in which we must obtain some result that has to do with the characteristics of the scenario. The mechanics is based on the possibility of cutting the two figures in various ways, superimposing them on each other and detaching parts from the original shape in order to shape them as desired to achieve different purposes. Everything is based on the coordinated action of the two characters (or on competition, if this method is adopted), so the best way to deal with it is two-player multiplayer; this can only be done locally, which could represent an obstacle even if one realizes well how the physical presence of the two players in the same space is in fact a natural element for this game. Snipperclips Plus is sold as a new edition of the game for 29.99 euros in physical version, including the original and new contents in a single solution, or as additional DLC for those who already own the original at the price of 9.90 EUR. This is a fair solution, considering that the Plus expansion introduces 30 new levels divided into two new settings which add to the 45 in the three existing worlds, thus substantially expanding the original offer. The game thus reaches a much more than complete form, considering that the initial endowment was not exactly poor anyway, thus becoming a truly rich puzzle game with practically no weak points, beyond the intrinsic need to have to play it in multiplayer for be able to fully appreciate it. The additions The two added worlds are Cosmic Comics and Toybox Tools, one characterized by a setting close to comics and the other focused on toys, so these are two additions of a certain thickness to the original equipment. As far as the game solutions are concerned, there is obviously a certain recycling of ideas as already seen in the basic version, because it would have been quite difficult to propose a new idea for each single level, however the basic characteristic of Snipperclips remains, i.e. the freedom interpreting problems and their solutions. The beauty of the game is that it does not offer any precise indications on what to do and how to do it, although the aim is always quite clear, so everything is left in the hands of the player, who can reach the solution in various ways. There is no unique solution to the puzzles, and although there is usually one path that may be preferable to others, the funny thing is that it can still be solvedsolve the problem even by adopting unconventional methods, often leading us to situations that make us sneer. In addition to the two new scenarios, there are however several unpublished situations in the thirty additional levels, such as firing cannons, dangerous liquids that must be transported with improvised ~containers~, toys to be moved through levers and various mechanisms and other solutions that greatly enrich the already vast repertoire of actions and solutions. The three new competitive Blitz modes must also be added to the levels of the standard mode which make this solution more convincing, although it remains an alternative of lesser importance compared to the ~Campaign~: we therefore find Territory which requires us to color parts of the scenario with its own color, Roundup focused on the capture of insects and Keepaway in which we have to transport balloons unharmed at the expense of jets of water (and obviously the disturbing action of the opponent). The Stamp mode closes the review of the new features, which allows you to make drawings based on the shapes of the creatures in a cooperative way and the possibility of tackling the levels with increased difficulty in the mode that proposes the shape of the ~random~ bodies.", "date": "2017-11-21", "grade": "8.6"}
