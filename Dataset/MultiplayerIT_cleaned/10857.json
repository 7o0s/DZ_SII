{"name": "Deadly Creatures - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/deadly-creatures-recensione.html", "text": "Every once in a while, a breath of fresh air is needed. In general, in a video game we have always played hypertrophic and armored soldiers, busty and lethal damsels, or funny little puppets straight out of a cartoon. Thq had an original and captivating idea: to create a very realistic ~mini-megaworld~ in which scorpions, tarantulas, snakes, wasps and rats would fight! Lots of furry paws... Deadly Creatures has been one of the most hopeful Wii exclusives ever since its launch. A completely new title, based on the hardware of the console, treated from a narrative and technical point of view, can only appeal to those who don't get along very well with scales and musical instruments. Deadly Creatures turns out to be a very adult title, based heavily on the atmosphere, but which contrasts an innovative and ingenious idea with fairly canonical playful bases. It is in fact a scrolling fighting game with timid exploratory elements in which you alternately control a tarantula or a scorpion. The spider has greater mobility, jumps, runs slightly faster, can hang on webs and poison opponents. The scorpion, on the other hand, is slower and more massive, strong in fights, can dig and cut small tufts of grass. This is enough to connote quite differently the way of tackling the levels and experiencing the small big worlds created. These are all very detailed and realistic - if somewhat cartoonish at times - representations of real settings. Everything has been tried to make the desert less monotonous and boring... Between dark caverns, coffins, bramble bushes, small rubbish dumps, cavity walls, wells and entire rooms, the environments are the real protagonists of the game. Of course everything is life size -even if you are a bit cheated on the scale at times- and the effect is what you once felt when playing ~Micromachine~. Discovering that the enormous and ruthless world that one has just faced is in fact nothing more than a small room of a few square meters is a particular and very pleasant sensation. Most of the ten levels are rather linear and are scattered in them, in more or less complex points to reach - hundreds of larvae to collect and some grasshoppers to search for. Larvae give access to nice galleries of sketches while grasshoppers allow you to upgrade various attacks. Just when you feel the limitation of this structure a little, you find yourself in the last complex and difficult levels, set in decidedly more open places and more devoted to freedom of exploration. Claws and stingers... Another very pleasant aspect is linked to the mobility of the protagonist insects. As you well know, these creatures can also walk on walls and even - in the case of spiders - on the ceiling. Everything is designed to make the most of this feature, with entire sections upside down or hung on a vertical wall. To remedy the obvious disorientation, a very useful arrow has been inserted which indicates the direction at any time by simply pressing a key. Even if it may seem like an excessive simplification, it turns out to be decidedly indispensable especially in some situations where there are continuous, but pleasant, changes of perspective and direction. All these settings are obviously not empty! In addition to some minimal environmental puzzles, they are infested with dozens of adverse creatures. The bestiary to deal with is quite large, ranging from lizards to spiders passing through frogs and praying mantises. What should be the strong point of the game and which instead turns out to be its greatest weakness enters the field here: the combat system. While trying to offer many moves, based both on keystrokes and on combos and various movements of the remote control and nunchuk, unfortunately they are unable to get away from the most sinister beating of keys and random shaking. Not that they aren't fun, but a greater difference in the behavior of enemies and the request for different tactics and moves to deal with them would have been very welcome. So they are indeed a good diversion to explore the levels, but they are a bit flat and repetitive, with just the frogs and wasps offering some hint of diversity in being faced. And it's a bit of a shame because the moves on offer are varied and well cared for, but unfortunately most of the time to bring down a mouse like a praying mantis just furiously press ~A~ and shake the pad. To save the situation, however, there are some nice QTEs who face each other by shaking the commands in various ways or by pressing the right keys required. Very well done both in combat and when they appear in excited escape sections; Everything is finemuch more lethal enemies such as a rattlesnake, an iguana or even man also appear. Obviously these cannot be defeated - one is always poor insects! - but they can be tackled with sequences that may have already been seen, but are never trivial and very pleasant. Webs and larvae... Technically we are faced with an excellent job, the settings are represented very well with nice lighting effects. The atmosphere is rendered excellently thanks to a good number of details, dark colors, transparency effects, environmental depth and panoramic points. The insects are also very well animated and have great polygonal models. Leave the sound sector a bit perplexed. The music is very beautiful, ambient and strongly devoted to creating tension, but it's always the same... The effects, on the other hand, are a bit trivial and unrelated to the world of insects. The speech and all the accompanying elements are very well done. Spoke? Yes, in the English version the game is voiced by a well-known actor, here instead the voices are anonymous but still positive. But who talks in an insect game? There is a feeble history of little big cruelties of man both towards himself and towards nature; of this story we will in principle only be indirect and occasional spectators and finally the architects directly... Comment Deadly Creatures is an excellent title, well edited and well conceived. There are two major defects that can be attributed to him and which keep him away from higher grades and goals. The first is to be found in a creation that is too ~mannered~ and linked to certain standards and stereotypes in a decidedly unconventional context. The second is a certain flatness of the combat system as already reported in the review text. Apart from these two aspects, the rest is so well done and pleasant that it is difficult not to recommend it and not give it a good rating. We must also reward the effort to offer something new and original... exploiting the world of insects in this way was truly a brilliant idea.Pro Excellent levels Neat and well done The idea of using insects is brilliant Against The control system is a bit flat Nice but repetitive music Too ~fashionable~", "date": "2009-02-24", "grade": null}
