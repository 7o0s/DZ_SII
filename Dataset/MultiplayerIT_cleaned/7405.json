{"name": "Peggle 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/126557-peggle-2-puzzle-gaming-next-gen.html", "text": "Arrived shortly after the launch of Xbox One, Peggle 2 is a decidedly atypical time exclusive for a home console that has to flex its muscles in the face of a competition that is, on paper, stronger. Not that this consideration can lead us to condemn a title simply due to its nature, and in any case we must consider that in recent years puzzle games have returned to roar and are also important for console users who have changed, expanded and it is diverse. It follows that a title of this kind, moreover a time exclusive, can have its importance in supporting the launch of a console and enriching its line-up, especially if it is part of a highly successful brand. We measured ourselves with Peggle 2, the first next-gen puzzle game Xbox One goals Despite the low price and limited offer, Peggle 2 offers the player 1000 points to be earned by completing 28 objectives. Most of these are cumulative in nature, and the skill-related ones are not difficult to unlock, and are obtained by completing thematic blocks of maps or accumulating up to 180 optional achievements. Unicorns, ghosts and messy yetis Peggle 2's formula is the same as Peggle's and is inspired by the old mechanical puzzles based on dropping a ball into a board full of obstacles. Some of these, or the orange ones, must be eliminated or transformed and to do this the player has ten balls available which are fired, one at a time, with an adjustable cannon located at the top of the screen. The latter is the only element of the title controlled directly by the player and this means that luck plays a big role in the PopCap title although the initial direction of the shot, combined with the use of specific powers related to wacky characters, has a high importance. Importance that is magnified in the use of scoring, which is relevant to the style and obstacles not to be eliminated but whose color indicates that by hitting them it is possible to obtain bonuses in calculating points. In addition, several screens feature bricks that can be used to make extreme shots and include moving elements, such as baskets to hit, which require an ability to calculate shots and rebounds worthy of an NBA basketball player. But, as we have anticipated, some feats are made easier by the special rolls guaranteed by the masters who guide us in the game. The unicorn, as in the first chapter, shows us the trajectory of the ball while the ghost girl can make all the blue obstacles disappear for two rounds, i.e. the neutral ones that merely slow down the ball. The voluminous and drunken troll, capable of transforming the ball into a destructive boulder, is less delicate, which contrasts with a yeti who is much more delicate in spirit although horribly awkward and characterized by a vulgar detail almost bordering on Vanzin. And it is precisely this last detail that is one of the most representative of the marked change from the bucolic lightheartedness of the first chapter. An element that has turned into something more caciarone through a series of lively and colorful skits, but not particularly inspired, which have the masters of Peggle 2 as protagonists. But let's go back to the gameplay, a decidedly predominant element in a title of this genre. Peggle 2 is once again based on ~boards~ made up exclusively of removable obstacles and this means that the sixty maps, apparently similar to each other, are characterized by extremely varied and always intuitive gameplay. Furthermore, some frameworks are more complex to deal with than those of the first chapter and this further reduces the random component inherent in the game's mechanics. The result is an enjoyable and satisfying title, enriched by new symphonies and new visual effects, even if too similar to its predecessor and unable to make that evolutionary leap necessary to make sense of a sequel which, among other things, took the field in combination with a next gen console. Instead, the only peculiar thing that comes from the union between Xbox One and Peggle 2 is the control via Kinect which plays a decidedly marginal role, making aiming difficult and forcing the player to launch a voice command to start the ball. A control system that is too cumbersome for a puzzle that thrives on immediacy even if it is certainly not to be considered as a negative element since it is one more option that the player can safely overlook.", "date": "2013-12-13", "grade": "7.5"}
