However, their irrepressible passion for fantasy stories and paper role-playing games is not surprising, since it is enough to enter any comic book store in the middle of a Dungeons & Dragons or Magic tournament to find yourself in front of dozens of similar figures. However, it is precisely this wonderful fanaticism that has positively influenced their new Rimelands: Hammer of Thor. It's a fascinating turn-based RPG with an isometric view and made in part with the help of the guys from Crescent Moon, a team that has already made itself known on the App Store thanks to the excellent Ravensword. Taking a look at the images accompanying the article, one may have the wrong impression of being faced with a simple Diablo clone, when Rimelands can count on original combat mechanics and an intriguing character growth system. Instead of recycling the classic fantasy setting, with elves, dwarves and ogres, the developers have also decided to set the game in a slightly steampunk-derived universe, mixing gothic structures and advanced technological elements, traditional white weapons and bizarre guns. Gambling fights However, those who expect a well-finished and engaging plot should be on guard: in contrast with the genre to which it belongs, Rimelands overshadows the story and its narration, which takes place through very short dialogues and very uninspired missions. Most of the time it will be about recovering a magical artifact or eliminating groups of rioters, while the whole plot is based on a conflict that broke out between the faction of humans and that of fairies. Even the missions to be tackled are unexpectedly linear, and the small number of side quests does not allow you to explore the game world to your liking or to get away from the main events for a while. But, if they are decidedly scarce as Dungeon Masters, the two developers of Dicework Games seem to have much clearer ideas when it comes to game mechanics. Although completely invisible, an enormous grid transforms each scenario into a sort of huge chessboard, in which both the player and the enemies move from square to square during the fights: at each turn, you can decide whether to move, attack the opponent or use a special ability among those previously learned, after which, in the case of the last two options, the actual success is resolved through a dice roll by both sides. On the faces are depicted skulls, which indicate successful hits, shields, which allow you to defend yourself from each skull, and crosses, which have no effect; in essence, if the number of skulls exceeds the opponent's shields, the hit has been successful, and the wider the discard, the more damage is caused. In the event of a poor roll, both in attack and defense, the player can decide to sacrifice a point of Mana and reroll the worst dice. It is an extreme simplification, which partly takes its cue and partly mixes the rules of games such as D&D, Warhammer and RisiKo!, replicating the charm of the mechanics but also being easily accessible to newbies, often cut off from excessive complexity. Equally interesting is the growth system of your alter-ego: every time you level up you can decide which skill to learn among those present in the three trees available. Unsurprisingly, the barbarian's techniques are based on hand-to-hand combat, the assassin's on ambushes and ranged attacks, while the shaman's on spells and curses. However, it is not possible to learn them all, since the level limit is quite low and, above all, the enemies will no longer reappear after being defeated; this challenges the player to take on each enemy and specialize in a single skill tree. Fortunately, although grinding is completely impossible, the level of difficulty is increasing but well balanced and a good number of healing potions should ensure victory even in the most difficult battles. Rimelands then enjoys a really good technical realization, even if the same cannot be said for the design of the scenarios, which alternate environments rather inspired by dungeons that are nothing short of bare and monotonous. Closing note for some interesting but clearly underdeveloped ideas, such as the possibility of going to a shopkeeper to dismantle your weapons and build new and more powerful ones with the pieces obtained; the game does nothing to push to utiluse this function, and indeed the advantages obtained are often imperceptible.
