After the good impact of the previous expansions, or the beautiful Ardennes Assault with a completely new single player campaign and the multiplayer one The Western Front Armies, the Canadian software house recently purchased by Sega following the fall of THQ has decided to put the proverbial dots on the i with a new stand alone package, dedicated to one of the ~toughest~ armies in history and in the first chapter of the saga. We are talking about the British armed forces coordinated by the charismatic Winston Churchill, the only ones capable of resisting the Axis invasion and among the main protagonists of the famous Normandy landings, the turning point of the Second World War. Like The Western Front Armies, British Forces is an expansion designed for multiplayer, which in addition to adding the army to his majesty's orders integrates eight new maps and some small technical improvements. Eight new maps and the mighty British Army in the British Forces expansion for Company of Heroes 2 Two for the price of one If there is a strategic maneuver in which the English soldiers managed to distinguish themselves during the conflict, it was the ability to take refuge on the conquered outposts and not to be driven back by the enemy, with a legendary tenacity and courage recorded in the stories of that terrible historic moment. This ability to cushion blows and repel opponents was successfully translated into the first Company of Heroes, where the British Army was the hardest force to root out, drive back and ultimately annihilate. Remaining in the same historically accurate perspective, but adding a dutiful and greater balance, the British Forces of the Company of Heroes 2 expansion of the same name always have a natural propensity for defense, nevertheless Relic Entertainment has imagined the technological tree of the units with a dual development, well explained by the ~hammer and anvil~ theory constantly used in promotion. If on the one hand it is in fact always possible to focus on a robust defensive approach capable of rivaling the German one (anvil), on the other we find specializations in favor of troop mobility and above all commanders capable of subverting the outcome of the battle thanks to devastating ranged attacks (hammer), supported by reconnaissance vehicles, fighter-bombers and heavy artillery. In a nutshell, it is possible to shape the British forces according to two distinct tracks, a strategic malleability that can make the difference in the hands of more experienced players. The new units are fifteen in all and range from the versatile basic infantry, capable of defending itself very well even from enemy elite troops, up to the fearsome tanks such as the Sherman Firefly, the Cromwell and the Churchill, without forgetting the transport glider RAF Airspeed Horsa tactician and the Hawker Typhoon fighter-bomber, used with success above all during the Normandy landings. Beyond the basic soldiers, who can be equipped with grenades and gammon bombs (capable of temporarily immobilizing an enemy tank), distribute medicines and even coordinate the attack of the 25-pound howitzers (howitzers-cannons) placed in the headquarters , among the most effective we find the invaluable Royal Engineers, whose multiple functions range from repairing vehicles and structures to building defensive systems, without forgetting the possibility of destroying obstacles with small explosive charges. There is no shortage of commandos oriented towards stealth ambushes thanks to smoke grenades and powerful demolition charges, the ~tank destroyer~ infantry department equipped with Boys rifles and HEAT grenades, the sniper equipped with the same rifle capable of destroying light vehicles, a couple of units armed with self-propelled guns (40mm Bofors QF and QF 17 AT Gun) and the Airlanding Officer, who offers tactical air support to the infantry and is particularly effective in the ~hammer~ strategy. The versatility of the human personnel is also reflected in that of the vehicles, divided into light, medium and heavy. Among the least armored we find the AEC MK III, a small and fast armored car equipped with a dangerous 75mm cannon, the Universal Carrier dedicated to the rapid transport of infantry on the battlefield, theself-propelled artillery vehicle ~Sexton~ with a 25-pound howitzer and the small tank Valentine, well known by World of Tanks fans and which in the title Relic can coordinate the barrage of the Sextons and enable the so-called ~Emergency War Speed ~. Among the medium armored tanks we find the A34 Comet from which it is possible to launch fragmentation grenades and the aforementioned Cromwell and Sherman Firefly, the latter which can be equipped with a devastating battery of RP-3 rockets, useful on vehicles and to create havoc between entrenched enemy infantry. The centerpiece of the British army is naturally represented by the Churchill heavy tank, which can be developed in three variants: the MKIV is the most versatile thanks to the 75mm cannon and the possibility of launching smoke grenades and grenades; the AVRE is equipped with a powerful 290mm mortar capable of knocking out any obstacle, while the infamous Crocodile has a terrifying flamethrower that is particularly useful against infantry. As for the so-called commanders, a key element in the gameplay of Company of Heroes 2, among the most interesting we certainly find the Special Weapons Regiment, which can deploy tank destroyer infantry, send supply half-tracks and launch grazing attacks with Typhoons, as well what powerful artillery shots concentrated on the target indicated by the player. The Royal Artillery Regiment is effective for reconnaissance and barrage purposes, while the Royal Engineers Regiment is primarily designed for vehicle support, especially the ability to automatically repair damaged vehicles. The Vanguard Operation Regiment closes the lot of the best, balancing between the hammer and the anvil strategy: with this commander you can initiate an attack with Typhoon fighter-bombers and deploy an advanced headquarters with gliders, useful for reinforcements and the acquisition of additional resources. Overall a great variety able to satisfy both the history buff and the savvy RTS player. Theater of War In British Forces we find not only the British army but also eight new maps, set in the symbolic places of the progress made by the forces across the Channel after the Normandy landings. Checkpoint Arnhem, designed for two players, is located in the Dutch city of the same name which was the scene of one of the most famous operations of the Second World War, namely Market Garden. More extensive are the Gelsenkirchen refinery and the beautiful Heidelberg Pass, with the German city cut in two by the Neckar River (a tributary of the Rhine) surmounted by three bridges, the crucial sectors to be conquered in order to crush the enemy in its headquarters. Among the largest for six to eight players are the Port of Hamburg, with the three strategic points located in the vertical line in the center of the map, the Assault of Lorch and the Essen steel mill. Also fascinating are Dusserdolf, where the city was totally destroyed by Allied bombing, and Al di l del Reno, full of defensive positions on the river bank, to be conquered before the enemy to have a significant tactical advantage. From a technical point of view, the contents of British Forces do not differ from the excellent quality of the other Relic works, however there is room for an interesting innovation relating to the animations, given that the motion capture for the basic movements has been renewed, translated in all factions. However, it remains a little unpleasant to observe the ~leap~ that the soldiers make when they are killed. As far as the audio sector is concerned, a good job has been done above all for the dubbing of the units, given that the British army was and is characterized by different accents and behaviors based on the country of origin and the social class of the soldiers. It goes without saying that any faction balancing problems can only arise after intensive tests carried out by the entire community of enthusiasts, however at the moment we have not identified any critical issues and British Forces represents an excellent package to expand the experience of the good historical RTS.", "date": "2015-08-24", "grade": "8.0"}
