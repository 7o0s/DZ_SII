{"name": "War of the Monsters", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/war-of-the-monsters.html", "text": "How to raze a city to the ground and live happily War of the Monsters immerses you in a typical atmosphere of those old UFO B-movies that were so fashionable in the 50s, with particular attention to the film ~War of the Worlds~, recognizable right from the introductory film. Your first game of WotM is about as chaotic as you can imagine. The roster of 10 fighters (8 + 2 secret) is very varied and includes, among others, a Mazinger-style robot, a kind of King Kong and a giant grasshopper. Once you have chosen your alter ego, you will find yourself in the first ~arena~, a city of considerable size. You will immediately be attacked by the beast on duty who, not having much time to waste with you, will pull you by the neck, punch and kick you and throw you with such power that you will destroy all the buildings that are in your trajectory, showing an interactivity with the environment that surrounds us that is almost unbelievable. At first glance, the buildings will see the facades crumbled, exposing the load-bearing structures and the various floors. As they take more damage they will begin to shed pieces until they collapse in on themselves or topple to one side, giving you the ability to crush any opponent who inadvertently stands beneath them. The interaction continues with roads, bridges and means of transport that can be taken, used as a weapon and thrown at the enemy, thus causing him variable damage depending on whether it is a simple car or a tanker. How not to mention the light poles or beams, which once thrown at the enemy will stick into his body, leaving him defenseless for a short period of time against any attack. Relegation Corner: King of the Monsters 2 Let's spend a few words for what can be considered the inspirer of the reviewed title. KotM 2 is a '91 fighting game for Neo Geo, where in the role of 3 gigantic monsters you have to face monsters and military forces up to the end-of-level boss, which can be faced as in a normal fighting game. The levels are inspired by the most famous cities in the world and are all quite short, however free scrolling allows you to go through them far and wide. During your adventure you can use kicks or punches or grab the buildings (or anything of equal size) and throw them at the enemy. By destroying buildings, monsters and planes on the screen you will get power ups of various kinds, from the bomb to the special move up to the inevitable additional life. The difficulty of the title remains decidedly low until it is time to face the end-of-level boss, which always proves to be difficult enough to defeat, above all because your energy bar runs out quickly. Like all titles for this machine (especially the first ones), KotM 2 suffers from poor longevity in the face of excellent graphics, this is because the games on this machine were designed for the arcade market and therefore had to charm the player to then be ~ consumed~ quickly. For the record, the cartridge occupied 78 MegaBits. It's all under control! The attack system involves the use of combos based on punches or kicks or the attack from a distance, variable in intensity and power depending on the character used. The number of combos is quite low but additional moves are available, which can be performed using the single key-stick combination. The low number of total moves, in addition to making the attacks of the various characters quite similar to each other, risks making the fights repetitive in the long run. Fortunately, it is the same game mechanic that encourages variety of action with the alternating use of ranged attacks, combos and throwing objects. Using the L1 + R1 keys you can take advantage of a practical lock-on, especially useful if you have to hurl a car or a beam at the enemy. The special attack, on the other hand, is limited to the use of red globes scattered around the arena: once positioned in their vicinity, it is possible to perform a super move which can be short or long range, depending on the eventuality. Besides the red globes, there are two other types of globes, green and blue. The former increase energy, while the latter fill a second bar positioned vertically below the first. This runs out as you attack, especially if you use the ranged attack, until once completely exhausted you can no longer attack. It will often happen that during the fight you will have to interrupt your intentions of annihilation to collect more orbs poshisses, making them easy targets for opponents as a result. Every few levels you will be asked to face a mega-boss, which always proves to be difficult enough to defeat, also because initially you will struggle to understand the exact point where this must be hit to be destroyed. After each fight you will get points that you will need to unlock characters, secret arenas, alternative costumes and mini-games. The excellent control system will never give you the impression that your alter-ego is too clumsy, even if in truth certain characters are too slow in some maneuvers, but in general you will be free to fly between a building and the other popping spokes left and right. During the first few games you will have the impression of being at the mercy of your opponents who will often make you bounce here and there without you having the opportunity to react effectively. The initial problem is accentuated by the fact that since there is no practice mode you will have very little time to try the various moves, given that the opponents tend to attack without leaving you a moment to breathe. A frequent element however is the one that sees the enemies ganging up on you, which can be quite annoying during the adventure mode as it makes some missions excessively demanding. You are better than uan War of the Monsters shows its side in the various single player modes. The additional modes are quite trivial and structured in a questionable way, as well as being all in all similar. What is the point, for example, of a free-for-all mode if it is not possible to defeat the enemies until you are the only one in the arena? The main mode itself is not at all varied as whichever character you choose the fights will always follow the same usual sequence. Fortunately, the two-player mode compensates for the lack of variety in the single-player modes. Playing in two in the various arenas proves to be a very enjoyable experience, both in one-on-one battles, but above all in the free-for-all mode, in which the battles will thus turn into capcomian duels, between teasing and insults of all kinds . In case the players are too far away, the screen splits in two via split-screen and then unifies when the two get close again. Finally, a mention for the mini-games, which although not of a very high caliber, prove to be a pleasant diversion. Of course, if it had been possible to play in 4 at the same time, the fun would have risen to even higher levels, but WotM is just fine as it stands. The Monster Factory In the technical field WotM reserves some pleasant surprises. Upon careful analysis, the polygonal models of the arenas do not denote who knows what polygonal complexity, but all in all it is not that we can expect more than this taking into account the amount of objects represented on the screen. The buildings crumble and interact with the player which is a pleasure, all without any kind of slowdown, even in the presence of 4 characters at the same time. The arenas vary in size, some representing vast cities, while others merely representing a flying saucer or a nuclear power plant. The characters are beautifully crafted and animated, and the textures are well made. On the other hand, nothing relevant as regards the sound sector, which is limited to a few 50s-style music and all in all well-made effects. Comment Given the game mechanics, War of the Monsters could be compared to Godzilla Melee for GameCube, or at most to PowerStone2 for Dreamcast, even if to tell the truth the very definition of fighting game is a bit tight for it. WotM represents a title that probably wins, but fails entirely to convince. Unfortunately, the game turns out to be not very varied in the single player modes, all too similar to each other. The same game mechanics of the single player mode can get boring after a while, since repeating the same sequence of fights every time, just to unlock a few more characters or arenas, can make even the most tenacious of players lose their desire , a problem also accentuated by the lack of variety of moves between one fighter and another. Fortunately there is a doubles mode to largely compensate for the shortcomings of the singles game. Played in two WotM becomes a devastating experience (in every sense), capable of keeping you glued to the screen for a long time. With a higher availability of moves, a greater variety in the various one-player modes, and maybe, with a nice option for 4 players, WotM would have had no difficulty in gaining much more enthusiastic opinions, but even as it is the title still manages to make a good impression. Pros: Cities that can be devastated far and wide Graphic engine valid and without any hesitation Lots of fun in doubles Cons: Few moves available Main mode rather repetitive The other single player modes are not very varied and poorly structured How many of you have never dreamed of being as tall as a building and going around razing entire cities to the ground? How do you say? Nobody? Well, perhaps in reality such an idea would be considered rather bizarre, fortunately the world of video games can afford this and more. Already in the days of the old Rampage it was possible to step into the shoes of three gigantic monsters and wander around the cities with the aim of destroying as many buildings as possible, in the meantime avoiding being knocked down by army troops. In more recent times some of you may remember the King of the Monsters series for NeoGeo, where huge beings fought each other in cities that could be razed to the ground, while buildings, towers or vehicles could be used as a weapon against the opponent. At Incog Inc. they must have played a lot of two titles in the series because War of the Monsters after all is a more or less faithful re-proposition, with the necessary adaptations that a 128-bit console title entails.", "date": "2003-05-20", "grade": null}
