{"name": "Zombie Army 4: Dead War", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/zombie-army-4-dead-war-recensione.html", "text": "The review of Zombie Army 4: Dead War takes us back to the disturbing scenario painted by Rebellion in the first three chapters of the series: close to defeat, Adolf Hitler has decided to exploit the knowledge of the occult acquired by the Reich to bring the dead back to life and build an invincible army, transforming himself into a demonic creature. Defeated the Fuhrer, unfortunately the war has not stopped: the hordes of zombies have invaded the whole of Europe and only Italy has not yet been conquered; so that's exactly where we'll head, in the role of the indefatigable sniper Karl Fairburne or in those of one of his fellow venturers, facing the nine chapters of the campaign (each divided into four missions) solo or in cooperative for a maximum of four participants. Characters, upgrades and news Zombie Army 4: Dead War is the latest episode of a franchise born as a spin-off of Sniper Elite, set precisely in an alternate reality in which the Second World War has produced ... apocalyptic consequences. point from Rebellion for the first three chapters has never gone off certain tracks, catapulting us into very linear levels, full of living dead to be eliminated using an equipment consisting of a sniper rifle, a shotgun or a machine gun, a pistol and from different types of explosives. The different nature of the experience compared to the mother series translates into mechanics more oriented to pure third person shooters than to precision shooters, although sniping zombies from a distance proves to be a necessary practice in order not to run out of other cartridges too quickly, fundamental when we find ourselves going through very crowded and insidious scenarios, with waves of enemies that literally arrive from all sides and have various peculiar types. Well, in this latest adventure some interesting innovations have finally been introduced which break the degree of repetitiveness of the action, adding a little depth, even strategic, to a gunplay that has never been so solid and well balanced, with the most evident improvements made in the clashes from the short distance, previously often problematic. In the first place, the four characters available are not simple different skins, however equipped with unlockable clothes, gestures and aesthetic accessories, but boast truly unique characteristics: Karl is the balanced choice, but it is possible to opt for faster and more elusive or more powerful fighters , especially in melees. In the lower part of the screen there are also three indicators that fill up as we carry out eliminations: the one on the left regulates the possibility of performing a powerful melee shot that defeats nearby enemies, and which can be selected from various alternatives; the one on the right allows you to kill any opponent with a knife, which gives us back some health (it is possible to carry a single medkit and finding others around is not easy, so the maneuver often becomes very important); and finally the one in the center activates the special ability of each weapon by acting on the right back button: the sniper rifle launches an explosive shot that opens a gap between the enemy ranks, the shotgun slows down time allowing us to hit a large number of targets within moments, the pistol quotes Red Dead Redemption's Dead Eye by locking onto several targets and landing powerful headshots. That's not all: a progression system and the collection of certain kits allows us, in the protected rooms at the end of each level, to get on the workbench to modify weapons and buy upgrades which translate into faster reload times, higher power, boosted modifiers (see electric or explosive appendages found around the stages), boosted optical zoom for the sniper rifle, increased dispersion for the shotgun, and so on. Playing at normal level, the rank of challenge turns out to be challenging but perfectly balanced in relation to the upgrades, which never create disproportionate advantages and indeed keep us afloat as the clash becomes more bitter. The only drawback: interactions with objects are often problematic, specifically opening the crates and collecting grenades or replacing those in our possession proves to be a cumbersome and imprecise process, as well as trampling enemies on the ground. Will an update fix things? Structure and enemies The important novelties in terms of gameplay are joined by others concerning the structure of the levels, once again designed in watertight but fairly large compartments and capable of proposing relatively varied situations,in which the obligation to fully explore the locations leads us to take considerable risks, given the enormous amount of wandering zombies and the frequent waves.The latter often arise as the final event of a mission, gradually introducing new types of unpublished enemies and bosses: if on the one hand figures like the hateful snipers who jump from one roof to another return, in Zombie Army 4: Dead War there are Nazi generals who summon undead, dark officers capable of killing us with their own projections, armored giants to be ~dismantled~ before being able to place a bullet in the forehead, enemies with shields throwing grenades, kamikazes ready to explode, elusive and insidious creepers, beasts armed with chainsaws running towards us, pathetic blind creatures that recognize noises and furiously charge us, soldiers equipped with flamethrowers or heavy machine guns, and so on. In short, a substantial work of enrichment of the bestiary has been done, inflating some mechanics (the obligation to find objects to open doors is a constant) but in the end reaching a balance that is all in all convincing for what remains of a third person shooter: if you like shoot, here you will do it in abundance, multiplying the cooperative fun. We tried some missions together with other players and the potential is all there: the opponents increase, the challenge becomes really pressing and collaborating becomes indispensable in order to survive. The special abilities have been rebalanced accordingly: it is not possible to slow down time, so it is the character's movements that are speeded up in certain situations. Horde Mode and Special Events In addition to the campaign, Zombie Army 4: Dead War also includes two extra modes, Horde and Special Events. If the latter, renewed from week to week, are nothing more than reinterpretations of the main missions, set in the same locations, the Horde fields four unpublished stages and an action that is nothing short of frenetic, clearly to be enjoyed in a cooperative. We tested it with some colleagues from the international press, discovering that in fact, even on this front, Rebellion has tried to pump out the contents and novelties to the maximum, making relatively large glimpses available to users that open up towards new areas, while the waves they follow each other incessantly presenting increasingly numerous and tough enemies, including bosses. The lack of extra mechanics like those present in Gears obviously make themselves felt, together with an inevitably less elegant and inspired design, but it is a mode that works very well and offers a lot of fun. A nice touch: if your character is killed, he will rise as a zombie and you can see him pathetically advancing on his former comrades, waiting to respawn during the next wave. Playstation 4 trophies The fifty-one Trophies of Zombie Army 4: Dead War are obtained by completing all chapters of the campaign, aiming higher and higher in Horde mode and leveling up your character. Then there are obviously numerous achievements related to specific situations, sensational kills, heroic actions (such as saving NPCs in difficulty) and eliminations in the two or three figures. Scenarios and technical implementation The technical sector of Zombie Army 4: Dead War appears from the outset to be superior compared to the previous episodes of the series, although over time the limits of the English production inevitably come to the surface. The developers have focused on effects, embellishing the surfaces and the lighting system, complete with screen space reflection (but at low resolution, and it is noticeable) on the pools of water and assets that rarely show the side of poorly defined textures. The problem lies in the realization of the characters and the related animations, which appear dated and/or recycled, while there is really nothing to say about the Kill Cams and the dismemberments, which reach an unprecedented level of truculence, in concert with a precision of the millimeter collisions: if you're aiming your sniper rifle inches from an obstacle or between tree branches, you won't see the bullet ricochet off an invisible obstacle, as it sometimes does. In short, the manufacturing care, especially in these details at the service of the gameplay, is undeniable and extends to the possibility of activating two different graphics modes on PS4 Pro, quality or performance: in the first case the game runs at 30 fps at higher resolution, in the second case at 60 fps with lower resolution, probably 1080p. It goes without saying that the second option is the most functional to the action and we preferred it right away, but also this time to change from un preset to another the application must actually be closed: a solution that does not go well with the world of consoles. Ah, the frame rate is also unlockable on standard PS4. In general, Sniper Elite 4: Dead War does what it can with the budget available, sometimes venturing into situations that should have been represented differently. This is the distance between the Rebellion title and the most famous third person shooters on the market, also because a setting like Italy could have been exploited much better by the developers: there are no truly iconic and recognizable glimpses, in some cases everything is so generic that we could find us everywhere, with a few notable exceptions. In Venice you travel along the canals on board a vaporetto, in Naples instead you move between rivers of lava (guess where they come from?) and ruined houses until you reach a castle which, however, bears no resemblance to the Maschio Angioino, the Croatia certainly has its own reason but much more could have been done to visually characterize these scenarios. Then there is the sound sector, which does its duty well as regards music, effects and the ability to create a certain atmosphere, increasing tension especially when the situation gets more complicated. However, it is a real pity that an Italian dubbing, present instead in the main series, has been renounced: the dialogues in our language (available only in the form of subtitles) would have streamlined some passages and contributed to making a plot more engaging which obviously does not represent the strong point of this production.", "date": "2020-02-03", "grade": "8.0"}
