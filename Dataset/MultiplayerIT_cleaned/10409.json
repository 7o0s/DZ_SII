With mixed results, though. The solid structure of the gameplay adopted by each chapter of Harvest Moon has remained intact to the bone: The Tree of Tranquility does not distort the normal game mechanics, but reproduces exactly those characteristics that have made the series famous since the days of Super Nintendo , now more than fifteen years ago. After choosing whether to play as a boy or a girl, the adventure begins... The merry farmer The ship on which we were sailing, caught in a storm, is docked in a safe harbor and is now safe: we are on the island of Cialde, a pleasant and sunny place by the sea where life flows calmly and serenely. As usual, it is our job to take a house and put up a respectable ranch with animals to raise, plants and anything else that is appropriate for a cheerful farm. The secondary objective, as usual, is instead to build a family trying to maintain social relationships with the single ladies of the island and maybe find a girlfriend. Harvest Moon is the right mix of Animal Crossing (as far as social relationships are concerned), an RPG (our character has numerous characteristics that evolve over time and with practice) and a Japanese dating simulator. In short, it is a very particular and distinctive genre of the series since its first chapter. In this new adventure, however, it's not just about paying attention to the farm and the beautiful girls, but we have to complete some secondary ~quests~ of far from marginal importance. First of all, we have the heavy responsibility of restoring the ancient prosperity to the entire island by trying to reawaken the legendary ~Father Tree~: we have to complete the recipes of the Island Goblins (cooking is just one of the thousand aspects of Harvest Moon) to then be able to be able to plant the seed that will make the mythological tree sprout. Also making the famous ~Harvest Goddess~ reappear is another of our primary tasks. The player obviously has no impositions or obligations, but can set up the game freely by deciding whether to devote himself more to agriculture, missions or social relationships. Or living with the right balance between the three elements. Those who don't just want to dig the land or milk the cows can have fun chatting with people, receiving letters, ordering goods by telephone or wandering around the city taking advantage of its work and leisure opportunities. There are many activities on the Waffle Island: creating clothes in the tailor's shop, talking, giving gifts, buying objects, accessories and furniture for the home and work, looking for minerals and reselling precious gems, cooking delicious local dishes and, alas, every now and then go to the doctor for a visit. Not just rural life The main activity, however, is still agriculture. But that's not all: breeding is also of great importance, in this chapter ~enhanced~ thanks to the introduction of many new animal species such as silkworms, oysters, but also turtles, ducks, and the canonical roosters, hens, cows , ducks, pigs and sheep. We can also have pets, to cheer the presence in our Ranch. In Harvest Moon: The Tree of Tranquility you can even fish, go to the market, sell goods and do extra jobs to supplement your salary and buy new tools and machinery. Animal Crossing owes a lot to this series. The view behind the protagonist has been abandoned in favor of a bird's eye view with a fairly backward zoom, certainly to remedy the technical problems that appeared in previous chapters such as polygonal clipping. The camera is not very comfortable, and the developers have studied a system to detect the characters on the map, track them and make our lives easier to find them. The new commands designed specifically for Nintendo Wii do not make the task easier, but are limited to being used to simulate the movement of some typical actions of the farmer. Some mini-games interrupt the action by offering a few moments of leisure together with three other friends of ours, in very simple but equally nice and fun multiplayer competitions. Unfortunately, the Wii remote is only used well in these situations, while in the rest of the game the traditional, fully compatible controller is even more comfortable. The new hardware is not well optimized even for disk access: going from one area of the city to another Harvest Moon suffers from very long and tedious loadingi of almost ten seconds each, a now inconceivable factor for a game that, moreover, loads very little data into memory. The graphics sector, in fact, is not improved by the previous chapters: while very nice and colorful, The Tree of Tranquility is certainly not one of the most impressive titles ever conceived on Nintendo Wii. The characters are round, well drawn as are the animals, but all the ~outline~ is quite scarce and poorly cared for. The series takes place in the countryside, beaches, mineral quarries, cities and forests: the locations are many and well characterized, but made with little varied textures, elements not properly finished and not many polygons on the screen. The sound accompaniment mainly consists of simple music played in loops: quite boring and repetitive, even if they are nice at first listening. The theme remains unchanged throughout the game, with no emotional jolts or peaks. Effects and sampled voices are recorded very hastily and with a very variable quality. Both the gameplay and the technical realization now seem like things of other times; perhaps the time has come for the series to offer real innovations and a graphic sector up to today's productions. .", "date": "2009-11-04", "grade": "6.2"}
