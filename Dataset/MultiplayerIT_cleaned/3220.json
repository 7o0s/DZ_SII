The review of the Metro Redux collection is instead simpler and more positive than expected because the work done is almost miraculous and recalls, in some respects, the one seen a few months ago with The Witcher 3. We tried them both, we also mercilessly compared them with the PC counterpart and we got a definitive idea about these jobs. A strong story... metropolitan For those who have no idea what the first-person adventures of 4A Games are about, it is right to take a step back and contextualize the saga. Freely inspired by the series of novels of the same name, written by Dmitrij Gluchovsky, Metro is part of that long line of post-apocalyptic entertainment products that have somehow monopolized the panorama. However reductive the concept is exactly this. In a future in which humanity has given way to the dreaded nuclear conflict, the inhabitants of Moscow have found themselves forced to take refuge underground, choosing the underground tunnels as a shelter while waiting for better times to return to the surface. Artyom is a man like many others, indeed a child, who after losing his mother is forced to grow up quickly and become, in spite of himself, one of the fundamental people of the resistance. The world above is devastated by radiation and populated by monstrous creatures, deformed and infinitely more powerful than man, who resist the evil that consumes the Earth and creep underground to hunt down the few remaining human beings. Artyom's journey is therefore one of desperate ones, in search of the truth about what happened and about the Dark Ones: figures beyond man but humanoids, able to exercise great power over the human psyche. Both Metro 2033 and Last Light, the two chapters that make up the collection, still represent two of the best first-person single player experiences that can be played today. Both campaigns lasting about ten hours, are able to give a good pace and an exciting story, albeit sometimes too tangled. If anything, the question is linked to the quantity of reissues of the collection, which has been in circulation since 2014 and which sees in the Switch release the search for a market that is profoundly different from that of birth, a bit like Doom did before her. Which means Redux The collection of the first two Metro (waiting for a package that also includes Exodus) does not only bring the double game inside. Several improvements have been added which, inevitably, affect the original 2033 more than Last Light. The revision of the lighting, of the animations and the addition of some interludes in the first chapter, go alongside the insertion of the customization of the weapons and the total rebalancing of the game, even going to retouch the design of some maps, as well as the spawn of enemies and some resources. The biggest addition that instead has an opposite effect on one with respect to the other title is that of the initial choice of mode. Once the game has started, it will be possible to choose between ~survival~ and ~spartan~. Where the second will tend to keep the game on track closer to a classic fps (and therefore to the second chapter), survival will exponentially increase the risk of game over, tending towards the origin of the series. The positive element of this choice is linked to the innate ability of both titles to adapt to each of the two choices. Anyone who could not digest the survival approach of 2033 is able to make the title more action and less focused on attention to resources; on the contrary, if you have been burned by the drift of Last Light, you can return to the glories of the past. The choice of mode is then paired with the classic one of difficulty, making the two games more or less brutal. It seems clear how combining the survival mode with the ranger difficulty will bring the game closer to total frustration, but also immerse the user in an all-encompassing and well thought out experience. Metro Redux on Switch In light of the undoubted quality of the games in question, how is their conversion on Nintendo Switch? As we anticipated in the first lines of this review, we were pleasantly surprised by the work done. Although in the past months we have already surprised ourselves with other titles, it is always difficult to expect an excellent job when it comes to bringing the ibrida Nintendo of titles such as Metro. Above all Last Light, which already at its original release could boast a sufficiently frightening technical sector, represented our greatest fear. To be honest, already from the first light of dawn we realized that the work carried out could give more than one satisfaction and, the hours spent again in Artyom's company were pleasant and interesting. It is clear that we are talking about a pair of reworked titles, lowered in their aesthetic and lighting characteristics, but which are still able to elicit more than a smile from that player who is still amazed to see a triple a running on Nintendo Switch. From a purely aesthetic point of view, despite a clear approach to medium-low details and the general impoverishment of an illumination that years ago had been able to lead the way, we are faced with two fluid and solid fps from the point of view of the frame rate. It is always difficult to ascertain the precise number with the naked eye, but if you are able to mentally get off the ugly pedestal of the master race, you can rejoice in the possibility of playing them anywhere and without an internet connection (which, for example, would be required in the cloud) The question of controls is different and more pernicious. We know that by now several generations of gamers have become accustomed to playing fps with a pad. This does not exclude the possibility that this element may be, by itself, indigestible for many others. Unfortunately from this point of view the conversion does not help, mainly due to the poor management of customization and a reduced sensitivity of the analogs which, even taken to the maximum, makes aiming difficult in some situations. Nothing about which we cannot get used to is clear, but it still seemed right to add it to the calculation of the analysis.", "date": "2020-02-28", "grade": "8.2"}
