Provided of course that you are also a fan of pinball machines, given that the list of tables currently available within the Zen Studios title can in fact count on a total of 20 different settings, dedicated to more or less as many works taken from the world of the home American publisher with all the most famous superheroes. After all, it has been months now that the developers of the pinball simulator have adopted a policy of external licenses, launched in a particularly profitable way especially with Disney to bring the various films we have seen at the cinema in recent years to our screens also in pinball versions , including the first Avengers. With perfect timing, given the release of the sequel in theaters, the replica could not be missing also in Pinball FX2, thanks to the arrival of the table dedicated to Age of Ultron. As usual, we have carved out some time to play a few matches, to understand whether or not it is worth spending the 2.99 euros required for this single DLC. Pinball FX2 hits 20 tables dedicated to Marvel superheroes, thanks to the latest in the Age of Ultron series Avengers Assemble The new table created by Zen Studios is naturally focused on the figure of Ultron, the villain of the second film dedicated to the Avengers who came out of the peace program designed by Tony Stark, a billionaire who lives in the Iron Man costume. The construction of Ultron is presented to us as a ~prologue~ to the pinball machine, in which you have to hit the bumpers with two marbles representing the colors of Iron Man (red) and Hulk (green), protagonists of the creation of the bad guy on duty. Once this initial part has been completed in multiball mode, it is possible to start the actual game, in which each Avengers character can count on a separate game mode: therefore dedicate oneself to completing the portions of pinball machines dedicated to Iron Man , Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye leads to different mission types for scoring points, with the last one associated with Hawkeye similar to those seen in other tables featured in Pinball FX2. By illuminating all the name of the superhero in question, it is in fact possible to access a minigame in which we have to aim and shoot arrows at Ultron's followers, obtaining points in case of success: a dynamic that obviously differs from that of pinball machines , but which has now become an appreciated trademark of this game. In more practical terms, the table does not distort the dynamics of that many Pinball FX2 owners already know, however it stands out for its difficulty on some occasions: the elements present in the pinball machine in fact guarantee a particularly fast type of action, played for the most part in the area just in front of the fins. To confirm this we find a single additional flap placed in the upper right part of the table, accessible however in a rather rare way and therefore used less than in other tables. A good dose of attention therefore becomes necessary towards the evolutions made by the ball, which sometimes even ends up disappearing in a certain part of the table, to then emerge in another point at a fairly high speed towards the lower part of the screen. It is no coincidence that the developers have included the possibility of choosing the level of difficulty of the pinball machine, just as it is no coincidence that the dynamics of this specific table make access to multiball and the special protection against losing the ball quite frequent. part of Thor. Fight continues Also from a technical point of view, the tradition of the themed tables of Pinball FX2 is preserved in this one dedicated to Age of Ultron, which can count on the constant presence of some well-known faces on the screen: in the lower part the Black Widow appears quite fixedly to comment on our actions, taking part in some animations that also involve Iron Man and Ultron, placed instead in the upper part of the screen. As happened with The Walking Dead, we must say that the various interludes are welcome as such, but if related to the game they can end up distracting the player, thus making him lose attention towards the marble. As for the sound, we are on good levels, even if the speech of the various characters appears a little less in shape than seen in other tables. In conclusion, the second Pinball FX2 pinball machine dedicated to Avengers continues on the safe path traveled so far by Zen Studios, giving Marvel fans another way to have fun with their favorite heroes. If you are already in possesI know of other tables and are looking for a demanding challenge, this new pinball machine may be for you, while if not, we invite you to carefully evaluate the level of difficulty, also considering possibly starting from a different pinball machine and then moving on to this one once you get the hang of it.", "date": "2015-05-02", "grade": null}
