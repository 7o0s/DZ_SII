The pixels that made up the graphics of shooters like Galaxian or Space Invaders generated a particular halo and a ~trail effect~ which, although due to the technical limitations of monitors, helped to characterize their aesthetics, creating an almost hypnotic effect. All elements that Q-Games has tried to recover and re-propose in PixelJunk SideScroller, available for a few weeks exclusively on the PlayStation Network. The partnership between the team founded by Dylan Cuthbert and Sony continues, therefore, and seems destined to last much longer. In the specific case of this production, the idea comes from the bonus stage that can be accessed once PixelJunk Shooter 2 is completed, even if it is hard to consider SideScroller a mere spin-off. In fact, the game has a well-defined personality, very different from the extra level on which it is based, in which each of the twelve (sixteen, in reality) stages marries a specific philosophy and confronts us with threats that must be faced using one of the three weapons which our ship is equipped with: the gust, which multiplies once it is strengthened and allows us to eliminate enemies placed in every direction; the laser beam, an extremely powerful beam that is ideal for the demolition of the most resistant units; bombs, explosive spheres that ~bounce~ off the walls of the scenario in search of targets to disintegrate. The intention of the developers was to provide the player with these tools so that they can be switched between them quickly and intuitively, hence the assignment of the Square and Circle buttons on the Dual Shock to ~scroll~ weapons, an operation that can also be performed via the secondary backbones but in a less ~elegant~ way. To open fire with the weapon equipped, just press and hold down the R1 backbone, while the L1 backbone activates a further offensive manoeuvre, in this case a ~charge~ that the spacecraft performs towards a target and which is particularly useful against small groups of enemies, even if during the tests we never frowned upon it, preferring more traditional approaches. Imperturbably flows If you are returning from the experience with PixelJunk Shooter 2, the first impact with PixelJunk SideScroller could be traumatic. In fact, we go from a dynamic but fundamentally reflexive gameplay, in which the shooter action alternates and sometimes merges with the resolution of puzzles based on the scenario, to an ~old-fashioned~ approach in which the progressive horizontal scrolling leaves no room for anything that is not the destruction of enemy units; as many as possible, perhaps, to reach the high score and place on the online leaderboards. However, there is a precise design behind the game dynamics, with the stages having a gradual structure, starting with the usual double row of spaceships and urging us to focus above all on those among them that shine, as their elimination releases in the background a power-up or shield. The upgrades affect the ability of the equipped weapon only, so you have to learn to understand (often with a series of trials and errors, since memorizing certain sequences is practically a must if you want to overcome the more complex phases) which of our three tools of destruction it is necessary to improve because, as already mentioned, there are stages designed expressly around a type of weapon. Some levels present threats on the lower and upper walls, thus lending themselves to the assaults of bombs; others attack us head-on with very resistant emplacements, to be knocked down using the laser. In short, the default burst is the classic ~all-rounder~, able to support us a little in all situations but without boasting the effectiveness of the specific tools. Shooter enthusiasts, those who perhaps cut their teeth with Thunderforce IV on Mega Drive, will recognize the value of certain moments, the taste of the quotation but at the same time the desire to propose something new; to push, if possible, an already largely squeezed vein towards new heights. The final stages of each level fall within this perspective, in which we are tested in various ways and we are asked to think quickly to survive. Playstation 3 trophies There are fifteen trophies made available by PixelJunk SideScroller. Obtaining them is generally a simple operation, that is, you just need to complete the individual stages, the ~zones~ and the game in the various lilevels of difficulty. However, there is no shortage of slightly more particular businesses: eliminating fifty enemies using the loaded attack, eliminating ten with the laser, collecting hidden crowns and so on. The usual routine The genre of scrolling shoot'em-up is based more on routines, or rather on the operations that enemy units perform every time they appear on the screen. We will find ourselves facing spaceships that fly in formation and fire a few bullets treacherously, when we least expect it, or turrets that launch missiles at us at a certain angle, or emplacements capable of carrying out different attacks, with numerous branches, very difficult to avoid. The key to passing the stages lies in memorizing these behaviors, even more so when it comes to the bosses, who we will meet at the end of each of the three (four) zones and who in their movement and in their offensive patterns will recall past experiences with the best titles of the genre, which maybe we thought we had forgotten. The fact that the gameplay is accompanied by basically wireframe graphics, which manages in its small way to be stylish (starting with the rounded edges of the screen, which recall those of the 80s coin-ops) and sometimes dazzles us with its shades acidic, represents only an added value for the experience, the demonstration that it is possible to create something significant even drawing on a very different budget from that of triple A productions. The contrast of the soundtrack, which underlines our raids with rhythms and ~ambient~ melodies, electronic but not too much, it doesn't hit the target of placing a particular tune in our heads but it certainly contributes to the general atmosphere.", "date": "2011-12-07", "grade": "8.2"}
