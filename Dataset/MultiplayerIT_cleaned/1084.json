The progress of the team in the various sectors of the training The same progress seen specifically for each player Tactics and Market Tactics are the next step. From a theoretical point of view there is no formation better than the others, but often you have to come to terms with the limitations dictated by the squad, or with the tactics used by the opposing team. For example, if our wing midfielders are slow and not very agile, it will not make sense to set up a tactic centered on the wings, but it will be better to try to break through centrally. All these orders can be given in a simple way, selecting the settings closest to our ideas among those available. Furthermore, we will also be able to give specific indications to individual players in case it is necessary to differentiate them from the rest of the team. Practically all the formations are present, it is a pity that the positions are a bit difficult. rigid Gauges allow you to quickly switch squad orders Comparing players is the best way to compare players. important to understand which is more convenient to field or buy In arranging the tactics it is natural to notice gaps in some roles, and here comes the moment least appreciated by the presidents of the teams (Moratti excluded): they put their hands on their wallets and go and dig into the transfer market. The search system is comfortable and allows total customization in order to direct it as much as possible towards the type of player you are looking for. It's not all that easy though, in fact even the best selector isn't omniscient, and many characteristics of less famous players will be obscured until we send a talent scout to get more information. However, this takes time, and a delay could cut us off from a negotiation, so these choices must also be made with great caution. Furthermore, the negotiations for the sales are extremely complete and allow for any type of negotiation, finally including the loan with the right of redemption. If the players we already know aren't enough for us, we can always send our talent scouts around the world, specifying to each of them where and what type of champion to look for. However, all of this must take into account the budget available to us, and we will hardly be able to convince the management to further loosen the purse strings, even if it costs nothing to try (apart from the job if we push too hard...). Feature masking is to simulate incomplete player information. Here however; you exaggerate... Search customization is a must. almost total More brains than brawn Perhaps the Italian championship will not be the most beautiful in the world, but it is certainly the most difficult, above all due to the enormous pressure to which the coaches are subjected. Like any good self-respecting manager, FM2005 allows us to jump to the other side of the fence and put on the shoes of the much-criticized coaches, with all the problems that this entails. After entering the data of our virtual alter ego and choosing the team to lead to glory, we find ourselves entangled in a huge mass of data that is not at all easy to unravel at the beginning. The president wants results, the fans too, and we still don't even know the complete list of players. First of all we have to raise awareness of the players we will train in the following months. Each one is indicated by a large number of characteristics (34 for players, 32 for goalkeepers) which represent individual abilities in the various game fundamentals (dribbling, shooting, balance, etc), divided between technical, mental and physical. In addition to this we will have to take into account physical fitness and morale, which have a big impact on performance. By comparing the various players, we should thus be able to identify the best ones to line up as starters. If this were not the case, however, we can always ask our deputy for advice who will give his opinion on the current squad, on the possible need for reinforcements in the various departments, and on the most suitable choices depending on the type of training. [C] The player characteristics screen. Some even have photos In seire C2 the staff is; quite limited, things change completely once you reach Serie A The assistant coach's report is 100%. very useful at the beginning to quickly get a global idea of the team [/C] A small introduction A few months after the release of Championship Manager 03/04 the programming team (Sigames) and the distribution company (Eidos) separated and each decided to continue forr own way. Sigames retained the rights to the game engine, while Eidos retained the trademark rights. So Football Manager 2005 is the effective continuation of CM03/04 and follows its philosophy and mechanics. Finally on the pitch Once the ~office work~ is over, it's time to see if our schemes and ideas really work or not. During the game we have a large number of screens available that summarize the progress of the game, from the one on ball possession to the details on the performance of each individual player. This information represents what we would see as a manager, and is very important for understanding if there is something wrong and consequently deciding what adjustments, if any, to make. For this reason, at any moment of the match we will be able to modify all the tactical settings of the team. The funniest moment, however, is the 2D representation of the highlights. Each movement is calculated based on the characteristics of the players and a myriad of other parameters starting from the set tactic. The result is extremely complex and realistic, to the point of being as compelling as if not more than a real game. Goooool!!! The split screen allows you to observe the match along with other useful information The detail of the players' performances: it is not possible. as difficult as it sounds, it only takes a little of practice The changes in detail FM2005 and CM03/04 are extremely similar, indeed too much. From a theoretical point of view there is a fair number of innovations, we need to see how useful they really are. So here is the official list of changes compared to the previous edition: - Improved interface - Improved game engine with the addition of the players' favorite action (the favorite action is actually visible, as well as modifiable, only through the editor. ..) - Players' shares to buy visible in 2D (the manual doesn't mention it and I've never seen it, but I could be wrong) - Comments from the trainers on the squad (the only real innovation of FM2005!) - Job center for non-players (it doesn't help much, just the old staff search) - Improved loans - Improved comment possibilities: you will be able to comment on opposing managers as well as on your own players (it has the same utility as the estimate statements released on Sundays sports...) - 43 national leagues, with 140 divisions and 100 cups. - 235,000 players and staff from 145 different countries with 120 parameters for players and 40 for staff (but most of them are secondary information such as age or preferences...) - Youth and reserve leagues - 14,000 teams of which 3000 manageable directly - Database provided with the collaboration of over 2500 researchers from all over the world (but incredibly the Cervia squad is wrong...) - Improved the visualization of the match in 2D and the commentary - Increased the relationship with the media - Redone the injury system - Improved the scouting system - Improved the financial management making it more realistic - Added the appearances in the under 18 national team - More realistic prize allocation system On balance there are not many changes that have a real impact on the game.. . Favorite action is only seen with the editor, not during gameplay Work NOT in progress For once, no technical comment: since it is a managerial matter, the video and audio components are not really of primary importance. In the box opposite is the official list of the new features compared to CM03/04, but it is very interesting to distinguish what has actually changed from the simple scenic retouches. The search engine in the market is much more convenient and allows you to search for exactly the player you need. However, the masking of characteristics for unknown players has turned into a plague: players who are free agents or from minor divisions are all considered unknown, and you only have to rely on scouts to complete the information. This costs a lot of time and makes the start of the match frustrating if you choose a team from a lower division, because without any information you are cut off from the summer transfer market. It would have been useful to know at least some owners of the teams that participate in the same championship as you. The morale of the players is visible from the general screen and is useful in choosing the owners; moreover, the proneness to injuries is no longer a secret characteristic, thus allowing to avoid the ~crystal players~. The real novelty is the possibility of asking the assistant coach for his opinion on the squad based on the tactics we have chosen, complete with opinions on possible champions and young promises, and a judizio on the departments that should be strengthened. The utility is undoubted, even if, strangely, it often doesn't coincide with the ~ask the deputy for training~ option. The training system, unanimously considered disastrous by fans, hasn't changed one iota. The assignment of the work schedule to the players has been moved to a separate page, but the changes end here. The other big problem of CM03/04 was the slowness of loading (I still remember a test with all settings at maximum done on a P4 2800: 30 minutes for each effective game day). Despite the boost in PC performance, FM2005 manages the difficult feat of being dramatically slower. These are the results of some speed tests carried out on an Athlon64 3200+ (the same one from the ~PC of the month~ section) based on the time it takes to start a new game: - huge database, 4 leagues, no additional countries selected - 10 minutes - huge database, 10 leagues, around 25 additional nations selected - 1 hour - huge database, 20 leagues, around 50 additional nations selected - 1 hour 40 minutes - huge database, around 75 leagues, all additional nations (around 225 ) - restarted out of desperation after 3 hours (but by eye there were at least a couple more missing) For fairness it should be noted that the tests were carried out with the antivirus enabled, and this, given that it continuously analyzes the files being modified, causes a slowdown of 10-15%, so much so that in the FAQs on previous editions of CM it was recommended to set it to ignore the game files to reduce loading times. You get to mind-blowing levels, and these times don't just refer to starting a new game, but are also reflected in the loading time every time you continue the game (over half an hour for each game day by selecting 10 leagues and 25 additional nations). What is serious are not the times themselves, but the fact that CM03/04, equipped with a database of similar size (just over 200,000 players), was much faster even selecting over 100 leagues. Such slowness does not have an explanation known to non-experts, but it certainly cannot make players happy, especially given that many had clamored for better performance. Releasing a comment on the opposing coach should make him lose confidence... if this were the case in reality, the Italian championship would resemble the insulting duels of Monkey Island... Comment The vote is 7, but this is valid only if FM2005 is considered an end in itself, without making any consideration in relation to its predecessor. In this way, therefore, it must be considered by those approaching football management for the first time, or who have not had the opportunity to play CM03/04. Seen from this point of view, FM2005 is a decent game, well balanced from many points of view, but which suffers from gross defects that severely limit some aspects. However, the situation is quite different for those who have already played CM03/04. Football Manager 2005 is virtually identical to its predecessor despite the fact that a year has passed. The most serious problems have been completely ignored despite the thousands of posts written by players about it, and the improvements in some (fortunately limited) cases have created more annoyances than anything else. Already last year CM03/04 created some perplexities given the proximity to the release of CM4 and the scarce innovations. In that case, however, the numerous bugs affecting CM4 had at least been resolved. We therefore had the impression that CM03/04 was the complete game, and instead CM4 was a hastily released beta. The split with Eidos may have been traumatic, but that's no excuse, given that Sigames retained the rights to the game engine, so to all intents and purposes it lost very little time. Such a similarity would have been understandable (although not pleasant) in case of replacement of the team of programmers due to the time needed to study the program, but not by those who created the code and therefore know it well. Almost all the new features of this edition are actually simple superfluous ornaments that slightly improve the general feeling with the game, they don't affect its playability in the slightest. For them, therefore, the judgment can only be disappointing as the impression one gets having thoroughly tried both games. Now we just have to wait and see what Eidos will get out of the hat. Pros: Huge database Total customization of every aspect of your team Anticipated CM5 on store shelves Cons: Nothing new worthy of note: it's a photocopy of CM03/04! Players' criticisms of the training system have been ignored", "date": "2004-12-16", "grade": null}
