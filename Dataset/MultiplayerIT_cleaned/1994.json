{"name": "Tsunami 2265: manga... all'italiana!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tsunami-2265-manga-allitaliana_a.html", "text": "Elena indeed E.L.EN.A E.L.EN.A is a mysterious source of energy. In a world characterized by energy poverty such an object could give immense powers of global control. The two protagonists (who are part of the ranks of the ~good guys~ who try to steal E.L.EN.A. from the ~bad guys~) Naoko Hikari and Neon Shima are two samurai from the future. In this world so devastated both because of the forces of nature (a huge tidal wave has in fact changed the world as we know it, destroying cities, states and creating new centers of power) and because of the civil war (the corporations parties are at war with each other) they will have to try to bring back some peace by delivering into the right hands, the incredible power of E.L.EN.A. At their disposal there are 17 powerful mechs with which to face enemies with lasers and missiles! At the start of the game, Neon is held in a super-fortress after being ambushed by enemy ninjas. Then you will start playing with Naoko but later Neon will also be available. Two games in one The arcade section is quite lively. It's a question of often fighting against other mechs and I must say that the enemy artificial intelligence is really ~intelligent~ ;). Enemy mechs are able to dodge shots, they hide, they wait for you to come out, in short, they have a well-programmed AI. One thing that disappointed me a little though is that I was expecting more variety in terms of weapons. Furthermore, the mechs do not present major differences from each other. In short, a nice ~customize your mech~ section is missing from the Mechwarrior. However Tsunami is an arcade and not a simulator so in the end it is not really fundamental. The adventure section is more exploratory. In these situations, Naoko and Neon get off their mechs and wander around different environments to solve puzzles of various kinds. The game here slows down the pace of the action and gives you some breath to relax and prepare for a new arcade section. Although both Naoko and Neon are samurai, they will not use the typical skills of this particular role or the classic swords. This adventure section therefore perhaps could have been treated better, but in the end it is only a personal opinion. In essence, it is certainly two games in one and this can only improve the longevity of the whole product. The graphics engine Prograph Research has developed a great graphics engine, called Truman Space. This is capable of integrating closed locations with huge open locations. All thanks also to the advanced ~clipping~ techniques, which serve as a link between one location and another, and ~sector-clipping~, that is, the subdivision of a very large level into smaller sectors, which can be optimized separately. The use of Cell Shading is truly remarkable, as you can see from the screenshots. As for the characters and structures of the game, they were developed using 3D Maya (a very powerful modeling software), suitably interfaced with Truman Space. The animations are very fluid and realistic, thanks to the ~motion capture~ technique, which consists in applying the movements of a real-life actor to the skeletons of the characters. In short, Prograph Research has really worked hard. Some news on Cell Shading Sega for Jet Set Radio Future also implemented this technological marvel. But what exactly is it about? Through this technique, the polygons that make up the game characters are automatically divided into ~sections~ by means of a marked black line and then shaded with various pastel shades. In practice, it is as if cartoon coloring techniques were applied to 3D graphics (a bit of a mix of two-dimensional figures and three-dimensional effects). On balance we are faced with a new way of representing virtual worlds which for now seems to be enjoying quite a bit of success. Think of the next Legend of Zelda for GC that will use this technique or XIII, the new shooter from Ubisoft that promises wonders. Audio and gameplay The sound is good and the soundtrack is masterfully on topic. All this creates a suggestive atmosphere which, together with the quality of the graphics engine, perfectly arouses the sensations of Japanese anime. The only ~sore~ note (so to speak ;) heh) is that I noticed that the quality of the tracksorchestral is not at the level of the more rhythmic ones (let's call them ~techno~ even if they are a bit of a mix of various genres). However, considered as a whole, the soundtrack is decent. As for the sfx, in my opinion they could have been made ~more aggressive~ with targeted effects in the studio. But maybe I'm too picky about these topics .... The gameplay instead is good but not excellent. The game difficulty is medium and can satisfy all players, from the hardened veteran to the newcomer. You learn to play in a few seconds thanks to a simple and intuitive control system, perhaps too simple, but even in this case it is a question of personal tastes. Those who want to have some fun with a light but tasty arcade without creating too many problems can only be happy with Tsunami 2265. Defects And the usual paragraph dedicated to the defects of the game cannot be missing. As much as a softwarehouse can do its utmost to try at all costs to arrive at the release date of the game with a perfect master, in the end some problems always crop up ... and by now we have become accustomed to the necessary patches that often come out just a few days after the release of a game to quickly resolve some little things left unfinished for various causes, and not always at the expense of the developers who often have to fight with tight deadlines and tyrants. So let's start by talking about some minor sound and texture bugs. However, Prograph assured me that the patch solves most of these problems. Some colleagues from other magazines later complained that the game doesn't run on some systems. It hit me right away so my personal opinion, from this point of view, is positive. Conclusions What else to say about Tsunami 2265? In recent years, other ~manga inspired~ games have come out such as the excellent Shogo and ONI, but Tsunami seems to come out of the ~genre~. It will be the use of the ~notorious~ Cell Shading which certainly makes the game ~special~, or the simplicity of the game, for some a point against, for me a point in favor since I see it perfectly in tune with the intentions of Prograph: to create a fun game, without too many pretensions but that has a ~something more~, and the use of Cell Shading shows us that Prograph has really achieved what they set! In short, thumbs up for Tsunami 2265! Introduction The war for world domination ended in 2160. The world capital became Shin Balhe. The imperial family reigned supreme over the ashes of the earth, the shogun with the help of imperial delegates controlled the political power and the individual fiefdoms that made up the empire. Energy poverty was the means by which Shin Balhe managed to keep the provinces under control~. Thus begins the description of the sci-fi background of Tsunami 2265, a brand new and promising mix of action and adventure game. The action amuses us, and the adventure keeps us glued to the game to solve the puzzles and see how it ends. In short, the mix seems really spot on, as well as the setting that all manga fans cannot fail to recognize. The sensation therefore that the game is an interesting product of some ~made in Japan~ software house is very clear, but then we go and see who developed Tsunami and we discover that it is Prograph Research, a well-known Italian software house that some time ago ~teased us l'appetito with the nice Tony Tough and the Night of Roasted Moths (cartoon-like style 2d adventure) which will soon be released also in america. Now Prograph offers us this fun arcade that I tried for you read read! ;)", "date": "2002-10-03", "grade": null}
