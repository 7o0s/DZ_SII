{"name": "Spookware", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/spookware-recensione.html", "text": "WarioWare's formula may seem so absurd that it is difficult to replicate, despite its extreme simplicity, yet every now and then some cases emerge in which the crazy mini-game becomes state of the art and in this Spookware review we see how Beeswax Games is very close to this concept, at least. The ingredients are all very interesting: the sudden bursts of gameplay given by the mini-games thrown head and neck, a setting that starts from the classic styles of horror and builds a hilarious parody and a real story to discover through several acts, which stages the adventures of three skeletal brothers grappling with different situations. All this creates a very particular amalgam that has practically no equal in the videogame panorama and is no small thing nowadays, although the gameplay is always extremely simple. It is difficult to find a precise place for Spookware in the system of videogame genres , being something even more particular than WarioWare, given the presence of further hybrid elements to build its structure, but we can consider it a sort of adventure with integrated mini-games. The result is rather interesting because it creates a constant variation between different situations, with a base focused on exploration and dialogues and the frequent takeover of mini-games to provide sudden blows of extremely elementary but also decidedly hilarious action, above all thanks to the demented characterization adopted for represent the different situations in which we have to act. The game was released last summer, but we recover it now, with this review, because it can be particularly suitable for Halloween, especially for those who are inclined to a decidedly humorous interpretation. Story: Three Merry Dead Boys Spookware begins with the three protagonists watching horror movies on TV The game starts strong right away, offering a tight series of 9 mini-games to be completed in sequence before even being able to see the beginning of the story, just to make it clear what we have to deal with during the adventure. Three somewhat funny-looking skeletons watch the action on an antediluvian TV comfortably seated on a sofa, which suggests that the theme of the game is actually a sort of marathon of ~classic horror films~ that the three brothers are pursuing for who knows how long now, in a typical basement of an American house. At the end of this first section, the three finally decide to go out for some air and the story actually starts from here, revealing how the basement is actually a tomb from which the three brothers emerge to try to recover some ' of lost time in their long stay underground. Lefti, Midi and Righti, these are the names of the three skeletal figures, therefore decide to face the wonders of the outside world, taking part in various adventures within separate sections and characterized by specific scenarios. It starts, for example, from a typical American high school and then moves on to a cruise ship and then to a neighborhood of a big city where ours must deal with the management of a restaurant, with a main quest to face for each level. The mini-games come in a really bizarre style It is easy to understand how each section represents, to all intents and purposes, the discovery of a typical component of normal life, which is faced by the three brothers as a sort of ~first time~, in fact rediscovering life after death, or at least this is what it seems at first glance. In fact, among the light-hearted and humorous tones that characterize dialogues and game situations, a sort of underlying disturbing element can be glimpsed, which surfaces during the dreams of the protagonists and in other situations, making it clear how everything can only be ~an illusion~, waiting to discover the truth hidden at the end of the path. Gameplay: WarioWare with the dead School is the first level to be tackled in Spookware From a gameplay point of view, the game is configured as a sort of adventure in which interactions with characters and scenario are limited to dialogues and mini-games in the style of WarioWare: Get It Together!. During the exploration phases we are free to move the three characters within the settings, looking for locations and discovering the main missions to be completed, but once these elements have been defined, the mini-games become the fundamental moments of the game. Essentially, the real game moments are made up of these bursts of gameplay in which we have to understand what to do and perform simple actions but without being able to make mistakesre, all within a minimum amount of time. The mini-games are many and varied, offering a variety of absurd situations as the Nintendo series has taught us, but in this case with a tone tending towards the lugubrious and grotesque: recomposing a skeleton, cutting off a head, defusing a bomb, escaping from ghosts and many other game micro-structures to be executed correctly in a few seconds. Compared to WarioWare, in Spookware there is a certain contextualization of these mini-games, at least as regards those sections that more specifically concern the progression in the story. In the second level of Spookware we are on a cruise ship In the first level, for example, we find ourselves having to assemble a band for the school concert and to do so we have to win various musical challenges: all of these take place like a sort of rhythm game which requires the correct pressing of the keys in time to play the percussion correctly. In the next level, set on a cruise ship, we have to solve a case of alleged murder trying to counter the testimonies by presenting evidence that could frame the suspects (much like Phoenix Wright), while in the next level the games deal deal with running a restaurant. In practice, the most disparate mini-games are inserted within game sequences more rooted in the narrative, which act as a common thread with regard to the individual levels. However, it must be noted that the control system is a bit confused: the game himself reports that it is preferable to use the keyboard, but in some cases the mouse is preferred instead, with the need to switch from one to the other to control the characters in the adventure phases and in the mini-games. Graphics between 2D, 3D and reality A mini-game in which we have to cut a trunk, with real images The solution chosen for the graphics is very particular, with a truly unique aesthetic that mixes 2D and 3D elements, drawings and real images. As for the relationship between 2D characters and 3D environments, the effect closely resembles that typical of the Paper Mario series, with the various skeletons appearing ~flat~, but moving within a three-dimensional space. Rather unique is the mix between live photos and drawn elements, with a high-impact rendering that seems to be based on real dioramas to which some ~low-fi~ filters have been applied that can distort the image, also applying a vintage effect in line with the slightly 90s style that characterizes everything. This effect is valid both in the exploration phases between the settings and in single-screen mini-games, where the use of photomontages reaches the maximum humorous / demented effect. This style leads to a truly singular characterization and represents a good part of all the charm of Spookware, but it also involves some rather problematic elements: the clear and clean graphics of WarioWare let you immediately understand what you have to do inside the various mini-games, which are always immediate but difficult to execute perfectly and in minimum time available. Spookware often lacks this clarity and immediacy, so you may find yourself losing lives (we have three available, before game over) just to try to understand not only what to do with the mini-games, but also simply what is happening and what are the elements of interaction. The soundtrack, for its part, however, manages to accompany the action perfectly with the right bizarre style that associates perfectly with the game.", "date": "2021-10-26", "grade": "6.8"}
