We were really curious to try this particular mix of genres, to play the role of two characters so different from each other yet united by a deep friendship, perhaps even something more. It is curious to discover, right from the start, that the beefy Caddoc is actually the mind of the group, he loves to plan actions and consider all factors before embarking on a mission that he considers risky. E'lara, for her part, is the last elf left after the extermination perpetrated by the Minotaurs on her race, and this has inevitably made her prone to anger and instinct: if there is a fight, she is the first to join the fray; and likewise finds the sound of big explosions cathartic... especially if she caused them. Two undoubtedly picturesque characters, who live putting their sword at the service of the highest bidder and who out of the blue find themselves entangled in an adventure that has little to do with earthly riches. Seraphine, a woman as attractive as she is ghostly, manages to appear in Caddoc's dreams and push him to accept a very dangerous mission. At first it seems that the goal of the expedition is to save Seraphine in her human form, kidnapped by the horrible Wargar together with many other people who don't know why. Later, however, events will take a different turn and Caddoc and E'lara will have to choose which side to take. The plot of the game unfolds through a large number of cutscenes and is enriched with details as the two characters find stones of death around, objects capable of making them speak with the deceased. However, the direction of the product inXile Entertainment appears hasty, probably the meeting with Seraphine is reached too early and then one finds oneself ~digesting~ a second part of the story that is far better narrated. The point is that while the English version can remedy these shortcomings thanks to a very thick dubbing, which we have had the opportunity to listen to several times thanks to the dev diaries mentioned at the beginning, the same cannot be said of the Italian version of the game, from this point of view is strongly penalized by the usual team of ~professionals~ who unfortunately we know well and who persist in offering their own dubbing work without art or part. We reiterate a concept already expressed in the past: if this is to be the result, we might as well leave the dialogues in English and translate only the subtitles. Shooter or slash'em-up? Closed this necessary parenthesis, let's move on to the analysis of the gameplay which, as mentioned, mixes action, adventure and some RPG elements, but which also offers different interpretations of the fights in the management of the two characters. Both Caddoc and E'lara carry a sword or equivalent, a shield, and a bow or crossbow, however the human warrior specializes in close combat, while the elf is more comfortable striking enemies from a distance. The respective special abilities, which can be enhanced by collecting certain crystals, reaffirm the concept: Caddoc can carry out a powerful charge capable of destroying the opponents' shield, lifting them off the ground with a spell or entering a state of anger that amplifies its strength, while E'lara can multiply the effectiveness of her arrows by making them explosive, increasing their penetration capacity or investing them with a freezing spell. Alongside these skills there are others that are reflected instead on the action of your partner: one allows you to make him momentarily stronger, another to hurl lightning and the last one to throw fireballs. During the most ferocious and chaotic clashes, the collaboration between the two characters proves to be truly effective: while one acts in a direct and impetuous way, the other supports him from afar with her bow. The cooperative multiplayer mode, available both online and locally (via split screen), bases its appeal precisely on these dynamics and is certainly fun and exciting, provided you immediately select the highest difficulty level (the becomes a bit tricky only towards the end of the game). From this point of view, however, the impossibility of joining a game in progress is surprising in the negative. But let's get back to the gameplay quickly. As mentioned, playing with Caddoc turns out to be a rather ~physical~ experience, which proceeds with combo hits and implies the continuous execution of lateral parries and swerves to avoid sufferingre damage, while with E'lara you immerse yourself almost in the dimension of a third person shooter, given that both characters can lurk behind objects and therefore engage in real firefights with enemy archers. Life is made up of choices The developers of inXile Entertainment have chosen not to make the transition from one character to another free at any time; however the procedure is far from mandatory, or once in front of the crystal that allows us to alternate with the commands of Caddoc or E'lara we can simply go ahead and ignore it, without any problems whatsoever. The puzzles based on the activation of switches, which generally must be solved using the elf and making her shoot flaming arrows towards this or that target, in fact proceed without problems thanks to a certain flexibility of the artificial intelligence that guides our companion. So you can also tackle the whole adventure as one of the two mercenaries, which we actually did by choosing to use Caddoc about halfway through. In fact, the shooter dynamics did not convince us, instead of close combat which after some uncertainty takes shape and returns a more than discreet sensation of impact. In this regard, we must also appreciate the RPG value of the weapons. The shield, for example, loses resistance as we use it to parry blows, and at a certain point it can break, effectively leaving us defenseless (very dangerous thing!). It should therefore be replaced often, preferably with more robust models. Likewise, it is possible to pick up new swords, axes, hammers or bows by selecting them according to their power, with evident effects on the effectiveness of the combos. We mentioned a certain lack of challenge in the normal difficulty setting earlier. Well, in the advanced stages dying is far from impossible and when our vital energy is about to run out we have two options: resort to a health potion, if we have any, or stay on the ground and hope that our partner can heal us. In some situations the AI proves to be punctual and reliable, recovering us quickly, but it has happened more than once that the other character, who remained too far away, was unable to reach us. In fact, the scenario maps are sometimes huge and it is sometimes necessary to resort to the expedient of predetermined cutscenes (the opening of doors which mentions Army of Two, the passage in narrow spaces which mentions God of War, the ~guiding light~ which mentions Prince of Persia) for our companion to materialize at our side. During the first levels you also come across an enigma based on the collection of objects, quite challenging due to the extension of the area in which you have to look for them and above all due to the excessive similarity between the different areas that compose it. But this is an isolated case, which basically concerns the first third of the adventure and which does not do justice to Hunted: The Birth of the Demon, since then the action takes off decisively, with more frequent and tighter fights. The importance of the packaging To recap: a long-lasting single player campaign (we're about thirteen, fourteen hours), which in many situations mentions other video games (see also the cannons of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, rediscovered in several variants), the possibility of playing it in cooperative with a friend and an interesting editor (the Crucible mode) which allows us, indeed in a very simple and intuitive way, to create new levels of the dimensions we prefer, inspired by the scenarios present, with the enemies we want to face and even with ~junctions~ that determine the nature of the route, all to be shared with the community. Fine, but how does the game look from a technical point of view? We have already talked about the bad dialogues in Italian, fortunately, however, the rest boasts a much higher quality: the effects are sufficiently full-bodied without ever shining, while the music manages to underline the epic nature of certain moments. The graphics, which move thanks to the Unreal Engine 3, alternate evocative scenarios, full of details and well designed with others that are ~dirty~, not very varied, characterized by questionable color choices. The yield of the destruction of the buildings, shown in some situations, appears poor, for example, while applause should instead be given to the variety of opponents that we will find along the way. The main characters themselves offer a mix of ups and downs: pretty faces but too many simplistic solutions for the body, with badly smeared textures. The animations are discreet, but the view in certain cases is produced in unlikely shots. Either way, the result is finele manages to be relatively light despite the spectacularity of some situations: on the test configuration, we played at the resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, with all effects maxed out and v-sync activated, obtaining a frame rate of around 60 fps.", "date": "2011-06-15", "grade": "7.0"}
