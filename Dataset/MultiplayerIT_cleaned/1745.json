{"name": "Devil May Cry 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/devil-may-cry-11.html", "text": "The Way of the Demon All those who have been able to enjoy the legendary DMC will know very well who Dante is. For the uninitiated, in addition to being the protagonist of the game, he is the son of Sparda, a demon who had fought against evil before him. In the first chapter, Dante had followed in his father's footsteps in a fight to the death against the king of demons on a mysterious island. Even in DMC2, Dante's purpose will be the same: to defeat a man named Arius who is trying to awaken a god of the underworld. In addition to the legendary Dante, you will be able to impersonate a new character named Lucia: her story, even if in its own right, will intertwine with Dante's and it will therefore be like living the same adventure from two different points of view. The plot is nothing short of ridiculous, flat and not very engaging the usual fried and re-fried soup. To be honest, even that of the first was nothing special, but it must also be said that it was told in a not a little exciting way. Do you remember the ironic conversations between Dante and the various bosses? Or even the fight between Trish and Dante in the opening cinematic? The charisma of the various enemies? Well, forget all about it, because now Dante is a witless curmudgeon, no more jokes, no more charismatic characters, bosses with no personality whatsoever, nothing at all. It seems that Dante goes around killing insignificant demons and that's it! Where is the ~fancy~ Dante who made us exalt so much? We don't know! It's disappeared! Unfortunately the thickness of DMC2 is not even comparable to that of the first one and this is a huge flaw, since it was the feature that made it unique! If you think that these are the only defects, think wrong ... now let's move on to the actual game. DMC2 is predominantly an action game like its predecessor; as I have already said you will play Dante and Lucia in a frantic fight against demons. Both will have particular types of weapons to use (which you can also level up, so you can deal more damage): a pair of pistols and submachine guns, a rocket launcher, a shotgun and three types of swords for Dante, while throwing knives, bombs and various types of stilettos for Lucia. Our two heroes will also have the opportunity to mutate into a demon when a special bar is filled up enough. This, once the transformation of the protagonists is completed, will slowly decrease until it is completely empty: you can well imagine that, as soon as it is reset, you will resume the human form. To enhance your demon you must take particular stones, which confer powers, for example some make the attacks have the force of fire, lightning or ice, while others will increase the attack strength or increase the regeneration of the power. All these upgrades are useless since the attacks will always remain the same: they will be simple enhanced sword blows while the shots from the firearms will always turn into machine gun shots that will come out of the hands of the demon whatever weapon you were using. The game is divided into missions like DMC: 18 for Dante and 13 for Lucia; gameplay has also remained largely the same. The fun will not be lacking, also because Dante has been made more agile and a key has been added that is used exclusively for dodges, making them easier to perform. You'll also be able to hit two enemies at the same time with multi targeting, walk on walls, and have the ability to switch weapons during battles without having to go to the menu and therefore without interrupting the gameplay. Unfortunately, however, the ease that characterizes DMC2 is excessive to say the least. Compared to the first it seems like child's play even at the highest difficulty level. Yes, it is true that the frenzy of the fights, the ~Matrix-like~ moves and the combination of firearms and edged weapons make the playability of a high level and ensure that there is no shortage of fun and excitement, but it is also true that those looking for a bit of a challenge, will be very disappointed. Technique and longevity The technical realization is perhaps the one that does not reveal any defect: spectacular graphics, various and detailed settings (the medieval citadel and the underwater caves are beautiful), metallic soundtrack that fits perfectly with the style of the game; moreover the appearance of the demons, even if as I said before they seem ~empty~ in terms of personality, is very captivating and fascinating. There are slowdowns and they are felt during the most frenetic moments, but they are still very sporadic. Note the plagiarisms of other games such as haunted tanks and helicopters that are very reminiscent of Shinobi, a level on a marina similar to that of Metal Gear Solid and Dante's dodges recall those of Raiden always in MGS2; however, this does not affect their excellent realization. The cameras have been slightly improved, giving you the possibility to keep an eye on everything in certain moments or creating spectacular shots in others, but basically the style has remained unchanged: the background will remain stationary while you move with the character. Longevity is very poor: the first time you play you will finish Dante's chapter in 4 hours and Lucia's in about 2 and a half hours, however it is likely that you will find yourself needing even less time. There are 3 difficulty levels: normal (with which you will start), hard and must die. Every time you finish the game on the various difficulties, both with Dante and Lucia, you'll unlock secrets: new characters (including Trish with nothing less than Sparda), new costumes and a minigame in which you'll find yourself fighting an infinite number of enemies in a ' arena. Comment Here we are at the end, if you have carefully read the body of the review you will well understand that the new born in the Capcom house is not up to its older brother ... unfortunately the disappointment was huge. Many things that characterized the first chapter have been cut, including the two demon modes, the thickness, the difficulty; on the other hand, however, it must be said that, if you know how to take it for what it is without expecting too much, it will give you very pleasant moments given by the high playability and spectacularity which, however, are not comparable to those of the first one. My advice? Buy DMC if you don't already have it, or if you want to get your hands on the world's most massive demon hunter again, wait for the third episode... if you really can't resist try it anyway, if you're not demanding you might even like it. Pros Excellent playability Cons too easy thin plot a big step back from the first Demons, broadswords, firearms and adrenaline are the ingredients of one of the greatest action games ever to appear on PS2 and on any other console: its name is Devil May Cry. More than a year after its release, Capcom offers its highly anticipated sequel that could only make all fans of the first episode happy. However, we specify that the game was only released in the NTSC version, while for the PAL we will have to wait another month; you will therefore need a chiappata console or import to play it. Having said that, imagining that you are wondering if Devil May Cry 2 is up to its predecessor, I announce that the answer to your question is a nice no! That's right, DMC2 has been made worse in many aspects, improved in a few, but to find out more I suggest you keep reading", "date": "2003-02-25", "grade": null}
