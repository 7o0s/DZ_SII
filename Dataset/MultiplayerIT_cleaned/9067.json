Captain Titus and his team are sent to join the resistance forces, but the operation proves more difficult than expected and the commander finds himself on the ground alone, surrounded by Orks and with only basic equipment at his disposal . Advancing within the desert scenarios of Graia, Titus comes into possession of new weapons and reunites with the Ultramarine Leandros and with Sergeant Sidonus, thus forming a small team but capable of weakening the enemy's defenses. Three soldiers against an entire army? Space Marines aren't exactly humans, their bodies have been augmented in various ways and are able to live for hundreds of years, yet the endeavor promises to be hopeless. Fortunately, a new hope is on the horizon: the inquisitor Drogan has conducted a series of research on Graia, coming into possession of a mysterious source of energy that could allow the army of the Imperium to rout the Orks. The point will be to survive long enough to use it. The guys at Relic Entertainment have quite a bit of experience with the Games Workshop license, especially thanks to the strategic series Dawn of War, so the narrative element in Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine does not disappoint: the story is captivating, the characters discreetly characterized (even in their traditional absolutism) and the situations proposed boast the epic and spectacularity that fans expected. Of course, in certain situations one gets the feeling that by daring a little more the developers could have covered the distance that separates the excellent games from the masterpieces of the genre, but in principle we cannot complain: Space Marine confirms that it is the most ambitious production based on Warhammer 40K, and has the numbers to conquer a generous slice of the public; especially on PC and PlayStation 3, given that an unbeatable opponent like Gears of War 3 is missing on these platforms. The blood of martyrs is the seed of the Imperium Speaking of Gears of War, in the course of this review you will often see the Epic Games masterpiece series mentioned, due to the innumerable points of contact with Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine, which in some moments even lead to plagiarism: the text announcing the beginning of a new chapter, Captain Titus who in the early stages of some stages walks communicating with someone else via radio, weapon and view management, etc. To be honest, it must be said that the muscular protagonists of Gears of War, with their enormous armor and Lancer with built-in electric saw, in turn undoubtedly refer to the Space Marines of Warhammer 40,000, so perhaps the developers of Relic Entertainment have thought in turn to draw on what has established itself without a shadow of a doubt as the best third person shooter ever made, in a sort of ~exchange of favours~ that shouldn't make us turn up our noses and that indeed puts the Games Workshop license fans in the face of a work of enormous potential. The PC version, object of the test, differs from the console counterparts due to the high resolution graphics (in our case at 1080p), better textures and a smoother frame rate; however, playing using the keyboard and mouse immediately proves to be an enormous sacrifice, a solution that deprives the title of its peculiar physicality and which therefore must absolutely be set aside in favor of the inevitable Xbox 360 controller, due to whose characteristics the game it was definitely thought of. Having grabbed the pad, Space Marine immediately offers us clashes and situations that alone are worth the ticket price, with an excellent feeling of the weapons and an equally excellent sensation of impact. Pity is a sign of weakness The arsenal available to our character, Captain Titus, ranges from the standard type Requiem (a light machine gun) to the assault one (a submachine gun), from the Hunter Requiem (a sniper rifle) to the plasma cannon, passing for a large number of highly effective variables, such as the controlled detonation grenade launcher, heavy machine gun, sniper laser, flamethrower, and so on. However, the equipment of the Space Marines does not stop at firearms: each soldier also has the terrible Chainsword (a sort of huge electric blade) or variants of the same, for example the Power Ax or the colossal Hammer Thunder, so heavy and lethal that it allows us to use only light weapons when we wield it. It is proprio the alternation of firefights and hand-to-hand combat that makes the gameplay of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine peculiar and differentiates it from the ~shooter only~ approach of Gears of War. Once familiar with the control system and with the typology of enemies, in fact, you find yourself switching from one weapon to another with extreme ease, weakening the hordes of Orks from afar with the Bolter and then crashing them once sword reach. The only shortcoming at this juncture, indeed of no small importance, concerns the combos: our character has only a couple of variants, which makes the close combat rather repetitive, albeit always very spectacular and enriched by short bullet times that they glorify violence. The management of vital energy also differs from the solutions adopted by Epic Games: the bar is fixed and does not recharge over time (apart from multiplayer games, for obvious reasons), albeit an energy shield (this yes rechargeable) protects it from minor damage. There are two ways to recharge energy: the first is to stun certain types of Orks and finish them off with a ~fatality~, an absolutely necessary operation but which must be performed before our conditions are desperate, given that in this situation we will not be invulnerable to enemy attacks; the second is to enter ~fury mode~, pressing both analog sticks on their axis as soon as we have filled a special gauge. In this condition, our Space Marine will not only be able to hit his opponents with extraordinary power, massacring even the biggest and most resistant ones in a short time, but also take advantage of a ~slowed~ fire mode to eliminate distant threats and, precisely, recover energy in the meantime. To ask questions is to doubt The single player campaign of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine presents a good degree of challenge, especially in the more advanced stages, and situations that are sufficiently varied to marry effectively with the plot, without dull moments and gradually proposing stronger and more numerous enemies . The desire to face the seventeen levels again after finishing the game is great, although the only extras are represented by the ~holoskulls~ and the audio testimonies contained therein, which further enrich the narrative implications of the Relic Entertainment title. However, there are other elements capable of significantly increasing the duration of the experience, and we are obviously referring to the two multiplayer modes currently available, to which a ~horde~ style co-op for four people will be added in October. The modes in question see two teams of eight players face off in spectacular deathmatches (Annihilation) and games based on territory control (Capture of the Objective), within five fairly large maps and using three different Space Marine classes: the Tactical Marine (or his evil counterpart, the Chaos Space Marine), balanced in equipment and capable of using all firearms; the Devastator Marine (or the Chaos Havok), with great firepower at the expense of agility and the ability to fight in close combat; the Assault Marine (or the Chaos Raptor), specialized in close quarters battles and equipped with a jetpack to swoop down on enemies from above. The current matchmaking system unfortunately leaves something to be desired, in fact we managed to play a few games and the presence of lag was often noticed to affect the quality of the experience, but we are confident in an update that can put things right. After all, the multiplayer potential in Space Marine is high, also in this case with particular reference to the PC and PlayStation 3 platforms, and the arrival of a patch as well as the already announced cooperative mode can only increase the incisiveness of the online sector. also given the presence of rich facets in terms of customization and unlockable extras. You serve the Emperor today, you may be dead tomorrow The inevitable analysis of the technical sector of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine cannot ignore the huge base of fans of the Games Workshop license, who will undoubtedly be conquered by the excellent visual rendering of the Space Marines and some particularly inspired scenarios. The strong point of the game, at this juncture, certainly lies in the spectacularity of the fights, which you can see from the accompanying images and which makes extensive use of a representation of violence that is sometimes cartoonish (see the animation of the blood splatters) but big impact. Captain Titus and his companions move convincingly, with a good set of animations, and the rendering of their heavy armor is underlined by the ~shake~ of the view during the run, even if the final result is less successful than the same sequences in Gears of War. Relic has also done an excellent job with regard to enemies, from the smallest to the largest Orks, from pure warriors to wizards who attack us from above, passing through the warships that we will be called to take down using fixed positions as well as the new types of opponents that we will get to know during the final stages of the campaign. The characterization of the scenarios is less brilliant, which especially in the open field leaves something to be desired and lacks personality. The physical behavior of certain objects, for example the walls of a collapsing building, appears too simplistic and unlikely, while things improve in indoor settings, thanks to the constant references to the gothic architecture of the Forge World. The sound compartment accompanies the action very well, even if the lack of more intense musical pieces is felt a bit: the most agitated phases are indicated by the growing drum roll and it is an adequate solution, but in fact it seemed to be missing a more comprehensive soundtrack, in the style of ~colossal cinema~. On the other hand, the effects are very good, with the sound of the weapons that change markedly when the magazine is emptying, while the dubbing moves between highs and lows: some characters enjoy a medium / high level interpretation, at times even intense , like that of the inquisitor Drogan (voiced by the veteran Marco Balzarotti, or at least it seemed to us), but every now and then a voice emerges outside the grace of God and lowers the general tenor a bit. Also noteworthy is the nice appearance of Pietro Ubaldi towards the end: in what looks like a Gears of War clone, Dizzy's voice actor could not be missing, right?", "date": "2011-09-26", "grade": "8.0"}
