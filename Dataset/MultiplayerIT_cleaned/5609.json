It is a dungeon crawler with traditional features, indeed characterized by a very slow start and a learning curve that is not very suitable for the usual immediacy of mobile gaming, without suggestions or indications on the interface, which could especially put gamers in crisis occasional. Once this obstacle has been overcome, however, some interesting variations on the theme are introduced, in particular the possibility of controlling up to seven characters instead of the only initial wizard, which gives the gameplay a not indifferent strategic substrate. The game immediately throws us into the action, starting from the first of the fourteen scenarios available in view of a rather long and demanding campaign, which gradually becomes more complex. The approach adopted by the developers in this sense seemed to us the best possible: you can play up to the fourth setting completely free, then decide whether to buy the new levels individually for 99 cents or unlock the entire experience for the price of 6. 99 euros. At that point, you can be sure, you will have a very precise picture of the product and you can decide whether or not to invest your money to fully enjoy it. 7 Mages is a great exponent for the dungeon crawler genre, an interesting and challenging title Underground 7 Mages has two configurations for touch controls: the default one works with gestures and allows you to move forward, backward, turn or sideways by drawing lines with your fingers in the respective directions, while a second option has virtual buttons for greater precision . During our tests we found both solutions valid. The icons at the bottom of the screen find a function during ~combat mode~, which is activated as soon as an enemy appears on the horizon. When he's within range, we can hit him with conventional weapons or use magic, always keeping an eye on the values of vitality and mystical energy, which can be restored by taking potions or simply by taking a nap if possible. The combat system works in turns and, as already mentioned, the strategic depth of the game takes on different connotations as you progress, new characters and skills are unlocked, objects are collected to enrich one's equipment and so on. At first, even in this case, the situation is a bit desolate, slow and boring, and the same should be said for the environmental puzzles: very often opening doors and activating mechanisms requires somewhat obscure reasoning, so it could happen that you remain stuck because you don't understand how to solve a puzzle, and this factor will artificially increase the duration of the adventure. However, it must also be said that the fast move function, once the map has been called up, manages to smooth out the corners of an experience that with less foresight could also have become tedious due to excessive backtracking. On the technical implementation front, Napoleon Games has done an excellent job, with settings that are certainly repetitive in their elements (see the textures on the walls), but endowed with a precise personality and capable of creating a great atmosphere. Thanks also to a functional and spot-on sound accompaniment.", "date": "2016-04-02", "grade": "8.0"}
