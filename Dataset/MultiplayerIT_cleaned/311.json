If the FPS winks at strategy and role-playing, the RTS genre cannot be outdone, already loved by a large slice of the public and protagonist of the greatest revolutions. The real-time strategy genre often relies on fantasy to find a way to success. In fact, the vast majority of genre titles take their cue from the fantastic imagination typical of the West, inhabited by fairies, elves, ogres, swords and magic. Heroes of Annihilated Empires seems to want to take this path, providing a product that starts from the classic RTS, adding RPG characteristics to this and emulsifying everything with a healthy dose of fantasy. A music already heard then. Yet the news is always hiding around the corner. Elven courage The incipit of the game is one of the most classic. Choosing the ~campaign~ mode, passing through a pleasant introductory movie, we learn about the great battle that is raging at the gates of the elven city to which, unaware of everything, our hero Elhant is going. The dead have risen from their graves to wreak havoc among the elven ranks. Moved by a sense of duty, Elhant challenges his courage and decides to head towards battle, disliked by the army of elven archers who in the meantime is retreating into the forest. Our first goal is already evident. It will be up to us to instill new courage among the troops and try to block the seemingly unstoppable advance of the living dead. moved by a sense of duty Elhant takes up his courage and decides to head towards battle, disliked by the army of elven archers who in the meantime is retreating into the forest Elven courage Once in the rear we find refuge under a watchtower, which succeeds well in the attempt to repel the enemy's assaults with enchanted darts. To the dismay of the soldiers and of Elhant himself, we try to go upstream against the mass of elven refugees and retreating troops. We notice that some elves are determined to resist alongside us and we form the first troop under our command. With some elf archers at our disposal and a handful of good pikemen we can anticipate the game characteristics on which the entire gameplay is developed. The hero has an inventory in which to collect the numerous objects abandoned on the ground or dropped by the intermediate bosses; these items can be equipped to improve the characteristics of the same hero. Leafing through the dedicated menu, we discover that the elf also has a small list of spells to use in battle, some of them are able to improve the basic characteristics of the hero, others are capable of influencing the quality of combat of the troops at close to him, within a limited range. RPG vs. RTS That's it and the first part of the mystery is revealed. Heroes of Annihilated Empires aims to bring the classic features of the arcade RPG to the land dominated by real-time strategy. The character, the hero, can level up by accumulating experience in battle, has characteristics of health and magical strength (mana) and generic characteristics such as resistance to magic, speed, strength, dexterity (thirteen in total). All alterable through the use of special objects. And it also has a class to which it belongs. Elhant in particular is a ranger, and like any ranger he is distinguished by the use of ranged weapons, the bow in primis, and by the great agility that allows him to get around the enemy and strike in complete safety. The hero, exalted by personal characteristics and by the availability of these powerful objects, constitutes a weapon bordering on invincibility, which must be supported by the troops only in extreme cases, or at least this is what the developers have set themselves. With the development of the plot we reach the point of total union with the classic RTS. Elhant meets the help of the fairies who provide the people of the elves with support for the collection of natural resources and the construction of the buildings of the sylvan cities. the character, the hero, can level up by accumulating experience in battle, has characteristics of health and magical strength (mana) and generic characteristics such as resistance to magic, speed, strength, dexterity (thirteen in total) RPG vs. RTS The great themes of real-time strategy emerge again. Harvesting or rather collection of resources; theme so muchor dear as critical for this genre. HoAE pursues the philosophy of unlimited resources; once a source has been identified, in fact, one will not have to worry about its depletion as it will simply provide the resource until the end of the level. Gold, iron, stone, timber and food are the materials with which it is possible to build buildings and train troops. The hero, on the other hand, possesses the coins, which can be conquered during battles with enemies, the only material of exchange for the purchase of weapons and magic potions. The production of basic units is extremely cheap and it is equally easy to have new free places for the creation of new troops. In essence, the game aims to make disproportionately large armies available to the player, made up of hundreds (up to thousands) of units. Although sophisticated control tools are not supplied for the management of the troops and their ordering on the field, the grouped troops are able to arrange themselves in simple and orderly formations, following the basic strategic rules. The same abundance is not provided for the figure of the special units, often real unique pieces of the army that can be enlisted only on the death of those already created. The high mortality of the troop, the right supply of power and skill of the special units and the singular and fundamental presence of the hero in the field constitute a good point in favor of this title. Goblins, orcs and magic cards During the development of the story we understand that the facets of the hero are not finished. Wandering around the map, there are numerous encounters that can be made. We understand that the world of HoAE is dominated by a very large variety of imaginative races, more or less belonging to the canonical fantasy (although very welcome variations on the theme appear from time to time). Ursids, gnolls, goblins, orcs, trolls, yetis, draconians are all part of the rich bestiary designed for the setting of the title. It happens from time to time to come across clusters of huts or real cities. Each of them is dominated by its own style, inextricably linked to the occupying race. Among the buildings you can find special trading points where you can buy or sell items for your hero. Among them, the library stands out, from which it is possible to learn new spells and magical abilities. the magic system is dominated by the presence of ~cards~, each of which contains one or more characteristics to be exploited in battle Goblins, orcs and magic cards The magic system is dominated by the presence of ~cards~, each of which contains one or more characteristics to be exploited in battle. The spells can be passive, i.e. usable only in terms of increasing the characteristics by proximity to the hero who is using the card in question, or active, therefore capable of acting directly on the units, for example by conferring the power to throw fireballs or unleashing natural phenomena of enormous proportions. What you don't expect from such a game however is the unusual presence of elements alien to the classic setting. In fact, strange things were rumored on the relative forums for some time, and playing HoAE we realized that in fact not everything is as it seems. The box that contains the game underlines that this title is only the first in a series that will constitute a saga, some official banners already provided clues on the subject, thrown there as if to tickle the curiosity and the subconscious of the players. The fact remains that continuing with the adventure it happens to come across strange marks on the ground, such as those left by the tracks of a tank, and when we meet the carcass of an aircraft we understand that something unusual is hidden underneath, but apparently this first chapter will leave us in suspense. Four races, one world We have already had the opportunity to talk about the sylvan people, and we have made the acquaintance of Elhant, one of the available heroes. Switching to skirmish mode we have the opportunity to play with the remaining three races and immediately control two new types of hero. In addition to the sylvan elf race, there are those of the Undead (already encountered in the campaign), the Cryo, inhabitants of the frozen lands, and that of the Mechanical People, or rather a dwarven society based on advanced knowledge in the field of technique and of industrial production, in a decidedly steam punk style. Among the classes available to the hero we find that of the Ranger (the same as Elhant), that of the Warrior and that of the Magician (or Technomancer in the case of dwarves). The game in this mode has some rules that prevent the use of unscrupuloustion of the hero's power in the early stages. Once the player has found a propitious place for the foundation of his own settlement (typically the one richest in resources) he summons some units of workers through the hero, at the same time the hero will immediately freeze, remaining in this state for thirty minutes. In the meantime, the foundations will have to be laid for the creation of a sufficiently competitive army to subsequently accompany the hero in conquering the map and annihilating the enemy. The game mechanics are similar for each race, although it is easy to see the unique differences between one and the other on the battlefield. The elves prefer the use of force at a distance, they have powerful units in large numbers but not very resistant to close combat attacks; very fast, they can be easily reallocated on the field to contain the attacks quickly. The dwarves, faced with a slowness in their movements which reduces the application of retreats once the battle has begun, can count on the power of their firearms, on the grandeur of golem units (unique, but devastating) and on the high resistance of the units. The Cryos have a power based mainly on the melee attack and on the slowing of the enemy, while being able to have a good range of giant units. The undead they favor mass attack and the use of curse spells that reduce the effects of opposing attacks. while the campaign-based game offers a guided path in which the alternation of the single (or almost) use of the hero often gives way to the more massive use of the troop, the game in skirmish mode leaves free rein to the player's choice Four races, one world While the campaign-based game offers a guided path in which the alternation of the single (or almost) use of the hero often gives way to the more massive use of the troop, the game in skirmish mode leaves free rein to the player's choice . It is possible to choose a totally rolistic setting and postpone the summoning of the units designated for construction. In this way it is possible to explore the map with the hero, looking for enemies that can be beaten at the first experience levels. By making the hero grow, it is then possible to decide to summon the workers at a later time; the greater the power of the character, the greater the number of workers summoned. It all depends on the strategy chosen for the battle and the type of gaming experience you want to have. Finally, it is possible to recruit neutral units to support your hero. These units are scattered on the map in small groups, and can be exterminated to conquer their treasures, but certainly their use as mercenaries can prove to be more profitable than any other barbaric conquest enterprise. Each neutral race has its own characteristics ranging from cheaper hires to better efficiency in the field; the skills of special characters, such as those of the orc shamans, are then a real boon as they allow a wide range of bonuses ranging from aura of protection to healing units and heroes. However, it is worth remembering that the neutral units recruited as mercenaries do not act under the direct control of the player but, once engaged, they begin to produce units until they have a sufficient number to launch an attack on the closest enemy in total autonomy. Final comment Here we are at the final comment of this first chapter of the Heroes of Annihilated Empires saga. There are several elements that must be taken into consideration. First of all, it should be remembered that HoAE's primary objective is to provide the player with a varied and as original product as possible. We feel like saying that the first goal has been reached. From the point of view of the technical realization we were faced with a sort of split personality. Initially the game does not seem to exceed the standards much, as regards the graphic system in particular. Nonetheless, the maps demonstrate respectable attention to detail, fully supported by the 3D graphics engine. The units are well made and it is a real pity that the limited zoom penalizes the hunger of the player's eyes, who cannot thus enjoy the good workmanship of the models in its entirety. The only flaw of the graphics engine is a small flaw in the management of the rotation of the camera and the consequent rotation of the unit models. Another flaw lies in the somewhat too weak management of the artificial intelligence of the computer-controlled units. What to say then? We could be facing the beginning of a masterpiece, the swan song. For now, let's talk", "date": "2006-10-27", "grade": null}
