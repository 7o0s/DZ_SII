{"name": "Pangya! Golf with Style - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pangya-golf-with-style-recensione.html", "text": "Pangya! Golf with Style is not a conventional golf game, it's a golf game made up of super deformed style characters, golf courses that could have come out of Lewis Carroll's imagination (if he had been born in Japan and had written manga instead of novels ), of not always human caddies that move at supersonic speed, of improbable clubs, and above all it is a game that bases its structure on the fun and lightness of the games. The Pangya party, the main mode and - above all - event on which the structure of the story is based, is the tournament in which the player is invited to take part. In this mode, you follow exactly what the story offers, taking part in a series of 3/6/9 or 18-hole competitions against increasingly tough opponents; at the beginning the game gives the possibility of being able to select between only two characters present (one male and one female), however, by completing the Pangya party you can unlock the entire cast of characters present in the game, characters that -it must be emphasized- follow perfectly those that are Tecmo clichs: girls with tiny costumes, mysterious ninjas, nurses, cat women, army commanders and men dressed in black leather with flames on their hips. The Pangya party represents the classic match play mode of golf, in which two or more players challenge each other along a series of holes and the player who has obtained the best score on as many holes as possible is the winner; this event, while actually representing the main game mode, suffers from a very big flaw: slowness. Playing at the Pangya party is often equivalent to not playing: the interludes dedicated to the story, despite being relatively short, are slow, boring and above all not skippable (moreover, the dialogues do not contain information of particular importance), in the same way the clips in which it is the CPU that plays the coup they are tedious in the long run, reaching the only result of unnecessarily breaking the game. Parallel to the main event, however, there is a much more interesting mode called ~stroke competition~ which puts the player to the test alone: the 18 holes are played in rapid succession as happens on a real golf course, and in the interludes between one hole and another, the updated results of the hole are highlighted, with the situation of all the other players on the course. Furthermore, this mode, unlike the Pangya event, allows the player to select the track where to compete, choosing from the many bizarre ones offered by the game. The ~hole competition~ concludes the count of the single player modes where, in a very similar way to match play, you compete against a single opponent trying to win as many holes as possible. The multiplayer of Pangya, unlike the PC version from which it was inspired, does not allow any online challenge, however it allows four players to arm themselves with remotes and challenge each other to the sound of stroke competitions, pit competitions and to challenge each other in an exhilarating competitions to pop balloons. One of Pangya's biggest misfortunes is probably that of not having arrived at the launch of the Wii, on December 8, but in June, many months after Tiger Woods 07, certainly not his direct competitor, but the game that partially defined control of any golf game on Wii. The control system, in fact, is probably one of Pangya's biggest flaws, managing to combine little precision, a lot of confusion and a use of the remote that is halfway between the golf experience with a normal joypad and the It's now a classic swing movement. The game control system, as mentioned earlier, bases its structure on what is in fact a hybrid between practically all the golf games published up to last year with the classic power bar (a button to load it and another to determine the power of the shot) and the innovative system implemented by both Wii Sports and Tiger Woods, where the player swings more or less complete to give power to the shot. Pangya gives the player a power bar to charge with the first phase of the swing (the one that actually brings the club/remote from the ground to behind the back) and then forces him to press A -thus setting the power of the shot- and conclude the swing to determine just the -possible- effects to the right or left. The developers' choice to insert a control of this type is rather strange because at the same time it fails to offer a complete golf experience and also distorts the old method. One of the cornerstones of Pangya! Golf with Style is represented by the in-game currency, the Pang. This type of currency is ~delivered~ to players at the exact moment they take parti hitscularly complex, powerful or precise, or simply after successfully completing a match against an opponent. The Pangs are not only a parameter of skill of the player, but are useful to expand the gaming experience thanks to the items in the shop. The shop is configured as a real emporium where you can indulge yourself with the purchase of clothes and accessories (there are both complete sets and loose clothes, perfect for creating your own style) and interact with your room, a personal space where you he can select the set of clubs, the caddy to be accompanied by, equip particular objects to be used as a bonus during the races and finally view extra material to unlock such as artwork and songs. The setting, style and characterization have a strong reference to Japanese culture, and more precisely to that of the ~otaku~, or manga and anime lovers. Unfortunately - albeit in intention - the work of the developers remains excellent thanks to the highly inspired settings, the visual impact is equal and nothing more than that of a gamecube, with dull and washed out textures, meager particle effects and a slight flicker that rages in the background. Musically speaking, Pangya fails to surprise, the tunes that follow the deeds of the players in the long track turn out to be boring and monotonous after a few games and in the same way the sound effects fail to give the characters a characterization worthy of their appearance. The moral of the story? Pangya! Golf with Style is neither fish nor fowl: a good characterization and a gameplay based mainly on fun is associated with a decidedly outdated control and a probably inadequate game structure. The biggest misfortune, it must be reiterated, was that it didn't represent a launch game for the Wii (Pangya would have worked very well) and came out after the excellent Tiger Woods. In its simplicity and accessibility even Wii Sports golf works much better. Probably the developers should have kept firm what were the foundations of the success of the PC version, online multiplayer in the first place, and then who knows, maybe insert modes much more suitable for console multiplayer. It is said that you learn from making mistakes, now we wait to see Ntreev's next move. Pros: Fun and long-lived Characterization and setting decidedly above average Control system a bit confusing Modes not very varied Graphically inadequate Once upon a time there was a small Korean developer named Ntreev who developed a free online golf game called PangYa that was so successful in his country that it made a name for itself in virtually every computerized area of the world. One day several years ago, the road of the Ntreevs met that of Nintendo: the Korean developers had in their hands a video game absolutely loved by the public, fun to play and at the top of its internet success, Nintendo on the other hand had a ~revolutionary~ project that would have changed the way of understanding the modern video game. The two, united in the same vision and for a single purpose, decided to travel the rest of the road together, passing through places with ancient names such as ~e3~ and ~TGS~ and finally arriving in the sacred place of the video game called ~shop~. Thus was born Pangya! Golf with Style, transposition for Wii of the homonymous pc game by Ntreev under the supervision of Tecmo and so the story continues, with golf that seems to have become the most attractive sport for those who develop on the Nintendo revolution.", "date": "2007-06-29", "grade": null}
