Is this a superfluous remark? Indeed, is it right to understand the lack of involvement that a niche sport can result in the evaluation of the game? Some might say that it is normal for a sports simulation to be of interest above all to fans of this sport, therefore such a consideration would make little sense, but the question, in the case of NHL 13 and of all the latest chapters of the series in general, is hard. The quality of the simulation of EA Canada is evident but in the face of a structure so complex as to require a rather long period of adaptation, moreover burdened by the total absence of the Italian language, the passion, or at least the keen interest in such a sport ~ exotic~ becomes an element of fundamental importance. In short, it is a question of immersing oneself within a complex team sport, assimilating all the various aspects and mechanics, all the more to also enjoy the managerial side elements which in this new chapter have great importance in the very structure of the game and in all this should be added transport - the ~breathing hockey~ that EA manages so well to instill in its productions - which should seize the player as an essential element to fully enjoy the title in question. This NHL 13 is therefore a particular case and its evaluation is not a simple matter, because in absolute terms it is simply the best ice hockey simulation further perfected in this edition, yet the game can still be not very enjoyable due to its high rate of involvement required in the topic at hand. What is evident, in any case, is precisely the confirmation of the positive trend of EA Canada, which with NHL 13 demonstrates once again how the annual cadence of a sports simulation can also represent a real and honest opportunity for self-improvement. For fans, the situation is obviously different: the release of the new NHL chapter represents a guaranteed celebration, especially in a year that could appear to be completely devoid of the real counterpart of the American Hockey Championship, given the new problems that have arisen between team owners and player associations. Check first The major evolutions made in the last chapters of the series, beyond the mere graphic creation and content additions, are all attributable to the control system, a fundamental element of the gameplay on which the team has particularly concentrated. Starting from a conceptual upheaval that has shifted all attention to the analog sticks, in the last few chapters we first witnessed the introduction of the excellent ~Skill Stick~ system, which transfers all the various possibilities of hitting with the club, previously always relegated to front buttons, entirely to the movement of the right analog stick and then to the new ~True Performance Skating~ which is presented for the first time in this chapter. The search for complete control has also led to a decisive step forward as regards the movement of players on skates, introducing a series of variables that take into consideration the position, size and speed of the character with implementations at the physics level, derived by the capabilities of the Impact Engine. In this way the skating movement, which remained standardized and automatic for a long time, becomes an integral part of the gameplay, delegating to the user a series of choices that substantially change the approach to the game. By holding down the left trigger, for example, it is possible to move the body back and forth to protect the puck, make sudden changes in speed and direction with spectacular braking or skate backwards in a defensive attitude. Added to this is the almost complete control over the movement of the club, which allows us to precisely decide the power and direction of the shot, the feints and dekeing, for a much more physical and realistic management of the players and their relationship with the spot and with ice under the skates. Having abandoned the excessive inertia that characterized the previous chapters, with the consequent sense of excessive lightness transferred by the motion of the players, the new engine is able to return much more convincing sensations, with a much more evident physicality than the characters on the ice. The evolutions of the Impact Engine which calculates any type of contact - voluntary orrandom - between body and body and between stick and body. Among the novelties, we also note the presence of a specific control for melee against the barriers on the sides of the ice rink, with the possibility of pressing the opponent or defending oneself from the pressure by releasing the puck at the right moment, and a more extensive control system during ~fights~ to the sound of fists with other players, another historical ~folk~ element of video game simulations dedicated to ice hockey. Let's be clear, the search for realism and the large quantity of commands and variables entrusted to the user also determine an intrinsic difficulty in the control system which requires a long period of adaptation, one of the elements for which it is desirable, as previously said, a certain passion for the subject in question in order to achieve complete mastery of the gameplay, but it is a structure capable of giving great satisfaction once it is assimilated. A universe of options Each new chapter of the NHL adds something to the base of historically established options, expanding a cornucopia of content in which it is easy to get lost. NHL 13 presents a number of layered options between offline and online to make it really difficult to fully explore the playful offer. The Hockey Ultimate Team returns in this chapter, i.e. a managerial implementation that is based on the use of stickers to conquer, modify or exchange, some representing the various players and others ~consumables~, to be carefully managed to modify the performance of the team. squad. One of the novelties is represented by the GM Connected mode, which takes the ~Be a GM~ option - based on the fusion of the managerial approach to the game with classic games - and places it within a huge online context capable of involving up to 750 players online at the same time, all placed in different roles, between players and coaches. Obviously, given the impossibility of providing a continuous experience with such a mass of players, the CPU will introduce itself if necessary to replace disconnected users and fill in vacant spaces, but it is still the grandest Dynasty mode ever seen online. NHL Moments Live is another new introduction and recalls the old ~scenario mode~, offering historical NHL situations, famous games or performances by legendary players, to be recreated in the game. The other modes are the well-established ones, namely the managerial ~Be a GM~, the classic ~Be a Pro~, in which we find ourselves playing a single player and living an entire career starting from the Canadian Hockey League to get up to NHL, trying to achieve the objectives imparted gradually by the game and the coach, the ~Be a Legend~ that allows us to play one of the legends of American hockey such as Gretzky, Lemieux, Kurri, Hasek, Gilmour and others and recreate the respective careers and the usual plethora of standard modes. These include simple offline and online games, leagues, customizable or predefined tournaments, EA Sports Hockey League and more. In short, these are modes that can be more or less interesting but their quantity is impressive and manages to always keep the interest high by varying the gaming experience in many possible alternatives, also lengthening the general longevity. Also from this point of view, the work carried out by EA is commendable and demonstrates once again how the NHL series represents a bit the flagship of the entire simulation production of EA Sports. Xbox 360 goals There are 47 unlockable achievements for the usual total of 1000 points to collect within the game. Since this is a title characterized by an enormous amount of different modes, for the complete collection it is necessary to range as much as possible between all the corners of the playful offer of which it is composed and this requires time and dedication, also considering the need to play a lot online. It breathes hockey The typical spectacularization work implemented by EA also remains in this chapter, which exudes passion for ice hockey by the developers themselves, one would say. The reproduction of stadiums and players is extremely accurate and the general effect is remarkably close to reality, although here even more emphasized, since it is a game that, although simulative, still focuses on several arcade features, which stage the most spectacular hockey possible. The animations, also given the introduction of True Performance Skating, are now more variable and unpredictable, although the Impact Engine still maintains a certain margin of ~strangeness~, which reveals itself in bizarre reactions based on collisionsdetails, but these are rare moments. For the rest, the repertoire of movements and fundamentals, combined with the total control of the players, truly generates a realistic effect at unprecedented levels, which combined with the paroxysmal emphasis with which the sport in question is represented, typical of EA Sports productions, leads to an exhilarating spectacle. There are also improvements to the artificial intelligence, another aspect on which EA has worked intensely for NHL 13, which lead to more complex behaviors on the part of the players, which is evident both in the approach of the opponents and in the careful construction of the choral maneuvers from your team, in case you control only one player as in Be a Pro mode. There is a significant gap between the easy level and the one just above it and you get the impression of not being able to find the golden mean between excessive immobility and robotic infallibility of the opponents passing from one to another, but working on the management of all the various aspects of the game through the complex system of sliders it is always possible to find the optimal situation, only in this case too some dedication to the game is required. The audio accompaniment stands at the same levels as in recent years, with the presence of the same commentators (obviously in English), typical noises and jingles from the ice rink and the usual licensed rocking songs for the long moments spent between the game menus .", "date": "2012-09-12", "grade": "8.8"}
