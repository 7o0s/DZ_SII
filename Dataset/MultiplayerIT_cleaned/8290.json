However, when a title like The World Ends with You: Solo Remix appears in the first category, it is really difficult to complain about the recycling operation, and it is even possible to swallow the bite of the 14.49 requested on the iPhone, which they become 15.99 on an iPad with a dedicated version that does not, however, benefit from the Retina display. A lot of money for sure, but those who love Jrpg and have never played the 2008 original on DS should really proceed with the purchase without too many thoughts. A pin to bring them all If you want to know everything about the plot and gameplay, we refer you to our in-depth review of the version for the Nintendo portable, from which this re-edition takes up the vast majority of the contents; in fact, here we prefer to minimize repetitions, thus limiting ourselves to describing the game and reporting the innovations introduced. The protagonist of the adventure is Neku, a braggart and a bit sociopathic teenager who cannot ~understand people~, as he himself states in one of the first dialogues; the setting is Shibuya, a splendid district-city of Tokyo, one of the most famous of the Japanese metropolis. The turning point comes when Neku mysteriously finds himself in possession of a pin with an extraordinary power, namely that of allowing him to listen to people's thoughts; and as if that weren't enough, he also becomes an unwilling part of a ~game~ against the Reaper that is anything but fun, lasting seven days, in which being able to win is equivalent to (re) surviving. The story then develops in an incredibly engaging way, between well-characterized characters and situations with extraordinary variety. The pin system, on which the gameplay of the combat phases practically completely rests, constitutes yet another successful aspect of The World Ends with You: Solo Remix; in practice, each brooch collected provides a power (or ability) to the protagonist, who can freely manage those equipped during the clashes, however, paying attention to the recharge periods of each of them. Compared to the DS version, it is precisely in the fights that one of the major novelties can be found: if in the Nintendo console, thanks to the two screens, the actions of both Neku and his partner were managed simultaneously, in this case on the only touch screen it was decided to relegating the companion to a ~summon~, to call him thus to occasionally support the hero's otherwise solitary struggle. The use of the powers of the various pins requires you to interact with the screen through a whole series of ~gestures~ that have now become commonly used: swipes, taps, or slightly more complex things. That this control method is better than the one on DS cannot really be said, but in any case it proves to be an acceptable alternative and which does not deteriorate too much the quality of the overall experience, even if it makes it a little more chaotic and imprecise . As far as the graphic quality is concerned, however, there is no doubt that the work of the Japanese artists headed by Tetsuya Nomura has enjoyed immensely the high definition rendering allowed by the Apple platforms; if on the iPhone the result is excellent, on the more comfortable (to play) new iPad instead the resolution of the Retina Display has not been reached, making the glance a little less exciting. Faced with this aspect, the decision to publish not a single universal version, but two distinct ones for smartphones and tablets, therefore appears even less understandable. On these aspects, Square Enix undoubtedly still has a lot to learn.", "date": "2012-10-03", "grade": "8.9"}
