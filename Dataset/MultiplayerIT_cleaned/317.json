I would like spears, halberds and excellent milk to curdle! In fact, the introduction of flying units, witches, dragons or the already mentioned ice giants, involve a planning of attack and defense that is independent of the presence of classic siege weapons such as catapults and ballistae. The many units at our disposal are also very well thought out and push the player not to rely only on the more powerful ones. The army must be built as heterogeneously as possible. Every soldier, every mechanical means, from the infantryman to the siege tower, has its perfect counterpart capable of effectively countering it. Same thing goes for magical units. Once upon a time there was a knight, a vampire and a warrior from the northern lands... The boys of Fire Fly Studios, anno Domini 2006, retrace their steps proposing a revised and corrected version of the second episode of the saga that made us appreciate, better than a good textbook, the joys, and especially the pains of life in a castle. The game system has remained the same, but as already seen during the hands-on, the historical verisimilitude has been abandoned in favor of a mix of fantasy, fantasy and pure management, which smells like a commercial lifeline a mile away. As if to say, we can control dragons, witches and ice giants, but at the same time we must also provide for the food sustenance of our village. After having faced an exhaustive tutorial, which allows us to get to the heart of the singular economic and military management of the castle, we can choose which of the three single player campaigns to face. The Legends Campaign can be tackled without a precise order, but Stronghold Legends warns us that each of them is saddled with a different level of difficulty as well as a different faction. We can therefore choose between playing King Arthur, the hero of the Nibelung sagas Siegfried and the evil incarnate Dracula, in the guise not of a vampire (sigh!) but of a ruthless leader. Unfortunately all three campaigns are independent, there is no narrative link between them. Each of these heroes, as is now the practice of modern RTS, can summon special units, obviously specific to their iconic background. We will then have the opportunity to hurl giants and ice maidens, knights with saving abilities, werewolves and similar amenities at our opponents. Once upon a time there was a knight, a vampire and a warrior from the northern lands... These faction star players are nothing compared to the real special guests of the game. Great and mighty dragons can be called upon to aid our armies, each with their own characteristics and attacks. These, in addition to being as lethal as a heavy machine gun for infantry, are literally a godsend against castles and fortifications in general. The other game modes, in addition to the well thought out multiplayer, are represented by a classic skirmish mode and by La Via delle Leggende, a series of clashes in succession with other armies, and user maps, which as the name suggests, give us the possibility to engage in battles on maps that we ourselves have created. The mission editor at our disposal is decidedly powerful and unexpectedly easy to use. With a few simple and skilful clicks, we can create complicated orographic systems from scratch, build impregnable strongholds and decide alliances between the warring factions. Graphics: October 16, 2001, or the praise of detail and slowness When it comes to deploying the troops, choosing whether to protect the flanks leaving the cavalry behind, when we decide whether to send the ice giant forward or to dig a tunnel to take the castle in the Viet Cong way, in these situations SL mercilessly shows us all its shortcomings. Simply moving a large number of foot soldiers is painful and frustrating. Our men appear to be decidedly staid and equipped only in first gear. Everything translates into an exasperating slowness, which often leads to a slow motion effect, bordering on bullet time, definitely embarrassing. As if that weren't enough, the unit detection system fails over and over again, forcing us, when selecting multiple units together, to a precision worthy of much more rewarding Photoshop sessions. Unfortunately, the criticisms do not end there. Even if we had taken the time machine and gone back at least five decades, we would have had the pleasure of running into such marked pathfinding problems and obviously an artificial intelligence that is decidedly not worthy of the name. Examples are the moments when some foot soldiers get stuck behind a tree or decide to go funghi, oblivious to the battle that is taking place no more than 3 meters from them. But even more serious, in the event of a furious melee only the closest units attack while the others, who may be behind them, remain stationary. Add this to the point-and-click problems listed above and a decidedly negative picture emerges. It is very sad that the solid military structure of the game is mortified by a poor realization of mechanisms which, in the light of the ruthless competition in the sector, represent the minimum conditions for a good game. Graphics: October 16, 2001, or the praise of detail and slowness This carelessness of realization also invalidates the cosmetic component of SL, which although it can be said to be light years away from the best that can be seen around these days, is decidedly inspired and well made, especially as regards the individual units, which appear, even during melee rages, instantly recognizable. The animations of the latter are well done, especially those concerning the knights, who lunge and slash with the elegance of masters of arms. It is a pity, however, that sometimes the speed of execution drops practically to zero, thus making the pair with the equally low movement speed. Instead, the castles and the environment in general appear dull, flat and poor in detail despite the use of bump mapping and other graphic refinements. Negativity of this kind heavily betrays the no longer young age of the graphics engine. In the end, however, what is little more than a simple graphic revamping is not sufficient to mask deep structural deficiencies. Polygons aside, SL does not have the characteristics to deserve full sufficiency. The audio part, on the other hand, is excellently done and enjoys a respectable dubbing, both from the point of view of interpretation and from that of the correctness of the translations. Final comment In the end, the judgment on Stronghold Legends can only be partially negative. Too many and decidedly serious flaws in terms of mechanics penalize a game that already in itself reveals little appeal and a strong feeling of deja vu. In fact SL fails to emerge from the mass of RTS with a fantasy background that infest our PCs, while offering an interesting setting and an excellent variety of units available to the player that tend to smooth out the negativity of the gameplay but, unfortunately, the project gets lost in a particularly flourishing moment of excellent real-time strategy. Pros Great voice acting Great variety of units and vehicles available Cons Terrible artificial intelligence Frustrating control method Graphically below average Greetings! I would like spears, halberds and excellent milk to curdle! That said, the first missions of each faction present us with a fait accompli. SL is a simple reissue of the previous chapters, in which only the main players change. We therefore have the same resource management system, which differs from the classic RTS method, without however bringing any apparent benefits. In fact, our skills as good administrators, our popularity, attract citizens who automatically set to work. However, this means that we are denied the possibility of employing workers in other sectors at crucial moments. An armourer remains an armourer, and in case of lack of food we will therefore not be able to send him to work the fields to increase food production. The strange production chains and the instantaneous construction of buildings return from past episodes. Resource management and economic planning certainly have less appeal than military planning; the diversification of food (apples or cheese?) and the buying and selling of arrows and spears may be interesting, but it will never be as interesting as the preparation and organization of an army. In this case, the addition of mythological figures adds variety and brings benefits, balancing the disadvantage that the attackers suffered in the event of a siege in front of the archers and crossbowmen positioned in the shelter of the battlements of the castle.", "date": "2006-10-24", "grade": null}
