War of the Roses is in fact a third-person action game entirely focused on the great battles that dyed the English sound red between 1455 and 1485. At the end of the long dispute the House of Lancaster won, while Richard III of York he lost his life in the last act of the conflict which took place just south of Market Bosworth. The title Fatshark reproduces some of the most famous scenarios of the bloody struggle for the throne of England, allowing us to impersonate a soldier of the York or to wear the colors of the Lancasters. Two factions for one country The highlight of the new Fatshark title is the multiplayer, which offers enough unique mechanics to distinguish War of the Roses from the crowd of fighting titles. There are four basic classes, namely light infantry, heavy infantry, archer and crossbowman, but with the accumulation of experience points, four custom slots become available that allow you to equip our armed at will. This means being able to combine crossbow and shield, use a mount and gradually obtain more and more lethal and specific weapons. There are many levels and it is not immediate to unlock everything, but even the simple infantryman can have his say on the battlefield if the person who maneuvers him shows off his skill. One of the other peculiarities is the slow reload of the crossbowman, which can be speeded up by pressing the left mouse button at the right moment, while some classes can make a short charge that allows you to push the opponent or to get between allies and enemies to save someone in difficulty. Among the possibilities of the title we find the cure, with the allied players who can lift us off the ground and the bandages that we can apply on the wounds to restore health. Yet the most characteristic element of all is undoubtedly the race: in the Fatshark title, in fact, there is no sprint and to increase speed it is sufficient to move for a few seconds without being hit or performing any action. Unfortunately the multiplayer includes only two modes, namely the team deathmatch and the conquest of some positions that turn into spawn points. The lack of Siege mode, the real pearl of Mount & Blade, is a real shame, given the context, to say the least, suitable, but on the other hand, the title does not even offer catapults, protections, ladders or mobile towers, therefore move away from the exclusively linked modes the fight could highlight some structural limitations of the title. Obviously, we hope that these limits are broken down with some updates, but for now the only thing that matters is beating your opponents to blood in games of up to 64 players. As we said, the multiplayer sector is the heart of the experience, but the single player is not lacking in the offer, which puts us in front of a series of objectives in sequence and surrounds us with dozens of bots. Unfortunately, the solo mode is affected by the presence of only 5 scenarios and a poor artificial intelligence. To describe the campaign, the development team, which probably found itself forced to brutally downsize the single-player experience for administrative reasons, took refuge behind the wording ~training~. But even this term is too flattering, given the poor quality of the bots, and the sense of the whole experience is reduced to the suggestive description that accompanies the panoramic shots at the beginning of each battle. England's green is tinged with red One of the strong points of War of the Roses is the strong differentiation between the classes. The crossbowman takes several seconds to charge but inflicts more damage than the archer, who however can throw more shots and enjoys greater mobility while using the bow. Sword and shield are slender while two-handed weapons have substantial impact force. The horse obviously has its own story and is a considerable advantage, especially in terms of movement, but it is also a big target for archers, and falling to the ground in the middle of enemy soldiers is almost a death sentence. The combat gives much importance to the player's skills and tries to simulate reality, even if in various situations it helps us with visual indicators that mark times, angles, shot power, precision and so on. Blocking attacks with a shield is quite simple, at least for frontal blows and as long as the protection holds, while when using weapons exclusively it is necessary to orientatethe parry towards the exact direction of the blows. This element gives life to rather technical fights and, although affected here and there by imperfect collisions, always fun. Winning against two opponents is no small satisfaction and our ego can count on the final moves to inflate further. These are killing blows that are useful for quickly finishing off a dying enemy and that give us some brutal and well-crafted animations, capable of increasing the pathos of the battle. In terms of balance, the only problem is perhaps represented by the arrows, extremely precise and incredibly fast. Dodging shots is difficult to say the least, even if it is decidedly realistic, but too much precision can be frustrating for those who find themselves targeted by a particularly skilled archer. In the shadow of Bamburgh walls From the point of view of the setting, the work done by the developers is undoubtedly valid. The dawn assault on massive Bamburgh Castle, amid rain, mist and flickering torches, is nothing short of thrilling. The large maps, with proportionate and detailed constructions, allow you to set up maneuvers, to outflank the enemy, to hide effectively and to close the enemies in the numerous alleys and ravines of the fortified structures. Even the more open maps, however less evocative, have an excellent aesthetic result whose beauty, unfortunately, is compromised by the bad look of the water. But overall the English countryside is rendered with care, as are the villages, and that is enough to immerse us emotionally in the context of dozens of carefully modeled and rather detailed soldiers. The animations, in absolute terms, are not exciting, but in relation to the genre, or that of realistic combat, they get along with dignity and are decidedly fluid. Sometimes the desire to create that typical drift of the body, yanked by too heavy weapons, creates a grotesque effect, but for fans of the genre and of the time it will certainly not be a problem to get over it. It is more difficult to overlook the numerous glitches, which involve the aforementioned collisions, but fortunately the incidence of these problems is limited and for most of the time it is possible to play in peace. Unfortunately it is from a purely playful point of view that the experience is incomplete. While the variety and ideas of Mount & Blade are dampened by a decidedly poor technical sector, the opposite happens in War of the Roses. An excellent technical potential is in fact ruined by the lack of ideas and the failure to implement complex methods that would give the title a much greater depth. If we add to this the lack of modding, which like the sieges will perhaps be implemented later, it is impossible not to turn up our noses.", "date": "2012-10-03", "grade": "7.5"}
