{"name": "Mr. Prepper", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mr-prepper-recensione-pc.html", "text": "In our Top 5 Indie episode dedicated to this month, we pointed out to you that Mr. Prepper was one of the most interesting titles, to be released on March 18 on Steam, which we are here today to review. The title developed by Rejected Games is proposed full of interesting ideas, set up in an intelligent and intriguing way. After a few years of waiting and a moderate success also in the recent Steam Game Festival, we are ready to give you our final judgment in the Mr. Prepper PC review. Escape to victory Mr. Prepper: the greenhouse room. The world is no longer what we used to know, the government controls everything and freedom is just a distant memory. Within this scenario is Mr. Prepper, a particular title in which, playing the role of the Prepper, you will have to try to carry out your escape plan. As that famous chap always said? Between saying and doing there is a sea in the middle. Escaping from Mr. Prepper's world is not that simple, your previous attempts to escape have failed in a disastrous way and therefore what you will have to execute now is a complex and layered plan that starts from the foundations of your home. Creating a bunker is not a simple thing and you will find out at your expense. In Mr. Prepper the goal is to create your own personal underground bunker in which to put into practice every key step of your escape plan which, no spoilers, does not involve the use of orthodox means of locomotion. To do this, however, you will have to learn to survive, craft objects, trade with shady individuals and manage not to be discovered by the government (under penalty of the end of the game). Before going into the gameplay, however, we want to underline how Rejected Games has well inserted in such a peculiar title several layers of narrative capable of stimulating the player, intriguing him at certain moments and causing that desire to discover more which has been a panacea to break the intrinsic repetitiveness of certain mechanics. A 3D game in a 2D world Mr. Prepper: your kitchen. The game will take place almost entirely in your home: the 2D plan you'll be working on creates a cross-section of your home, allowing you to navigate through the various rooms with a click of the mouse and interact with each element on the screen. The only really important room will be the bedroom, for the rest all the others will serve as an alibi and side dish to the real nerve center which will be the set of underground rooms. A small tutorial will welcome you at the beginning of your game in Mr. Prepper, allowing you to become familiar with the main features of the game. However, not everything will be explained to you and the gameplay will be discovered a little at a time. In fact, we found this introduction a bit hasty, poorly cared for compared to the other components of the game. For those who are not used to this kind of game but above all for those who are not used to the mechanics of crafting and obtaining materials in a survival game, the first impact can really be brutal. Mr. Prepper is not an easy title, in order to build and be efficient you will have to remember to eat, manage your strength well and above all rest. Sleep is a fundamental factor, taking naps when you are too tired and remembering to go to bed at the right times will allow you not to lose efficiency and not suffer malus. If being performing with respect to your escape plan will be the most important thing, therefore, immediately below we find the survival from your Prepper. In the third step of the priorities, however, is the management of materials. In Mr. Prepper materials can be crafted in the workbench, obtained through the exploration of certain areas or recovered through trade. The mailbox outside your house will allow you to interact with the neighborhood and various shops (as well as some individuals who will contact you during the game). This aspect will be very important: in fact, you will not always be able to recover the materials you will need and being able to fully understand all the dynamics of the trade will be crucial for the success of your plans. For example, dismantling the glasses in the pantry is an excellent and quick way to obtain glass, a pity that by emptying the cupboard you will trigger a dangerous mechanism of suspicion in the government. In fact, in Mr. Prepper, the main antagonist (the government) acts through one of his employees who every few days (you will have a notice on the calendar) will come to check your house in search of activities that go against the law. Mr. Prepper: the advanced workbench. At the end of the government inspection you will be shown a report. If the inspection will have caused a large increase in suspicion, you may even lose the game. For this reason, the careful management of materials requires the player to be able to juggle every single way to obtain materials. Precisely for this reason, the possibility of exploring some areas such as the desert, the mines or the forest to recover materials comes to the rescue of the player. The 2D exploration will take place through multiple levels in which you will be able to hunt, recover materials, place traps, face captive wild animals and even find some NPCs with which to undertake some side quests. The important thing will be to better manage your forces, leave prepared and be able to get as much as possible from each exploration. Graphics and technique Mr. Prepper: the essential mailbox. Ludically Mr. Prepper really offers several intriguing solutions: energy management, crafting, government suspicions, exploration, even upgrading the rooms you'll create. It was this last point that convinced us the most. The rooms that you can create are very varied and the management of the bunker will be very personal, with the possibility for each player to create a set of peculiar, unique and personal rooms even though some of them are the same for all. Each element then has a remarkable depth, with interesting mechanics that will always keep your attention high. Even growing carrots in an underground greenhouse will require a series of precautions that make such a trivial action fun. As far as aspects such as graphics and sound are concerned, Mr. Prepper clearly does not aim to impress from a technical point of view and indeed, some models leave something to be desired. We would have preferred a greater cleaning especially of the explorable areas. For example, the various levels of the forest have the same pattern in sequence and the textures in general seemed a little less refined than those in the house. As far as the house and the bunker are concerned, on the other hand, we are very satisfied with the results obtained, especially as regards the lighting of the environments (which also has its implication in terms of gameplay) and in managing the weather, which is also important for some game dynamics. In terms of sound, the game does not offer great ideas and even in this case perhaps it could have been daring in the open areas, perhaps to make them more memorable.", "date": "2021-03-14", "grade": "7.5"}
