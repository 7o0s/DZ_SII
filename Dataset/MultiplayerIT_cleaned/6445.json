{"name": "Midnight Fight Express", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/midnight-fight-express-recensione.html", "text": "Babyface is a former criminal who decides to clean up the city where he lives, pushed by a strange sentient drone. At the beginning of the adventure we find him tied to a chair while being interrogated by the police, who are apparently trying to understand his motives, before sentencing him to death. The whole game is therefore a backwards story of something that has already happened and which, as we will see in the Midnight Fight Express review, involves a large number of corpses left along the way. Combat system The levels are many Developed by Polish independent developer Jacob Dzwinel alone, Midnight Fight Express is a top-down scrolling beat'em up with a decidedly technical combat system. We are not from the parts of Sifu, but neither from those of a Final Fight. Let's say it's the classic system designed to give the player the opportunity to grow and experiment with new combos as they are unlocked. The moves available to Babyface are many: he can punch and kick, he can grab enemies, he can sprint, he can use a firearm with different types of projectiles and he can throw a grappling hook to pull some opponents too far away. In reality, at the beginning, all the moves and all the tools are not available, which must be unlocked level after level by spending the points that are obtained at the end of each stage. Be that as it may, in addition to his abilities, our solitary avenger can also exploit in combat the weapons collected from the corpses of the enemies, from close combat or from fire, various objects to be thrown scattered around the scenarios, whether they are explosive barrels, bottles , boxes, chairs and so on (there is a special key that is used to display all collectible objects) and the walls themselves, which are convenient for breaking heads. All this translates into a constant search for the most effective and choreographic massacre possible, in which opponents are faced trying to exploit the moves available to do more and more harm, first in a rather clumsy way, then in an increasingly fluid and dynamic way. In short, we are faced with a sandbox conception of the experience in which the given tools can be exploited as one wishes, also developing personal action strategies. Unfortunately, the Midnight Fight Express combat system does not only have lights, but also different shadows. When it works, it allows you to create engaging situations and exciting moments of play, but in some cases it proves to be a bit too slippery, i.e. it is not always able to follow the player's actions, thus creating unpleasant situations, in which one does not understand well what is happening on the screen, also helped by the often not exactly impeccable feedback of the shots. Maps and enemies There are also vehicle levels The maps themselves are decidedly linear and simply require you to follow the set path. There is nothing to explore and nothing to search in the levels. You advance quickly, you arrive in front of the opponents on duty, obviously to be massacred without concern, then you start again. Repeat until the end of the level. Three levels take place aboard vehicles (a boat, a motorbike and a truck) and introduce some rather sketchy classic shooter mechanics, but fortunately they do not last long and only serve to create a bit of variety, even if they could have been done a little a little better. Their enemies are many and range from the classic gang of drug dealers, to special police squads, passing through ferocious clubbers, an all-female gang, religious fanatics, Russians and all the fauna to which we have become accustomed underground culture. As we will see later, so much variety unfortunately does not coincide with equal quality. In addition to normal enemies, from time to time it will be necessary to fight against bosses, the classic stronger and more resistant beasts, which enjoy special attack and defense patterns. In theory they should represent the pinnacle of difficulty of each section of the game, but in practice they offer a variable and unpredictable level of challenge. After all, the management of the difficulty is one of the most evident problems of the game. Problems There is a lot of blood flowing in the game Let's explain: in some situations, Midnight Fight Express has significant difficulty peaks, which then return immediately, so much so that it is not clear whether they are wanted or if they are simply the result of an uninspired design. These are moments in which the game becomes very difficult, even against generic enemies, and then returns to its traditional tracks. For example, one of these peaks occurs in the early levels, when you face mutant humans in the sewers (chand then disappear for the entire game), another when you're being chased by a lawn mower, yet another when you're fighting bikers who, despite appearances, are far more dangerous than SWAT. One section in particular, in which we had to face zombies, made us particularly nervous, either because it was totally free, or because the battle wasn't particularly interesting, given that the game mechanics are not designed for that type of gameplay (yes suffers a lot, in fact) and suddenly we were asked to use only firearms to keep the creatures at a distance. Too bad the latter have limited ammunition. Also considering that this is a unique moment in the game (there are only zombies in that level), it is not clear why it was included. The idea is that an attempt has been made to artificially create variety, even by making controversial and absurd choices from a narrative point of view. The difficulty has sudden peaks Strange difficulty modulation aside, which is also forgivable if desired, one of the major problems of Midnight Fight Express is that it is a bit out of focus, in the sense that the developer has tried to put everything he deemed interesting and that might surprise into it , however creating an often tasteless concoction. If some quotes or situations also make you smile and appear tasty, like those of Hotline Miami or Portal, or the moment in which you infiltrate a triple A development studio victim of a crunch, in which you are celebrating the launch of a game with cushions, the excessive number of enemy gangs is a bit confusing, as is the fact that many enemies appear different from each other only in appearance, i.e. they always follow the same attack patterns and have similar abilities to others their colleagues they have already met. As the game progresses they get tougher and hurt more, but that's about it. It must be said that in this way it is not even possible to delve into the themes and aesthetics that the gangs bring with them, given that after a few minutes of meeting them we have already moved on to something else and we also forget what role they have in history (often they don't even have it). There is also room for satire Thus, for example, we find ourselves fighting with criminals dressed as priests whose implications in the general picture are very weak. There is a church full of banknotes, which is, if you like, a very mild criticism of the ecclesiastical system, but you don't have time to look around before you have already gone to fight against someone else. It almost seems to be in front of a fashion show, in which the same actors wear different clothes which, on balance, do not determine much of the general sense of the game. From this shapeless mixture, even the story comes out weakened, also because there are no characters that are deepened. The plot itself is quite insipid. At first the mystery behind Babyface's motivations may intrigue, but revelation after revelation we understand that we are faced with a rather childish and at times very weak story, carried forward by the dialogues between the protagonist, his drone and the other characters. Of course, the umpteenth criminal amazed by the return of Babyface begins to turn up their noses, just as they turn upside down in the face of certain twists, which trivialize everything a bit. Considerations Midnight Fight Express is developed by one individual To complete the forty missions of Midnight Fight Express we took about five hours. Once finished, it is possible to replay the individual missions to unlock specific objectives, such as collecting a certain number of gold teeth, obtainable by hitting enemies in the mouth, or reaching the end in a given time. This is certainly the best way to put all the skills learned to good use and to enjoy the gameplay without dialogue or cutscenes. Finishing missions earns you money and unlocks new items for purchase in the shop. In short, it is the classic mode for completionists that takes more hours than the basic campaign and which allows you to really master the combat system. The levels are very linear Graphically, Jacob Dzwinel's title fares quite well. Characters and scenarios are not particularly detailed, but the choice of framing the action from above and the good animations compensate and make some fights particularly beautiful from a choreographic point of view. Too bad for the aforementioned collision feedback that occasionally spoils the show. On the other hand, the accessory elements are poor, such as the interlude sequences and the dialogue scenes, which make their weight feel a bit especially in the final part, consideringrando how much the game cares about its narrative side. Finally, the soundtrack is excellent, with songs that perfectly accompany the action, galvanizing the player especially in the most excited moments.", "date": "2022-08-18", "grade": "6.0"}
