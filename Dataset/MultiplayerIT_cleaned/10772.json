This is the case of Galaxy on Fire, a series developed by Fishlabs which debuted in 2006 on Java-compatible devices and is now available with a second episode also for iPhone. The story of the game picks up where it left off, with the cunning pilot Keith T. Maxwell who finds himself in battle as usual with the space pirates and is forced to make a daring escape. However, when the space jump device malfunctions, things spiral out of control, and he wakes up confused and dazed thirty-five years later. Rescued by a trader, Maxwell must first earn money to buy a ship, and the only way is to temporarily devote himself to the extraction of minerals from meteorites. Once this phase has passed, he will be able to set off on a journey that will take him to explore a large part of the galaxy in search of his old life ... if there is still something to find. The game has a single, substantial mode that sees us face a series of missions in search of new characters to interact with. As mentioned above, during the early stages we will have to earn a living by drilling meteorites to extract precious minerals, and this will help us become familiar with the targeting system: just head towards an objective for a sort of ~lock-on~ to appear on the screen ~, after which you have to press the 5 key to interact with the target. If it is a meteorite, our spacecraft will automatically proceed with the extraction operations; if it is a destination to reach, on the other hand, we will be able to make ourselves comfortable until we arrive, without worrying about the journey. Each area that can be explored and visible on the spatial map can be more or less dangerous, that is, it can hide pitfalls of various types or be calm. All are characterized by the presence of a space station that we can visit, inside which there are rooms full of people looking for good pilots for various types of missions. Each mission can yield us a certain amount of money, to invest in the purchase of equipment (mainly weapons) or a larger and more powerful ship. Following a certain sci-fi tradition, in Galaxy on Fire 2 all the characters have very strange names, and this unfortunately doesn't help when it comes to listening to their stories or putting ourselves at their service. Luckily there are icons that help us, indicating the momentary goal when we believe we are at the mercy of the stars. In the presence of space pirates, we can resort to weapons by pressing the 5 key repeatedly or by activating the autofire using the 7 key. It is possible to control the ship in a standard way or by inverting the Y axis, and during battles it is vitally important to be able to perform evasive maneuvers in order not to suffer too much damage (or, worse, crash into a huge floating rock). The game's graphics are fully polygonal, and while the results on mobile aren't the same as the promising iPhone version, you really can't complain. The construction of the spacecraft is excellent, with a good level of detail and excellent fluidity. The space stations are all different and well characterized, while the space cutaways offer interesting lighting effects and a great atmosphere to view. The textures are not very numerous, but they are really well done as regards the surface of the planets, especially when we see them from a certain distance. The same cannot be said for the internal halls of the stations, however, which appear a bit worn out. The action is accompanied by a discreetly made sound, not unforgettable but not to be despised either.", "date": "2009-04-06", "grade": "9.0"}
