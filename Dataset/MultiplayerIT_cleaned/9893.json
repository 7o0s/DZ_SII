In Christian iconography, limbo is the area of the afterlife, located on the edge of hell, where the souls of unbaptized children or righteous men who died before the resurrection of Christ; an indefinite place, populated by those who have not been at fault but at the same time cannot aspire to the Kingdom of Heaven. Also mentioned by Dante in his Divine Comedy, in reality its concept itself has been discussed several times recently within ecclesiastical leaders, forced to take into account an uncomfortable historical legacy which denies absolution to those who have not actually committed sins . Limbo is also that Caribbean dance in which you have to pass under a horizontal rod without touching it, but with a good approximation we can assume that the latter is not the source of inspiration for the first work of the same name created by the Danish team Playdead. An exclusive title for Xbox Live Arcade eagerly awaited by the community especially for the load of awards with which it presented its debut on the market: 2 Independent Game Awards at the last GDC for Visual art and Technical Excellence, as well as 4 ~Best of E3~ from several major industry publications. But above all in the face of the aesthetic component, which can be easily summarized in one simple word: wonderful. Xbox 360 goals In the objectives Limbo can be quite original; in fact, their achievement is almost never linked to the normal progression of the adventure (with the exception of that for completion), but rather subordinated to the exploration of the settings or to actions not properly linked to pure and simple progression. A stimulus therefore, actually the only one, for a possible second playthrough. Limbo noir Limbo is one of those rare products with such an original and intriguing graphic style as to immediately attract attention; its genesis dates back to a concept video made in 2006 by one of the two founders of Playdead, namely Arnt Jensen, but the refinement and responsibility for the visual contents of the final game were entirely the work of the very good Morten Bramsen. In summary, the game is drawn only in black and white colors, along with everything in between in terms of shades of gray; there are no details within the contours, as if everything were nothing but shadows. A scenario as evocative as it is disturbing, capable of disturbing and fascinating at every single step, as one delves deeper and deeper into its guts where there are no allies or pleasant surprises to discover, but only desolation, deadly traps and hostile creatures. Likewise, dialogues, indicators, health bars are absent and even the soundtrack is only hinted at. Limbo is therefore a game that leaves a lot of room for the player's imagination, invited to ~complete~ in a personal way both the details of the setting and the characters that populate it, as well as the plot that supports the protagonist's adventure. All that is known is in fact that his alter ego, a helpless boy with no particular skills, is driven to visit this disturbing world in search of his missing sister. A single, simple address therefore, intended to support the entire course of what in practice turns out to be a very linear and essential puzzle-platform; the keys used are only two, one for the jump and one for the action, obviously to be combined with the left analog stick to move the protagonist. The gameplay structure is fundamentally based on the presence of a series of puzzles to be faced with both analytical skills and purely practical pad in hand; in all cases, in fact, the programmers have studied situations that require the solution of a puzzle and its contextual overcoming which cannot be separated from the skills gained in years of 2d platforming, perhaps Nintendo. The latter is not a random quote, because it is part of the sources of inspiration declared by the Danish team itself; but in reality in Limbo you can breathe the smell and taste the taste of the most evocative titles in the history of video games, and the references to Another World, Heart of Darkness, as well as the more recent Ico and Shadow of the Colossus are clear. This obviously does not take away the character and personality of Limbo, which indeed possesses them in industrial quantities and does not fail to surprise the player; this happens, for example, with the long sequence against the giant spider, emotionally impeccable and sincerely disturbing, or on the occasion of the hero's first ~splattered~ and unexpected death, perhaps beheaded or skewered or worse, crushed under a huge press. Actually death and defeat are meant to be very componentsmore than frequent during the experience with Limbo, basically in the face of the fact that the entire game is based on a ~trial and error~ philosophy which is essentially also the only element of perplexity within the product. Let's be clear, this is an absolutely conscious design choice on the part of the programmers; it is no coincidence that Limbo is literally stuffed with checkpoints, which allow you to restart a few steps from the scene of the crime after each game over, thus reducing any possible source of frustration almost to a minimum. However, the question mark remains regarding the possible hypothesis that a slightly different game design path could have been taken, not so strongly linked to the concept of stick (mandatory death to understand the mechanics of a puzzle) and carrot (its subsequent solution) . In Limbo, the killing of the character is no longer perceived as a defeat to regret, but simply as a fundamental tool for knowledge and understanding of the single puzzle. Fortunately, none of the puzzles present, although characterized by an increasing difficulty curve with some peaks, is so difficult as to block the progression for more than a few minutes. Therefore, the rather constant flow of the adventure will inevitably lead at least medium-experienced players to reach the conclusion in about 4 or 5 hours of play, perhaps even something less. A reduced duration that clashes a bit with the sale price, set at 1200 points.", "date": "2010-07-19", "grade": "9.0"}
