{"name": "L'abilit  tutto", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/107995-shootmania-storm-labilita-e-tutto.html", "text": "Nadeo launches into the world of competitive FPS with ShootMania Storm, a title that puts all players on the same level by eliminating perks, experience points, power-ups and also eliminating spawn kills thanks to special platforms that deprive those who cross them of the possibility of shooting . The simplicity of the gameplay is the key element of the title based on the millimeter use of a few simple weapons, on the knowledge of the large maps and on the movement which, as in Quake and Unreal, returns to dominate. In fact, the jump is combined with the possibility of sliding both in the air and on the ground, and this allows you to cross the large maps at high speed, attacking your opponents by surprise. A choice that recalls a mix between Quake's strafe jump and Tribes' jetpack and which endows the title with a peculiar element, capable of making a difference, but at the same time extremely intuitive and masterable by anyone. From update to update, things got a bit complicated with the addition of the laser jump, the grappling hook and the possibility of bouncing off walls, but only this last element automatically extends to the competitive sphere, limiting the balancing problems in competitive field. In short, simplicity remains at the center of everything, and also guarantees a certain freedom in the design of the maps that can accommodate a very large number of modes without almost ever being unbalanced. A setting that is perfectly suited to editing, with modders who find rather high creative possibilities in their hands, increased in the final version by the option to import models and sounds, without the need for professional skills. And, to top it all off, player-created modes can go official, with Nadeo's approval, opening up an infinite variety of formulas. In any case, the title, after a long beta, already offers several modes. The capture the flag called Elite, the competitive mode par excellence, alternates between defensive and offensive phases, differentiating the weapons according to the role played by the players, while variants such as Jailbreak lock affected players in a prison. The maps are also characterized by some environmental variables that further articulate the gameplay. In some modes the weapon changes according to the faction, as in capture the flag Elite, while in others it changes according to the area of the map where the player is. And here, inside a structure, you find yourself holding the grenade launcher, but you can leave and re-enter the area, depending on the case, to be able to switch weapons and surprise your opponents. Finally, among the contextual bonuses, we also find the double shot, really useful in a title where the rate of fire is decidedly low. Unpredictable flights and very fast ascents ShootMania Storm's main weapon is a cross between a rocket launcher and a plasma gun that fires very slowly. In some modes, a sort of single-shot rail gun, capable of instant elimination, and a grenade that does area damage are also used. The existence of only three weapons, with the first present in all modes, makes it easy to get familiar with the gameplay but, given the slowness of the shots, calculating the trajectories is complicated and this means that practice is needed to reach high levels of skill. Team play is obviously important as two shots from the base weapon are enough to kill and in some modes it is the title itself that signals who has been hit. Obviously, tactical coordination is only possible in games populated by a number of players such as to allow one opponent to be distinguished from another, or in modes that do not include respawn. Others, on the other hand, are decidedly more chaotic and functional to individual gameplay both for the number of players, which makes them difficult to interpret in a competitive key, and for the excessive complexity of the gameplay. Royal, for example, looks like a simple Last Man Standing (the last one left alive) but in ShootMania Storm it becomes peculiar thanks to the addition of a circular wall of energy that quickly closes around the players forcing them to reach the center of the map . But the area that shrinks, burning those who linger along the way or get stuck in some ravine, can be activated by the players themselves, and the more users there are on the server, the more points the person who activates it gets. But that's not all, in fact multiple people can split the points by activating the switch together or decide to shoot like crazy to prevent opponents from getting the bonus points. Nadeo, perhaps taking advantage of the work of the modders, must clearly expand the competitive side which for now rests almost exclusively on the capture the Elite flag, but it is difficult to find, among the currently available modes, something equally suitable to support competitive gameplay. The official launch tournament itself was played entirely according to the Elite formula which saw Fnatic triumph against the Curse by 7 to 9. But the hype of the launch is one thing, with pro-players attracted by the prizes and the support of the sponsors, it is one thing to create something capable of attracting spectators and players not only for the big finals. We still don't know if Shootmania has this strength or not, but we will undoubtedly find out in the coming months. Imperceptible trajectories From an aesthetic point of view ShootMania Storm certainly does not aim to amaze. The engine, more than sufficient for TrackMania 2 Canyon, highlights the polygonal deficiencies and the repetitive textures that escape perception when you are in a racing car projected at high speed. In any case, the sunny colors please the eyes and all that matters about the models, represented as digital avatars, is the fact of striking them. Unfortunately, the increase in the number of players and the succession of some not very successful patches have left some marks on the netcode. Playing outside Italy, a choice often forced by the lack of population on our servers, still involves some inopportune freezes despite the marked improvement in the situation compared to the last few months of 2012. Incidents of this kind are quite relevant in a title where the precision of movements and of those few single-shot weapons, it represents the heart of the experience, but support is guaranteed and even the last problems are likely to be fixed in the near future. No problem, however on the front of competitive support. ShootMania Storm, like Trackmania 2 Canyon, also enjoys the region-by-region rankings of Mania Planet. A complex scoring system evaluates each performance by attributing a global value to the player who can admire his position both within his own region and throughout the world. The interface is similar to that of Trackmania with the addition of the server search function that allows you to find games based on mode, population and location.", "date": "2013-04-10", "grade": "8.0"}
