{"name": "Daxter", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/daxter.html", "text": "The revenge of the supporting actor Anyone who has followed the gaming scene in recent years will not struggle to remember Naughty Dog's Jak and Daxter. The American team series, now in its third episode, was one of the most successful original franchises on Ps2; the formula, that of a 3d platform / adventure with some digressions into racing and puzzle games, was developed by the former group led by Jason Rubin in an extremely valid way, with accessible gameplay and a more than good characterization of the characters. The protagonist, a classic young hero named Jak, was in fact supported by the sidekick Daxter, a hairy and talking weasel (male) with a marked irony and a not too condescending character. With an apt marketing choice, Sony has therefore decided to exploit a series with a well-known name to produce an exclusive title on Psp, created thinking only of the characteristics of its laptop. The fundamental differences compared to the previous chapters are two: first of all, the game is not developed by Naughty Dog but by Ready at Dawn studios. Secondly, the protagonist is no longer dear Jak but Daxter himself, finally legitimized to stand alone in the spotlight. Yes, because the title in question for Psp is placed chronologically between the first and second episode of the series, just as Jak was arrested by the regime and imprisoned in a high security prison. Meanwhile, the lively Daxter finds nothing better to do than get hired by a pest control company, thus engaging his unexpected free time against insects of various shapes and sizes. This occupation represents the leitmotif of most of the game, which unfortunately results in a rather poor and bland narrative framework; in fact the paucity of the plot that acts as a glue at the various levels represents the main defect of Sony production. In fact, although the dialogues offer good ideas on a comic level, and although the characterization of the characters is undoubtedly valid as it has always been, it is inevitable to feel the lack of a more robust, engaging and exciting story. Impressive! The game structure adopted by the programmers of Ready at Dawn Studios follows, as it was reasonable to expect, that of the previous chapters of the series. A good dose of platform sections are therefore accompanied by fights with the various insects scattered throughout the levels; as in any self-respecting title of the genre, there are also a series of objects to collect to achieve objectives or unlock particular bonuses. Initially equipped only with an electrified fly swatter, our Daxter will soon also gain a kind of rifle capable of shooting insecticide, useful not only for temporarily blocking the movements of disgusting cockroaches and the like, but also for making short distances in flight. A further subsequent upgrade will make it possible to transform this weapon even into a flamethrower, extremely fun to use to gruesomely set fire to insects. The classically platform / adventure game sections are sometimes interspersed with pleasant phases aboard flying vehicles, or with some not too demanding puzzle games; an effective divertissement to break the linearity of the action, providing a good overall variety. The bonus levels also contribute to this, unlockable by collecting a certain number of precursor globes; these are simple minigames, but set as parodies of famous films such as the Matrix and Braveheart which are absolutely hilarious. So if Daxter from the point of view of the game structure is, on the whole, an excellent albeit canonical exponent of a rather inflated trend, where instead it stands out strongly is in the technical side, absolutely impressive considering the characteristics of Psp. The graphics engine grinds an incredible amount of polygons, offering settings full of details and characters that are particularly cared for from every point of view; especially Daxter, who sports a really nice fur-shading. The use of colors is exceptional, as is the management of light sources and in general of explosions and effects. Excellent animations, with the protagonist capable of performing a large number of actions all well mapped on the Psp controller. The various levels, all characterized by a different setting, are scattered throughout a large city and divided into neighborhoods. The frame rate is actually at times dancer, especially within the aforementioned metropolis which evidently overloads the cpu; nevertheless, levels of unplayability are never reached. Also surprising is the absolute lack of loadingnts during the game, thanks to the solution of access to streaming data aided on occasion by some clever technical gimmicks. The sound is also really excellent, both thanks to a high quality Italian dubbing and thanks to an orchestrated soundtrack of great thickness and perfectly suited to accompany the action. One last mention about longevity: getting to the end of the adventure with your head down won't take more than 10 hours in total, which however become much more if you want to collect all the objects and therefore complete the game 100%. Comment Daxter is an extremely classic platform/adventure in game structure, which adds nothing new to the genre. Furthermore, the story that forms the background to the events is rather thin, banal and monotonous, unable to leap towards higher levels from sufficiency. These are Sony manufacturing flaws. Everything else about Daxter falls absolutely in the positive side of the balance; while not very original, the Ready at Dawn effort is in fact characterized by an excellent quality both in the level design and control system and, above all, in the audiovisual side, absolutely impressive considering the Psp's capabilities. On balance, Daxter is therefore undoubtedly one of the best games available for the Sony laptop, and represents a highly recommended purchase except for those who can no longer stand the genre in question. Pros Outstanding audiovisual component Very entertaining and challenging Flawless control system Cons Uninspired storytelling Average longevity Adds nothing new to the genre The first months of life of the PSP were certainly not as exciting from the point of view of the software as one might have hoped. Poised between a console with its own personality and a simple portable extension of Ps2, the Sony handheld has had to suffer the shame of far too many direct portings from its ~older sister~, different from the originals only for less accurate graphics and times of loading often asphyxiating. A trend, this, which has not taken into account the fundamental need for any console to possess a series of exclusive titles, developed around its characteristics and which therefore justify its purchase and very existence. It took some time, but finally things seem destined to change...", "date": "2006-04-07", "grade": null}
