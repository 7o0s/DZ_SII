{"name": "Marvel's Avengers", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/marvels-avengers-recensione-pc.html", "text": "It's not easy to write the review of Marvel's Avengers: on the one hand there is the fear of being unfair to the good things Crystal Dynamics has done with such an ambitious project, on the other there are aspects of this tie-in which reveal rather important gaps and a technical sector that even on PC makes an incredible effort to keep up with the frame rate, highlighting a hasty optimization phase. As you have probably already read in the review of Marvel's Avengers for PS4, the game boasts some absolutely brilliant moments , and if the campaign had always remained on these levels we would be toasting to the best superhero videogame transposition ever, received with substantially higher votes than the conflicting ones with which the title has had to settle so far. However, it is important to remember that we are faced with a real work in progress, not only due to the many technical problems that we will discuss in a specific paragraph, but also and above all due to the numerous post-launch contents arriving, some of which have already announced, which could literally transform this production and make it the game that the developers actually imagined making when they embarked on this difficult project. The numerical evaluation must therefore not scare you, we write it right now: if you are a huge fan of the Avengers, this may already be the tie-in you've been waiting for, but you too will surely come to perceive its structural limitations, the anonymous character design (thankfully mitigated by the excellent Italian dubbing, with only a couple of exceptions) and the avalanche of technical problems that currently afflict him both on consoles and on PC. GaaS framework The main problem with Marvel's Avengers is that the need to give the experience a GaaS structure ended up castrating it, severely limiting the variety of settings and prompting us to repeat practically identical missions several times. The initial and final phases of the story emerge from this annoying limbo, the duration of which is around thirteen hours where the vast majority of optional quests are left behind. Naturally, in a product like this, the concept of longevity is highly relative: having completed the campaign, you find yourself involved in the Avengers Initiative and therefore in the folds of an endgame that can be played alone or in a cooperative (much, much better if together with three friends with to coordinate), in which to delve into the background of each individual character, unlock their abilities and collect new equipment to use. Just on the loot, however, the developers were very wrong. There are situations in which objects must be managed with a pinch of strategy, based on the conditions of each individual assignment, but in general this aspect is undervalued since equipping different components does not change our hero's appearance one iota: this prerogative is left only to the unlockable skins, and it's a real shame. However, if we think that these elements are literally the cornerstones of Marvel's Avengers post-launch support, it is clear that things could take a very bad turn if the developers are not able able to keep the promises made so far. With a monetization system based solely on accessory microtransactions, absolutely not fundamental, one wonders how Square Enix will support the game in the long run, unless the sales are truly sensational. Gameplay On the gameplay front, it is certainly appropriate to reiterate a concept: when things work in Marvel's Avengers, well ... they really work. The Crystal Dynamics title is expressed at its best in the moment of action, giving us a robust amount of maneuvers and options, as well as alternating introspective sequences with moments of absolute spectacularity, in which the Earth's Mightiest Heroes do exactly what is expected from them. And so, while Iron Man flies around dispensing repulsor beams and cracking jokes, Thor unleashes lightning bolts, Black Widow uses a mix of martial arts and high-tech gadgets, Hulk smashes everything and Kamala spends most of the of her time pinching herself big, in disbelief of being part of such an iconic team. From the point of view of the plot, she is undoubtedly the real surprise: a teenager who has acquired great powers and knows that they correspond to great responsibilities. The combat system is solid and convincing, despite the incredible chaos of certain moments, and makes the impacts very well, this is a fundamental element in a brawler of the genblack. The characters are well differentiated, each with a unique repertoire that leads to a precise approach in battle, and this pushes them to experience beyond the campaign. It is therefore a pity that the bosses have been handled in such a questionable way, because it is clear that at least a second fight with Taskmaster and Abomination (or the presence of further villains, of course) would have contributed to making the campaign more meaningful rather than limiting the bestiary to AIM soldiers and various Adaptoids. On the narrative front, the initial feeling of an adventure in which the young Kamala Khan is the only protagonist with a pinch of depth dissolves after a few hours, as the heroes return to the group, at the end of missions in which they fortunately go beyond their anonymous character designs and prove that they are indeed the Avengers we know. It's just a pity that a couple of them remain in the background. The PC version So let's get to the point: how does Marvel's Avengers behave on PC? We carried out several tests with our configuration, trying to understand what exactly was the problem behind the game's inconsistent performance. It would be nice to be able to say that you have discovered the secret, but the reality of the facts is that at the moment there is probably no setup capable of running the title at its best without ever slowing down. Maybe the Crystal graphics engine Engine just wasn't meant to handle all of this stuff at the same time. We all remember the Geothermal Valley of Rise of the Tomb Raider, and there it was a question of moving a single character within a large but essentially empty setting. Here history basically repeats itself, only with far more elements on the screen, particles galore and a level of chaos rarely found in other games. In short, it is difficult to imagine a different outcome. With a GTX 1080 Ti, Marvel's Avengers holds up to 2160p with all effects at their maximum, staying between 30 and 40 frames per second, but only and only in the quietest situations, otherwise it becomes unmanageable. At 1440p it seems that the game is able to maintain 60 fps with some little help, but just get involved in a fight with several enemies to see the counter drop to worrying levels. 1080p, then? Well, even so you are not protected from drops: normally you travel on 80-90 frames per second, but there are situations (see the mission with Thor on the Chimera Helicarrier) in which you also go down to 10-15 fps This huge margin is obviously not normal, but for the moment the updates released by both NVIDIA and Crystal Dynamics have not solved anything. The big problem is that the automatic scaler doesn't work: even if you activate it to keep performance fixed by dynamically changing the resolution, all you get is a bland assistance, completely insufficient to solve these problems. Added to this is also a quantity of glitches that we have rarely encountered in a triple A product at launch. While waiting for robust updates that can improve these aspects of the experience, you can make an effort with the many graphic adjustments available in the game and thus understand if there is a decent compromise. In fact, it starts from four general presets (low, medium, high and very high) to get to the individual items, which include vertical sync, antialiasing, reflections, motion blur, volumetric lighting, ambient occlusion, details, shadows, contact shadows, tessellation , quality of effects, depth of field, filter and quality of textures, as well as a couple of effects related to Intel processors to improve water rendering and environmental destructiveness. Finally, a few words on graphics and sound beyond performance. Compared to the materials shown a few months ago, the various Avengers have fortunately acquired a pinch more personality: there really is a lot of Scarlett Johansson in the game's Natasha Romanov, while for the other Avengers it proceeded in a somewhat vague and uninspired. Tony Stark looks much better with long hair and the helmet of his armor leaves a lot to be desired, Thor looks good in a t-shirt rather than in his traditional suit, Banner is a nice character who, however, has nothing of the puny little man that it really should be. Kamala, probably due to the fact that she is the least known heroine of the group, has been valued much better than all the others. The characters move well even when it wasn't so simple to manage their characteristics, and their animations are excellent and abundant. The enemies are numerous, but they all basically belong to the same type, and as mentioned the bosses wereemployees well below their means: we will see how this aspect of the experience will grow in the future. However, in closing, we would like to reiterate the excellent localization in Italian: apart from some volume levels that are too high compared to the others, a great work, especially with Tony Stark: being able to capture the essence of the interpretation of the cinematic Iron Man must not have been easy, yet the actor did it. Kamala Khan, Bruce Banner and Black Widow are also really excellent, while Thor and Cap could have worked better.", "date": "2020-09-07", "grade": "7.0"}
