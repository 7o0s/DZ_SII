However, in Nascar, traditionally characterized by rather marked changes from one edition to the next, the phenomenon is even more noticeable. The game modes available are the classic single race, the Dodge challenges (predefined scenarios from the 2005 season), the season mode and ~chase for the cup~ (where you race only one part of the season including 10 races). In career mode you start with an unknown driver, with the aim of becoming the best driver in Nascar. We start from the minor leagues, but by placing record times you can be able to make a career very quickly. It must be said that some aspects of the career mode are a bit obscure and cumbersome, and the accompanying manual doesn't help much. The variable skill system is a welcome novelty: by performing particular maneuvers such as clean overtaking, staying in the lead for a long time and so on, particular skill points are obtained which can be used to increase the skill of your virtual driver (a bit like seen also in the Alfa Romeo Racing Team). Ring around the rosie But there's more: by causing accidents, damaging the car or doing anything else counterproductive, the skill points will be deducted. The setting system of the various components of the car is quite well done, slightly more powerful and precise than last year. Modification freaks will be able to indulge themselves with tire pressure, camber, gear ratios and so on. Playability-wise very little has changed, and driving the cars looks exactly the same as last year with the only difference being a more agile feel of the vehicles, which appear to be lighter. The multiplayer has also remained unchanged, and it's a real shame because it is precisely one of the aspects that would have most needed a good renovation. There is also a clear difference with the Xbox version, which can benefit from Xbox Live!. Graphics and sound The graphics are certainly not the strong point of the game, as they fully reproduce the one seen in Nascar 06, which already seemed dated and unconvincing at the time. The car models remain at acceptable levels, and the sense of speed is rendered sufficiently well thanks to the now omnipresent blur. It goes much less well for the tracks, which appear dull and not very detailed, exactly like in the last edition. Even the sound is practically copy-pasted from its predecessor, with the usual EA-style songs in the menus and more than discreet sound effects to reproduce the engines. The pit mechanics were present as usual, reporting all the things we need to know over the radio. The environmental effects and other car-related noises, such as wind or tire roll, are good. Final comment A little more than enough driving game, characterized by an outdated technical sector and by a resemblance to the previous chapter that leaves no room for misunderstandings: if you already own Nascar 06 it would be absolutely senseless to buy this 07 version. Only recommended for true enthusiasts of the discipline or historical fans of the series, also because of good driving games more deserving of your money, be they arcade or simulation, there is no shortage on PS2 at all. Pros Interesting for geek enthusiasts Erm... Cons Virtually identical to the previous version Boring on medium distance Watching Tamarre cars that run for hours in monotonous oval circuits is not the funniest thing for us Italians, but evidently someone, in this case the Americans, likes it so much that they dedicate a long series of simulations to the phenomenon, launched as far back as 1994 by Sierra On-Line and then continued over time by Electronic Arts. Actually, over the years, EA has made us like it a little more too. The few enthusiasts of this discipline follow me, therefore, and will know what this new Nascar 07 has in store for them.", "date": "2007-03-26", "grade": null}
