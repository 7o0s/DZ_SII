{"name": "Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/harvest-moon-a-wonderful-life_b.html", "text": "Seeding mowing bags cultivate pota. A field, a cow, a small shelter and a dream. This is the small inheritance left on his deathbed by the father of the protagonist, and so on, luggage in hand to discover the pleasant and peaceful village of forget-me-not; to welcome the future farmer, Takakura, a longtime friend and partner of the deceased father with whom he had bought the small farm some time ago. After a short tutorial and a precise description of the possessions, the real life of a farmer begins. The game is divided into six chapters up to a maximum of thirty years of life, time passes -obviously- much faster than real time and is marked largely by rural affairs: in the morning there is milking of the cows and to feed them, then we move on to watering the field, then it's time to sell the products of our work and so on until evening arrives. In the first chapter, the first mission of the game, the player's task will be to get by with the few means available to arrive more or less monetarily calm at the end of the month; once this first mission is over, the young protagonist will have to start taking care of his own company in order to expand it as much as possible. Although games of this kind often suffer from too much mechanical operations, Harvest Moon offers a strong human side to the whole game: during the adventure (because after all we are talking about adventure) the making of friendships with itinerant traders and inhabitants of forget-me-not, will be the viaticum to a much faster growth: it will be much easier to conclude business, receive valuable advice on how to manage particular aspects of your company and even expand your family by finding a girl to marry. Marriage forces the player to think about different managements of his future life: first of all for different girls there are different characters, and therefore it will be necessary to weigh the choice either based on emotional or shamelessly practical terms, in anticipation of help in terms of labour. The presence of a wife also implies another mouth to feed and the birth of a child will only increase this need even more. In terms of progeny, what will be the behavior held with one's wife and child will shape the character side of the latter, which will have positive or negative repercussions in the difficult adolescent period. Married life is just one of the aspects that can drastically vary one's approach to the game, but the fact remains that taking care of a farm is not easy: the animals must be fed, brushed and cared for; the plants must be watered, the fruits must be harvested, all the gears must be well oiled and work perfectly if you don't want to live a life of hardship. Born to be Abraham In addition to the consequences of his actions, the player is also put to the test in situations not directly dependent on him such as the climatic conditions: the game follows in all respects the alternation between day and night and the succession of the seasons, it will be therefore it is necessary to follow the daily weather news on the small television in one's home to avoid unpleasant accidents to livestock and plants; in the same way it will be useful to tune into the second channel to follow the advice of the experts on the sowing period to avoid (literally) throwing away the invested money. Carrying on a farm is not easy and often the forces will fail, and since in fact life is a continuous cycle, another parameter comes into play: the kitchen. Everything that is grown can be cooked in more or less complex dishes, if the harvest fails to recover energy the only way will be to feed on grass found around, or to buy ingredients from the villagers with consequent financial hardships in the immediate future. The first month turns out to be both a perfect portrait of the tasks that will be performed daily by the young farmer and the biggest obstacle in the continuation of the game. Due to the not excessive speed in the unfolding of the days and the repetitiveness of the situations within the game, Harvest Moon falls into that particular category of games that management fans are so passionate about, as they quickly bring the casual gamer into a stalemate and of boredom. And if, as history teaches us, the successes of a lifetime must be built day by day, whoever manages to overcome the initial obstacle will find himself in dialogue with a game that is as fun as it is complex. Born to be Abraham As much as the game isstructurally varied and well thought out, it is when one moves on to discuss the graphics sector that the first discordant notes arrive: faded textures, dull colors and a questionable amount of polygons are the background to a graphics engine that is unable at any time to keep the pace of what it carries with it. Evident frame drops make a game even slower that at least in the movements had to try to be reactive (already the genre itself does not express dynamism). Hand in hand with the graphic sector is the sound, with repetitive and very little incisive music, and it is a pity if you think that, given the genre, the music should help create a situation of total relaxation. Slow, slow, slow. This is the leitmotif of this Harvest Moon, for a genre that does not already stand out for excessive speed, the Marvelous interactive create a port afflicted by obvious drops in frame rates that weigh down the structure and the gaming experience. Overlooking the graphic defect, Harvest Moon comes out as a good management software, excellent for those who are fans of the genre and certainly difficult to understand for those who are not accustomed to mechanics of a certain type. However, the depth and difficulty of the game remain, for a product that promises to offer dozens of hours of gameplay and thirty years of life. Pros: Managementally well done and deep. It offers a few more ideas than other games of this genre. Very long-lived. Cons: Technically average. Slow. It could get boring in the first hours of the game. Annoying sound sometimes Harvest moon: the harvest moon, a term indicated as the moon closest to the autumn equinox and the best time to reap the fruits of an intense year of hard work. This could be enough to partially describe what the bizarre management/life simulator created by Marvelous Interactive represents, the rest is the story of life played out: of fields, animals and fruits of nature, of loves and hard work, of commerce and walks under the moon. Harvest Moon is all this and more, it's the fastest thirty years of life you'll ever spend, it's the rural life you'll never have or the virtual version of the one you already live, it's the crowning of a dream who left on a summer morning in front of an uncultivated field, in the company of your only cow, observing the panorama offered by the forget-me-not valley.", "date": "2006-03-01", "grade": null}
