{"name": "Phantasy Star Online", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/phantasy-star-online_a.html", "text": "Planet earth calls Mars! In the distant future (not so much!) the Earth becomes unlivable and the permanence of the human race on the planet begins to be in serious danger, the only lifeline is the exploration using probes, undertaken by a group of scientists, of the universe in hopes of finding a habitable planet. After strenuous investigations, Rogol emerges, a planet with life conditions very similar to those on Earth. So the decision is made to send a colony spaceship called Pioneer 1 to verify the effective habitability of this probable future home. Immediately the settlers give life to the construction of a space city, covered by a dome, intended to house the earthlings who will gradually move. Unfortunately, an inexplicable phenomenon occurs! As soon as a new spaceship, loaded with people, named Pioneer 2 lands on Rogol, a tremendous explosion occurs and all contact with the first group landed on Rogol is lost. In this disturbing scenario, you will come into play as a warrior, passenger of the Pioneer 2, with the task of going down to the planet and understanding the truth. What mysteries will be hidden behind the explosion? Is it really a hospitable land as everyone believes? A world divided into castes! Before embarking on the adventure you will be asked to choose between 9 selectable characters (men and women), belonging to 3 different classes: Ranger (recommended for beginners because they have excellent aim even from a distance, and for their skill in use firearms), Forces (a sort of futuristic ~sorcerers~, able to use psychological magic in order to survive, considering their physical weakness, they are certainly the right caste for the most creative among you), and Hunter (specialised in close combat and in the use of white weapons). Each class is in turn divided into three selectable categories: humans, newmen and androids, with their own peculiarities. After selecting your favorite character you can fully customize it thanks to a series of modifiable parameters, face, hair, clothes, physical structure, complexion, and so on. Finally, after these preliminary phases and after having saved your character (the memory will require at least 45 free blocks) you will be ready to start this fantastic adventure. Offline? Training question. In the main menu you will have the possibility to choose whether to face the adventure online or offline. As the name of the game itself suggests, this title was specifically designed to be experienced online, but I personally believe that the offline mode proves to be an excellent (free) training before measuring yourself against the expert Japanese and American players. Surely you get tired after a while, but in the meantime, in addition to accumulating experience, you can increase the various scores of your character, and I assure you that you will really need it, otherwise you will hardly find someone online willing to ally with you. The offline game will see you as protagonist in several main missions, which will engage you in the fight against indigenous creatures that live on the planet Ragol. You have to experience this phase offline as a sort of preparation for the real adventure that you live online, so in addition to facing the enemies you have to practice with the various shops located inside the spaceship, item stores, banks, hospitals, sort of employment offices and so on Finally Online After having performed the indispensable training, all you have to do is connect the Dreamcast to the telephone socket and select ~Online Mode~. At this point you will be asked to enter the Serial Number and the Access Key (contained in a sheet inside the package), and you will find yourself inside one of the specially prepared servers. You will be catapulted into an interplanetary spaceship, populated by hunters (each commanded by someone scattered around the world) looking for friends to ally with in order to face the terrible outside world. Once you have selected your adventure companions (each group can be made up of a maximum of 4 people), based on the data that you can view (name, server of origin, experience...), you are ready to create a new ~channel~ in which to invite your companions and start your adventure on the Pioneer 2, and fulfill the mission that will be assigned to your party. global language One of the problems that the guyszzi of the SonicTeam they had to face was to make communication possible between people coming from various parts of the world and consequently equipped with different languages. The adopted solution is nothing short of ingenious: using an assortment of predefined messages from simple greetings to more complex requests, including cries for help in case of emergency. For the most scrupulous players it will always be possible to use the keyboard (sold separately) dedicated to the Dreamcast, in order to type any text you wish. In any case, the game supports a function for building sentences word by word for everyone, which will then be translated into the various supported languages (English, French, German, Spanish and Japanese). You can also send emails from within the game and prepare your own business cards, called ~Guild Cards~. Unfortunately, Italian is not among the selectable languages, and this is certainly a negative aspect. Let's go into Rogol PSO can be classified as an action/rpg with real-time combat. Unlike RPGs like Final Fantasy, the fights take place along your journey, without being returned to special arenas, and to defend yourself you can use two or three types of attacks, as well as using a dodge automatically managed by the CPU. An element that will penalize you considerably during the clashes is the shot system, which makes it very difficult to see the enemies in the most agitated phases (a map that indicates the enemies present will mitigate this defect) The control system is very simple and immediate, while using all the keys on the pad, even if the character's moves are limited to walking, running and talking to the other members of the group if you are in online mode. As already mentioned, the game is divided into missions. After you have been assigned one inside the spaceship, you can go to the places thanks to the use of teleporters, which at the end of the mission will allow you to return to the base and collect the agreed prize. Just the money, called ~meseta~ in the world of PSO, plays a leading role. Thanks to it you will be able to buy items, weapons, spells in the various shops on the Pioneer 2 and thanks to them you will be able to wake up in the hospital after having died in the war (even if you will find yourself without money). The settings are extremely varied and well detailed, just as the graphics are really well made and the player will feel immersed in an alternative world in which to wander. The only graphical flaws come from small bad clipping defects and slowdowns in online play when the servers are crowded. From the sound point of view we are faced with excellent music and average effects. In conclusion... We are dealing with a highly innovative game, which deconstructs the strict rules of the rpg world to give life to a totally new experience, which opens the door to an online future of video games. The British would call it a must buy, and certainly the purchase is highly recommended. Too bad for some small flaws that prevent it from climbing to the videogame Olympus. pros: pure innovation spectacular settings cons: shot management bad clipping effects scattered here and there Breaking with the past! After a decade in which the world of rpg has not known radical changes, the SonicTeam has decided to take an innovative, but very risky path, leaving the traditional canons to create the first real online rpg for consoles, we are obviously talking about Phantasy Star Online. The structure of the previous episodes of the saga has been significantly modified in order to enhance the online mode to the nth degree, the true cornerstone of this title.", "date": "2001-03-09", "grade": null}
