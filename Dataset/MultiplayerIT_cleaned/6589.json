{"name": "Saint Seiya: Legend of Justice", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/saint-seiya-legend-of-justice-recensione.html", "text": "The Knights of the Zodiac were the protagonists of a real boom towards the end of the 80s, thanks to an animated series that literally made a splash, also pushing the related merchandise a lot. It is therefore no coincidence that, even after so many years, the work of Masami Kurumada continues to thrill millions of fans. Over the years, we have seen various licensed games on iOS and Android which, however, have not stood out for the quality of the experiences offered. Well, will the idle RPG developed by Wanda Cinemas Games be able to reverse this trend? We reveal it to you in the review of Saint Seiya: Legend of Justice. Structure: from manga to game Saint Seiya: Legend of Justice, Crystal / Hyoga is one of the first characters to unlock Let's begin immediately by saying that, although the game's artwork uses a style that is in some ways distant from the magnificent character design of the late Shingo Araki, Saint Seiya: Legend of Justice manages to present itself as a licensed game that truly respects the original work, in this case the manga of Kurumada, which is clearly mentioned with some images in each new chapter. From a structural point of view, the title traces the entire saga of Saint Seiya, starting therefore from the Galactic War and the Twelve Houses to then involve us in later stories. Of course, the narration, in truth, is reduced to the bone and in the end the representation of all these situations and all these characters ends up being simply functional to the action. And that's where the proverbial Pegasus falls into the ravine. Gameplay: idle in name and in fact Saint Seiya: Legend of Justice, a fight with the Gold Saints The trend of idle RPGs is very strong in Asia, but in the eyes of a traditional gamer this peculiar sub-genre stands as a sort of senseless perversion. In fact, we are talking about those titles that basically ~play themselves~, full of automatisms and with a limited degree of interaction, which focus entirely on a progression system which however often and willingly acts as a forerunner for even very aggressive monetization mechanisms. Saint Seiya: Legend of Justice is no exception, unfortunately: the gameplay that the game offers is quite limited, and in practice all we have to do is deploy a team of characters, upgrade them as far as possible and let them fight within a corridor that looks like that of an old-fashioned endless runner. During the clashes we will see the indicators fill up: once they are full, we will be able to touch them to make our Knights carry out their special attacks. The abundance of characters and sagas, as mentioned, is simply functional to this type of action, and so the appointment with the paywall is literally around the corner: if our units are stronger than the opponents they can win the battle, otherwise not . Personal skills and strategies are therefore marginal with respect to the result, which we will be able to influence in an incisive way only through grinding or microtransactions. The good thing is the amount of fanservice for fans of the Knights of the Zodiac, who will be able to find an enormous amount of fighters in the game more or less known, although deployed on the field with little logical sense: since the obscure versions of the various Saints are also available, why make us often fight even with duplicates of our characters? Technical realization: too little Saint Seiya: Legend of Justice, one of the campaign fights There is no doubt that opting for a vertical view and an approach, as mentioned, similar to the old endless runners does not play in favor of the visual impact of Saint Seiya: Legend of Justice, which in fact turns out to be modest. The characters are too small, the animations ugly, the scenarios are frankly unwatchable and only the representation of the special moves raises the general level a bit. The official license of Saint Seiya has allowed the developers to use the iconic music of the anime and this obviously it helps to create a certain type of atmosphere, as well as to excite the most ardent fans, but often during the action we will have to settle for generic songs, while the sound effects are purely essential.", "date": "2022-08-04", "grade": "5.0"}
