{"name": "Metroid Prime 3: Corruption", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/metroid-prime-3-corruption_a.html", "text": "Spacetrotters With the exception of the first hour of the game, set in the vast and aforementioned Olympus ship, however, you will be able to wander through a succession of large and airy levels, as per tradition, whose visit will go hand in hand with the skills you have in possession. Precisely the continuous discovery and the ensuing amazement are the main themes of the entire experience, the only ones capable of justifying the much back-tracking required. The variety is then guaranteed by cold icy landscapes, damp caves, lands burned by flames and deep space, with a style that closely resembles Prime and Echos and which stands at the top offered by the Wii as regards the maturity of the situations. The divided soul, between shooter and adventure, is perfectly rendered in every situation. If the first half, made up of plasma bullets and an aim to be refined, is based on its simple and immediate conception, the second is based on the pleasure of research and not least on the use of the rich documentation available, complete with maps three-dimensional and the collection of all the conversations and data obtained. Except for some more complex passages, none of the three initial difficulty levels puts you in the presence of an impossible challenge, leaving it to be the very approach with which you relate to the adventure that has the last word on the effort you can suffer to complete it: by meticulously observing each room and all the details, one avoids being stuck during the following visits, when probably the goal to which one aspires has only been mentioned or entrusted to memory. The Hyper Mode deserves a separate discussion, which can be unlocked after the adventure and is able to significantly increase the resistance and strength of the enemies, representing a decidedly demanding challenge. Much has since been said about the absence of multiplayer. The ~Metroidian~ universe would in theory allow this kind of modality  as more or less brilliantly demonstrated by the Nintendo DS incarnation  but the very nature of the product would have been upset, resulting in being valid because it is the rib of a set of valid elements, not for its true dignity in its own right. It would not have contributed to the pursuit of excellence, so it is good that it does not exist. Collect them all As a nice addition, Retro Studios has decided to assign some medals based on particular results obtained  number of kills, combat techniques, etc ... -, which can then be exchanged for interesting additions using the appropriate menu. Sketches and dioramas but not only, as there are special stickers for the shuttle and a personalized and exclusive Mii puppet, as well as a photo mode with which to capture in-game shots and then send them to friends. Finally, the entire soundtrack will also be unlockable and listenable separately. In short, for all tastes! Being Samus The controls have one of the most heavily influenced sides in the development phase, having to adapt a setting created for a classic pad to the Wiimote / Nunchuck combination, while trying to make some innovations. Unlike what previously happened with other first-person titles, this task was successfully completed, developing ad hoc solutions of the highest caliber. The management of movements - both when erect and in spherical form - and of the view, respectively with the stick and the movement sensor, are simple and accurate, while the possibility of hooking up to opponents is essential when precision is not a simple quirk. The use of the harpoon is also very intuitive, for which the gesture of launching and calling to oneself will be mimicked, as are the various upgrades and power-ups: from missiles to the fearsome laser to the Phazon, a quantity of weapons are the only solution to the most demanding fights, such as those with the huge bosses who occasionally peep into the player's way. Obviously there is no shortage of supplementary visors which, in addition to the traditional ones such as the one dedicated to the interface with computers and the analysis of the most sensitive objectives, see the most interesting introduction in the Command Visor: with this it will be possible to recall Samus's shuttle at pre-established points , speeding up the movements or solving the most complex passages. The Wii puts the turbo Metroid Prime: Corruption manages to satisfy the eye as perhaps no other title released for the Wii has done up to now. In particular, a simply impressive fluidity catches the eye in any situation, even the most eventful, which combined with the skill with which the textures and good effects have been reproduced, gives a decidedly positive panorama. Only the models, not all of them to be honest, suffer from the deficiencyza of polygons which in any case should not be confused with the angular style chosen once again for the characters and settings. The latter enjoy a successful mix of elements, which combine parts of a clear science fiction matrix with others that are more naturalistic or with an ancient flavor. On the other hand, the use of the 3D map requires some practice, essential for orientation but difficult to manage in the first instance, while at times the uploads are almost ridiculous, tedious due to their excessive length: moreover, it often happens that you make the wrong destination and have to immediately go back to the own steps, undergoing these interminable pauses. As now standard for the console, support for both 16: 9 and 480p resolution is full, with the further note that even on the LCD panels it is possible to have a more than satisfactory rendering. The soundtrack features well-acted voice acting, successful effects and a fantastic orchestral score, with old and new themes of unique intensity and beauty. Virtually perfect. Comment Metroid Prime: Corruption is an unmissable title for every Nintendo Wii owner, based on the now ultra-tested structure of the previous two chapters, to which it adds a whole series of innovations related to the control system and a first-class graphic-sound sector. Overall, what impresses is the naturalness with which the hours of play follow one another and the ability to keep glued to the screen without ever having to resort to excesses or upheavals, making the experience a single, constant solo The few dark sides  or rather, less brilliant  they can be summed up in the perhaps not excessive involvement that it could cause to those who approached this title in the hope of finding a naked and raw shooter, immediate and less tied to exploration. For everyone else, it deserves every penny it costs. Pros Innovations are all in the right place at the right time. Over 15 hours of duration Technically at the top of the console Against River Loads If Prime and Echos are not liked, Corruption will not change their opinion Metroid Prime 3: Corruption is available for Nintendo Wii. The first European autumn of the Nintendo Wii continues under the best stars which, after having given its users the little jewel Super Paper Mario, is preparing to bring back the beautiful Samus, the absolute protagonist of the Metroid first-person adventure series. In fact, it is with Corruption that the trilogy that began five years ago on Game Cube ends, capable of repeating the success of the previous two-dimensional episodes and gaining unanimous acknowledgments from audiences and critics. The sci-fi setting  always original and immediately distinguishable  influences the narrative cue: it starts with an arrival, the one on the Olympus space frigate, to immediately become aware of the dramatic situation in which the Federation's computers find themselves, contaminated by the Phazon and now out of control. It will therefore be up to Samus and four other bounty hunters to resolve the thorny cascade of events that will follow this cue. Wanting to leave the details that will follow veiled, it is good to immediately highlight the ability with which this albeit simple plot is narrated, both with the spectacular films dedicated to the main events, and with the many communications, vocal and written, received from time to time , which give a first and not ignoreable contribution to identification. The experience, entirely focused on the single player front, makes use of a framework that follows and is almost entirely affected by the excellent work done by Retro Studios in the last five years. It is therefore a question of exploring vast environments located on a handful of planets, alternating the resolution of puzzles with the killing of increasingly dangerous monsters. This continuous stimulation of intellect and reflexes is a force to which Metroid Corruption will appeal again and again, managing the difficult task of convincing for all the more than 15 hours necessary to complete the adventure.", "date": "2007-10-25", "grade": null}
