{"name": "The Getaway", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-getaway-3.html", "text": "The other side of the coin As repeatedly stated by the developers themselves, The Getaway has little to do with titles such as GTA3 and its spin-off, to which it can be united only for the excessive (perhaps at times gratuitous) violence; for the rest, the game that comes closest to it is Mafia for PC. Focusing on a decidedly cinematic approach, The Getaway puts the player (at least initially) in the role of an ex-bank robber called Mark Hammond, who has finally atoned for his sins and is preparing to live an honest life together with his wife and son . Unfortunately, however, one of his old and deranged business ~associates~ kills his wife and kidnaps his son, forcing our Mark to re-enter the ~round~ and start a real private war against both the police and other factions who control the territory of London. The types of missions present in The Getaway can be broken into two large sections: the foot sections, where Mark will have to perform more or less suicidal actions, and missions aboard motor vehicles, which can be stolen at any time (yes, there is also the famous double decker, the London double-decker bus) and will be used to reach certain locations or ram other vehicles. The story itself will unfold through two different points of view, that of the ~bad~ Mark Hammond, an adjective purposely placed in quotation marks because the development of the plot will not be free from twists, and that of detective Carter. Just to maintain a precise cinematic cut within the game, Team Soho has decided to purge the screen of any indicator or hud of any kind, leaving only our character and the world around him visible. When we find ourselves facing missions aboard cars, we will be able to orient ourselves thanks to the arrows of our vehicle, which will indicate the direction to follow to reach the objective of the mission. In the sections on foot, however, we will be able to check our state of health by seeing the bloodstains that will appear on the protagonist and through his gait: the greater the damage suffered, the more the ambulation of our digital alter ego will become slow and uncertain. Our energy can be restored by leaning against the walls and remaining still for a few seconds, a feature certainly in tune with the game, but which can lead to continuous interruptions in the course of the action; especially at the beginning, when you have little confidence with the control system. The movements available to the main protagonists are placed in the standard for the genre; Mark can lean against the wall and crawl, shoot with only his arm exposed, somersault to avoid bullets, use auto-aim or not. Unfortunately, the impossibility of rotating the view to your liking makes it (at least initially) quite difficult to juggle during firefights, but in general the situation improves with due practice. The sections in which we will be on board vehicles turn out to be very fun and immediate, especially during the escape / chase phases. The driving model is placed in the arcade vein and certainly does not aspire to a rigorous physical simulation, with a setting that in some ways recalls Metropolis Street Racer by Bizarre Creations. The implementation of damage to vehicles will also be reflected in the control of the car, in fact it will not be uncommon for the police to puncture a wheel at a checkpoint, or for repeated accidents to change the set-up of the car, to the point of making it uncontrollable. But how do you let it play? Managing a title like The Getaway was not easy at all, and unfortunately the various imperfections and shortcomings that characterize the title are here to confirm it. The missions, albeit to a large extent exciting, follow a very specific plot between shootings, car chases and very rare situations in which you have to use your head rather than brute force. The artificial intelligence routines are very simplified, in fact they are limited to making enemies chase you and make you shoot, without following alternative paths or cover behind particular objects (except on rare occasions). The police sometimes seem to be overly reactive to our infractions, and the lack of a rear view mirror or any rear view at all doesn't help with that. The same passers-by will most often run wildly in circles, inevitably being hit during a shootout or mad chase. The decision to eliminate the hud and the ability to manually adjust the orientation of the camera is original and realistic, adds immersiveness, but leads, especially in the early stages of the game, to a bit of disorientation. Saidthis, The Getaway also has several strings to its bow, thanks to the excellent structuring of many missions, to a good plot that supports our adventure, up to the possibility of roaming around the city of London with the most disparate means. Without forgetting that, once the game is completed, you can freely roam the city. Mon amour technique... The work done by Team Soho in reproducing London has been mammoth, and the results are certainly appreciated. Each pub, shop or building (especially in the central area) is faithfully reproduced both in the exterior and interior, with textures ranging from good to discreet, but which generally shine for variety. The cut-scenes themselves, created with the game's graphics engine, are of excellent workmanship, with one of the best faces that have appeared on Playstation2. The city of London is also very populated, the variety of cars present is very good as well as their polygonal modeling, which also benefits from environmental-mapping effects for some objects that adorn the streets. However, all this pays off in terms of drops in fluidity in the most crowded situations, which however do not affect playability in the most absolute way. To offer a graphics department that was up to par, the guys from Team Soho had to resort to some compromises, first of all with the intensive use of ~blurred~ textures in the distance, which inevitably lose quality if observed closely (we are talking above all of the exteriors ). Furthermore, the lack of a fully controllable view by the player, as well as a precise design choice, is probably to be justified by the fact that the graphics engine cannot handle abrupt and random scene changes. From an audio point of view, the game can enjoy an excellent localization in Italian and is entirely voiced by very capable actors. In the dialogues vulgarity abounds, so much so that one wonders if one hasn't exaggerated a little too much with the profanity, which is absolutely gratuitous on several occasions. A title not suitable for younger gamers therefore, also for the type of missions we will have to face and for the settings in which they are set (cafes in the Soho district that defining ~red light~ is an understatement...). Finally, the presence of the 60hz and progressive scan modes should be noted, further added value to the technical part of the game. Comment The Getaway isn't the masterpiece everyone expected, but it has the rare virtue of ending on a crescendo and enticing the player to see what the story holds until completion. The missions range from mediocre to exciting, but in general we can say that the work done by the Soho team, although full of imperfections and shortcomings, turns out to be of a good standard, with an adequate reproduction of London and which provides an excellent challenge. A must try experience for all PlayStaton 2 owners and a highly recommended purchase. Pros: Very well done London recreation Some exciting missions Technically good Cons: Simplistic AI Little freedom Lack of real innovations Comment Attention! As can be clearly seen from the sticker on the cover, a nice Forbidden to minors under 18 years old, The Getaway is certainly not a title suitable for everyone, due to the high dose of violence and foul language. To sleep the children! London is a beautiful city. Immense, multi-ethnic, full of colors and alive even at night. Only the gray weather limits the splendor in part, but its fog is almost also one of the characteristics that made it so fascinating. The Soho Team with a lot of courage (and a millionaire budget) has tried to reproduce this stupendous metropolis in the most realistic way possible, mapping it for over 40 square km and bringing it directly to Playstation2. And he didn't stop there, since he wanted to add an ambitious interactive film project to the painstaking reproduction of the city, with perfectly recreated digital actors, top-level motion capture, hours and hours of dialogue and a compelling and complex plot. It goes without saying that around this The Getaway, announced more than two years ago and delayed several times, a hype of gigantic proportions has been created, which it is difficult to survive... And it is precisely from this assumption that we must judge the game: forget the splendid rendered images that appeared some time ago, the latest effort by Team Soho is a good game, but absolutely not a masterpiece as someone (perhaps more than one) would have expected.", "date": "2002-12-11", "grade": null}
