{"name": "The Game of Life", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-game-of-life.html", "text": "It is known that board games often have ancient origins, and in the case of The Game of Life we are even talking about the end of the 19th century. 1861, to be precise: the legendary Milton Bradley, pioneer of modern game designers, invented this pastime inspired by an imported game that had been given to him by a friend. The success of the product was extraordinary and lightning-fast, so much so that The Game of Life was able to survive for a century and a half, thanks to continuous reinterpretations that made it more modern and adapted to the times every time. In this specific case, in fact, the correspondence of the game with the current historical reality is very important: the players, in fact, after having thrown a ball in the roulette placed in the center of the board, will find themselves moving their pawn through those that are the events of each person's life. They will have to choose between different careers, they will have to get married and have children, they will have to buy a house and, in general, try to achieve success from all points of view. From the start screen we can start a game alone or in multiplayer, the latter using the ~pass and play~ system that uses a single phone for multiple players. In single player mode, we will have to choose our character from the four available, then decide how many opponents we will have and draw the first card, which we will use at the first opportunity. Once this is done, we'll move on to shooting the ball in roulette, by pressing the 5 key according to an indicator on the screen: the resulting number will correspond to the boxes we'll be able to go through. As also happens in the famous Monopoly, each box can hide pitfalls or happy events: depending on our luck, we will find ourselves earning or spending money, going to modify our available capital, which then represents in some way the measure of our success to other players. We will happen to choose between study or work, between diametrically opposed careers, or to get married and have children, with the expenses that all this entails. At the end of the board, we will be able to retire to private life and watch what our opponents manage to combine before joining us... The technical realization of the game is discreet, and indeed it would have been difficult to expect much more. The board is designed in an essential but legible way, and the same thing can be said of the pawns. The management of the graphics, in general, appears quite agile, without particular problems. The various cards are well made, while the sound sector is as usual devoid of quality and can be largely deactivated. There's not much to say about the control system: we'll simply have to press a few buttons, given that the level of interactivity is what it is. PRO Faithful to the board game A large number of possible events Very simple... AGAINST ...but just as limited Poorly interactive Technically only sufficient", "date": "2008-10-02", "grade": "S.V."}
