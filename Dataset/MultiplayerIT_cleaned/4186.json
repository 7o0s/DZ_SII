{"name": "Darkness Rises", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/darkness-rises-recensione.html", "text": "Darkness Rises aims to establish itself within a vein, that of action RPGs, which is very strong on mobile devices, thanks in the first place to some excellent exponents. However, we are talking about the new production by Nexon, which means that the development team had the necessary resources at its disposal to complete such a onerous task, and this is evident right from the start. In fact, the game boasts extraordinary quality graphics, very close to that of current consoles, especially if you enter the options screen from the iPhone X to maximize detail and frame rate, thus obtaining an experience that does not budge from sixty frames per second and whose visual impact fears very few comparisons on iOS and Android. The accompanying plot is fairly derivative, it is enough for you to know that in a dark fantasy setting our task will be to defend the borders of a kingdom from the attack of the forces of evil. To accomplish this mission we will first have to try our hand at some tutorial-style stages, becoming familiar with the excellent touch controls and the combat system, immediate but with a minimum of thickness where it allows, by pressing a button, to perform a somersault to dodge the blows of enemies. However, this is only one of the many maneuvers available, all of which can only be replicated after a variable cooldown period, with the only exception of the main attack. Once the introductory phase is complete, we will be able to really get busy, selecting the class we want for our character (warrior, assassin, sorceress or berserker) and modifying its appearance using a fairly complete editor, which does not give up even a little fan service (yes, it is possible to adjust the breast size of female avatars). Gameplay and Structure: Army of Darkness The mechanics of Darkness Rises belong to the tradition of mobile action RPGs, although the approach chosen by the authors is that of short missions, to be consumed in rapid succession according to the terms of a structure that, inevitably, focuses on the replayability of the individual stages in order to lengthen the single player campaign and avoid completing it within a couple of hours. It is for this reason that the new narrative chapters are unlocked only after having completely explored each scenario, returning to it several times to face different types of enemies and even bosses. It should be pointed out: during the first few games the experience turns out to be quite trivial and inconsistent due to a lowered degree of challenge, so you'll have to wait until you reach at least level 10 for things to get a little more interesting, perhaps running into in the first game over against a more powerful and resistant opponent than usual. However, the suspicion is that they have chosen to proceed in this way to provide a lot of strictly free content, including a cooperative mode with various unlockable options and a competitive multiplayer also divided into various phases. The very rich outline also falls within this perspective, made up of unlockable and upgradeable objects, features to improve, skills to obtain and consolidate, the inevitable prize boxes and an almost infinite list of achievements. In short, Darkness Rises draws from what has now become the tradition of the genre, pulling out anything that allows you to capture the attention of the players and make them return for yet another game; and it does so in a sensible way, given that any paywalls only appear after a few hours of play, when by now the user has clear ideas about what he wants from this experience. A feature that makes it a little difficult to frame the gameplay balance perfectly, given that we often find ourselves faced with situations that are too easy to solve, but the feeling is that a really good job has been done, with references that come a little from everywhere (Middle-earth Shadow of War, to name one) but a quality that always remains high, net of the inevitable repetitiveness of the action.", "date": "2018-06-27", "grade": "8.5"}
