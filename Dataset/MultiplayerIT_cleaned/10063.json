We are faced with a series of fighting games that in some ways distort the classic characterization of this glorious trend, dictated by timeless masterpieces such as Street Fighter 2 or its SNK-branded antagonists; characterization that precisely sees a series of factors concur as promoters of success in battle: timing, yes, but also the ability to perform combos and special moves, not being surprised by the opponent's attacks and being able to manage the space available to us in the best of ways. As anyone who has had the opportunity to try the product published by Tomy knows, the characters make their moves without the player having to perform particular key combinations: just press a button several times to get a combo, and associate this pressure with a direction of the analog stick or d-pad to come up with a special move. Some of them have a purely defensive value (see ~active parries~), others allow us to hit our opponent even from a distance; and then there is the classic ~super move~, capable of changing the tide of the battle, to which the developers have assigned a special button: we just have to press it when the chakra bar is full, being careful to do it when which the enemy has an exposed side, otherwise the precious spiritual energy will be wasted. My ninja friend Beyond the ~alternative~ game mechanics, which take some getting used to, Clash of Ninja Revolution 3 introduces a series of interesting new features and can count on respectable numbers: almost forty characters, seventeen scenarios and a total of ten different game modes. From the initial screen the accounts do not add up? The reason is obvious: to unlock the secret characters (there are only eight initially available), the stages and the extra modes you have to buy them in the special ~shop~, spending the money earned with the fights, especially those that make up the mode ~ history~. It is in this juncture, unfortunately, that the new work by Eighting / Raizing just does not shine, very often offering us annoying limit conditions in order to win the clashes. A quick example: at a certain point we have to defeat Itachi Uchiha, Sasuke's older brother, and to do so we must necessarily end the fight with a super move. Have we already talked about the importance of timing in the game? Well, this means that in addition to reducing the energy bar of an already very cunning opponent, we are also called to guess the moment in which he cannot parry our attack maneuver, then execute it. What if it goes bad? Here, exactly. Again in the ~story~ mode, the multiple fights also return, which have characterized Clash of Ninja Revolution since its inception and which have never fully convinced, due to the confusion and woodenness of the movements that are created in such a crowded context , with three or four characters facing each other in the same arena and who can clearly defend and attack on one front. From this point of view, some options of the ~clash~ mode only make matters worse, allowing us to organize free meetings between two characters, between two teams or between three or four different players. It is even possible to limit oneself to being a spectator. The strength of a hundred arms We were talking about the news. Apart from the presence of characters and situations from the Shippuden series, which Naruto fans will surely appreciate, we finally have an online multiplayer mode that can be accessed via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. Finding matches isn't always a quick operation, unfortunately, and once an opponent has been challenged you notice the typical problems deriving from the ~lag~, the presence of which profoundly undermines the quality of the experience, given the already mentioned importance of timing during matches. clashes. The unlockable modes ~time attack~, ~survival~, ~kumite~ and above all ~missions~ fortunately increase the longevity of the product considerably, together with the possibility of being able to obtain a fourth level of difficulty for the ~story~ mode. However, it was reasonable to expect an online multiplayer equal to the situation, after all we are talking about the same team of developers who dealt with the conversion of the extraordinary Tatsunoko vs Capcom for Wii. Moving on to the controls, the best way to play Naruto Shippuden: Clash of Ninja Revolution 3 is undoubtedly using a Classic Controller or, alternatively, a controllerfor GameCubes. The alternatives present, with only the Wii-mote horizontally or the combination of Wii-mote and Nunchuck, on the one hand allow some unprecedented and interesting maneuvers (the position of the hands can activate ~boosts~ for the power of the attacks or the level of the chakra), on the other they force us to shake the device to repel projectiles (Wii-mote only) or even to carry out light attacks (using the pair of controllers). The configuration of the keys is unchanged: we have a button for the light attack, one for the heavy attack and one for the grip, assisted by the button for activating the super move, the large back keys for rapid lateral movement and the small shoulder keys for character replacement (in team mode) or ~lock-on~ on opponent (during matches with more than two characters on screen). Finally, as far as the technical realization is concerned, the undoubtedly higher numbers compared to the previous episode do not correspond to greater care. We therefore have rather bare and uninspired scenarios, but above all terribly woody characters, who have completely lost the naturalness of the movements seen in the first Clash of Ninja Revolution. Finally, the dubbing is only in English and it is terrible as per tradition.", "date": "2010-04-20", "grade": "7.3"}
