Even more incredible is the fact that this title has never seen a home transposition faithful to the original, Arcade Perfect we like to say, the forbidden dream of every Sega lover to take the cabinet home. If we exclude the Saturn version, somewhat problematic, and the 2001 version for Dreamcast, which however deviated significantly, it is precisely in 2011 that we can enjoy an edition on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live platforms that is absolutely indistinguishable from that miracle of polygons, speed and colors that shook our fragile minds. But times have changed, as has the sensitivity towards graphic sectors, in the name of a technological frenzy that hardly knows how to look back. Probably aware of this, AM2 has not limited itself to converting the original code, but has made significant aesthetic improvements, especially designed for new generation televisions (read: HD), but we'll talk about this later. Blue, blue sky, I see... From the menus, the playful offer is immediately clear, structured through countless facets of a formula with the thickness of tissue paper. So don't expect career mode, Grand Prix or a boundless garage of cars, for those there are Forza and Gran Turismo, Daytona USA just wants to bring you back to those wonderful and unforgettable days, with an eye, however, attentive to scoring and online competitions. In addition to the Arcade version, which can be customized both in terms of difficulty and number of rounds, the one that attracts the most attention is the Survivor mode, where you have to resist as much as possible in the three famous circuits, increasing a functional multiplier to the score. The main enemy is obviously represented by time, tyrannical and lethal, which is partially restored not only by cutting the checkpoint, but by carrying out the most disparate maneuvers, from controlled skidding, to maximum acceleration on impact with the pins surrounding the track. The frenzy and fun that comes with this mode is not easy to describe in words, but we assure you that the mere desire to beat the scores of friends will make it difficult for you to leave the pad. In addition to this we find the challenge Challenge, where we are asked to carry out precise operations along a series of mini stages located throughout the routes. In a delusional apotheosis we also find a Karaoke mode where you can run around singing the legendary pieces of Takenobu Mitsuyoshi. It is here that every true fan risks a heart attack by listening to Let's Go Away, The King Of Speed and the crazy Sky High, almost an emblem of the joyful Sega philosophy of the golden age. We take this opportunity to point out that the game ofers the motifs of the original edition by default, but through the options it is possible to choose the rearranged versions of the Saturn edition, definitely preferable! Xbox 360 goals The canonical 12 objectives for a total of 200 player points are those proposed by Daytona USA. The tasks required to achieve them are not too onerous, such as finishing on the podium in all three available circuits, at any level of difficulty, or reaching certain points in Survivor mode. Obtaining them all won't be an excessively burdensome operation, excluding at least two ~hidden~ ones that we advise you not to peek at beforehand so as not to spoil the surprise (and the pleasure of obtaining them!)... Back to 1993 As we said, Daytona USA technically benefits from several graphical improvements compared to the Coin Op, even if AM2 has decided not to distort the aesthetics and artistic direction of the original, working on texture resolution, trilinear filtering and bringing everything to HD . The general impact is excellent, especially on the 16:9 displays, even if the low polygonal load and the scarce detail offered by cars and scenarios remain unchanged, certainly not comparable to today's productions. But this is certainly not the main objective of Daytona USA, and the framerate firmly anchored at 60 fps prevents us from dwelling too much on the details. And then, we assure you, after a few minutes of playing you won't think about it anymore. The most interesting aspect of this reissue lies in the validity of the steering system, which has brilliantly managed to pass the test of time. The one represented is obviously an Arcade gameplay devoted to simplicity and without the slightest pretense of realism, even if the wear of the tires, the dynamic damage and the presence of the Pit Stops enrich the formula with a pinch of strategy. Takeering a curve in full drift is as fun as in 93, undoubtedly thanks to the design of the tracks, particularly the oval one at the Beginner level. But it is impossible not to mention the third, an interminable circuit that winds through cities, ports and poignant cliffs complete with seagulls flying over our canopy. Once all the modes have been completed, the fun moves online, with competitions for up to 8 players, the ability to create custom games and regularly updated score and time tables. We did not encounter any particular problems in the online sessions, which took place with excellent fluidity, completely comparable to the Single player one, a clear sign of the goodness of the code. Admittedly, this is almost purely a nostalgic operation and if you don't feel fit to race endlessly chasing records on just three tracks, Daytona USA may be aged a little too soon. Daytona USA is available on the Xbox Live Marketplace for 800 Microsoft Points, you can buy it at this address.", "date": "2011-10-31", "grade": "8.5"}
