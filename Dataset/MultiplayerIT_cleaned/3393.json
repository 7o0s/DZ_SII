In short, we are talking about a product which, with its elitist profile, certainly does not present itself as a chart-topping blockbuster, which would not be a bad thing at all, on the contrary: however, after playing Atone: Heart of the Elder Tree, it is clear that developers lacked the necessary experience to balance a mix of ingredients with so many different flavors... Adventure, rhytm game and divinity Atone: Heart of the Elder Tree is an adventure at its core, with the user having to move around the various maps by talking to non-player characters, collecting objects and solving puzzles and simple quests. The plot follows the story of Estra, daughter of the last great leader of her people, engaged in a journey through Midgard to shed light on the events of her past that seem to be intertwined in some way with the reasons that prompted Odin and the other deities to abandon humans. The Wildboy Studios team has evidently focused a lot on the presentation of the product, which is truly extraordinary: the design of the characters and settings is a very successful blend of ancient and modern elements, embellished by a fascinating minimalist cut that gives a unique glance, not only for the mobile landscape. The graphics amaze both for the attention to detail in the exploration phases (framed from a bird's eye view) and for the rendering during the combat sequences and the cutscenes, animated with a technique that closely resembles the rotoscope by Another World. The sound is no less, which can count on an excellent quality English dubbing and above all on an evocative musical accompaniment by the Australian artist Luminist, made up of synthesizers and digital reproductions of period instruments. The problem with Atone: Heart of the Elder Tree is that, taking its excellent production values out of the way, there is unfortunately very little left to talk about in completely flattering terms. The story, despite the intriguing premises, completely lacks balance: in addition to taking for granted a basic knowledge of Norse mythology that not everyone can have, the narrative proves to be too hasty in some cases and excessively verbose in others, also failing to give the right weight to the dramatic moments and to what should be the most comical and light situations. We therefore continue by appreciating the style exercise of the developers which however is not supported by an adequate structure, for a development that we would not hesitate to define even boring. Unfortunately, the gameplay also emphasizes Wildboy Studios' choice of appearances over substance, with a rather bland exploration of the maps and generally trivial puzzles that occasionally lead to excessively cryptic manifestations, denoting here too a chronic lack of balance: a defect that is also found in overly stylized menus and in mechanics that do not even benefit from a tutorial line, which instead would have been beneficial especially for what concerns clashes with enemies. The fights have the advantage of having original premises and each one enjoying animated sequences and music created specifically for the occasion, but the rest is watering everywhere. The dynamics are typical of rhythm games a la Guitar Hero, with the player having to press the indicated key when the icon reaches the end of a line: in theory, correct input sequences should be performed to deliver a blow to the opponent, but reality is a mess in which you understand very little or nothing of what happens on the screen. The attacks seem to be inflicted in a completely arbitrary way (and on the other hand the game doesn't explain anything even in this area), the tap detection on the touchscreen really leaves a lot to be desired, the keystrokes to press present pointless peaks of difficulty and the lines frequently move to the side to show the action in the background, adding further confusion to an already chaotic picture. The fact that Atone: Heart of the Elder Tree is played better with a pad rather than using touch controls is finally the clear demonstration of a title born with other platforms in mind and brought to iOS without too much conviction.", "date": "2019-11-04", "grade": "6.5"}
