Is it a phoenix? Is it a meteorite? Is it Super Man? No, it's a nuclear missile that sends you to the other world in a flash, without however having to bear the costs of the funeral. Surely some of you have wondered what would happen if an atomic war were to break out. Well, now you can view it thanks to what is more of a tool than a video game, as you will learn by reading the Nuclear War Simulator review. Pure simulation Simulating large-scale nuclear war will appeal to a niche of people Nuclear War Simulator is a nuclear war scenario generator in which the player sets various parameters of the simulation and then watches what happens. During the simulation it is not possible to intervene in any way on the development of the events. It is important that this point is understood well so as not to misunderstand the nature of the Bit Mirror product, which must necessarily be taken for what it is. From this point of view the tutorial does a valuable job in making us understand all that we can do and not do. In general we have to choose the forces in the field, for example USA against Russia, then position bases, ground forces and air forces, determine the nuclear power of both factions, choose the allies of each, perhaps dedicate ourselves to the behavior of single individuals that populate the simulation, then press the play button and watch as nuclear bombs travel from one part of the planet to another, clicking on a calculator icon to get the raw numbers of the destruction created. If desired, you can also load preset scenarios to immediately have something to observe, modifying some parameters according to your personal tastes in terms of atomic disasters. From a scenario-setting standpoint, you can really do anything from looking at the effects of an atomic bomb on a single densely populated area to comparing two small nations. An escalation of the conflict can also be simulated. The results will always be observable in detail, with geographical maps dedicated to showing the effects of the bombs on the territories. For example, the deaths caused by the explosion and the effects of radioactive fallout are counted, complete with graphs showing which areas are most affected. As a study tool Nuclear War Simulator is really good Do you want to study the effects of a bomb on a strip of territory? You can. Are you interested in understanding whether there would be survivors in the event of a nuclear war? You can do this too, thanks to the pre-set scenarios that simulate the current geopolitical reality of the various continents. What you cannot do is interact directly with the system, so much so that after a while, if you are not passionate about the subject, the whole experience leaves the time it finds for a while, i.e. it produces the effect that usually have the tools that happen to be found on the net, those with which you spend a few minutes intrigued by the novelty, and then move on to do something else. Problems Nuclear War Simulator is full of graphs and statistics The main problem with Nuclear War Simulator, therefore, is that it runs out really quickly, unless you use it as a means of study. Moreover, at present it is plagued by a strong instability and really annoying performance problems, between continuous clicks and sudden returns to the desktop ... considering that it is a game essentially made up of maps and graphs, with essential animations, it is not really the maximum. Honestly, we didn't like it very much even from the point of view of the visual rendering of the conflicts. Sure, we didn't expect who knows what, but at least more dignified explosions, given the theme of simulation. Instead everything is essential, abstract, cold and detached. Maybe it's a good thing, given the theme, but we felt a little bitterness in the mouth all the same. The developers' goal is certainly to make us focus on the statistics, i.e. on the effects of the conflicts, making us play with the configuration of the same, but there was really no need to annoy the player in every possible way.", "date": "2023-02-07", "grade": "6.0"}
