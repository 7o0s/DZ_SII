{"name": "Devil May Cry 3 Special Edition - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/devil-may-cry-3-special-edition-recensione.html", "text": "Graphics and sound All lovers of the latest effects and jaw-breaking graphics will inevitably be disappointed by Devil May Cry 3, which does not exploit any feature of the latest video cards nor can it boast a particularly impressive polygonal mass, but presents the exact same graphics seen on PlayStation 2 with a higher resolution and possibly the application of anti-aliasing and anisotropic filtering. However, the final rendering on the screen is not to be condemned completely, and the salvageable is saved thanks to a more than good character design, an undeniable atmosphere and good animations. The biggest weakness is the same as the PS2 - the textures, which are very blurry. The musical component is entrusted to adrenaline-pumping metal-style songs, which go well with the braggart nature of the protagonist, while the dubbing, strictly in English, stands at discrete levels. The manual, menus and subtitles of the game are completely in Italian. The age-old problem of conversion Whenever we are faced with a console conversion, we inevitably run into a wall of silly limitations due to the very little time employed by the programmers for the adaptation. Devil May Cry 3 is no exception, and we therefore find, for example, the settings file (DMC3SE.ini) in read-only mode (if so, change it, or the options will not be saved), the inability to use the mouse in the menus, the possibility of exiting the game only by pressing ALT+F4 (there is no menu item), full motion video in low resolution and other little unpleasant flaws. This does not diminish the intrinsic value of the game but, let's face it, in the year 2006 these nonsense are starting to get annoying, especially considering the fact that a few minutes and a few lines of code would be enough to solve many of them. The most consistent problem encountered in DMC3, however, unfortunately goes far beyond the status of ~stupidness~: many users have had serious problems in mapping and using native PC joypads, essential for enjoying a game like this to the fullest. Some have solved using the ControlMK emulation software (downloadable at this address). Absolutely perfect, however, the functioning of the original PlayStation 2 joypad connected to the PC via the EMS adapter. Another small problem is that of resolution: some players don't have the possibility to use the maximum resolution supported by their monitor, and among these there is me, who is forced to play at 1280x960 when my monitor supports up to 1280x1024. Dante and Virgil This third episode is placed chronologically before Devil May Cry, and presents us with a Dante, a boy born from the union of the legendary demon Sparda with a mortal, younger, beardless and rebellious, with such a tamarro attitude as to be almost annoying. The adventure begins when our hero decides to open a paranormal investigation agency, and even before starting the business he sees a gigantic tower sprouting from the underground right next to his shop. Behind this event is Virgil, his twin brother, who with a large group of demons aims to restore the infernal kingdom on earth. Needless to say, Dante disagrees. DMC3, like its predecessors, is an action entirely in 3D with shots managed by the CPU, not controllable by the player. In this ~Special Edition~, among the improvements made to the normal version, it is worth mentioning the possibility of controlling Virgil. The combat system is based on the pairing of white weapons and firearms, which Dante can alternately use in spectacular combos. By killing monsters (in this case demons of various types) or by reaching particular locations, objects called orbs are obtained, through which it is possible to acquire new skills and upgrade weapons. in this Special edition it is possible to unlock Virgil and use it to play Dante and Virgil The orbs are simply concentrates of demonic substances, and based on the color they have a different effect. After satisfying particular conditions, Dante (or Virgil) will have the opportunity to go into Devil Trigger, i.e. to unleash the infernal forces that dwell in him, transforming himself into a demon for a limited period of time, with the effect of increasing both the offensive than defensive. The combat system, fun and frenetic at the right point, is quite technical, and if mastered properly it can be profound and satisfying. By upgrading Dante and acquiring new weapons, the range of moves available grows more and more, reaching an undoubtedly excellent level of depth.mo, higher than that of more acclaimed games like God of War. The ability to select from different styles, each granting particular extra attacks, adds a good deal of variety. Longevity stands at more than discrete levels, guaranteeing around 15 hours of first-play gameplay for expert players of the genre. A look at the past Way back in 2001, the first Devil May Cry was a real bolt from the blue. Shinji Mikami, the legendary Capcom game-designer, had initially entrusted Hideki Kamiya with the development of Resident Evil 4, but after a few weeks of work he realized that the project was straying too far from the idea of survival horror. Mikami thus decided to let Kamiya continue on his way, to create something new and conceptually different, which then materialized in the action with a gothic / horror setting that any fan of the genre knows. Devil May Cry was the first title to showcase the true graphics capabilities of the PlayStation 2, and it was a huge success among gamers also thanks to excellent playability, an adrenaline-pumping soundtrack and the undeniable charisma of Dante, the protagonist man and half demon always portrayed as a ~cool~ character, extremely self-confident and, on occasion, rather arrogant and vulgar. The second episode, however, turns out to be a real disaster. The fact that its development is entrusted to a satellite team which does not host any programmer who worked in the prequel, together with unpleasant things such as an ostentatious advertisement for Diesel clothes (unlockable as secret costumes) and above all a heavy inconsistency of longevity , script, characterization and innovation, suggests a sleazy attempt to ~ride the wave~ and scrape together as much cash as possible by exploiting (and tarnishing) the already high-sounding name of the franchise. In the third chapter, as we will see shortly, luckily the shot was corrected. Here's if it was corrected. During 2006 Ubisoft released three titles on PC, each of which representing one of the three most famous series developed on consoles by the Japanese Capcom. After ~Onimusha 3: Demon Siege~, waiting for his majesty Resident Evil 4, here comes the second title of this line of conversions: Devil May Cry 3 Special Edition. Final comment Devil May Cry 3 represents one of the most valid exponents of the action genre, the best ever if we consider the only titles available for personal computers. Frantic, long-lived, and with a deep and fun combo system, the Capcom-branded game undoubtedly has the numbers to make a good impression. The downside is represented by a graphic layout that may not satisfy players well accustomed to the most recent productions (such as Oblivion, F.E.A.R., Prey and singing company) and by a poorly cared for conversion as usual, which leaves a lot of bitterness in the mouth . Nota Bene: the final grade also takes into account the fact that the game is offered at a very attractive price: around 30 in shops. Pros Excellent playability and good longevity. Technical and deep combat system. Competitive price. ' dated by current PC standards Problems with some joypads", "date": "2006-07-24", "grade": null}
