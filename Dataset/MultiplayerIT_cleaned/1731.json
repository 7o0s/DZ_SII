{"name": "Scudetto 02/03", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/scudetto-0203.html", "text": "When the mouse is useless! The most difficult challenge for the developers was certainly that of making the game fast and enjoyable even without having the possibility of using the capabilities of a mouse. We can certainly say that this obstacle has been overcome with flying colors as we have 3 different ways to move the cursor. 1: The first method allows us to use the analog sticks like a mouse, and with these to move around the whole screen at will. When we pass over a selectable option, the cursor will change shape, becoming the classic little hand so well known to those who surf the internet (the one that indicates a link) 2: The second method consists instead in using the arrow keys (the digital ones). with this method we will no longer have the possibility to roam the monitor as we please, but we will only be able to switch from one option to another. 3: The third method is probably the one that makes everything faster, as each of the main options is assigned a key which, if pressed, will activate it immediately (Ex: the continue is paired with Y and if we press it, we will immediately go to next screen. Basic isn't it? news The best of the best I don't think much can be done to improve a style of play that is by now perfect like that of Scudetto 02/03. The game will allow us to do practically everything a real manager could do in our place, that is deciding formations, signing players and squandering the management's money^_^ (although this may not please him) The first thing to do will be that to choose your name and your nationality, and later the team to coach. In this field the possibilities are really many as we will be able to choose between the teams of 27 different leagues. The game also gives us the opportunity to play 3 championships at the same time. This number, even if much lower than those of the PC version, is more than enough because otherwise you would risk making everything too complicated. We will also be able to decide to undertake the same championship using multiple coaches, this option will therefore allow us to try our hand at fun multiplayer seasons. The database of players and personnel is also impressive as it includes more than 100,000 men with characteristics faithfully reproduced from their real life counterparts. Once the team has been chosen, the management will immediately inform us of the minimum objectives for the season, it is logical that if we start with a team of the caliber of Juventus or Milan, we will be given higher and more demanding objectives (usually winning the championship) than we would have choosing a less strong and competitive one. Once you have passed all the selection screens, you will begin to get to the heart of the game which, as explained above, will allow us to manage the chosen team as we please. Another positive note of the title consists in the possibility of choosing the type of training to be followed by the player. If we, for example, want our young signing to become a skilled striker we will be able to make him develop above all shooting and technique, on the contrary if we want him to become a strong defender we will above all develop the essential characteristics for this to happen. The shopping campaign is really well taken care of (like everything else) and will keep us busy throughout the winter and summer breaks. The first difficulty to overcome will be to convince the club to sell the player. Fortunately, everything has a price and it will be enough for us to raise the number of zeros to convince even the most stubborn teams to abandon their protg. Much more difficult is instead to be able to convince the player to move to your team. It could happen that you have to discuss a contract for weeks or have your way blocked by the same player who for one reason or another has no intention of leaving his team. Personally I believe that this is due to the fact that the team the player is on has achieved very positive results, higher or equal to yours and therefore the player does not deem it appropriate to leave it in order not to risk a drop in winnings. Also in terms of number of competitions, the title is up to the situation as it will allow us to face all the categories of the nations plus theimportant (in Italy we will be able to play in A, B, C1 and 2) and to undertake all the existing cups, among which we find the super cup, the European super cup, the champions league, the UEFA cup, the intercontinental cup, the cup Italy (and others related to other championships), and the American competitions. Lippi, Cuper or Trap... the choice is yours Before taking the field we will always be asked to confirm the starting formation and, if any player is unavailable, a message will appear which will impose the obligation to exclude him from the match. The preparation of the formation is done very well, as we will have the possibility to choose between a pre-existing game module (4-4-2, 4-3-3, etc.) or one whose construction will be of our free choice (ex: 1-1-1-3-4). Fortunately, the variants do not end here, in fact we will also be able to decide the mentality with which to undertake the meeting. If we need to win we will have to set the attitude to offensive, on the contrary if the important thing is not to be defeated we will have to opt for a defensive attitude. When we want to balance the areas of the field, just choose the normal option. In addition to all this we will also be given the opportunity to choose the type of passes to be made (mixed-long-short-from before), the intensity of the interventions (normal, light or hard), whether or not to adopt the tactic of offside or whether to make a counterattack and whether to close in differently by adopting the deadbolt tactic or whether to press the opponent. It must be said that all these statistics are not included for beauty, but will influence the course of the game, it will then be up to your skill as a coach to hit the right tactic. For the games, the same technique adopted in the previous versions of the game was used, in fact we avoided inserting images or sequences of the game, preferring to these a continuous update through messages, which are in any case capable of making you agitated (get ready to relive the emotions of Sunday afternoon). The game menu is really complete and will allow us to view practically everything, from statistics to player ratings (very useful for checking who deserves a change). During the match it will be necessary to pay close attention to the physical conditions of the player as a decrease in them could cause him an injury (unfortunately we will have to get used to it ... perhaps before a cup final ....) Many times it will be enough to choose the change just to turn the tide of the match, as indeed sometimes also happens in reality (see Pippo Inzaghi in Milan-Lazio) At the end of the match you may receive communications from the management or from the fans, which will be positive in case of a large victory or against a great team, or negative if you are defeated by conceding many goals. A game for a select few Scudetto is certainly not a game genre that involves the masses, as this focuses more on more ~active~ titles such as ISS or FIFA. However, it must be said that if the championship can become monotonous played alone, it can be transformed into an infinite multiplayer adventure. Each of you will certainly try not to be beaten by your friend and therefore to buy the best players on the market, perhaps taking them away from your rival who was on the verge of making the coup of the year. The championships will take place from season to season, and only time will decide which of you will be the winner. The game in question must be faced with a different mentality from that used for any other football title, trying to appreciate it for what it is, or a managerial one. I'm sure that if faced with the right mentality, the Scudetto can become one of the most beautiful games available, and if any criticism is made by users, it will certainly be aimed at the style of play (which, as I said before, must be understood) and not at the title itself that presents itself as the best of its kind Here we are at the final whistle Beautiful, beautiful and still beautiful. As I have tried to make clear throughout the review, I really think this title is really fantastic, both for the style of play it offers and for the accuracy and precision with which it is made. Of course there are still some flaws, such as the lack of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, a player from Ajax and the Swedish national team. Fortunately the only missing player found by me is this and I think chand if others were to be missing these would really be a negligible number. This is the only blemish I could find in a near perfect game. Recommended for all those who love football, who want to spend hours pressing a few keys in complete calm, perhaps with a drink, and bring their favorite team to success! Pros: Best of its kind multiplayer super fun lots of teams and players Addictive Cons: Missing Zlatan Ibrahimovic not for everyone A style that has lasted since 92 I still remember when, as a child, I enjoyed playing one of the first titles in the series on my uncle's 486, always trying to win the coveted championship, which however, for one reason or another, kept eluding me. Even then, the title offered great prospects for the future, allowing the user to manage every detail of his team to his liking and to bring it to the greatest football goals. After that experience I lost sight of the genre a bit, opting for different titles, such as those from the FIFA series. Today, after about 10 years, I'm happy to see that such a beautiful, but at the same time so selective style of play has not been lost, and that indeed, it has found more and more support from the players. Thanks to Scudetto 2003 (XBox console exclusive), FIFA 2003 and Red Card soccer, we can say that we have all the desirable football genres available on our console, respectively managerial, simulation and the reinterpretation of football according to Midway. Let's now analyze the characteristics of this 02/03 Scudetto in detail", "date": "2003-03-10", "grade": null}
