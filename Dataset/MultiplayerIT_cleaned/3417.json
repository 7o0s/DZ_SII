{"name": "MediEvil", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/medievil-recensione.html", "text": "MediEvil's review gives us the opportunity to think about the meaning of two words that we have often heard in recent years: remaster and remake. The first indicates an operation in which a game is taken and adapted to current standards only in terms of resolution, sometimes improving some effect, with work by the developers that is limited to changing some parameters of the code and a final check that everything is working properly. A recent example can be the Shenmue I & II collection. The conception of the remake is different and more multifaceted, which mainly depends on the intentions of those who make it: the game remains structurally the same, but all the graphic elements are redesigned from scratch and often changes are also made to the gameplay to smooth out the inevitable edges. Without wanting to disturb the magnificent work done by Capcom with Resident Evil 2, we can mention the collections dedicated to Crash Bandicoot and Spyro, or Shadow of the Colossus to stay at Sony. Well, MediEvil was advertised as a remake and is being sold for a remake price, but ultimately it's not a remake; not in the conception to which Sony itself has accustomed us, at least.Other Ocean has carried out a complete technical review of the game, recreating all the assets from scratch with a view to a work that on the one hand is respectful of the original style, on the other seeks to put his own to further enhance the atmosphere. The point is that, however, the gameplay has remained practically identical to that of 1998, and if this can represent an added value for the incurable nostalgics and purists, alas it ends up cutting out those who expect certain things from a 2019 video game. Story, characters, strengths MediEvil's new narrative voice, the only unedited graft within the original Italian dubbing, introduces us once again to the story of Sir Daniel Fortesque, an unblemished knight who sacrifices his life to defend the borders of Gallowmere from the attack of the evil sorcerer Zarok. A century later the necromancer returns with his army of undead, but the black magic also awakens Sir Daniel, who despite having the features of a skeleton does not give up fighting for his kingdom. After completing a very short tutorial inside the crypt where the knight's body was placed, we will have to grapple with almost twenty levels to eliminate the evil that has once again invaded the territories of Gallowmere and confront Zarok for the last time. The original atmospheres appear intact, even enhanced in this remake: thanks to the extraordinary soundtrack that accompanies the action, but also to a stylistic approach that leaves room for very few blunders, when considering the thing from a purely artistic point of view. The scenarios appear very varied and well differentiated, leading us to explore cemeteries, dungeons, labyrinths, villages and forests inhabited by always different creatures, which are distinguished by unique attack and movement patterns. The game's bestiary still appears very rich today and includes zombies, goblins, scarecrows, anthropomorphic pumpkins, mummies, demons and various bosses. Getting the better of these opponents will not be easy, unless you devote the necessary time to the search for objects and secrets, within a formula that makes the completionist approach not only desirable but even necessary in order to have the resources useful to get to the end of the adventure. In fact, we need to scrutinize every corner of the settings to find the bottles of life that increase the health available to the protagonist, providing us with an important aid to smooth out the effect of very chaotic melees, in which we end up hopelessly to suffer extensive damage. As well as to unlock the coveted goblets, which ~materialize~ when all enemies are eliminated and are worth for Sir Daniel the entrance to the Hall of Heroes, where the knight will be able to receive much more effective weapons than his dull sword: a crossbow, a war hammer, an axe, various types of bows, more or less magical swords, shields and even armor. After about eight hours (game over permitting: every time you die the stage has to be faced from the beginning and times can dilate) you will find yourself witnessing one of the two possible endings and unlocking extra missions added for the occasion, in a sort of further tribute to the replayability of a title that has always focused precisely on this factor, making it a founding element of its design and making it a real hallmark. The goodies MediEvil includes a number of extra contents that point to highlightsre the nostalgic value of the production, in this case a digital artbook that highlights the work carried out on the various assets in a very interesting way, the soundtrack and an animated comic starring Sir Daniel Fortesque, funny but frankly ugly to see. Gameplay and criticality Anyone who was twenty years old in 1998 (every autobiographical reference is purely coincidental) will undoubtedly remember that the original MediEvil had its beautiful flaws in terms of gameplay, deriving from the fact that we were in the middle of an epochal change: the passage from raster to polygonal graphics in the field of action games. The developers didn't know exactly how to manage the third dimension and for some years they proceeded a bit by groping, experimenting with various solutions until someone (Capcom) found the right fit. Reproducing that type of mechanics today, without smoothing out the obvious edges, represents a controversial choice that will inevitably turn up their noses to those who, as mentioned, legitimately expected a production along the lines of Shadow of the Colossus. Controller in hand, the remake of MediEvil is terribly slippery, completely lacks impact rendering, suffers from significant camera problems and often stumbles when it comes to interaction with the scenario. In comparison with individual opponents the shield proves to be one useful tool where you intercept the attack movement to parry it and then sink, but the slashes seem to move in the air even when they hit and this is accentuated during the numerous, chaotic melees in which you have to move quickly to avoid taking too much damage and keep pressing the attack button in the hope that some move will land. Using weapons from a distance thus becomes a necessity when you have little energy and do not want to risk game over (which, as mentioned, forces you to start the level over with the same health level, without it being restored) , but with some tools the lock-on fails and there are moments in which the potential target is not considered in the least by the aiming system. The simple gesture of moving an object becomes problematic because the character avoids locking and his movements are too large, but it is above all the adjustment of the view that creates difficulties: the structures in the foreground do not become transparent and when you find yourself in a corner it can happen that you no longer see anything. Added to this are some quite annoying glitches, in our case it happened that the character got stuck in a lever or could not complete a puzzle. Playstation 4 trophies MediEvil's 39 Trophies are obtained by completing the game's campaign, but also by dedicating the right amount of time to exploring the scenarios, collecting coins and discovering secrets. There is even an achievement that is unlocked by trying to insert one of the old cheats of the original MediEvil: a nice touch of class from the developers. Technical realization As mentioned at the beginning, the guys from Other Ocean have redesigned all the assets of the original MediEvil, paying close attention to respecting the vision and style of the Studio Cambridge work. The result is excellent from the point of view of the atmosphere and the feeling in general, which is not distorted in any way and on the contrary is enhanced in many elements. The soundtrack is also magnificent: a sequence of orchestral pieces that accompany the action as best you can could, at least partially remedying an aspect that unfortunately appears decidedly less happy, namely the dubbing in Italian. It is essentially the same as in 1998, when the first steps were taken on the audio localization front, with generally very distant results from those we are lucky enough to hear today. Maybe you remembered it better, as often happens, but it's really bad and redoing it from scratch would certainly not have been a scandal or a lack of respect. Moving on to a purely technical analysis, the feeling is that of being faced with a project born on PlayStation 3 and then ported to PS4. By now bothering the aforementioned remake of Shadow of the Colossus seems excessive, we think we have understood that MediEvil is a substantially less ambitious production, but the workmanship of the polygonal models, settings and effects appears very dated. The original limitations obviously don't help, but the fact that on PlayStation 4 Pro the frame rate (generally stable at 60 fps) has evident drops in the initial stages of the campaign and in moments of greater chaos helps to get a not exactly positive idea of the optimization work done by the cal teamifornian.", "date": "2019-10-23", "grade": "7.0"}
