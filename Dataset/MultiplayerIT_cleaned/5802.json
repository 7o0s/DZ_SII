Interactive seem to want to change this negative trend by offering the public a finally noteworthy DLC. Entitled The season of Infamy, the new package offers four unpublished stories for as many super criminals, all set before the end of the main adventure. Players can then step back into the shoes of the Dark Knight to challenge and capture Ra's al Ghul, Killer Croc, the Mad Hatter and Mr. Freeze, in a series of scenarios specially created for them. But before delving into the subject better, we remind you that the new additional content has been available for a couple of days on PlayStation Network, Xbox LIVE and Steam, free for season ticket holders, at a price of 9.99 for everyone. the others. Four historic villains return to face the Bat Man in the new Batman: Arkham Knight DLC Playstation 4 trophies There are twelve trophies available for the Season of Infamy pack. Eleven are the bronze ones and one the silver one, all obtainable by progressing normally within the four mini-adventures. Hatters and crocodiles Unlike previous content, content in Season of Infamy is seamlessly integrated into the Gotham world of the main game, and is available through a new mission menu. Each objective is independent and can be played as you wish, even if our advice is to play the episodes featuring Ra's and Mr. Freeze as protagonists, as enemies, as they turn out to be the most beautiful, at least in terms of plot. As we said at the beginning, in fact, the expansion contains four new wanted missions, which are also useful for deepening elements of the plot relating to some key characters left unfinished in the previous games, and adds a new, small area, right in the police: an interrogation room and a corridor with the usual evidence compartment, plus a room with four cages. In any case, the play style of the four scenarios is obviously that of the main adventure, and in terms of gameplay it therefore provides a combination of stealth, action and investigation elements. All corroborated by the usual care with which Rocksteady loves to season certain aspects of his productions, from the acting of the characters to the plot up to the maniacal search for detail as regards costumes and locations. In detail, in ~Wonderland~, the Mad Hatter voluntarily surrendered to the police. However, the insane ex-engineer Jervis Tetch wants to reveal the reasons for his gesture only and exclusively to the Dark Knight, who must therefore rush to the Gotham City plant to meet him. The episode is structured in two parts, with a first dedicated to the search for some missing persons and the simple resolution of a puzzle, and a second more action with a dreamlike cut and a successful style, conceptually not dissimilar from the Scarecrow levels of Arkham Asylum. The protagonist enemy of the mission ~Beneath the surface~ is instead Killer Croc. It all begins with the Iron Heights prison airship crashing into Gotham City Bay. With the help of Nightwing, the Caped Crusader is called to investigate why the maximum security penitentiary was in the skies of his city and why it ended up sinking. The structure of the mission is very classic, with two combat rooms to be done in pairs, interspersed with a research section and another conclusive reserved for a good fight with Killer Croc, born Waylon Jones. That of this super villain is perhaps not the bombastic return that many hoped for but it is still a nice cameo in terms of history for the reptilian mutant. Frost over Gotham Continuing our analysis of the Season of Infamy DLC, let's move on to see what the ~War in the Shadows~ mission offers us. Here the investigation leads Batman on the trail of the League of Assassins, which apparently is engaged in some sort of war between members of the group. Without going too far or telling the plot to avoid spoilers, let's just add that there is also Ra's al Ghul, here in search of a new Lazarus Pit, with a new type of enemy ninja. The mini-adventure offers space for an investigation phase in detective mode, some environmental mini-puzzles and a couple of combat rooms, with an interesting ending and a surprise linked to the possibility of making a certain moral choice. The last episode we played is ~Below Freezing~, where the antagonist deThe Bat Man is the revived Mr. Freeze. The Arkham Knight Militia has stolen the frozen body of Nora, the super villain's wife, and Batman sets out on the trail of Mr. Freeze and the woman, interrogating the unfortunate henchmen who stand in front of him as only he knows how. However, the story offers much more, traveling along some unexpected paths, with a very beautiful ending in our opinion, worthy of an enemy of this magnitude. In terms of playability, the assignment initially focuses heavily on silent action, given that it offers two predatory rooms, but later also on the Batmobile, with situations designed specifically for the Dark Knight's armored car. From what you have read so far you will certainly have understood that the new package dedicated to Batman: Arkham Knight this time we liked it a lot. The content has been crafted with skill, the overall quality level is very good, and the stories told are quite interesting, especially that of Mr. Freeze. If we really want to find fault with the DLC, we can only look at its duration and therefore at its price, perhaps a little high in this sense: even with four different scenarios, the content turns out to be less long-lived than expected, so much so that it is You can complete all missions in just three to four hours, depending on how you go. But on balance, we reiterate, what it offers mitigates the not excellent global duration, to the point that we feel like recommending it to all fans of the Rocksteady Studios saga.", "date": "2015-12-27", "grade": null}
