On the one hand there was all the will to finally produce a real portable Assassin's Creed, rather than a pale imitation like those proposed in the past, thanks also to the power of the hardware; on the other, such an important and desired franchise could only represent a real turning point for the certainly not brilliant situation of the handheld, as demonstrated even by the special package with game and console together. In short, both Ubisoft and Sony have really bet on this Assassin's Creed. The strategic choice to release it at the same time as Assassin's Creed III for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 was by no means accidental, moreover. So, after months of photos and videos we finally grabbed our PlayStation Vita and dived into the 1700s to find out if the expectations have paid off. Wonder Woman Assassin's Creed III: Liberation does not connect in any way to the story of the other chapters; it is to all intents and purposes a spin-off, even if there is a point of contact with Assassin's Creed III, in the form of a brief cameo by the protagonist Connor. However, it must be admitted that after so many years of hypotheses, intrigues and mysteries, it was almost liberating not to have to deal with Desmond Miles and his clique, of whom there is no trace in this spin-off. Indeed, to be honest, the game itself is proposed in a rather original way, as if it were a real Abstergo software that allows you to relive the story of Aveline de Grandpr, a young French-African from New Orleans, apparently a simple daughter of a wealthy entrepreneur and actually a very dangerous assassin. Here, however, the problems of the chaotic plot of Assassin's Creed III: Liberation begin. Aveline is stunningly beautiful and determined, but we will never really know her: she hates the Spanish and slavery, has been looking for her missing mother for a lifetime and has been trained by a murderer named Agat; however, none of these issues is really explored and the real story of the game doesn't start before the fourth or fifth Sequence, after a very long prologue/tutorial where nothing really important happens: as soon as things start to get a little more interestingly, when you get into the usual conspiracy and leave New Orleans, it's practically already time to finish the game. The franchise has consecrated a charismatic character like Ezio Auditore to the collective imagination because the players have practically seen him grow from game to game, becoming attached to him; instead of Aveline we are offered only a few fragments of the past, her reasons or her training are not explained to us: many of her decisions seem to have been taken ~because yes~, because there is a script that imposes them, however absurd they may be . The Italian dubbing, perhaps excessively shrewd, helps to complicate the figure of an apparently bloodthirsty character who faces every situation in a slightly too simplistic way, however delicate it may be when the life and freedom of his parents are at stake. similar. PSVita trophies Copious amount of Trophies: twenty-two Bronze, twenty-one Silver, 1 Gold and Platinum. In addition to unlocking them by completing the various Sequences of the story, you will have to perform very specific actions: eliminate enemies in a certain way, collect all the secret objects scattered in the areas, play the multiplayer mode for a long time, and so on. There really is something for all tastes. Girl power Let's leave the narrative component behind to answer the most obvious question: how much Assassin's Creed is there in this spin-off? We can state without fear of contradiction that Ubisoft Sofia has succeeded in the delicate task of translating the key features of the series, proposing for the first time a genuine portable Assassin's Creed. There is everything one would expect from a main title of the franchise, and even something more given that the basis would seem to be Assassin's Creed III: it is no coincidence that the new system of moving between the trees used in the brother has also been implemented greater. However, it must be specified that the game represents a reduced-scale version of the previous titles: the explorable areas are smaller and the management component is almost absent, to give two examples. Unfortunately, New Orleans certainly does not have the charisma and majesty of Rome or Venice, but it is nonetheless well structured in its multitude of alleys, piers and buildings: a real pleasure to explore, as are the subsequent areas, albeit a little less incisive, among which the marshes stand out (the so-called ~Bayou~) composed of a dense network of branches, trunks and bodies of waterinhabited by a few humans and some ferocious alligators, a threat presented with great pomp during the tutorial but which, unfortunately, you come across very rarely. The important thing, however, is that each setting is explored like a normal Assassin's Creed, climbing included. In this sense, PlayStation Vita perfectly reproduces the intuitive control system and the various related mechanics, such as the need to keep a low profile in front of guards and enemies, at least if you don't want to engage in daring escapes or classic fights with counterattacks. We take the opportunity to underline that not even Assassin's Creed III: Liberation manages to distinguish itself in this area: the difficulty of the fights is often laughable, thanks also to the various weapons available to Aveline, among which the whip and the lethal blowpipe stand out. It is also possible to pause the game for a few moments, just long enough to select the enemies we want to kill via touch-screen, automatically and in rapid succession: the combined killing is a technique that further lowers the difficulty of fights with multiple enemies , despite these patiently waiting their turn to be sliced, attacking us, as usual, one or at most two at a time. The multiplayer mode We're dedicating a short article to the multiplayer mode of Assassin's Creed III: Liberation because there really isn't much to say, it's more of a strategic mini-game in which we'll have to side with the assassins or Abstergo. In reality, the mechanics are very unclear, and explained even worse. Once we have chosen a node, possibly close to our real geographical position, we will be able to decide whether to defend it or attack the adjacent ones by sending our assassins: the clashes last a few seconds, represented by a short animation, and consume the energy of the characters. Once exhausted, we will have to wait some time before being able to make another move. In short, it is a kind of board game that develops behind the scenes, but really not very significant: the number of playing users was also decidedly small, among other things, therefore it was not even possible to deepen the subject. Not that he missed it, really. The dress does not make the priest A questionable novelty is instead the one represented by the three clothes that can be worn, perhaps in the specially purchased changing rooms around the city. There are three types of dresses: assassin, lady and slave; each of them forces you to lead a different style of play: that of a slave, slightly less agile than the basic one of an assassin, for example, allows you to blend in with servitude, while the bulky and uncomfortable dress of a lady allows you to seduce the guards or pass almost completely unnoticed, to the detriment of reduced mobility. On paper, the idea is excellent: in short, it is a matter of wearing the right dress for the strategy we intend to implement to complete a mission. Suppose you have to assassinate a target in the middle of a crowded street: you could approach discreetly in the guise of the noblewoman and then hit him with the blowpipe hidden in the umbrella, or choose a more direct approach, swooping down from above in your assassin's dress with a quick and deadly attack, then run at breakneck speed in search of a place to hide. In practice, however, the system does not work as well as it should. In fact, the player is granted very little freedom of choice: there are very few missions that can be managed at will, while much more often it is the game itself that forces us into one dress rather than another, depending on the circumstance. Unfortunately, however, the limited possibilities of slave and lady dresses, especially the latter, make those sections definitely not fun. Furthermore, artificial intelligence often throws a tantrum, generating truly paradoxical situations. For example, one of the risks in filming dressed as a noblewoman is attracting the unwanted attention of criminals: at this point, to defend ourselves, we could push one of them to the ground and be chased through half the city, until we reach a gendarme who, instead of protecting our lady from a pack of potential rapists, he will decide to turn the gun on us and hunt us down with them. Hopefully for different reasons, but let's not digress. It is therefore normal that you prefer to wear the comfortable and practical assassin's dress for each secondary or main mission in which it is not mandatory to wear other clothes: unfortunately this reasoning cancels the main characteristic of this edition of Assassin's Creed, but on the other hand we are faced with a good idea that they could bere developed properly in a possible sequel. Ubisoft, we have a problem Even if between ups and downs, the main and secondary missions and challenges of the game are faced with pleasure; more controversial is instead the technical aspect that has left us quite dumbfounded. Despite the modest resolution of the image and the copious aliasing effect that afflicts it, the initial glance is stunning, if only because it is the first time that you have played a real Assassin's Creed in the palm of your hand. Historically well-reconstructed complex urban networks, lighting and effects that change depending on whether it's day or night, crowded streets where dozens of characters stroll at the same time, breathtaking views to be admired from the highest point of the neighborhood... It has everything a fan of the series could wish for, but as soon as you move on, the pains begin. The biggest problem is certainly the decidedly unstable frame rate, especially in New Orleans; the situation in the swamp and in the following areas, probably because they are less crowded and smaller, is much better, but in the small town of Louisiana the abundant drop in frames per second is really often suffered, especially during escapes and fights. This does not particularly affect the playability of the title, but it is all too frequent and evident. Just as a substantial series of graphic and behavioral bugs and glitches of all kinds often catches the eye: structures that materialize out of nowhere, walls that you pass through, enemies that die in mid-air or get stuck together or inside others buildings. It's a real shame, because the animations and textures, especially by Aveline, are also really well done. On the other hand, even from the sound point of view there are many problems that demonstrate a fairly superficial finishing work: the entire soundtrack, however decidedly good, seems to be a bit too compressed and tends to become enchanted or disappear altogether practically at random, sometimes covering the characters' dialogues instead. Even the sound effects tend to disappear, especially during fights that sometimes seem to belong to a silent film, so much so that in some cases we don't really realize what's going on, if our gun has fired, for example. Apart from this, the implementation of some hardware features in the gameplay also deserves a brief mention: in some cases it is pleasant, such as sliding your fingers on the touch-screen and rear touch-pad simultaneously to open a letter , while in others it is truly incomprehensible, such as when it is necessary to display a secret message by exposing the console camera to a strong light source. What if you're playing in the dark or don't have a strong enough bulb? Well, you can also acrobatically attach yourself to the tram, in pure Assassin's Creed style.", "date": "2012-11-02", "grade": "6.9"}
