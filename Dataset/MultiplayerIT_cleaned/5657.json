This is the third edition for the latest chapter of the Koei Tecmo franchise inspired by the great battles and great leaders of the Sengoku period, further confirmation of a brand that seems to know no crisis or which, more likely, has reached such maturity in terms productive that you can churn out new releases within a few months, simply by adding a few new characters and some scenarios to the basic structure. Because, let's face it, the musou concept is one of the great mysteries of the videogame universe, which has resisted unchanged for almost sixteen years now but can always count on a hard core of fans who, evidently, have never had any of this type of mechanics Enough. In the specific case of the Empires editions, however, the in-game action of the usual battles for the conquest of the territories of a map is supported by non-trivial strategic implications, which can determine victory or defeat both during the missions themselves and, above all , in the management phases between one expedition and another, when the general at the head of the selected faction must decide which development policies to implement, how much to tax his citizens and whether to hire some promising mercenaries to flesh out his troops. Samurai Warriors 4: Empires manages to offer some variations on the controversial theme of musou Alternate phases The main mode of Samurai Warriors 4: Empires, the Conquest Mode, playable alone or cooperatively with a friend, consists of six campaigns that are unlocked as you complete the initially available ones. The characters on the roster are the same as seen in Samurai Warriors 4-II, a lot, as well as their commanders; and it is precisely in the role of the feudal lords that we will have to relive some of the most complex and interesting phases of the great war for the unification of Japan. Having selected our clan from a map that includes all the forces in the field and their respective territories, we will be able to cross the seasons and years by alternating our action within two distinct phases: the first, which we know well, will see us attack a neighboring clan with the aim of conquering its possessions, and then handing it over to our commanders or to those who, among the enemy ranks, will agree to serve us (for those who will not do so, clearly, only two alternatives will remain: a magnanimous release or the death); the second will take place between one mission and another, when we will have to manage the roles within the army, select an adviser and a group of ~ministers~, then implement strategies that may concern the cultivation of the fields, trade, the 'learning of military techniques, the recruitment of troops or specific characters, the management of taxes and finally the construction of castles. The two phases influence each other directly: the quantity of provisions determines the time limit of a mission, while the state of health of the troops and their number can lead to situations of clear advantage or clear disadvantage, which in the field translate into more or less complex fights to conquer the various areas of the map. The campaign ends when we have completed the main objective of the clan, but if we want we can continue until the unification of Japan, multiplying the duration of the experience. The second mode available, the Genesis Mode, offers in practice the same mechanisms in the context, however, of a completely customized map, in which we will be able to move the armies as we please and configure the factions differently. Finally, the Edit Mode will allow us to create our characters from scratch and then recall them in the main modes. The PlayStation Vita version During our tests we were able to try Samurai Warriors 4: Empires also in the portable version for PlayStation Vita. From a structural point of view, there are no differences from the ~major~ edition, while the use of the touch screen and touch pad makes it possible to recover the lack of secondary backbones in terms of controls. The problem is all technical, given that on the Sony handheld the game runs at a frame rate of less than 30 frames per second, suffers from frequent uncertainties and a particularly marked pop-up effect of enemies, so much so that you see opponents appearing out of nowhere a few meters away during battles. This lack of fluidity affects the enjoyment of the experience in a very negative way, unfortunately. Playstation 4 trophies The fifty one Trophies of Samurai Warriors 4: Empires are portedcompleting various operations, from the most trivial ones (conquering a first outpost, learning a strategy) to the more complex ones, to be pursued by investing some time in experimenting between missions and campaigns, but above all in the management phase. Something old, something new In terms of gameplay, Samurai Warriors 4: Empires does not differ from the other episodes of the Koei Tecmo series and from musou in general, given that the structure of the stages is always the same: you move around the map reaching points from time to time~ crucial~, eventually switching from one character to another, and you conquer the areas until you defeat the commander of the opposing army. In practice, the combat system is the same, with very simple combos based on the repeated pressure of the Square and Triangle keys (or the repetition of the latter, which activates ~fan~ maneuvers that are very comfortable for wiping out large numbers of enemies), the possibility to parry (and center the view, again often problematic) with the left backbone and to use two types of specials that depend on the relative indicators. The rendering of the impacts is not yet up to the rival series of Capcom, Sengoku Basara, and the artificial intelligence of the enemies is of a basic type, given that it is enough to alternate the same combinations to defeat anyone. The difference, as mentioned, lies entirely in the strategic component, which substantially modifies some parameters and puts us in front of situations that are different from the usual, with hordes of soldiers enhanced when we try to take an outpost without first deactivating its ~force ~ by following the links on the map. It's possible to win this way too, sure, but it's much more complicated: a variation on the theme that we appreciated. On the technical implementation front, it must be said that the engine manages to manage a huge number of characters on the screen with relative ease, although the frame rate does not appear rocky, and here too the pop-up effect typical of old musou has been eliminated generation, although the design of the protagonists seemed to us less valued than in the original edition of Samurai Warriors 4. Unfortunately, the scenarios are as always desolate, repetitive and devoid of bite: simple backgrounds functional to the action.", "date": "2016-03-11", "grade": "7.0"}
