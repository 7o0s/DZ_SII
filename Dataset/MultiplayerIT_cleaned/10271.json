{"name": "MiniSquadron", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/73283-minisquadron-nuvole-e-piombo.html", "text": "The charm of propeller planes is undoubted, and there are many video games (simulators, for the most part) that have these glorious aircraft with their characteristic rumble as protagonists. As far as the shooter genre is concerned, however, apart from the classic 1942 by Capcom, there are not many titles that prefer the ~vintage~ style to the ultra-modern one when it comes to choosing the vehicle that alone will face an entire hostile army. Therefore, the choice of Studio FungFung is striking, which in its MiniSquadron does not give us the possibility of piloting a single propeller airplane, but more than fifty models that differ in speed, responsiveness to commands, agility, firepower and resistance to attacks. The game uses a reward system that unlocks new vehicles as we complete missions, giving us the possibility to view our hangar at any time and to select the plane to use for the game. Once in action, the classic control system via virtual d-pad and fire button (positioned on the edge of the touch screen) is combined with a fresh and original approach, which sees us subject to certain physical laws while our aircraft hurtles from one side to the other trying to eliminate all the enemies within shooting range. The plane does not stop or lose speed, but a wrong maneuver can make us stall (if we climb perpendicular to the ground for too long, for example) or directly determine the loss of a life, especially if we hit the ground. The response to inputs is prompt and precise, the d-pad performs well and does not seem to suffer from the classic ~dead zones~ unfortunately typical of this type of implementation. Clearly, the absence of a ~braking~ system forces us to make constant changes of trajectory while trying to hit the enemies... Battles in the skies The rate of fire is variable, but generally it is necessary to press the appropriate button quickly and continuously to obtain effective bursts. Given the approach based on speed and frenzy, the MiniSquadron developers have seen fit to avoid collisions between our aircraft and the enemy ones, leaving us full freedom of movement and focusing attention on evasive maneuvers that eventually allow us to avoid to be hit. In practice, things work really well: it only takes a few seconds to grasp the spirit of the game, and the differences between the numerous planes available appear clear, giving us the concrete possibility of choosing the vehicle that best suits our needs. There are eight scenarios available, each divided into a certain number of stages which are completed by destroying all the enemies present. Depending on the target shot down, bonuses can come down from the sky that restore our energy or multiply the score. An online multiplayer mode is also available which allows us to challenge another player within a stage of our choice. The locations only scroll sideways to a certain extent, giving the impression of a fixed setting like those of the numerous ~survival~ type games available for iPhone and iPod Touch. Moving on to a purely technical discourse, we have a barely discreet sound sector and with few surprises, embellished with some nice effects, which accompanies very nice graphics and characterized by a high-impact comic style. The excellent use of colors does a large part of the work, but we are still faced with a title that is always fluid, free of uncertainties even in the most agitated situations, which adopts excellent and never banal visual solutions.
