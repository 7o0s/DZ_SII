In the videogame field, the list of productions born from the classic ~turning on the light bulb~ are actually many, but precisely those that have subsequently managed to become noteworthy franchises are undoubtedly many fewer. The circle of actually successful sequels is even more restricted, even those - perhaps above all given the greater expectation that can be generated - born directly from a previous successful title. iPhone/iPod Touch devices apparently still have the advantage of being fertile ground in the hands of developers in terms of creating original and captivating products. Calm and cool Among these Ragdoll Blaster 2 certainly stands out, a direct sequel to the original product capable of kidnapping many, presumably happy, owners of these gaming platforms. Ragdoll Blaster 2 is a concentration of light-heartedness combined with a technical base that is undoubtedly of great value. It is basically a puzzle game whose protagonist is a very simple cannon, which has the possibility of launching small puppets representing the features of a stylized human figure, which in turn are used to hit a specific target in order to obtain the access to the next level. For those who have not had the opportunity to play the prequel, we specify that the main peculiarity of the entire gameplay lies in the fact that it is the user himself who has to govern the direction in which the cannon must hit, and obviously the coveted target, a classic center in the style of bar darts, it is not always positioned in convenient points, on the contrary. In fact, the difficulty of the success of the operation, and therefore essentially overcoming one of the 150 chapters available, lies in understanding scheme by scheme, map by map, what the classic crux of the matter is, i.e. being able to understand with what bank games and through which amazing lines the trajectory of the puppet launched from our cannon must pass to reach the ambushed viewfinder. It is precisely within this precise connotation that the Backflip Studios product takes on an absolutely relevant tone: the physics created around these precise mechanics is perfect, realistic and selective, in short capable of captivating the player thanks to an out of the ordinary immediacy and incredibly effective simplicity of use. What derives from it is a genuine, fun, never predictable gameplay, also considering the many variations introduced by the developers such as obstacles, pressure buttons, automatic gates, laser beams and many other nice game details. The touch screen controls are also perfect, very reactive and precise although in some maps there is the need to move the finger resting on the virtual viewfinder which is a little too invasive compared to the centrality of the game action on the screen. Therefore, if the strong point of the Backflip Studios product is certainly the playability, the graphic sector of the title does not seem much less, on the one hand a bit repetitive in the background settings of the adventure, but very precise and detailed in all the minimal nuances. The accompanying soundtrack is also interesting, able to marry perfectly with the pressing but at the same time reflective rhythm of the game. Ragdoll Blaster 2 is available on the App Store at a price of 2.39 euros, which can be purchased directly from the iPhone and iPod Touch or through the iTunes store. Also noteworthy is the presence of the Lite version, which allows you to test the title for free. The tested version is 1.0 App Store links", "date": "2010-03-30", "grade": "9.0"}
