And yes, there's a family man who's actually an octopus, but nobody notices, because he's wearing a jacket. Can you think of an idea more out of all logic? Difficult. But the development team believed in it so much that they sacrificed two years of private life to be able to make it, and now, after a modest fundraising on Kickstarter and many referrals, they are ready to let us play their creation. The aim of the game is to overcome the daily difficulties encountered by this unfortunate octopus grappling with actions designed for human beings: even preparing coffee can become an (almost) impossible mission if you have two tentacles instead of hands. All without causing too much trouble, otherwise our disguise will be compromised and we'll have to start over. As we said at the beginning, the sandbox world of Octodad is the background against which a family comedy is staged, which alternates hilarious gags with more delicate moments. We talk about acceptance, love, and how much the support of loved ones can help overcome difficulties. Thinking about it, in fact, our octopus is as if it had a physical handicap, and if we look at the game from this perspective, there is also room for some more reflection on how it can be complicated for some people, sick or elderly, to perform actions that for most people are trivial. We started with a comical idea and ended up talking about serious things. We didn't expect so much from this Octodad. And the same goes for the game system, really well done, especially when tested by the controls, which work wonderfully, especially with a joypad in hand. With a trigger we move the left ~leg~ and with the opposite one the right ~leg~, while the two levers are used to move one of the two upper tentacles in height and depth, which thanks to the suction cups it is equipped with can pick up one object at a time . The fact that the octopus is slimy and boneless does the rest, allowing our involuntary hero to slip into the narrowest passages. Finally there is a tutorial set on the wedding day between the octopus and his current wife which allows you to immediately become familiar with the commands in the best way. At the beginning, however, it was unsettling to be at the controls of an octopus and more than once we were ready to bet that such an idea could not work. And yet we were wrong. Octodad: Dadliest Catch ends in about three hours, a perfect time to enjoy its best sides without having the time to gorge us with the inevitable limits. Octodad is a fun sandbox featuring a loving octopus who tries to look like any other dad The day of the tentacle The first part of the game is also the most spontaneous and carefree. We start by preparing breakfast for the two children and then move on to grilling hamburgers, cutting the grass and chopping wood. The best moment, however, is right after, at the supermarket. Here we can slide around the shelves and discover video game quotes, activate secret gags and enjoy the havoc created by our awkward movements. Shopping has never been so much fun, and the freedom of action granted is intoxicating. We go back to being children by dint of combining so many disasters with impunity. And then there's the cursed frozen pizza to get, a step that we're sure has puzzled several players, because it requires complete mastery of our little sea monster. The tasks are usually physics-based puzzles or mini games of some sort, and it's very difficult to stumble into a sudden game over. From this point of view, the first half of the game is very encouraging, a quality that we would have liked to discover also in the rest of the adventure. Above all, the developers of Young Horse had the good sense not to ask us for pinpoint precision in the actions, which would have completely ruined the party. Once the right object is close to the place where we have to take it, it positions itself, as in the case of splitting logs. And we are certainly not asked to stuff all the food neatly into a trolley. Therefore, between ramshackle humor and tender attempts not to disappoint the expectations of our family members, we arrive at the aquarium section, the longest of the whole game. From here on we discover something more about the events behind our family, complete with an adventurous playable flashback that makes us experience the daring encounter with our current partner. Unfortunately the wild joy of playing with the world slows down to disappear in the very last stretch of the game, when we have to face offare once and for all our nemesis, a sushi chef determined to unmask us by spreading a rice ball on top. In fact, starting from the section set in the aquarium, the game begins to offer more and more infiltration sections to escape the marine biologists - who recognize a fish when they see it (fantastic) - to then stubbornly stick to tightrope walkers that often cause the end immediate match. Fortunately, the variety of environmental situations, the presence of checkpoints and the brevity of the game as a whole prevent frustration from reaching danger levels: when we start to puff it is the moment in which we manage to overcome the obstacle. Only the camera causes some trouble, especially in the infamous Fun Castle Climb. But they are small ink stains that are hardly noticeable on Octodad's almost impeccable dress: Dadliest Catch, which, thanks to the possibility of playing cooperatively, can be enjoyed in two to double the fun. Or you can always start over a second game and search for all the secrets, or still have fun with mods from the Steam Workshop. And if you're finally wondering with a bit of malice how the two children were born, well, wait until you get to the end and you'll have one last liberating laugh.", "date": "2014-04-25", "grade": "7.9"}
