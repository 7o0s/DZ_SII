Eiichiro Oda's magnum opus is now as seminal as the immortal Dragon Ball in the worn-out shonen universe, and its cult status is consolidated to such an extent that it has led to an expansion far beyond the inked pages of a manga or colorful episodes of a successful anime. A wealth of ideas and characters of this kind should, at least on paper, also give life to very high quality video games, on the other hand there are very few names capable of marrying the world of action or RPGs with equal grace; yet One Piece seems to live under the same curse as many other brands made in Japan, inevitably plagued by the rapid expansionism and strict copyright rules of the companies that control them: a production chain of often rushed and limited titles, which certainly cannot do justice to the original material. Of course, in the mix of video games created with Oda's universe as a basis there is no shortage of noteworthy work, but if we consider that the most critically acclaimed one is a free to play mobile, in addition to the fact that no one has yet taken the bother to try the role-playing road properly, one can only shake one's head in front of an ocean of sadly unexplored potential. However, something must have moved in recent years around Bandai Namco, because investments in the so-called ~manga games~ have increased exponentially, giving life to creatures with production values and passion behind them clearly superior to the pale imitations of the past. From this change of course (yes, with a pirate game puns are almost automatic, we apologize) comes One Piece Odyssey: finally a JRPG developed by that ILCA which in the recent period - thanks also to the experience gained on a myriad of different projects - seems to want to aggressively carve out a space in this complex and increasingly competitive genre. We have played it almost without breaks in the last few days and, as historical fans of the saga, we want to anticipate it immediately: One Piece Odyssey is not a masterpiece, but for a holy time it is a game with a soul capable of satisfying a little everyone. Let's see how the ILCA developers navigated these stormy waters, in our review of One Piece Odyssey. Narrative: fanservice cubed The first colossus faced in one Piece Odyssey doesn't seem particularly dangerous, at least until Luffy and his friends lose their abilities The narrative of One Piece Odyssey is immediately curious, in fact it lives on a strange duality, which on the one hand makes it absolutely brilliant as a structural basis for the entire campaign of the game, but at the same time it is a half pastrocchio comparable to the classic ~filler episodes~ of the anime. Let's understand, that the story of this JRPG had to be something detached from the events officially narrated in the manga was absolutely inevitable, yet ILCA wanted at all costs to offer fans a complete experience, through an idea that was as trivial as it was functional. It all begins when Luffy and his are involved in an unnatural storm after having sighted a strange island in the distance; struck by gigantic frozen lightning and hurled onto the islet by unnatural currents, our people discover that they have ended up in the mysterious Waford, a place full of highly advanced technologies and apparently uninhabited. Emphasis on ~appearance~, because, during a battle with a huge metal colossus, the Straw Hat crew meet a little girl named Lim who, recognizing them as pirates, deprives them of their abilities with a touch and spreads them in the form of cubes for the whole island. After clarifying that they have no malicious intent, the group teams up with the girl and an explorer named Adio to regain their strength and solve the secret of Waford, only there are far more dangerous powers at play than initially anticipated. .. Adio is clearly hiding something, but it will be very useful in the opening stages of the campaign As easily understandable, the expedient that justifies a progression from JRPG in a game that chronologically would already be well after the Dressrosa saga (with already exaggeratedly powerful protagonists) is precisely the power of Lim described above: because of the girl, the crew begins this adventure weakened and unable to give full use of their skills in battle, and is therefore forced to listen to the instructions of Adio (curiously the only one to have a plan on what to do). With a backlash worthy of the best bettor, however, the development teamdecided to expand Lim's ~magic~ to the point of allowing her to create real alternate dimensions based on the memories of the touched pirates, which represent the main trick to making One Piece Odyssey a truly complete experience for fans. The only way to fully recover the lost strength, in fact, is to relive some of the salient moments of the manga, modified in order to make sense in the new context; a boon to ensure fans face the most iconic fights and the most touching scenes of the Oda universe. For heaven's sake, we are well aware of how this is pure fanservice, however we find it very difficult to be critical of such a gimmick here. It is in all respects the easiest way to reconnect to the main storyline without any particular changes, and the developers have approached everything with much more care than we expected, adding entire explorable chapters set in the past, with often markedly more extensive and interesting maps than that of Waford itself. Gameplay: time and space Luffy and his will also be good-natured pirates, but also in One Piece Odyssey their main specialty is slaps Perhaps aware of not being able to make a miracle cry with a story chained by the needs of the brand involved, ILCA has focused a lot on the game system, trying to give shape to a gameplay that is still distinctive enough to be able to have its say even in a populous genre like that of JRPGs. At the base their creature is more classic than ever: a RPG with turn-based combat and enemies clearly visible in the maps, where the progress is mostly linear and the complex parts are relegated to specific dungeons. However, each of these aspects is at least partially reworked, with valid design solutions that in our opinion place One Piece Odyssey serenely in the subset of quality JRPGs. Turn-based combat, for example, are markedly more elaborate than the classic vision and give enormous importance to both spaces and enemy resistances. In One Piece Odyssey, in fact, you will have a rather massive group of characters at your disposal, which starts with seven possible choices - initially separating Franky and Brook from the crew - to get up to nine. Each character belongs to a specific typology divided between strength, speed and technique, in a very evident ~rock-paper-scissors~ system (and conveniently indicated also in the interface of the clashes to avoid confusion) which also involves the enemies. During a fight, however, not only these subdivisions in type must be kept in mind, but also the positioning of the fighters, because there are four active fighters divided into several zones (usually two separate areas, but can increase in certain battles), and based on the position you find yourself facing different groups of enemies. Here comes the fun part, because each character has abilities with variable range available, which affect single enemies at close range, at long range and entire groups. Considering that all fighters can be replaced in their position at any time by whoever is on the field or on the bench - provided they have not already acted or are not victims of some status - and that it is necessary to calculate where they are, the skills available and their resistances to maximize effectiveness in battle, we find ourselves formulating complex strategies even during seemingly trivial clashes. When you see this energy bond between characters, a group attack is about to go off. In One Piece Odyssey they must be unlocked in dedicated side missions To these already solid foundations we must also add the presence of statuses such as freezing, bleeding and others, to which certain enemies have specific weaknesses, and even special moves of some protagonists that are efficient only against specific opponents (Robin's Dos Fleur, for example , it works only on those with vulnerable ~low parts~, while the Usopp Pound only works against easily impressed human enemies, to clarify). There's even a group attack system, which adds an extra factor to avoiding weaknesses and making even the offensive of mostly support or defensive characters dangerous. Most of the battles even have internal modifiers that temporarily increase the danger of enemies to offer experience bonuses. In short, in short, it is a complex mix of engaging and well applied mechanics, which alone significantly raises the general value of the experience and makes it impossible to dwell on only a handful of characters for most of the campaign. Certain limitations due to the narrative, then, temporarily deprive the group of some members, pushing the gplayer to develop the whole team. This is Lin, and if you start from the first level it's his fault. Thanks Lin Let it be clear, although ILCA's work demonstrates the clear desire to create a high-level game even for those who are not necessarily One Piece fans, this does not mean that there have not been some missteps: perhaps to offer more recognizable skills possible, the developers have given each character a myriad of moves, many of which become redundant as the game progresses; while understanding the desire to keep even the ~older~ attacks available to fans, we would have preferred a greater focus on their functionality rather than mass. The second misstep concerns the management of the difficulty, since One Piece Odyssey is extremely easy for anyone who hangs out in JRPGs, but sometimes the battle modifiers lead to rare challenge peaks that can knock out your pirates without much warning. Furthermore, some statuses such as freezing can act with an almost unnatural frequency, overturning fights that would otherwise be a walk. A higher average difficulty with fewer bumps would have been absolutely manageable, because as it is One Piece Odyssey feels too forgiving outside of a few strange jolts here and there, and this in particular makes the final stages free for anyone who has been behind the progression. The repetition of many types of enemies with the classic expedient of recoloring does not help, even if it is not the case to complain too much about the latter, given that the campaign offers a myriad of respectable bosses, which can be easily tackled even if they are avoided most fighting while exploring. Structure - how many treasures in these ruins The dungeons of One Piece Odyssey are certainly not difficult to navigate, but they are very varied and more cared for than we thought ILCA's passion for the project undertaken shines through in a crystalline way even when its structural characteristics are analysed, despite the ingenuity also in this field. This, in fact, is not a particularly long-lived JRPG, but its dungeons seemed very well-kept to us and, despite the technical limitations of One Piece Odyssey not allowing who knows what interactivity, the designers of the Japanese team have worked hard to diversify the more elaborate areas , inserting in each one dedicated mechanics that make simple puzzles and exploration at least interesting. Peculiarities that increase when one considers that the characters of the crew do not have unique skills only in combat, but also while wandering around the maps. For example, sometimes it is necessary to choose Chopper, the only one who can pass through the smallest tunnels, Zoro, because he is able to effortlessly cut metal walls, or Luffy himself, whose extension allows you to reach raised areas adjacent to certain grips. Indeed, the concept on paper is better than the application, and it is sometimes tedious to switch to ~collection~ characters such as Sanji or Usopp, who usually only allow you to obtain extra ingredients or some healing items, yet overall add variety to everything and we welcome the attempt to add some spice to the simple exploration of the maps. Also because, as already mentioned, it is always a classic JRPG and therefore there is no lack of repetitive quests or seriously hair-drawn moments, where the player is forced to retrace areas already explored by deactivating the fast travel for no reason or he is asked to complete mere goals that are sincerely negligible. Although it happens primarily in the secondary quests, there are inevitable phases of this type even between the main missions and we would have gladly done without them. Overall, however, One Piece Odyssey stands at around thirty hours if you focus on the primary objectives, a duration that is more than satisfactory in our opinion for the scale of the project. The team has even attempted to add a sort of endgame that we avoid anticipating: in any case, don't expect something particularly memorable or varied  Random conditions may appear during battles in One Piece Odyssey. Sometimes they buff enemies significantly, and force you to rescue some teammates within a few turns As engaging as the dungeons and fights are, so is the progression, which focuses on two factors: collecting skill cubes and crafting accessories. Reconnecting to what happens in the prologue, the members of the Straw Hat crew must also collect some cubes scattered around the maps, which can then be easily equipped to enhance the level of their offensive skills.
