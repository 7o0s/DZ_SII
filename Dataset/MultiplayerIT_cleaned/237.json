After all, the blue hedgehog managed to do what in theory would have been up to him, so let's imagine that the two don't really get along in love. According to many, Alex Kidd was a clumsy attempt to try to chase Nintendo and its Super Mario, but in reality, although the two characters share a lot, the distances in terms of videogames are enormous. Kotaro Hayashida, the director of Alex Kidd in Miracle World, the first chapter of the series, has always denied having copied Mario, as he also recounted in the book Sega Master System a visual compendium, published by Bitmap Books: ~Alex's idea Kidd in Miracle World was never changed. We made exactly the game we designed. Sure, we were aware that Mario existed, but we never tried to make a Mario-style game. Sure, you can skip it, but ever since I started working on video games I had a lot of ideas on how to mix genres. Adventure elements fused with action and platform mechanics. I can't tell what I was thinking about and how I was thinking about it. Sega didn't order me to make a certain type of game. I just put together various ideas that I had in mind, creating a product that we can say was born from my preferences and my needs at the time. I put all the ideas I had into it! Everything: every vehicle, every object.~ The Alex Kidds never touched the success of Super Mario, even if the first chapters made good sales. Sega tried in every way to give him prestige, even going so far as to give Alex Kidd in Miracle World bundled with the latest Master System models released on the market, but there was nothing to do: he was appreciated, but he never became a phenomenon. Yet someone loved it to the point of wanting to make a modern remake for 2021, called Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX, whose review you are reading. Game mechanics On closer inspection, Alex Kidd in Miracle World was very different from Super Mario Bros. Meanwhile, it was decidedly more varied in the mechanics, between blocks to be punched, bags of money to collect, sections aboard a helicopter, others riding a motorbike , boss battles, invincible enemies coming out of mysterious blocks, shops where you can buy consumable upgrades and much more. As well described by Hayashida, we are faced with a large mix of different ideas, some well implemented, some less. Alex Kidd in Miracle World Dx does not in any way deny the original design, which he takes up completely, adding only small sections that lengthen the broth (the Master System game was finished in forty minutes) and improved the graphics. If you like, it's a kind of genuflection towards the childhood memories of a now aging generation, which is increasingly looking for confirmation of its past. So, in essence, we are faced with a damn difficult platformer, in which the goal is to defeat the evil Janken, the usurper of the throne of Alex Kidd, a boy with vaguely simian features (he was inspired by Sun Wukong, the protagonist of the book Journey to the West by W Chng'n, more famous in our area as Son Goku), who trains day and night to become a mighty warrior. Alex Kidd's graphics in Miracle World DX are exquisite Despite this, the simple touch of an enemy is enough to kill him, which makes it really difficult to get to the end of the sixteen levels that make up the adventure. In fact, to say that it takes about an hour to finish it could be really misleading because, unless you select the infinite lives (one of the new options, basically a legalized cheat), being able to get to the bottom could prove to be an out-of-this-world undertaking. within the reach of many players. In addition to the enemies, there are in fact other big rocks to overcome to claim the crown, first of all the bosses, who, as mentioned, must be faced with Chinese morra blows. Here too Jankenteam, the remake development studio, has done nothing to sweeten the mechanics. So to win you have to memorize the sequences of each boss, the same in each game, including those of Janken himself (the word Janken in the rmaji writing system indicates precisely the Chinese morra). It must be said that, like the original, Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX is a kaleidoscopic title, in its conceptual disorder, capable of proposing new ideas to the end, between puzzles, very complicated sections and so on. In this sense it is much more anarchic and varied than the compact and more insquare Super Mario Bros., but at the same time it is full of imperfections, which transpire very clearly in the modern version, where instead Miyamoto's title still shows an irreproachable design. Restoration If desired, it is also possible to play with the classic graphics Technically Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX is a great job. It can be seen that the development team studied the original down to the last pixel (Sega didn't make the source code of the original available, so the developers had to do everything themselves), going to replicate every graphic element and every single mechanic. Jankenteam is so proud of its work that they have included the ability to swap modern graphics with 8-bit ones at any time, so you can check the fit of the new with the old. As for the new graphics, the look of the game is decidedly more modern, including lighting effects, cartoon characters and monsters, more intense and spectacular special effects and so on. It is evident how everything was done with an incredible passion. The same goes for the music, faithful to the original, but resonating in a more contemporary way. In the shops you can buy items that help a lot to continue the adventure As an operation in itself, Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX has succeeded precisely because of its proximity to the original, which configures it as a fetish game. It remains to understand how attractive it may be for the new audience, which may not digest what today appear to be radical characteristics. In fact, we imagine that his goal is to reach those who have good memories of Alex Kidd in Miracle World, as well as those who worship the 80s video games in all their forms. Of our own, we struggle to think that someone today can be passionate about mechanics such as that of the Chinese morra, which Hayashida himself disowned in retrospect by calling it an error for the flow of the gameplay, but one can never say. If we wish, we can even just consider it as a way to celebrate a past that is fading from the collective memory, or as a small tribute to a character retired by a porcupine unable to throw punches, but much faster than him.", "date": "2021-06-27", "grade": "7.0"}
