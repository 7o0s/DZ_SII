{"name": "Crash Team Rumble", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/crash-team-rumble-recensione.html", "text": "Among the series that have marked the childhood of entire generations of gamers, that of Crash Bandicoot can boast the indisputable value of having remained extraordinarily true to itself over the decades. While everything was changing rapidly, both in the real world and in that of video games, the franchise has never strayed from its roots and, with the exception of a few parentheses on four wheels and some exquisitely party-inspired spin-offs, it never even remotely dreamed of to give up that simple, ingenious platforming that has sculpted the outlines of the most famous peramele in the world in our consciences. Having paid off the debt with the main series, developing a new Crash Bandicoot capable of strongly relaunching the series in the contemporary world after ten years of waiting, Toys for Bob chose to try something different with Crash Team Rumble, a multiplayer experiment aimed at offering something very, very different from any other game ever released under the aegis of the orange marsupial. What does this strange Wumpa fruit taste like? As you'll find out in the Crush Team Rumble review, it's vaguely bittersweet. A new species of Bandicoot Few would have ever imagined they'd be playing an authentic Crash Bandicoot, but in multiplayer Needless to say, Crash Team Rumble was born from a fascinating and suggestive idea, a natural consequence of a creative freedom that Toys for Bob, in his interactions with the series, had perhaps never been able to explore. Of course, in 2020 the studio had taken on the responsibility of working on a new chapter in the main series, but in doing so it had inevitably followed the tracks traced by that boundless baggage of platform adventures that represents the legacy of Crash. After the great success of It's About Time, this time the Californian studio had the opportunity to experiment with a completely original video game, taking our beloved marsupial towards horizons never before touched by the series. In a long chat that we had the opportunity to exchange with Paul Yan and Daniel Neil, respectively Co-Studio Head and Creative Director of Toys for Bob, the two developers talked to us about how, despite the pitfalls, the whole project sprouted in a very coherent way, starting from a simple question: is it possible translating the classic experience of a Crash Bandicoot - with crates, platforming, Wumpa fruits and all - into an exclusively multiplayer title? The team has condensed all the possible answers to this question into Crash Team Rumble, packaging a four-on-four brawler that contains all the characteristic elements of the series, including that natural immediacy that has always made it accessible to gamers of all ages. Precisely in this sense, the rules underlying the game are very easy to absorb, from the first game: two teams of four players each have the sole objective of collecting Wumpa fruits, scattered in arenas that closely resemble the level design historical Crash Bandicoot, to deliver them in the bank of their team, trying in the meantime to hinder the opponents. Whoever deposits 2,000 first wins the game, gets all the glory, and the undisputed right to mock rivals. Gameplay, between immediacy and complexity Each Crash Team Rumble character has specific roles to perform on the field Described in this way, the gameplay underlying Crash Team Rumble may seem extraordinarily elementary, yet this hides an underlying complexity within the mesh of its code that has been able to surprise us. In fact, Crash Team Rumble is not configured as a messy fighting game, but rather as an elegant one, in which each player, in the apparent chaos of a match, instead plays a very specific role within the team. Forget about running around chasing Wumpas, the action is governed by the presence of three distinct categories of heroes, each able to pinpoint with exceptional accuracy what is expected of you to do using one of the eight characters included in the game.Choosing the 'iconic peramele, which is configured as one of the most effective Markers, your task will only be to accumulate the largest number of Wumpa fruits in your bank, trying to be faster than the other Markers, such as Tawna and Catbat. The Defenders, such as Dingodile, N. Brio and N. Tropy, instead represent the muscles of a formation and, to the detriment of the name, their main role will not be to protect the allied bank, but rather to invade the opposing one, preventing the rivals to cash in on their precious Wumpa fruit. The Boosters, Cocoand Neo Cortex, finally have the task of activating the numerous upgrades scattered throughout the arenas, which closely concern two resources such as gems and relics, which Crash Bandicoot veterans will know perfectly. Some active skills possessed by the characters of Crash Team Rumble will be very useful during the action In Crash Team Rumble, gems are nothing more than large platforms which, once conquered, guarantee the whole team a substantial multiplier to the collected Wumpa fruits, while the relics, scattered around the map, can be spent to obtain powerful personal and team capable of subverting the trend of a match, if redeemed at the right time. In short, looking at the strategic element that characterizes the Crash Team Rumble multiplayer formula, the new title from the Californian studio has a lot in common with experiences of the caliber of Overwatch, a series in which Toys for Bob has actively collaborated in its recent past. Meta and gameplay (dis)balances After a few hours grappling with Crash Team Rumble, it's easy to figure out which characters are the most effective It didn't take that long, in the company of Crash Team Rumble, to see the peculiarities and facets of each character's exclusive move sets emerge, capable of characterizing the fights in an unexpectedly marked way. Each of the members of the roster has unique abilities on its side, which together make up the pieces of a real meta that has all the potential to make the gameplay formula proposed by Toys for Bob even more profound. Following a typical logic of Chinese paper, each character offers the side of counter-moves, not strictly related to the division into categories between Markers, Defenders and Enhancers. Let's take the case of Crash, our choice of ordinance during most of the review. The marsupial, during the first few games, suffered greatly from the influence of a powerful Defender like Dingodile, endowed with many more HP than any other Marker. In evenly matched matches Crash was swept away, but as the matches progressed we discovered that Dingodile, completely devoid of vertical attacks, was dangerously exposed to Crash's dunks, extraordinarily effective against all the more massive characters. This also applies to other heroes and villains included in the game and while this represents an absolute strength of the production developed by Toys for Bob, on the other it took us an afternoon to identify some obvious cracks in the system. Dingodile, after the nerfs following the Crash Team Rumble beta, is now much scaled down In the current situation, Crash Team Rumble seemed to us to be prey to some distinct imbalances, which could come to compromise the progress of a game, as soon as the community manages to select those characters capable of canceling any possibility of cashing in Wumpa fruit in a bank. Another sore point is represented by the profound, unrecoverable drought of content: the title offers a good number of maps at launch, but only one game mode and just eight characters, too little to convince the community to stay close to Crash Team Rumble. both in the long and in the short term. The developers have promised to progressively expand the gaming experience with the alternation of the season and the battle passes, but with the barrier to entry of the  29.99 necessary for the purchase, the new Toys for Bob effort is serious risk of getting lost in the boundless sea of multiplayer experiences that nowadays crowd the digital libraries of PCs and consoles as far as the eye can see. Technical compartment The arenas of Crash Team Rumble are not very detailed, but have an exceptional level design to say the least On the technical front, Crash Team Rumble presents itself on PS5 without any critical issues, also because the whole experience is placed at the service of a compromise aimed at guaranteeing unshakable performance, at least on current generation consoles. The compromise, which we gladly accept, is clean, colorful and cartoonish graphics, devoid of who knows what details or effects, but faithful to Crash's identity. Developed on Unreal Engine 4, the game predictably takes up the style of the latest iterations of the series and, net of arenas fairly lacking in detail, offers a performance that is absolutely in line with the expectations of a multiplayer title. Different speech for the sound, which instead masterfully samples and reproduces some of the most iconic motifs and effects of the series, combining them with a sound design that is up to the task. The game is entirely dubbed in Italian, an aspect not to be underestimated if consWe imagine that the decisive moments of the match are punctuated by the announcements of a presenter who, if he had spoken in English, would not have been understandable to a large segment of the public.", "date": "2023-06-23", "grade": "7.0"}
