{"name": "Calling all Cars - Recensione PlayStation Network", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/calling-all-cars-recensione-playstation-network.html", "text": "The structure of Calling All Cars is soon explained and closely takes up the classic concept of cops and robbers: inside the game map there are four cars and a fugitive, the aim is to bring him to justice by loading him in his vehicle and taking him to prison or in the cell phone or even in the police helicopter, which will occasionally appear during the hunt. All in a predefined period of time and with a different score for each mode that we will use to perform this task. For example, if we use the helicopter, it will be five points, if instead we reach the lowest point of the police station, only one. The race ends when time runs out or a certain score is reached, depending on the race mode chosen in the options. There are a total of four maps available, and they start from the classic city setting to arrive at a sort of railway station for unloading goods. Each location is made up of several small structures, trees and so on, some can be destroyed by dint of bumping into them and in general they will be an obstacle when trying to reach the car that has the fugitive on board at that moment. In fact, it is not enough to be first in the capture, as long as the player does not deliver the villain he can be pursued by the other three machines, which will only need to hit the machine with force to take possession of it. As if that weren't enough, scattered around the map there are three types of weapons, a sort of catalyst beam, a homing missile and a giant hammer, which will serve the purpose of subtracting the bad guy from the other machines. Finally, there is the possibility of using the turbo to escape the clutches of the other contenders, which can be activated every time the appropriate bar is full. All these premises translate into a very fun game, especially when there are people of the same level challenging each other, who get to create a real mess to bring the thief to his destination and to use any means to achieve this goal. In fact, the core of Calling All Cars is multiplayer, both offline and online. On the same console it is in fact possible to play in splitscreen up to four players, catapulted online you can instead challenge three other opponents, also participating in two, again via splitscreen, on the same PS3. The text chat takes care of increasing the sense of identification, during the pre-match phase, and above all the vocal one, which allows you to ~season~ the matches with jokes or perhaps some swearing, in good taste, obviously. During our online tests the lag was almost always absent and the game proved to be considerably more engaging and fun than the single player counterpart. In the latter case it is possible to choose your own car, face a single race or a mini-tournament in one of the available difficulty levels. By successfully bringing home the races in a certain way (for example, scoring more than twenty points rather than leaving the opponents to zero) new vehicles are unlocked, which can also be used online and which obviously differ in the external appearance and type noise produced by the engine. Even technically Calling All Cars stands out for its very colorful and comic style, self-deprecating in the creation of cars and characters and deliberately over the top. Obviously it does not boast next-gen features or advanced graphic effects, but the result is equally very pleasing to the eye, thanks also to the frame rate almost always anchored to 60 frames per second and to a sound sector perfectly in line with the surreal tone of the title. Comment David Jaffe hits the mark once again, Calling All Cars is a game that has style and is a lot of fun, especially in its multiplayer mode. The single player fails to be of the same level, either for the number of maps, which we would have liked at least double, or for the modes present, which soon run out of challenge. For the rest it is certainly one of the best exponents of Sony's online platform, mostly sold at an affordable price, which makes us absolutely recommend its purchase. Pros Immediate and fun Online well implemented, even in splitscreen Excellent graphic style Cons Single mode too short Few maps available From God of War, a violent and bloody title (but at the service of the gameplay) to Calling All Cars, a cartoony and fun game with a police background. This is the process just completed by David Jaffe, now famous producer who created the world of Kratos and who decided to try his hand at creating a completely different type of game available for purchase and doDownload on PlayStation Store. For now, only on the American one, at a cost of about 10 dollars, soon also on the Italian one. In the meantime we have tried it and reviewed it.", "date": "2007-06-07", "grade": null}
