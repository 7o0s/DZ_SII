It is not the purple of the immense lavender fields, nor the cobalt blue of its crystalline sea. It's the red, but not the red of the poppies in bloom that color the countryside. It is the red of General Di Ravello's military structures, it is the red of his soldiers' uniforms, it is the red of the medals pinned on his white uniform as a perfect South American coup plotter. Even if in the imagination of Avalanche Studios we are in the Mediterranean, an imaginary land that has the characteristics of southern Italy, Greece and Spain from a tourist brochure. And when we see red we can't help but make everything explode, like angry bulls who have rocket launchers, hand grenades and infinite C-4 instead of horns. This is Just Cause 3: a bigger and more pyrotechnic Just Cause 2, but not necessarily better. Just Cause 3 is the caciarone game par excellence, but not everything goes right Exporting Democracy Rico Rodriguez has returned home after the efforts of Panau. However, a well-deserved rest is just a dream: together with the Resistance, his childhood friend Mario Frigo, mad scientists, mercenaries and spies he will have to put an end to Di Ravello's yoke. A thin thin story, told through short cut scenes, a simple fil rouge to unite the dozens of skirmishes and battles to free the archipelago inch by inch. In short, don't ask for an important, well-written and narrated narrative from Just Cause 3. How many of you feel the need for it, be honest? Nobody. In this sense, we do not feel like blaming the developers, therefore. The cutscenes are the prelude to the main missions of the game, which alas are the weakest part of the Avalanche Studios project. During the three acts of the game we will travel far and wide for Medici, protecting resistance convoys, stealing those of Di Ravello, we will discover secret bases or we will repel the assaults of the military junta eager to close the accounts of the Resistance. It's just a pity that certain situations are repeated several times and that the rate of spectacularity, even when we ride rockets or shoot down planes and helicopters, perhaps standing on a wing, is not so exciting, all topped off with a level of difficulty that is not really high. When towards the end then with inexplicable directing choices they put us on board two planes and make us make two long transfers to get to the place of the mission, without anything happening in flight, we wonder why such an anticlimactic choice. However, there is no shortage of long and articulated missions in which we fight on land, at sea and in the air, but more generally, Just Cause 3 gives its best when you are free to roam the map to export democracy when and how we want. In this sense, however, the game does not give us complete freedom of choice. Before important turning points in the story we are forced to liberate three provinces on each of the islands of the archipelago. There is no motivation of ~narrative coherence~ (acting in liberated areas) nor are Rico's particular skills required, given that the mods, real perks and upgrades to our equipment, are completely optional. It is pure and simple ~grinding~, you are forced to go around the islands far and wide, freeing villages, fortified bases and outposts, with the latter not even expressly indicated on the map. Obviously it is not a real criticality, but just as for the second chapter and its Chaos indicator, even here in the long run such an imposition can be a bit unnerving and not even too justified by the fact that outposts, countries and bases unlock new challenges, weapons and vehicles. Nothing will stand! Where Just Cause 3 excels is in destruction, and it could not be otherwise. It's not enough to put everything on fire, you have to find it sometimes with patience, since the game often ~hides~ from us that cursed last transformer or silo full of petrol. In every small town the police station must be devastated and Di Ravello's long arm eliminated by destroying radio antennas, surveillance systems, and all the propaganda in the form of billboards and machines with loudspeakers and obviously the statue of the General. The outposts, on the other hand, are small military structures bristling with antennas, watchtowers and maybe just a few armored vehicles if we're lucky. It goes without saying that here too the game generously distributes explosive barrels and silos ready to be blown up as we wish. And then there are the real military bases, the pride of the game. They are much larger and more intricate than in the second chapter, gigantic and on several levels, often defended by anti-aircraft batteries, Sam emplacements, tanks, armored soldiers, turrets and so on. And as if that weren't enoughhelicopters are always ready to take off, but above all they are rendered impenetrable by constant artillery fire, which targets us if we stay still for too long in the same place, but which we can use to our advantage perhaps by positioning ourselves near the structures we must destroy and escape with the grappling hook an instant before the broadside arrives. They are undoubtedly the best part of the game: villages and small outposts are all the same after all, but often there is to get lost in these bases among labyrinthine underground structures, caves, ports, hangars, or perhaps huge airports on top of very high mountains. They can be really challenging and rewarding. Without forgetting that that cursed transformer must be found by tapping the base inch by inch. They are the only structures that therefore commit us to thinking almost ~tactically~, about how to make intelligent use of all our equipment as much as what we can find generously on the battlefield. However, Avalanche Studios has decided that everything we have destroyed remains destroyed even in the event of a game over in the middle of an assault: an invitation almost to ~cheat~ if we don't want to play in a ~serious~ and ~rational~ way, going on and on, explosion after explosion. From heaven to earth? But how to raze everything to the ground? The zero degree of destruction is to use up grenades, rocket launchers and rifles, entering the Rambo through the main door. But this is really the easiest and often deadly way. The air vehicles are effective (we have two types of attack helicopters and even air superiority fighters and fighter-bombers!), but if the Sam batteries have not been destroyed or we have not tampered with them to use them to our advantage with two missiles we are ready to kiss the ground. The same if we use a tank: a couple of rockets from a sighting turret are enough and the game is done. Why not soften up the area by launching us into the air with the grappling hook and parachute combo and bomb the area from there in relative ease? The parachute is now a sort of portable ~helicopter~, much more stable and maneuverable than in the second episode, therefore perfect not so much as a tool for moving around as a real combat tool. To move when you don't have a vehicle nearby or you don't want to waste the beacon for dropping supplies, or weapons or vehicles kindly offered by the Resistance, there is the possibility of flying into the air with the wingsuit, in some ways very faster than some helicopters. Exploring the island flying like a bird is truly spectacular, but never quite as fast as running away, an evasive maneuver much safer than a placid glide with a parachute. In practice, one becomes almost immortal. And then there's the grappling hook. It's not only useful to get us out of the way in the hottest situations, but if the enemy fire allows it we can indulge ourselves by colliding more objects with each other, uprooting things and structures, giving way to increasingly explosive situations and ultimately hilarious accounts. There is the possibility of connecting up to four objects by enhancing it, but the feeling is that in the middle of the battle it is really difficult to do it, since the lock is automatic only on the soldiers, not on the objects or on the setting. The consequence is that making creative havoc is often difficult, except in the very early stages of battle when the enemies are not yet ~awake~ and active. When the terrifying AI decides it's time to throw everything it's got at us, there's little time and space to think about how to creatively destroy that turret or that silo. In short, we use the grappling hook to escape, moving at full speed between bullets, rockets, grenades and artillery. Why is artificial intelligence terrible? Because it hasn't improved at all since the second episode. The opponents are cannon fodder, but at the same time they are many, varied and well positioned in each area. It follows that the real challenge of fighting lies in moving as fast as possible with the grappling hook - parachute - wingsuit combo, which in fact takes the place of cover to take cover from enemy fire. But even here we have to deal with the lack of precision in quickly engaging the designated area, often frustrating our actions. In short, everything as in Just Cause 2: the previous problems have not been resolved at all. In closing, a couple of simple indications on how long it took us to get to the free endgame when the game was over: 23 hours for 46 percent of total completion. Rocket cows and other mischief! To make exploration and combat even more ~complex~ Avalanche Studios has insertedito the so-called mods, to be activated to increase the chances of destruction - and not only - in the game. They are obtained by winning gears in challenges, which in turn are obtained by liberating villages, outposts and bases. They touch all sectors of the game: we have those related to explosives, with substantial changes to grenades and the C-4, or those related to the increase in performance for all types of vehicles, or that allow us to enhance the grappling hook or make it capable of moving even very large and heavy structures. But there are also those relating to weapons, such as larger magazines, the possibility of bringing the aim closer and much more. They are really many and also very spectacular. But what are the challenges? Cars, wingsuits, planes and ships make us make checkpoint races increasingly complex and difficult. But there is no shortage of pure destruction challenges with single weapons, perhaps gliding with a parachute, or others in which we have to launch ourselves at breakneck speed against a structure on a car bomb, making the damage multiplier jump up. The problem with these challenges, all with regular online ranking, like the contextual ones with simple moving and destroying things around, is that the perks they give us don't give the impression of being so essential to complete the game . They are more spectacular than strictly necessary, but equally the perfect icing on the cake of all those who want to go overboard with the destruction. Understanding that trying to attach a modified C-4 rocket to the rear of a cow, then sling-like grappling it between two buildings aiming at an outpost, is as rewarding as it is difficult to implement in the middle of a battle. The writer found the hit and run tactic much more fun, flying between buildings and structures like a sort of Spider-Man in a leather jacket and with four slots for weapons, bombing from above, stealing vehicles and making them crash into everything and everyone, rather than playing at the aesthete of destruction. The fact that they are optional and not inserted into the progression are a tangible sign of how much they are more of an extra than something essential to get to the end. Just Cause 3 is already so full of possibilities right out of the box that we really didn't miss the extra, often forgettable mods. Are you a tourist? On a technical level, Just Cause 3 played on PC is undoubtedly a good thing to see. The Medici archipelago is truly vast and endless (1000 km) and offers glimpses of dazzling beauty, such as when we fly over fields of lavender and poppies. Even the beaches, the Roman ruins and the villages at sunset are perfect postcard places, so much so that they seem to be taken from some tourist catalogue. Except for the garbage on street corners, the military juntas are not famous for a highly developed ecological awareness. Not only sea and enchanted gulfs: the archipelago gives us beautiful forests and mountain peaks, while with the progression we will discover valleys made ~desert~ by mining. More generally, the scenic variety is undoubtedly high. However, it must be said that compared to the ~credible~ Far Cry 4 ecosystem, which is still necessary in terms of gameplay, there is very little fauna here. The detail is certainly more than high, the warm color palette chosen immediately takes us to the full Mediterranean. The interiors of the bases are decidedly less good, with force game structures all the same and decidedly flat and dull, like the models of enemy soldiers, simple puppets all the same although more and more armed and armored, but without particular touches of class in terms of aesthetics . The game cannot fail to excel in special effects, with pyrotechnic explosions that often almost blind us, then accompanied by a high level of environmental destructiveness also regulated by what seemed to us to be a decent physical model. The vehicle models are decidedly excellent and varied; all fictional, of course, but the enthusiast of military things cannot fail to recognize the origins. Just mention the fighter-bomber, a bit EFA, a bit F-18, a bit F-16.", "date": "2015-12-01", "grade": "7.8"}
