At least until we learned the name of the developer: Silicon Knights. The Canadian company achieved some fame with the creation of the Legacy of Kain franchise, then consolidated by the development of the thrilling Eternal Darkness and the remake of Metal Gear Solid for GameCube; fame inexorably collapsed with the publication of the disappointing Too Human, a titanic flop also caused by the hype generated around a prolonged development. In short, we followed the making of X-Men Destiny with a little distrust, which in any case had enough tricks up its sleeve to prove to be a real sleeper hit, despite the certainly not exciting quality of the preliminary photos and videos. The final verdict? Read on... Three mutants for so many problems In reality, the premises of the new Silicon Knights game are extremely interesting, above all because the story has been elaborated by the excellent Mike Carey, a professional author who for years has written the comic stories of the X-men, including some sagas in particular, such as Messiah Complex and Second Coming, which have profoundly affected the status quo of the superhero universe of the House of Ideas. In fact, X-Men Destiny starts from one of the most significant moments in the history of the Marvel mutant undergrowth, the funeral of Professor Xavier, mentor and founder of the X-Men, and then evolves into a plot that is loosely inspired by the most recent comic stories , full of well-characterized celebrities. However, the player does not take on the role of any hero or villain in particular, limiting himself to choosing between three young men who have just manifested the mutation: Grant Alexander, Aimi Yoshida or Adrian Luca. Here the flaws of the game are already beginning to be glimpsed, as the choice of character and his powers does not influence the unfolding of the story in any way and the discreet background of the three new mutants is soon overshadowed in favor of the battle against the Purifiers by Bastion and Cameron Hodge. In fact, the adventure provides a fair amount of moments in which the player will be required to choose between the path of good and that of evil, allying himself with the X-Men of the stoic Cyclops or the Brotherhood of Mutants of the evergreen Magneto. The problem is that these choices do not affect the structure of the missions in the slightest, which basically remain exactly the same regardless of the character played or the faction chosen, limiting themselves to modifying the script and the characters involved in a handful of cutscenes. Many heroes and villains are also simple cameos with a handful of jokes and although fans will undoubtedly appreciate the possibility of fighting alongside Colossus, the Iceman or the ever-present Wolverine, a bitter taste remains in the mouth for the untapped potential of such an interesting concept. X genes and superpowers Therefore, if it is not in the script that the much touted ~RPG~ aspect of the game is captured, it must be admitted that it is difficult to find it even in the actual gameplay. In practice, at the beginning of the game we will have to choose the powers of our alter-ego from three main archetypes: Shadow Matter is based on speed and quick but not very powerful attacks; Density Control allows you to create a slow but super strong mutant; finally, Energy Projection clearly gives the power to strike from a distance at the expense of our physical resistance. Each archetype corresponds to a discreet list of offensive and defensive skills which gives the clashes a minimum variety and the illusion of a challenge worthy of our super powers, however the reality is that the combat system in X-Men Destiny is simpleton boring and extremely repetitive. The cause is above all the bad artificial intelligence both of the common enemies and of the bosses themselves: the former generally surround the player and then attack him individually, patiently waiting to be beaten in the rear; the latter, on the other hand, present extremely predictable and banal attack patterns, thus proposing more soporific than epic clashes. On balance, it is possible to complete the game by repeatedly using the standard attack combos, and in this context the interesting X-Geni system developed by the Canadian developer is really wasted, which is substantially comparable to a form of equipment: our character can in fact beking endowed with defensive and offensive abilities based on the ~genes~ and on the costumes of the mutants present in the game, which can be combined at will. However, it is not only the difficulty of the fights that disappoints, but also the very structure of the missions which, apart from a few more interesting cases, mostly require the annihilation of a certain number of enemies; even the exploration is reduced to the bone and after all the San Francisco proposed in X-Men Destiny does not do justice to the real one nor to the comic one in the least: it is not only a planimetry problem, basically reduced to a sequence of corridors , but also of detail, texture and general modeling. Graphically X-Men Destiny is a truly anachronistic title, the polygon count is unsatisfactory when compared to today's standards and the repetitiveness of environments and enemies simply weighs down the feeling of being in front of a last generation product. The graphic effects of the powers, in particular, immediately appear rough and uninspired, as well as the animations of the characters, especially during the cutscenes but also in combat, are awkward and wooden. It's not a complete disaster, mind you, because the characters are represented in a very faithful way both aesthetically and in the dubbing, but the general impression is that of a title developed in a hurry, without passion and respect for a brand that certainly deserved to be more.", "date": "2011-10-17", "grade": "5.5"}
