This has been true since the birth of video games and has essentially led to the creation of two antithetical approaches to conceiving the medium: the more simulative one and the more arcade one. Obviously, each of them includes so many variations as to not allow a single exhaustive definition. Let's take what the first OlliOlli did for skateboarding. The most popular model for the simulation of this discipline is that of the Tony Hawk series which over the years and with success has eclipsed every competitor, to the point of killing any attempt at an alternative offer. More and more spectacular combos and tricks It is useless to try to compete on the same ground: so it is better to experiment with something completely different. The Spanish Armada Invencible was defeated not by building an even larger and more massive fleet, but by exploiting its greatest weakness. The British managed to stop that incredible sea power by betting everything on speed and surprise. Also a little on luck, let's face it, since the storms did a good part of the work, but the result was no less surprising: David had beaten Goliath again. OlliOlli did exactly this in the hypothetical challenge with the competition: he led a direct and fast attack by focusing on a different form of spectacularity, i.e. on the adrenaline that arises from conquering the mastery of a technique that is revealed as the game progresses. What at first glance might have seemed like a simple skate runner soon showed its nature as a competitive game that allows the player a constant and significant evolution of his skill, with an exponential increase in the satisfaction obtained after a few particularly long combos. Let's say that it is an essentially aesthetic pleasure. The OlliOlli levels were designed not as obstacle courses, but as a harmonious whole that had to be crossed following an ideal trajectory. In short, they were designed as backdrops for increasingly spectacular choreographies, as the player got better. Will the guys at Roll7 have managed to make a good port of OlliOlli2: Welcome to Olliwood for PC? OlliOlli2: Welcome to Olliwood, which we already reviewed a few months ago for PlayStation 4, follows exactly the path of its predecessor, with changes that aim to increase the sensations described in the previous paragraph, without distorting the heart of the game, strongly linked to the culture of skater (it is not for nothing that Roll7, the development team, is made up of enthusiasts of the discipline). In general, what Vincenzo Lettera wrote in his article is also valid for the PC version (don't tell him though, otherwise he'll pick up his grandfather's blunderbuss and go to free a couple of South American countries), which is not distinguished by any particular reason. We tried trying to find out if there were any technical or other issues, but there really is a desert of Tartars to report, apart from a few minor irrelevant bugs. Some passages are really adrenaline pumping The rare frame rate issues have been fixed with the latest patch, so it's not worth talking about them at length. The only comment we can make to this version concerns the obligation to have a controller to fully enjoy it. In fact, it is possible to play well even with a keyboard, so it is not possible to speak of a real defect (at least it is not decisive for the final judgment), but there is no doubt that the best results are obtained with a controller. For the rest, the characteristics of the other versions are all there. So get ready to experiment with the manuals, which allow the execution of very long combos (many levels can be overcome with a single combo, for example) and to admire the now completely vector graphics, with well-kept animations that do not make you regret the classics they are inspired by , namely Prince of Persia and Another World. Compared to the PlayStation 4 version, which received it with a post-launch update, the PC version immediately allows you to play Combo Rush, a local split screen multiplayer mode in which up to four players can compete in a challenge to who scores the highest combo after combo. Not bad, but we would have preferred that it could also be played online, since it is difficult to find other people to play with (especially in the middle of August).", "date": "2015-08-18", "grade": "8.5"}
