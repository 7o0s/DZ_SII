{"name": "Call of Duty: Vanguard", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/call-of-duty-vanguard-recensione.html", "text": "Berlin, April 1945: Sergeant Arthur Kingsley is in command of Task Force 1, a team made up of elite soldiers from various parts of the world, created to infiltrate enemy lines and discover the truth about the mysterious Phoenix Project. The group travels hidden on a train near Hamburg, without however having clear ideas on how to continue the mission. This is the incipit of the new chapter in the Activision series developed by Sledgehammer Games, which after Call of Duty: WWII wanted try again with the Second World War to tell the story of a group of fighters different from the usual, with extraordinary individual skills: leadership, precision, courage and a pinch of luck. All returning from experiences that have marked them deeply, the protagonists of the game will face seemingly desperate situations, trapped in the heart of Nazi Germany; but thanks to what they have learned up to that moment they will find the strength necessary to fight one last battle for the fate of the world. We tell you about it in the review of Call of Duty: Vanguard. History Call of Duty: Vanguard, the characters are captured The Call of Duty: Vanguard campaign consists of nine chapters that follow the narrative system of the game hand in hand. During the first mission, which takes place on board the train to Hamburg, the aforementioned Task Force 1 is introduced, which, however, after a fierce battle ends up being captured by General Hermann Freisinger's men. It is precisely during the imprisonment phase, while a Nazi officer tries to extract information from him, that the main characters of the game are properly presented, in flashbacks set in Normandy, Stalingrad, Midway Islands and Bougainville Island , Libya and Egypt. As mentioned, each member of the team was forged by an intense and traumatic experience. Born in Cameroon but a Cambridge graduate, Arthur Kingsley enlisted in the British Army and earned his rank by completing extremely risky missions, in which he showcased his leadership skills and rare courage. Polina Petrova, inspired by the lethal Russian sniper Lyudmila Pavlichenko, is instead a sort of crazed splinter: the Nazis took everything away from her and she wants to reciprocate. Tempered by tragedy, she is infallible with a sniper rifle. New Yorker Wade Jackson plays the role of the swaggering but capable American with a big heart in the team: the same one that allowed him to tear apart enemy planes and then fight ashore, in company with the 93rd Infantry Division, the first formed by African Americans, on the island of Bougainville. Finally, the Australian Lucas Riggs is an impetuous explosives expert with a rebellious character, who cut his teeth in the North African countryside. Call of Duty: Vanguard, a dogfight sequence with Jackson The flashback expedient proves to be effective for the purposes of characterizing the protagonists, but it is above all the interlude scenes between one chapter and another that lay the precise narrative foundations from which the gameplay then develops. There is no doubt that the missions in which we play Polina Petrova are the best; the problem is that there is a bit of confusion and a general lack of bite in the others. The story of Call of Duty: Vanguard is interesting in its structure, but not very exciting in practice. The twists and turns that occur are the same ones that the series has accustomed us to for several years and the only truly spectacular sequence is the one that you too have already seen, when Polina climbs a building that is collapsing during the invasion of Stalingrad. Call of Duty: Vanguard, the father of Polina Petrova before the invasion of Stalingrad If from the point of view of the story the fact that Task Force 1 spends all its time in a cell makes sense, from the gameplay point of view it seems much less justified. And so, when the team finally acts as a team, giving life to a final chapter of the campaign that is perhaps as it should have been in its entirety in terms of dynamism and spectacularity, the end credits arrive. Still speaking of narration, the Italian dubbing is great and undoubtedly adds depth to the system, but during our tests we encountered a huge problem in the mix of audio levels, with some dialogue audible too much and others not heard at all: we sincerely hope that can be fixed with an update. Gameplay Call of Duty: Vanguard, the flamethrower in action in a mission with Jackson Probably Call of Duty: Vanguard isthe episode of the Activision series that is most influenced by the parallelism between what is told and the part played, even if the latter ends up paying the price precisely because of the narrative choices made by the development team. In fact, if in terms of story the characters manage to obtain a good characterization, the same cannot be said of the gameplay. Generally speaking, one or two missions to introduce the peculiarities of the four protagonists are also sufficient, provided that these abilities are actually used. Instead, it happens that it is used within a single level, further increasing the feeling of excessive linearity, of being part of a scripted sequence that must necessarily go in a certain way. Call of Duty: Vanguard, a fight from a distance in a mission with Petrova Polina Petrova's parkour is a good example: it's a feature that refreshes the traditional Call of Duty formula by adding verticality, yet the paths that can be followed are already established within the missions, which transforms them into something very similar to a simple quick time event. The problem is even more evident when flying aboard a plane in the role of Wade, so much so that the controls of the aircraft themselves seem to suggest a single possible outcome for our evolutions. In short, if Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War (here the review) tried in some moments to provide us with greater freedom and introduced important structural innovations with its secondary missions, strategic objectives to be achieved and alternative endings, Vanguard does not bother to do the same, limiting itself to offering us the traditional cinematic campaign of Call of Duty: a long corridor that is not masked that much. Call of Duty: Vanguard, two companions of Riggs Attempts to move away from this concept, such as when you find yourself fighting in the desert lands and you can choose the direction of travel, are a little too timid and too late. The very connotation of special abilities, in this case Kingsley's orders, Petrova's distractions, Jackson's adrenaline (a sort of infrared bullet time which is not very well justified) and Riggs' explosives, appears to be linked to a path inevitably linear. The gunplay is solid, but the attempts to adapt it to the tools and the context of the second world war produces some uncertainties during the fights that give the feeling of some problem with the hitboxes. The artificial intelligence of the enemies is unfortunately mediocre: they move behind the stakeouts, but they don't ~see~ us where we have to run and flank them, or they produce inexplicable retreats. Call of Duty: Vanguard, a forest level with Jackson It goes without saying that the greater degree of destructibility of the shelters does not add to the experience the extra cue hoped for by the authors; as well as the mechanics borrowed from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (here the review), see for example the possibility of placing weapons on certain surfaces or opening the doors halfway to check if someone is there before entering, maneuver the latter used in practice only in the initial mission. As mentioned, the last chapter finally sees the development of a choral action, with the characters who quickly swap roles and use their skills in order to break through a thick Nazi cordon guarding a a strategic building, but that sense of synergy that justifies the setting of the four protagonists takes shape with guilty delay. Zombies mode Call of Duty: Vanguard, the zombies of the homonymous mode We had the opportunity to try the Zombie mode of Call of Duty: Vanguard during some multiplayer sessions organized for the press, completing it several times and managing to understand its structure, characterized at the launch of the game by the presence of the only stipulation Der Anfang, i.e. a round challenge in many ways similar to the classic Zombie mode, the one that sees us fight within a scenario that gradually expands. Narratively set up as a prologue to Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War Zombie mode, Der Anfang will see us select one of the twelve Operators available for the multiplayer sector of Vanguard, which also include the various Kingsleys, Petrovas, Riggs and Jacksons, to then face together with three other players the hordes of the undead within a structure in rounds. Call of Duty: Vanguard, the armored zombies with machine guns Specifically, we will find ourselves in a square, surrounded by zombies, and we will have to activate a series of portals to take part in different types of missions, which canrevolve around simply clearing a series of waves of undead or completing a course. Between one expedition and another we will be able to upgrade our weapons with the credits obtained, unlock special perks, create support objects and so on. Once we reach the fifth round, if we want we can decide to opt for an extraction and fight one last , desperate battle before entering the gap that will take us back home; or continue to ring missions characterized by an ever higher degree of challenge and by increasingly numerous and resistant enemies, in order to obtain better rewards. Call of Duty: Vanguard, an explosive zombie In zombie mode there are three types of enemies: the standard undead, the explosive ones that move much faster and the armored ones, who shoot at us using Gatling guns and appear in the advanced stages. We will have to try to survive their assaults while being able to count on a single weapon (but we will eventually be able to obtain a second one), collaborating with our companions and reviving them if necessary. The final result, at least as regards what will be available initially ( the Zombie mode will be enriched, as per tradition, over the months), it's a mix that we found entertaining, with some exciting highlights revolving around the need to make decisions very quickly and to have each other's backs when enemies become really numerous and one needs even just to top up. The multiplayer Call of Duty: Vanguard, the matchmaking screen If the Call of Duty: Vanguard campaign takes a step back compared to the previous episodes, the same cannot be said of the competitive multiplayer sector, which instead seems to build on the experience gained so far by Activision, also and above all with the free battle royale -to-play Call of Duty: Warzone. The online component of the game can count on a successful mix of content and quality, it fixes some critical issues encountered in Black Ops Cold War with regard to gunplay and animations, introduces interesting new features in terms of progression and customization, and finally proves to be very accessible despite the great speed. Call of Duty: Vanguard, the Operator selection screen From the multiplayer main screen, it is first of all possible to adjust the unprecedented Battle Rhythm, a setting that applies to the Quick Game and allows you to select three different presets (Tactical, Assault and Blitz) which gradually increase the number of players in relation to the size of the map, making the game more or less hectic and crowded. Beyond the main playlist, which includes stipulations such as Confirmed Kill, Search and Destroy, Free-for-All and Station, among the separate entries we find the traditional Team Deathmatch and the two territorial variants Domain and Patrol: in the first case it is necessary to control and defend three strategic points within the scenario, in the second case there is only one point but it moves within the map and this makes the situation decidedly more lively. Call of Duty: Vanguard, an online match played on the Tuscan map It is therefore possible to try your hand only with the maps of the Western Front, organize a Private Match and finally face another novelty of the Call of Duty: Vanguard multiplayer, namely the Hill of Champions: a real elimination tournament that sees the participation of eight teams made up of two or three players. In short, the endowment is very respectable, with twenty maps and a matchmaking that has proved to be quite fast with open servers, frequented by many online users (the game supports crossplay) already quite aggressive and get ready. Of course, from time to time there is some uncertainty, with (sporadic) latency episodes that also occurred in our case, with a 100 Mega fiber connection. Call of Duty: Vanguard, the first weapon modification options Beyond the many contents, however, it is the progression system of the multiplayer sector, with its many facets, that satisfies and keeps the interest alive. We have mentioned the twelve unlockable Operators: each has its own progression, and the transition from one level of experience to another is rewarded with new accessories and customizations that affect the gameplay. The Gunsmith, introduced by Infinity Ward at the time of Modern Warfare, in fact, allows you to apply up to ten appendages to weapons, modifying their precision, speed, power and other characteristics in order to reflect our style on the battlefield and build the perfect equipment around it.", "date": "2021-11-08", "grade": "8.0"}
