{"name": "Devil May Cry", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/devil-may-cry_b.html", "text": "Capcom's breakthrough... Shinji Mikami and Capcom never cease to amaze us. After more than 5 years of unchallenged dominance of Resident Evil in the Survival Horror genre, the time has finally come for the revolution we've all been waiting for. Resident Evil meets Matrix and the result is a highly spectacular action game that has very little horror to offer beyond the gothic settings. Devil May Cry is the game of the turning point on PlayStation 2, arrived just in time to replace the place left vacant by Resident Evil on the Sony console, now intended for an audience of only Nintendians. The similarities with the progenitor are however evident, starting with the inevitable manor, chosen as the scene of the ~clashes~, and with other ubiquitous elements such as puzzles, imaginative monsters and final bosses. Fortunately, or unfortunately, the points of contact end here, leaving room for a series of innovations that have contributed significantly to creating a winning cocktail. Forget the long phases of exploration or the search for the solution to intricate puzzles. Devil May Cry is pure action and, even if the obstacles constituted by the puzzles have not completely disappeared, their resolution will appear more often than not so obvious as to seem trivial. The unfolding of the adventure turns out to be rather linear and the plot itself plays a secondary role, accompanying the frequent and spectacular combat phases. Dante defies gravity The first major innovation is the control system, finally worthy of the name thanks to the perfect use made of the controller's analog levers. Thanks to the left stick we can now move in the various directions with a simplicity that seems light years away from the cumbersomeness of the control implemented in Resident Evil. But it is also the figure of the main character that contributes to making the gaming experience ~different~. Dante moves with the ease of a superhero. His fiery personality is underlined by his shiny white hair, and by the red suit he wears (which makes him very cool :) ). The broadsword carried behind the back and the two guns owned by default are certainly not optional as they play a non-secondary role in making the protagonist's look so spot on. During the clashes with the unfortunate enemies we will be able to use both some huge swords and firearms, often alternating their use and thus arriving at even more devastating results. During the adventure we will find additional weapons, some of which are very spectacular, and we will be able to buy (in the truest sense of the word) other objects that will give us additional energy or some surprising abilities. Dante is in fact able on certain occasions to abandon his human state, transforming himself for a few seconds into a demon with boundless powers. He will be able to fly, launch lethal attacks against enemies, make impressive leaps while floating in the air and simultaneously use guns or other weapons. Precisely on these occasions you will be able to witness evolutions worthy of the most spectacular scenes of the Matrix. Puppets, demons, scorpions... In the boundless rooms of the gloomy manor we will often have to deal with creatures of undoubted danger even if to tell the truth the ubiquitous ~puppets~ are more funny than insidious. From time to time we will have to face the classic end-of-level bosses that you will not struggle to distinguish from the rest of the group both for their often out-of-scale size and for the remarkable powers they are endowed with. Just to name one, it will leave you in awe open mouth the powerful fiery scorpion that you will meet in the first part of the adventure and that will try in every way to roast Dante. As I have already pointed out previously, Devil May Cry is an action game that has very little horror properly. The feeling of anguish that accompanied us in Resident Evil is now lost, now replaced by pure fun and exaltation for the excessive power of our darling. The difficulty level is well calibrated and, although there is to suffer with the more advanced bosses (especially at a hard level), once you become familiar with your means you shouldn't have to struggle too much to reach the end of the game. On the other hand, the longevity (7-10 hours) is only discreet but moreover one could not expect more from Capcom given the previous ones. It should be noted that compared to the first demo circulated in recent months in Japan, the structure of the game has radically changed, now divided into 22 missions plus numerous other secret missions. The adventure thus becomes as close as possible to the pages of a sudd taledivided into chapters and I believe that the novelty has benefited the final result. Architectural masterpieces in a videogame The time has come to talk about the technical realization of Devil May Cry, I think it is right to give the right honors to the Capcom programmers for a result that appears absolutely extraordinary to our eyes and ears. Despite the lack of any type of antialiasing, DMC is (GT3 excluded) the best expression of the now proven potential of the PS2 emotion engine. The incredible polygonal architectural constructions are only the most evident element of a cosmetic that does not admit of comparison. Sensational light effects also accompany Dante's evolutions or underline the singularity of some film settings. The sunlight which penetrates through the windows and illuminates some rooms of the castle is very scenic. The main character enjoys a very convincing realization as regards the beauty of his characterization and instead excellent as regards the always fluid animations that make Dante very ~cool~ in his movements. The audio part is also very convincing thanks to the very original mix consisting of rocking music of great vigor and pressing melodies ~stolen~ from the tradition of classical music. The sound effects and speech are also excellent which, although in English, are quite amusing. Waiting for the Pal version.. After such a lavish review of praise, even the few flaws found in the game could not in any way influence the final judgment. Devil May Cry may seem short or repetitive to some of you, but I think these are subjective considerations that cannot be shared by most of those who buy the game. Devil May Cry, albeit in the American version, is a masterpiece of its kind and probably the best title available for PlayStation 2 together with GT3 with which every outgoing title will inevitably have to deal with for some time yet. The PAL version of DMC, previously scheduled for November, will hit stores only in December but I think the wait will be amply rewarded. In fact, it seems that the version for the Italian market will be fully translated into Italian (including speech) and that it will include the much coveted 50/60Hz option previously snubbed by the Japanese software house. Good news that proves once again that Capcom knows better than the devil! :) Pros: Pure fun and action Protagonist of great charm Amazing graphics Music always appropriate Cons: Lack of antialiasing It's hard to find other faults... The most distressing fears of our unconscious have left our nightmares suddenly coming to life. The Devil, personification of evil and lord of death, managed to escape the spell that segregated him in the underworld for two thousand years and now his threat hangs over humanity. The only person able to counter it is Dante, assisted not by Virgil, but by an assortment of weapons and magical powers that make him semi-invulnerable. Our hero is not linked to the Alighieri by any kinship, but is instead the son of the demon Sparda, the one who in the past had defeated the Devil, and of a mysterious woman. Strengthened by his ambiguous nature of man / demon, Dante is ready to challenge the forces of evil in a fight that will upset the two worlds, the earthly and the ultra-terrestrial.", "date": "2001-10-25", "grade": null}
