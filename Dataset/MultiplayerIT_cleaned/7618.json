Yes, there are several games, both for mobile systems and for consoles, which use it more or less consistently, but there is very little that is original or concretely innovative. The reasons are varied, and the most common, perhaps, is that a precise combination of factors is needed - position, brightness, etc. - to fully enjoy this technology. Consequently, in the face of a probable failure in results rather than in intent, nobody really wants to bet on it. SCEA has tried in its own way to reverse this trend, inventing an intriguing puzzle game right from the title. The idea behind Open Me! it's as simple as it is tantalizing, the purchase model is very interesting, the quality... well, that's another matter. Open everything to me! It was said that the basic concept of Open Me! it's that simple. In some ways, indeed, it is brilliant. The puzzle of SCEA is mainly based on one idea: to open a box. Sounds silly, but that's how it is. The player's goal, in fact, is to open the various boxes proposed in the game to recover their contents (various amenities such as snacks and other objects) in the shortest possible time. This is because the boxes are actually complex three-dimensional puzzles that would make a bomb squad pale. Ironically, this is a fictitious complexity, because all you have to do to open the boxes is press a few little buttons here and there; however, the problem posed to the player is figuring out how to interact with the box. All this happens, of course, through the PlayStation Vita touch screen and touch pad. There's no room for the d-pad or analog stick - you play by simply tapping the screen. Switches and thumbsticks have to be pressed or dragged, and voice recognition technology also needs to be used from time to time. As new boxes are unlocked, the complexity of the puzzles increases, which begin to require combined actions and simultaneous pressures in real interlocking systems. Some boxes are also traps, in which rotating blades and other pitfalls put the player's virtual fingers in ~danger~, thus limiting attempts to ten before having to start over. As already mentioned, the concept is simple but original and some puzzles are truly ingenious, but a whole series of technical problems put a damper on the sense of satisfaction one would feel in completing a puzzle. The problem mainly concerns the superficiality with which the tactile control has been implemented. There's no touch feedback, apart from a faint anonymous thud, so it's not easy to tell if you're interacting with an important part of the box or not. Some puzzles are also quite cryptic, so you end up fumbling, haphazardly, tapping the screen here and there in an attempt to interact with the right spot and make some progress. In short, the satisfactions for having opened a new box without having racked their brains are very few, but unfortunately it is more often the rule than the exception. Despite the good ideas, Open Me! it is the proverbial donut without the hole PSVita trophies There are 14 Trophies that can be acquired in Open Me! and all pretty simple to unlock: 11 bronze, 2 silver 1 gold. Just complete the various packs of the game and score discrete scores to increase the number. Breaking boxes Four or five hours of play are enough to complete all the forty-eight puzzles proposed in Open Me!, yet it took us a week, because more often than not we had to take long breaks between one box and another to avoid taking our PlayStation Vita and throw her out the window in frustration. The problem revolves around augmented reality, the cross and delight of the SCEA offer, which does not work as it should and which, despite being the fundamental fulcrum of the gameplay, is often also the most insurmountable obstacle. The boxes, in fact, appear in the environment taken by the camera of the console: it is sufficient to frame an AR card (after having downloaded it for free and then printed) or a flat surface for a few seconds, moving the console so that the camera frames and registers the dozens of indicators needed to recreate the model. It is clear that this system involves two basic problems, especially in the frequent case in which an AR card is not available: firstly, a sufficiently adequate combination of brightness, surfaces and colors is required; moreover, a lot of space is also needed, both in width and in height, in which to be able to move freely. In short, Open Me! it sure ain't no bus game either,ehm, from the toilet, and quite frankly, even the results obtained with the RA cards are certainly not brilliant. If the idea of having to physically go around the virtual box formed on the screen to observe all the details may seem very intriguing at first glance, in fact the execution is decidedly summary and intermittent: a sudden movement or an involuntary shift is enough to lose one of the invisible indicators framed by the camera, making the box disappear. At that point we will have to wait several seconds for the process to repeat itself and the box to reappear on the screen, but much more often we will be forced to start the game over. Not to mention that the boxes are often created in an inclined or distorted position, forcing us to be contortionists to be able to observe them better.", "date": "2013-09-17", "grade": "5.5"}
