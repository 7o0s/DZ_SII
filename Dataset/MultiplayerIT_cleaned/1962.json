{"name": "Hitman 2 - Day One", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hitman-2-day-one.html", "text": "A good-hearted killer From a person who has made killing others his profession, one would at least expect to be grappling with new missions from the beginning to show our dark side, without any mercy. Instead it is not so. The story of Hitman 2 begins with agent 47 (aka us) in spiritual retreat at a convent in Sicily. Apparently, we had second thoughts about our lives and regretted the crimes we committed. Unfortunately the circumstances are not such as to let us sleep in peace. Soon the good Don Vittorio, a priest of the convent, is kidnapped by mafiosi and our instinct makes us rush to dust off the old paraphernalia. Thus begins our new adventure. A good-hearted killer In Hitman 2 we have to complete a series of missions, a bit like we did in the first episode. This time, however, it is not cowardly money that drives us to act, but it is our initiative due to personal reasons. Soon, however, we will discover some background that will change the cards on the table, but I don't want to spoil the surprise. Missions can be completed in different ways. The one most warmly recommended is the less bloody and more effective one; that is, when possible, it is a good rule to try to infiltrate the enemy ranks by disguising yourself and using all the tricks of the trade to be able to slip behind the guards and go into dark corners where we cannot be identified immediately. In this way we can be able to assume the role (in the true sense of the word, since we can kill a guard and take his clothes!) Of unsuspecting people and get closer to our goal without arousing suspicion. However, if you're like me and can't walk in silence, sneak around, go unnoticed and have an easy trigger, it's still not a problem. The weapons are not lacking, we can find ammunition without too many problems and therefore there is absolutely no problem if we decide to give ourselves to the massacre of the enemy guards! From this point of view, Hitman 2 offers a wide range of choices on the actions to be taken. And we are not forced to follow a certain line of thought throughout the game. We can easily choose the best tactic for each mission, mixing the various methods of action in order to reach the final goal. However, it must be said that the greatest satisfaction comes from overcoming the mission as painlessly as possible and generating the least amount of alarm. Hitman 2's scoring system is also based on how well we were able to operate in the shadows. Depending on our prowess as ~stealth assassins~, we will be granted fame and glory in the circle of professional assassins. That is all for the moment. Until the next installment, in which we will talk about the missions. Introduction The sequel to the infamous Hitman has also finally hit the shelves. It was since the first episode that I no longer played the role of hitman, but now I can resume my activity (definitely not lawful). For those who haven't been lucky enough to play the first episode, Hitman 2 is the continuation of the story of agent 47, an assassin hired to commit the most heinous murders around the planet. The first episode was a truly enlightening game, with a new and captivating gameplay and a whole series of winning ideas that are also presented to us in Hitman 2, but with the difference that IO Interactive have managed to eliminate all the negative aspects of the previous one chapter.", "date": "2002-10-31", "grade": null}
