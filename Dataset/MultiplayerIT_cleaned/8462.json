Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to shell out a cent. In the space of a handful of months, the talented Canadian developers of Get Set Games have created a real cult phenomenon on the App Store and Google Play, Mega Jump (we recently reviewed), which has been downloaded and played by over twenty-two million people worldwide. Much of the success of this product is undoubtedly due to the sympathy of the character, not surprisingly become the protagonist of a new free title, precisely Mega Run - Redford's Adventure. Curious cross between a gecko, a teddy bear and a dinosaur, the funny little monster Redford kept us company for hours between one jump and another, ranging within the more traditional survival structure, enriched however by an important sense of progression thanks to the presence of scenarios to unlock as you reach new heights. The next challenge of Get Set Games was to use the platforms for something more than a bounce, bet again on the numbers (in this specific case four different worlds, for a total of sixty-four levels) and insert an extremely immediate but in many ways original, as the amplitude of the jump depends on the duration of the pressure on the screen and is therefore not predetermined. It may seem silly, but platform fans will struggle a bit to familiarize themselves with this solution and to take the right measures to carry out their maneuvers. Fortunately, in the end, the system will prove to be valid and accurate... Hopping happily The gameplay of Mega Run - Redford's Adventure represents a mix of two different genres: on the one hand we have the endless run element, since the character will never stop running towards the right side of the screen to reach the exit of each level; on the other hand, the platform component, precisely determined by the presence of platforms to jump on, by enemies to be eliminated in the same way (jumping on their heads) and by chasms and traps that must be avoided by calculating the timing of the action well. As mentioned above, the controls are really simple: just touch the screen for Redford to take a leap, which can be more or less wide depending on the duration of the pressure, as well as transform into a double jump in certain cases. As in Mega Jump, one of our objectives is to collect as many coins, crystals and special objects scattered throughout each scenario, also taking advantage of momentary boosts that will allow us to pass through walls and opponents, all in order to obtain the best possible rating at the end of the internship, i.e. three stars. It goes without saying that the unlocking system for new worlds and new levels depends precisely on the stars in our possession, which at a certain point will lead us to replay already completed missions in search of a perfect performance, to the benefit of the longevity of the game. Don't think, however, that the degree of challenge is low: when we come into contact with an enemy, Redford falls to the platform below but continues on his run. The problem is when the impact occurs in the absence of further ~layers~, which results in a game over. The variety of worlds, each based on a different theme, helps to enrich the gameplay while the picture is completed by very nice graphics, characterized by an excellent design and an excellent use of colors.", "date": "2012-06-30", "grade": "8.6"}
