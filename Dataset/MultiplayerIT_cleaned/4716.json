Yakuza Kiwami, however, is not limited to being a simple remaster, but presents itself as a real remake, which not only uses the assets of Yakuza 0 to completely redesign the graphics, but adds several new cutscenes to the campaign that shed light on the darkest aspects of the plot, as well as a large number of secondary quests capable of lengthening the duration of the experience is substantial. We finished the game taking about seventeen hours, but with a completion percentage of just 23%, which at least gives an idea of the work done by the developers to make Kiwami attractive even in the eyes of those who played the first episode of Yakuza many years ago and wants to take the opportunity to do a pleasant review. After all, we will have to wait a few more months for the release of Yakuza 6: The Song of Life... Where were we... If you read our tried Yakuza Kiwami, a couple of weeks ago, you know that the game narrates the events corresponding to the rise and fall of Kazuma Kiryu, ~the dragon of Dojima~, a rising star of the Yakuza who one day decides to sacrifice himself for his closest friends, taking responsibility for the murder of the boss of his own clan and ending up serving ten years in prison. When he gets out of prison, however, things have changed a lot: his old close friend, Akira ~Nishiki~ Nishikiyama, has become a ruthless and power-hungry person, while the girl he particularly cared about, Yumi, seems to have disappeared in the Nothing. The Tojo clan is also in turmoil: someone stole ten billion yen from the coffers of the organization and soon after President Sera was assassinated. But what does this situation have to do with the little girl Kazuma meets by chance on the streets of Kamurocho? We will find out in the course of a solid and engaging campaign, once again characterized by a very simple but strong structure of a very high quality narration, masterfully directed by Hiroyuki Sakamoto based on the script written by Hase Seishu. As anticipated at the beginning, however, we are talking about a real remake: the producer Toshihiro Nagoshi and his collaborators have inserted several cutscenes that further explore the protagonists and provide precise motivations for their actions, building a very thick background of which the chapter original was in many ways lacking. All mine the city Yakuza Kiwami's missions are actually quite simple, as it is the narrative element that gives substance to the experience rather than what we do within the map. In most cases, in fact, it is necessary to go from point A to point B, perhaps obtain objects and deliver them to someone, almost always concluding the quest with a fight. On the streets of Kamurocho it will often happen to come across thugs of various kinds who want to challenge us: a system of non-random encounters (it is possible, if desired, to lose opponents or in any case avoid them after seeing them) which serves to make the protagonist grow in terms of of experience and therefore of skills, as well as to increase his stock of cash. The money is primarily used to buy energy drinks capable of restoring our health or our fury bar, but also a whole series of more or less useful objects, as well as to try their hand at the many activities that the city has to offer. Unfortunately, the SEGA Clubs in this case do not allow you to play a few games with the classics of the Japanese house, but only to try your hand at the curious Insect Queen, a ~fighting game~ between insect-wrestlers that works through the rules of ~paper, scissors and stone ~, and whose cards can be collected around the world. However, there are mini-games such as bowling and billiards, as well as hostess clubs where you can try to win over some beautiful girls by getting the right phrases right. It also makes its return from Yakuza 0 the Pocket Circuit, the races with radio-controlled cars to customize and enhance through the purchase of spare parts and upgrades. The fire inside Narration aside, it is the fights that represent the fulcrum of Yakuza Kiwami. Compared to the original version, the authors have seen fit to reproduce the fighting styles seen in the prequel and to add a further element of growth, entrusting the development of Kazuma's ~Dragon Style~ solely to the clashes that we will be able to have with Goro Majima around the the city. The other three techniques can instead be enhanced through the use of experience pointsa, unlocking new combos and counters, or generally improving the resistance and strength of the protagonist. The Brawler style stands as the most balanced choice, since it allows you to ring together powerful combinations without losing reactivity, creating spectacular super when the fury bar is full and the opponent is on the ground. The Rush style, on the other hand, is focused on speed and allows you to easily dodge attacks, even those with firearms, but produces relatively light sequences of shots. Finally, the Beast style transforms the character into a sort of unstoppable wrestler, who grabs any object within range to use it as a weapon and provides devastating blows, but the price to pay is a great slowness of movement. The surrender of the attacks undoubtedly represents one of the strengths of Yakuza Kiwami, and it must be recognized that an excellent balancing job has been done to introduce the styles that were originally missing, given that the degree of challenge always remains on a discreet level and to avoid problems you need to fully upgrade the protagonist, as well as stock up on healthy drinks. Playstation 4 trophies Yakuza Kiwami allows you to get a total of fifty-five Trophies, almost always related to progression. In fact, there are the achievements that are obtained by completing the twelve chapters that make up the campaign, others related to the secondary quests. However, several Trophies must be obtained by collecting all the collectibles and completing the side activities offered by Kamurocho. Find the differences Interestingly, Yakuza Kiwami is undoubtedly worth comparing with the original PlayStation 2 Yakuza, but also with the recent Yakuza 0, as that's where most of the graphics assets come from. However, if the prequel boasted two different maps and two playable characters, this remake must necessarily limit itself in content and show situations and places already seen. The feeling is a bit strange: narratively the two chapters are perfectly consistent, indeed the work done for the remake further consolidates this aspect, but the Yakuza 0 experience is decidedly richer and more varied. Also with regard to the secondary missions, which in Kiwami have a bit of a filler flavor and are concluded very quickly, without ever leaving their mark. So yes, it will undoubtedly take you more than the fifteen hours required to complete the twelve chapters of the main storyline, because it will be practically inevitable to try your hand at some secondary quests, but overall the fun will be less than in the prequel; as indeed it is normal that it is, since these are two products belonging to different eras. Both are united by an old-gen rescue system, manual and with a few seconds of waiting, but on a technical level there is really nothing to complain about: the gap between Kiwami and the original Yakuza is enormous, the polygonal models they are excellent and the utmost attention has also been paid to the details to avoid that a low resolution texture spoils the game's splendid new presentation. The sixty frames per second, very solid apart from rare cases, close the picture of an amazing graphics, which reveals its origins only during the car sequences. The audio sector is equally excellent, thanks to impeccable acting by the Japanese voice actors and perfectly spot-on music. Once again the dialogues have been translated only into English, a move that we understand but which will inevitably discourage users less accustomed to reading large amounts of text in a language that is not theirs.", "date": "2017-08-21", "grade": "8.2"}
