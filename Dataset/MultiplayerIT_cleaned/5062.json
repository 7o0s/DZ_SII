{"name": "Dynasty Warriors: Godseekers", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/179569-dynasty-warriors-godseekers-musou-tatticou.html", "text": "The Dynasty Warriors series has a long history and a very solid fanbase, especially in Japan: a factor that over the years has effectively prevented Koei Tecmo from introducing substantial innovations in the franchise, leaving it anchored in a now frankly worn-out setting. Waiting for a surge of pride from the Japanese publisher, therefore, what to do to break the monotony of fights that are too similar to themselves? Simple: take the most famous characters of the saga, add a couple of new entries and transform the experience into a tactical RPG along the lines of Fire Emblem, Super Robot Wars or the classic Kessen. The story of Dynasty Warriors: Godseekers begins when two friends, Zhao Yun and Lei Bin, go to a cave where they believe something is kept that could change the tide of the war that is putting imperial China on fire. However, there was no sign that that something was a mysterious girl, Li Xia, who is freed from the seal that has been trapping her for who knows how long and joins the two warriors to carry out a mission of great importance. In fact, very powerful demons have hidden among the ranks of the enemy army, intending to exploit the power of the orbs to conquer the country and turn it into a real hell. Will we be able to stop them? Dynasty Warriors: Godseekers is a solid and fun tactical RPG, but lacks sharp details Tactical breakthrough The protagonists of the game are therefore Zhao Yun and Lei Bin, armed respectively with a powerful spear and a pair of rudimentary pistols, with Li Xia supervising the clashes and a large number of supporting actors who will join the group on multiple occasions, but who sometimes they will part their way from ours. This is the case, for example, of Liu Bei, the self-proclaimed emperor of China, equipped with a double sword but not particularly effective in battle, or of his commanders Zhang Fei and Guan Yu, much more accustomed to combat. The gameplay of Dynasty Warriors: Godseekers, as mentioned, refers to the tradition of tactical RPGs and therefore sees us engaged in battles that are gradually longer and more complex, which take place within a map divided into boxes and which must be completed by reaching specific objectives each time: the elimination of enemy leaders or a particular target, the defense of an allied commander, the achievement of an area of the scenario, the pursuit of a fleeing opponent and so on. During our turn we can move and attack with any of the units that make up the party, without a pre-established order, which makes it very easy to set up effective strategies, for example damaging a group of enemies from afar thanks to Lei Bin's ranged attacks and then rout them with Zhao Yun's spear. It must be borne in mind that it is better to position yourself on the sides or behind an opponent to be able to cause him more damage and prevent him from blocking our blows, an eventuality that will be conveniently indicated by the interface with the term ~advantage~ when we are going to select the target. Most maneuvers cover much more than a single square, and the game progressively encourages us to take advantage of this element to hit as many targets with a single attack. In addition to the ability to deliver multiple blows in one turn, alternating the various moves and even releasing the strength of the special Musou, accompanied as usual by a predetermined sequence in which we can see our character at work with his own finisher, once filled the appropriate indicator we will also be able to resort to the devastating Synchro Attack, that is a set of movements that ~synchronizes~ two fighters giving them as many extra shifts of movement and attack, seasoned with a disruptive shower of blows that is released in an area adjacent to ours. It is a literally decisive move, which can change the fate of the battle when perhaps you find yourself in great difficulty, and which must therefore be used in the best possible way. Playstation 4 trophies In addition to completing the ten chapters that make up the campaign, the forty-four Trophies of Dynasty Warriors: Godseekers are obtained by performing the Synchro Attack with various characters, defeating a certain number of enemies with a single warrior, upgrading one of our units to the maximum and scraping together the considerable sum of one million gold pieces. In short, all side actions, but there is also the achievement that can be obtained by completing the story twice. Structure and outline Dynasty Warriors: Godseekers arises from the outset as a simple but solid title, equipped with a traditional system that does not delve too much into the prosopri strategic aspects, remaining at a safe distance from the sometimes excessive depth of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, to stay on topic. The experience therefore turns out to be quite accessible, but at the same time devoid of particular ideas for those who have already had the opportunity to try their hand at one of the many similar productions. In structural terms, the campaign is made up of ten chapters that can be completed relatively quickly, less than ten hours, but it will be difficult to do so without dedicating yourself to completing some of the many secondary missions present, which take place in the same scenarios but literally multiply the duration of the experience, easily bringing it beyond the twenty hours. The reasons why it would be difficult to proceed straight forward lie in the fairly wide range of possibilities offered by the functions of buying and selling weapons, loot, crafting and skill points that allow you to unlock perks for each of the characters that make up our group. By spending the gold earned in battle we will eventually be able to upgrade the weapons up to their limit, which varies according to the level of the tools, and reforge them to transfer a particular bonus from one side to another, similar to what happens in Nioh but in a very much more intuitive and basic. In short, the picture painted by this spin-off developed by the usual Omega Force is that of a competent but far from surprising product, capable of making good use of a license that remains very popular and of offering us a different point of view on the great battles and great leaders of imperial China. Little to say on the technical front: the graphics of the characters and scenarios are limited to being functional to the action, the cutscenes are of decent workmanship and well directed, the control system via the directional cross is precise and it is naturally possible to scroll quickly action by pressing the X and Circle buttons, so as to avoid unnecessary delays, especially in the more multifaceted missions. The musical accompaniment is good, sufficiently varied not to be repetitive after a few stages.", "date": "2017-02-06", "grade": "7.0"}
