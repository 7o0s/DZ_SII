{"name": "Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-2_a.html", "text": "The game starts exactly where the first episode left off: the very long introductory movie shows you Raziel (your alter ego), seeking revenge against the evil Kain, who follows the evil vampire through the portal of the Chronoplast and finds himself in a bygone age in which the kingdom of Nosgoth still thrives. As soon as you can ~guide~ Raziel it will be possible to look around and become familiar with the excellent control system inherited from the previous chapter. The actions that you can perform from the beginning are numerous and include the glide jump and two different types of attack, but as you progress in the game you will discover new abilities, such as the ability to swim, climb walls, etc. Learning all the game mechanics is gradual and absolutely painless: even if there isn't a real tutorial, every time you can do something new, the key (or sequence of keys) to be used will appear on the screen. to press. The things to do to help Raziel carry out his revenge (but you will soon discover that it will not be your only purpose) are many and more varied than in the past. First of all there are the numerous enemies to beat: the interaction with these is much improved, since they are not defeated too easily as in the past but they do not cause feelings of frustration due to excessive difficulty. And then to help there are a lot of weapons recoverable from the bodies of defeated enemies or in some locations. The means of offense are quite varied and well differentiated from each other; for example, the spear is useful for hitting enemies from a certain distance but does less damage than the saber which, however, forces you to face the enemy in close combat. Each weapon also allows you to end battles with a kind of ~fatality~ that brings to mind the great Mortal Kombat: it will be possible to impale, decapitate, rip out the heart of the enemy and many other things like that. However, the most powerful weapon remains the Soul Reaver sword, the use of which is discouraged because by continuing to hit enemies it will suck your own energy. The mystical sword also has other characteristics; for example, by tempering it with one of the elements that you will find in the various locations, you can use it to open doors, illuminate rooms, create bridges to reach otherwise inaccessible points, etc. It also allows you to access the spectral plane, a feature dear to all fans of the series. By activating the passage between the two dimensions, you will witness a kind of morphing of the surrounding environment which will change into an even more gloomy and dark place, but which will allow you to regain the strength lost in battle, as well as to overcome some obstacles, such as gates or chasms , unsurpassed in the real world. Thus we come to the puzzles which in this new episode finally become more varied and never boring. It's not about the usual find the key to open the door, but about something better thought out that requires you, for example several trips into the dark world or to use the Soul Reaver in combination with some element. But if this weren't enough to make this game a recommended purchase, I just have to tell you about the excellent development of the plot that will keep you glued to the screen and that more than once will leave you in suspense. The narrative style is really special, it almost seems like watching a movie and the long full motion sequences accentuate this feeling. And if these are of absolute quality, like the rest of the technical sector of the game, there is nothing to be happy about. In titles of this genre, much of the time is spent exploring locations, which is sometimes a really boring operation. In Soul Reaver this problem does not arise because you will be literally enchanted by the imaginative Gothic architecture and open spaces full of atmosphere and scenographic elements such as streams, waterfalls and the remains of the battles that were fought there. The splendid textures that cover the majestic polygonal structures are immediately appreciated. For example, walking through the halls of the mansion on the first level, you cannot fail to admire the frescoes and stained glass windows that represent war scenes and episodes that have made the history of Nosgoth. Not to mention Raziel who carries around three thousand polygons without the slightest sign of fatigue, given that the on-screen update is fixed at sixty frames per second. And if that's still not enough, there are also first-rate visual effects that accentuate the execution of special shots or that are put there just to impress. In short, technically it does not make sense even if lately we have seen better. The same goes for the sound department with music thataccentuate the epic tone of the entire adventure accompanied by effects that underline all the actions of the protagonist and of the other characters and enemies you will encounter. There is also a valuable spoken word in several languages including Italian, but to have lip synchronization you will necessarily have to choose the English version. Last gem the uploads, or rather, the absence of uploads that make the use of the hard disk superfluous, since the PS2 does nothing but continuously upload the data from the DVD player (practically the same system used by Jak and Daxter). In the midst of all this good things the only defects I can complain about are the occasional interpenetration between the weapons and the walls, the little interaction with the surrounding elements of the scenario (it's a pity not being able to use the torches or rage on the corpses or not being able to use spears with stuck heads lying around) and limited longevity. Oh yes, it won't take long to finish Soul Reaver 2 but those few hours will be really intense and will absolutely not make you regret the purchase. There are many other things I would like to tell you but the most important is not to miss this pearl in the list of gifts to ask Santa Claus! Pros: Unparalleled atmosphere and story Technical execution You won't be disconnected until it's finished! Cons: Longevity Some small graphic defects and that's it! We've been waiting for it for two years but finally the world of Nosgoth is among us again! I had thought of opening this review with a brief summary of the very intricate story behind this new chapter, but I would have deprived you of part of the pleasure you get from experiencing it personally, also because there is an entire extra section in the game containing several goodies including an account of the entire history of Soul Reaver. This part is, in fact, the first innovation on the DVD and I sincerely hope it won't remain a single episode: as in any good film on the new digital medium, in fact, it contains films, photos of the programmers and material on the development of the video game. But this is precisely a game and to unlock all the extras you will have to sweat the fateful ~seven shirts~.", "date": "2001-12-21", "grade": null}
