{"name": "Rainbow Six Vegas - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rainbow-six-vegas-recensione.html", "text": "Such a rich Christmas certainly could not miss Ubisoft, which since the beginning has stood out for a series of truly valid titles for Xbox 360 and which also for PC always remains among the best software houses around. At the start of the shopping spree, the French softco presents a new chapter of one of its most popular series, that Rainbow Six which at the time of the first Xbox literally made Live take off. After the controversial Lockdown, we are, therefore, back at war, at the head of a team of three soldiers, armed to the teeth, in a certainly new setting: the city of Las Vegas. The package of this new Rainbow Six is really succulent between the single player mode, versus and online co-op, up to the support of Xbox Live Vision, the webcam just released by Microsoft. Vegas proves to be the best FPS to buy on 360 for this Christmas, and one of the best on PC, albeit with some small flaws. The city of sin Logan is the senior member of a special forces group. He is sent to Mexico to investigate strange terrorist movements in a sunny city, where some unsuspecting inhabitants have been kidnapped. During the operations, two fellow soldiers are captured by a woman as ruthless as she is fascinating, but there is no time to investigate further, because all hell breaks loose in Las Vegas and it is time to fly by helicopter and join the fray, until the final showdown, in truth, a bit too concise. In this episode of R6, the possibility of taking cover behind walls and furniture is introduced by pressing the left trigger of the pad, switching to a third-person view, from the canonical subjective one. From this position it is possible to shoot without leaning out, with less precision, or, looking out with the left analogue lever, both from the side and from above, thus being able to aim, while remaining somehow more protected. Everything works perfectly and goes well with the new system with which energy is recharged, taken from fps like Call of Duty 2, and thanks to which it is enough to take shelter for a few moments behind a wall to get back in great shape. The management of the assault team is perfect, made up of two soldiers, in addition to Logan, who with simple commands move quickly, placing themselves behind the doors and freeing the rooms with excellent timing, while the player can take the terrorists intent on defend on the other front. The meanders of the casinos enhance all these gameplay elements, further demonstrating the state of grace achieved by Ubisoft Montreal in map design, not only in multiplayer, but especially in single-player mode. Every trick and tactic must be known how to use and put to good use in locations, which always offer multiple solutions, all of which can be adopted quickly and naturally, without the typical frustration of tactical shooters, so much so that at the basic difficulty level, anyone can complete the game in just over ten hours. Perhaps this, among other things, is a defect for those who do not want, or cannot, play online or for those who find the higher difficulty level too demanding, in which the Artificial Intelligence of terrorists proves to be really complex. If we exclude some uncertainties in the approach phases, in fact, the mercenaries moved by the CPU really do everything, even the tour of entire locations, in order to come and track us down. There is life online The multiplayer dish is really rich, which allows up to 16 players to challenge each other online in modes, ranging from the classic deathmatch, to elimination, both single and in teams. The new Attack and Defense is interesting which, on the 10 maps available, assigns the two teams different objectives, such as going to recover data that must be taken to the base, or rescuing hostages with the attention, on the part of the terrorists, not to do them die to snatch them from the Rainbows, on pain of defeat. Also of great depth is the cooperative mode which makes all levels of the single player campaign available to four players, with a real explosion of game mechanics and group tactics, giving great longevity to the Ubisoft title. Also noteworthy is the Hunt for Terrorists, always in co-op, which sees a group of players face a map that must be completely freed from bots moved by the CPU. Whoever dies acts as a spectator and takes note. The most intriguing aspect of R6 online is the creation of a real persistent soldier, who scores points after each game by unlocking new weapons and equipment, which improves his defensive and movement capabilities. Thanks to the points that are acquired, even after a defeat, one still feels encouraged to play and to persevere in a title, which will be safe.seriously stormed. The net code is not exempt from small flaws, and in some games we could notice some flaws in the attribution of experience points (in one we scraped together 0 points, after making seven kills, because we were branded passive players; penalty for standing still at a point on the map without doing anything). We also noticed some hesitation in Offense and Defense mode. In a couple of cases, the briefcase to be brought back to the base remained suspended on the head of the killed bear, without anything more being done to pick it up and take it to its destination. That said, online play is one of Rainbow Six's strongest elements, and we're confident right now that it will claim thousands of lives for several months to come. Such is the goodness of the action and level design. Clinking of coins Although the game is clearly designed around the levels set in casinos, the most successful settings are the last and the first, which closely resembles the latest Ghost Recon, while not sharing the polygonal engine, which here is that of Unreal. These two locations are the only ones that are almost completely outdoors, where the engine shows off excellent light effects and a concreteness that makes the different situations excellent. In the closed environments of the casinos, however, one cannot help but notice that not all the textures are up to par, that the number of polygons is not transcendental and that, above all, there are not many objects with which it is possible to interact on screen. In short, entering a kitchen full of plates, glasses and various foods, shooting at full flame, and seeing only a couple of objects blown up, greatly diminishes the atmosphere of a game that makes realism its strong point. Fan a table in a bar with a machine gun and see that the paper cups, placed on top, remain firmly in place, creates a bit of disappointment. In a good visual complex, this is clear. The same goes for the audio, with truly beautiful music, accompanied by exciting sound effects. The many conversations of the terrorists caught chatting about this and that, before each ambush, are atmospheric. Maybe it sounds a little strange that these dialogues resume in the middle of a fight, if you stay in cover for longer than usual, as if nothing had happened. Between car wrecks and shattered glass, a ~Fuck! He owed me money too!, or I thought I heard something but no, it's nothing. When up until a moment ago, there were bullets everywhere. Goals 360 In Ubisoft they have to trust very much in the success that R6 Vegas will have on Xbox Live. In fact, most of the goals are linked to the net and to co-op matches and, above all, versus. In addition, each level completed on any difficulty awards points, with a bonus for those who finish the game in ~Realistic~ mode, the most difficult. By playing on the net, the objectives are unlocked with a good progression, of course it takes time to get to 1000. Comment Rainbow Six Vegas is one of the best fruits of Ubisoft Montreal and Tom Clancy's work. Some of the single player and multiplayer maps are simply perfect and allow the player to squeeze every single drop of gameplay instilled into this tactical FPS to the core. The innovations introduced in the game system work great, despite an obvious turn towards action that leaves behind the most exaggerated realism. Especially if you have the ability to play online, this new chapter is not to be missed, as it will keep you busy for weeks. Some aspects could have been better taken care of, starting from the somewhat fluctuating cosmetics, but for the rest there is only one to take off the hat and start shooting. Pros: Great level design Welcome innovations Full online mode Support for Xbox Vision Cons: Short single player Graphics with ups and downs Small bugs The face of the Next Gen In all online modes, a texture that traces your face can be applied to the model of our soldier, thanks to the Xbox Live Vision and a system that takes two photos, one frontal and one lateral. The results, as you can see from the images in our gallery, are amazing. Imagine the satisfaction of playing the entire single player campaign in co-op, accompanied by your closest friends. There are a few problems in the most crowded games, in which many have the custom texture, because not all of them are displayed. The team, however, is already working on a patch that solves the problem. It's worth it, because, even if it may seem strange, the immersiveness of the game gains further.", "date": "2006-12-01", "grade": null}
