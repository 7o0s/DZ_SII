Combine this mix with a truly tangible possibility of influencing events with your actions and you will be able to come close to obtaining what is the essence of Dyscourse, an adventure created by Owlchemy Labs which has been available for a few days on Steam. Funded at the end of 2013 via Kickstarter with 44,000 dollars and broken compared to the 40,000 requested, the adventure puts the player at the center of a story inextricably linked to the most emotional aspect of the gaming experience, through the main feature represented by a relationship between cause and effect less artificial than the Telltale production, which translates first of all into the possibility of reaching different endings, but also of living and reliving a story that is largely different with each new game. Certainly intriguing premises, accompanied by a particular but interesting technical style, which helped push us to go to the island of Dyscourse to find out what this new independent production has in store for us. How far are you ready to go to save yourself? Dyscourse puts you to the test! Hello, my name is Rita In Dyscourse we are called to take on the role of Rita, a barmaid with an excellent curriculum of studies who finds herself involved in a plane crash, following which she ends up shipwrecked on a desert island. Wandering among the wreckage of the aircraft, the protagonist immediately comes into contact with the other passengers who were unharmed, together with whom she will naturally have to guarantee survival, while simultaneously trying to ensure that any rescuers nearby can notice the presence of those who escaped the crash. . The characters we will get to know include a couple on the verge of divorce, a video gamer with obvious problems of detachment from reality, a rather depressed workaholic and a schizophrenic conspiracy theorist: all quite particular types we must say, towards whom we end up feeling empathy in any case. an extreme situation such as the one proposed by Dyscourse. From the point of view of characterization there is not much to object to, even if in some situations certain characters in particular end up becoming a little too much of themselves caricatures, deviating from the solemnity of some moments. However, it is a choice that seems to marry with the philosophy behind the whole story, within which there are even dramatic moments where the dead can even escape us, preceded and followed by situations in which instead we end up laughing in convinced way. Fast rewind The plot of Dyscourse, as you have already read, does not shine from the start for its originality, but still manages to be followed thanks to the many details that make it up, through the approximately ten days that the castaways spend on the island: translated in real time , we're talking just over an hour of gameplay. If the time for the single game seems short to you, and it undoubtedly is, a clarification must be made: on the one hand the adventure ends in a decidedly hurried way, on the other it must be considered that Dyscourse represents a rather unique, in which the player's actions and decisions end up heavily influencing the evolution of the matter. It is therefore probable that with the means available to Owlchemy Labs this is what has been possible to achieve to avoid getting too entangled in the branches offered, focusing decisively on replayability. There are essentially three explorable endings, but the various modifiable details certainly make the idea of starting all over again attractive, if only to see how the story can branch out at a point where our choice was more fought over than elsewhere. Between attacks by wild animals, pangs of hunger, cannibalism and classic situations in which it is possible to save one person less than there are with us, we assure you that such moments will not be missed, thus urging you to go back at least once, if not more. Adventure in style As far as raw mechanics are concerned, Dyscourse can be classified as a point and click adventure, even if in reality the puzzles that once characterized the latter are practically reduced to the bone. As regards the choices that can be made by the player, depending on the seriousness of the situation, a countdown is proposed within which to make one's decision, as already seen in other shores. From a technical point of view, however, it jumps immediatelythe type of design that Owlchemy Labs wanted to give to its creature is clearly visible, close to that of cartoons but with some ~angularity~ which makes the style truly unique overall. As far as we are concerned, what we can say is that in the economy of the game, the graphic aspect also does its job fully. The sound accompaniment is also excellent, where we find a kind of speech that is actually a nonsense whispering between the characters. It goes without saying that except for amateur translations, Italian is not contemplated, so to fully enjoy the dialogues and descriptions you need to deal with English.", "date": "2015-04-09", "grade": "7.0"}
