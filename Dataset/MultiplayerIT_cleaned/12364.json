{"name": "Galaxy on Fire", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/galaxy-on-fire.html", "text": "We remove all doubts and embarrassment, we really liked Galaxy on Fire. We will face all the missions in the role of Keith Maxwell, an excellent space fighter pilot. We will initially have to face about a dozen missions, behind the engagement by the Terrans (the classic ~good guys~, here in the form of a security alliance), with the aim of driving out the evil Vossk. Finished these tasks we will be free to move in deep space, making the acquaintance of more than 10 different life forms, from robots to classic gray aliens. At this point an entire universe will open up to us, we will be able to take part, always rewarded, in more than 500 missions, with over 20 space shuttles to pilot, each with different capabilities. The ~engagements~ will be of the most varied, from intercepting and defeating invaders, to escorting important characters, to simple transport missions. During the adventure our character will grow, managing to improve his skills from every point of view. An aspect that is part of our protagonist and that we should not overlook is that relating to reputation, every action or mission that we complete will in fact have repercussions on our fame (indicated in the game by a convenient indicator), we will thus be able to choose to be totally aligned with the Terrans or feel the dark side of the Vossk strength. The choice will be ours alone. Technically, the title developed by Fish Labs is a small masterpiece, with an excellent polygonal engine that never suffers from slowdowns, even in the most complex situations. The realization of the turbo and the explosions is really good, as well as the details of the different spaceships. The controls are accurate and always precise, certainly a mobile phone equipped with a joystick is more advantageous than those equipped only with a directional cross. The only small defects we found in some loading a little too long, at least during our test with the Nokia N70, and in a decidedly inadequate sound. PRO Technically excellent Very long-lived AGAINST Long uploads Inadequate sound", "date": "2007-04-11", "grade": "S.V."}
