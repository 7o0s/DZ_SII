But faithful to the saying ~dulcis in fundo~, the Kyoto house waited for the very last days of the calendar to churn out one of its trump cards, thus guaranteeing a wonderful Christmas to those who had the patience to wait. Ticket please! The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks is the direct sequel to that Phantom Hourglass dated 2007 which still today represents one of the top production on the two-screen console; graphic style and gameplay are in fact practically the same, thus guaranteeing an indisputable quality from these points of view. What is certain is that the previous episode, despite having been an excellent game, did not fail to raise some criticisms above all linked to the ~infamous~ Sanctuary of the King of the Sea, a crossroads for some moments of repetitiveness and frustration that could frankly be improved. Spirit Tracks is therefore inevitably, at least in intention, a refinement of what was obtained with Phantom Hourglass, an authentic labor file that the Japanese programmers wanted to achieve during the months of development. The plot this time takes place 100 years after the events narrated in the predecessor, with a Hyrule in danger facing the threat of the terrible Demon King Malladus determined to free himself from the prison of the Tower of the Gods and from the energy chains that kept him bound in the course of the last century. The latter, with a solution typical of the fabulous and marvelous universe of the world of Zelda, also have the dual function of railway tracks, used by the inhabitants of the kingdom to move on board trains. And so the hero Link of this adventure is a young train driver, ready to join Princess Zelda to obtain the official license to drive trains. It's a pity that the situation precipitates rapidly, with the dramatic - and by now well known - event of the death of the regent; although his body is no longer animated, the spirit remained next to Link, ready to help him complete the adventure and restore peace to the kingdom. An element, this, which is anything but accessory; the traveling companion is in fact able to lend a hand to the hero in a more than concrete way, among other things also taking possession of the fearsome Specters, thus making them directly controllable according to the player's will. A collaborative aspect therefore that constitutes the cornerstone of the Spirit Tracks mechanics; continuous and numerous are in fact the moments in which it is necessary to manage two subjects at the same time, both to solve puzzles and to defeat enemies and bosses. Anyone who has played at least a few episodes of the series will not struggle much to find familiarity both in the mechanics and in the progression scheme of the game; in fact, as you enter the story, Link gains new tools so as to expand his skills and reach places and secrets previously denied. And so, together with classics such as bombs, boomerangs and bows, the team led by Eiji Aonuma has this time created new weapons, capable of adding some element of novelty to a mechanic that is still very, very faithful to the classic dictates of the series. The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks movie #1The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks | Watch all videos | See all images Arriving at platform 3 We were talking about the improvement work compared to Phantom Hourglass, and certainly one of the best expressions of this statement is to be found in the Tower of the Gods, practically the equivalent of the predecessor's Sanctuary of the Sea King; also in this case it is necessary to face multiple visits during the entire adventure, but fortunately there is no need to repeat sections already faced or respect a time limit. A real relief then. The improvement of the goodness in the level design of the dungeons is also sensitive, this time practically always impeccable and without evident drops. As far as driving the train is concerned, a means that actually replaces the boat for moving around within the kingdom of Hyrule, it should be noted that Aonuma has devised some convincing solutions capable of overshadowing the obvious need to remain tied to the routes pre-set tracks. In addition to the possibility of adding improvements, transporting passengers and goods, more generally the speed management alone and the ability to make the convoy whistlelio actually guarantee that reference to childhood and children's games that Mijamoto himself had underlined. As a result, trips are almost never boring, and indeed give the opportunity to get lost in the world of Hyrule and the variety of landscapes it is able to guarantee. Certainly the freedom of movement and the involvement of a Twilight Princess or Ocarina of Time are far away, but nevertheless the compactness and coherence of the elements of Spirit Tracks do not cause excessive inferiority complexes to suffer. This is also because the quality of the gameplay is, frankly, crystal clear; although at times a sense of dj vu can be felt quite marked, and although Link's latest adventure is all in all a more of the same, it is practically impossible not to be immediately captivated by the goodness of a game mechanic that represents one of the best exponents of the N-difference. Even on a technical level, despite a practically perfect identity with Phantom Hourglass, Spirit Tracks still manages to amaze thanks to a style and quality level often unknown on portable consoles, both in graphics and in sound. There is no shortage of local wi-fi multiplayer elements, both for competitive challenges and for exchanging items with friends.", "date": "2009-12-21", "grade": "9.0"}
