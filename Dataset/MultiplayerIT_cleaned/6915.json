Above all, what does it mean to become one and how do you do it? We honestly asked ourselves this question after spending more than thirty hours with Destiny, the highly anticipated new game from Bungie, and having raised a guardian up to level 22 with some armor on and a handful of friends met on the net. It wasn't clear what it was about, until a week ago: it wasn't clear how much RPG, FPS, MMO, present and past there were in this work on which five hundred people worked and still work within the walls of one of the most important studies in the history of video games. In the intentions of the team there was the hope of revolutionizing the genre of first person shooters again, but many years have passed since Halo: Combat Evolved, born when it was still thought that the same genre was incompatible with the joypad, and titles such as Borderlands they've already pioneered open worlds to be tackled from a first-person perspective, and they've done it very well. What Bungie has succeeded in the end is to create a solid structure but one that will need a series of additions to last the 10 years envisaged, leaving these early days with the task of doing the honors and making millions known of players a type of game mechanics that still has no equal in the panorama of first person shooters. The Traveler and the Guardians Destiny's story is more of a premise than anything else. Mankind is reeling from a conflict that saw the Traveller, a giant floating relic that imbued the good with power and knowledge, sacrifice himself as a last stand against dark forces that claimed him for themselves. The guardians of the tower that overlooks the last safe outpost of civilization are timidly starting to explore the space again to recover the pieces of the Traveler and restore it to its former glory. There isn't a protagonist, there are many, different in terms of playability, but indistinct from that of the narrative which is entrusted to a handful of movies with the game engine and which put together a series of missions to reach wonderful places, such as almost all those who meet on the four planets to explore, and which end with an epilogue that does not excite and, perhaps, not even try. Mass Effect had a protagonist, potentially anonymous like the guardians, who could change his appearance and attitudes according to the player's will, but the emotional bond with the game universe was created precisely in the fabric of relationships, of different dialogues. These RPG aspects do not converge in Destiny which does not have a ~powerful~ story and which of that genre embraces only the ideas related to the evolution of the characters that can be created between three races and three classes with a fast editor to create faces that are soon covered by dozens of helmets and armor. Titan is the physically strongest class; the hunter, the one that brings more damage from a distance and the sorcerer is the equivalent of an ~enchanter~ able with his powers to more quickly demolish the shields of the enemies, divided into four races, fighting each other for the dominion of the universe. For each class there are, for the moment, two interchangeable skill trees starting from a certain level, which develop by accumulating experience. There are no basic stats that grow, but three factors that allow each guardian's three special moves to be performed more often, each entrusted to two backbones of the pad and their simultaneous pressure for that special one. These three factors (intellect, strength and discipline) are influenced by the items you wear and which you get as rewards from game performance in any mode and by killing enemies in PvE phases. Some objects can be upgraded, some are found as engrams to be deciphered on the tower, all are divided according to the rarity and level needed to obtain and use them. A level 20 character, to be clear, stripped of all equipment and without prejudice to the above skills, returns to zero level for all three factors. The difficulties of Destiny The level of the character changes the quality, rarity and power of the weapons and pieces of armor that can be recovered and worn and, in fact, constitutes the backbone of the game balance and the prerequisite for accessing the different difficulty levels to which it is possible to face the story or the other modes in cooperative. This system works, it's where Destiny innovates and it's Bungie's way of pacing the progression of the experience. Reached level 20 (it takes 15 to 20 hours to get there, about 12 to finish the story), going up again becomes just a matter of loot, experience is no longer needed if not to enhance the weapons that have perks that are activated progressively with use. For example, to play the story on a heroic level (there is also a legendary one), you must have accumulated enough objects infused with Light, this is the enhancement factor, to reach beyond 20 and in this way the system knows that you have weapons and equipment powerful enough to emerge victorious. Power levels cannot be made, a group with a too young character in it cannot start heroic or legendary games. With a cold mind this is the reason why, probably, it is not possible to exchange objects between players because the progress through the difficulty levels of which Bungie seems to want control for now would be profoundly altered. Leaving the tower, the center of Destiny where weapons, equipment or ammunition are bought and secondary missions are activated linked to the achievement of certain in-game objectives such as killing a certain number of enemies, the spaceship takes off and accesses the map of the whole universe with the Moon, Mars, Venus and the Earth at our disposal. By clicking on each of them, another map opens with the visualization of all the missions of the story and the other PvE modes: Assault and Patrol. The former are an enhanced version of the Gears of War Horde which here close with the battle with a very tough boss to knock out, while the Patrols allow you to explore all the planets by activating procedural missions to accumulate good materials to enable the perks, to gain experience and to participate in public events, random occasions in which all players on a map (usually six) can help each other to achieve a timed objective to receive experience and faction points with the different merchants of the Tower, useful for buy heroic and legendary weapons and items. The problem is that, for the purposes of the Light-infused loot needed to get past level 20, you have to repeat over and over the Story missions set to higher difficulties, only four or five per planet, and the Onslaughts, which are six in total and which they end up in a playlist that rotates them through higher difficulties. If you're lucky - the drop seems totally random - you can get one or two interesting items for each session of about 40 minutes so as to get to, say, level 21 and then start finding items with enough Light to get to level 22 and unlock the most difficult levels and Raids that expect to have reached 26 and which will be unlocked, for now only one, from 16 September. The good artificial intelligence of the enemies, typical of Bungie, helps to find ever new situations in these activities, but who does not want to loop these few missions one after the other in 40-minute loops, it is not clear whether he will be able to find enough entertainment until in December, when the first of the expansions is expected, given that he finds himself forced to play the Crucible, or the PvP of Destiny, in which at the end of each session you can be lucky enough to receive up to two items useful for the cause and where you earn faction points to buy the strongest weapons and armor on the tower. We are at the showdown: after a long wait, here is our review of Destiny! Playstation 4 trophies After more than thirty hours of gameplay and after finishing the story, we achieved 23% of the Destiny trophies with a silver and all with bronze. We didn't play trying to achieve some objectives that would have been achievable with a little forethought, but simply letting what was happening in the game carry us forward. However, making platinum will take many hours also because there are some trophies that cannot be obtained until the raids are activated and only then will it be possible to understand how difficult they will be. The Crucible The Crucible can therefore be considered for the moment, the true central element of the Destiny endgame. It is the beating heart of the new Bungie production, it has always been deep down, but here it becomes really mandatory to also be able to access the legendary and heroic levels of the PvE modes to be done in cooperative and this is the first time that it happens. From this point of view, Destiny is much more linked to Xbox Live and PlayStation Network than the request to be connected to be able to play even alone suggests. The feeling of a non-infinite amount of content available at launch continues here too with five modes from Control, which is a fun variant of King of the Hill in which conquered bases multiply the points needed to win a game, to Recovery which sees two team of three people committed to conquering objectives in the approximately ten maps availableone, passing through free-for-all and team deathmatches of three or six players per team, for a total of twelve guardians in the game at the same time. Not many modes for a team with Bungie's history, since then there are no playlists that combine the different modes and that some maps are repeated more often than others if not several times in a row. One wondered how they would balance guardians so different in equipment and level in games that are balanced and always fun. This is possible because only the type of skills unlocked for each class changes, but not the equipment which is, as they say, ~normalized~ or brought to the basic statistics by type of weapon and armor. A level 20 has the same chances of hurting a level 10: what changes is the type of power developed along the skill tree of the three classes. It is precisely in the multiplayer that we see how differentiated these are, with a predominance of the Titans in the number of kills, especially at low levels, but with a re-emergence of Hunters and Warlocks in maps that require more strategy or wider spaces for long range weapons range. The netcode is certainly the best Destiny has to offer: apart from some understandable disconnections given the amount of players online, it is solid, the latency almost imperceptible and Bungie's ability to set up a structure that asks players to study the maps, to understand the opportunities to be exploited also thanks to the jumps that can take you anywhere to concoct the different game strategies. Destiny is a great way to get into this type of gameplay and, while still to be refined in some respects, it's difficult not to get hooked for long play sessions. The biggest change is that of the equipment, given that the weapons do not appear on the map, but that you can only rely on those that have been collected previously and, since the levels do not matter, it is advisable to keep more in the armory different types so as to always be ready on every occasion, paying attention to the ammunition that those, yes, appear and which can become a real balance of the games. A tea on mars Among the most successful things about Destiny is the quality of the artistic and technical production. The cleanliness of the images, the effects on the screen, the animations of the enemies and the care with which the models of these and the elements of the backdrops are made are, at times, impressive. Most creatively, Bungie has managed to recreate exactly what could be expected from a universe ravaged by conflict that has left abandoned industries, piles of rubble and a sense of wonder full of color that manages to escape the depression on which too much titles set in the post-apocalypse often veer. It certainly cannot be defined as an original world, dense as it is with quotations and references to the most diverse popular culture, but the sun of Mars or the lunar caverns are places where it is wonderful to poke your nose. The maps, among other things, are vaster than it might seem, given that neither the story nor the Assaults lead to every part of them, but we go back a bit to the problem of the contents that must increase in the coming months by giving the players a reason to keep wandering, perhaps adding new loot or the possibility of patrolling at a higher level of difficulty for what is a successful game especially in terms of the purest shooter. From a technical point of view, the engine runs at native 1080p and 30 frames per second without hesitation also thanks to a system that can be seen is also designed to run on past generation consoles, leaving interactivity to very few elements of the backdrop, no longer of a few explosive barrels here and there and relegating physics to a marginal role. Certainly on next-gen the quality of the light effects, the softness of the lines and the blur that accompanies the most agitated phases are impeccably executed. As always, the musical accompaniment created, for the last time, by veteran Marty O'Donnell with the participation of Paul McCartney of the Beatles, who before leaving Bungie created a series of compositions that help complete a experience among the most beautiful of this 2014. Where the cross-gen nature probably leaves its mark is in the management of the voice chat which is limited to the three members of the group with whom any activity can be tackled and which, even when launching modes for you are guardians, you do not add newcomers to the chat. Playing Control without being able to talk to at least three teams in the group is alienating. You have to create a group of six to do it right from the start", "date": "2014-09-14", "grade": "8.7"}
