{"name": "Imperium Civitas II - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/imperium-civitas-ii-recensione.html", "text": "Copying The Settlers From the title of the late Blue Bytes, this IC2 draws heavily, providing for an assembly-line structured administration of resources: you will have to start from raw resources, such as wood, meat and cereals, and through a series of increasingly advanced buildings (in order carpentry, butcher and baker), you will have to get to supply your city with the finished product, in order to satisfy the pressing needs of each social class. If, on paper, it may seem decidedly simple, the practice is complicated by the presence of areas of influence associated with each building: for your chain to work without interruptions, you will have to worry about keeping the production cycle within these mangy little circles, with the risk that a building does not receive the materials for its production and therefore remains inactive. If we continue to see everything from this pessimistic point of view, an inactive building leads not only to the deterioration of the appearance of the districts in which it is located, but significantly increases the risk of fires, real calamities to be avoided in any way, resorting or gratifying tricks (and so we risked the respect of hardcore gamers), or the Prefectures, civic buildings that are concerned, among other things, with safeguarding honest citizens from criminals, thieves and disturbing bald and malicious editors-in-chief. In essence, each of your games will vaguely recall a three-dimensional Tetris, where you will spend your time fitting circles on circles, in a desperate attempt to make your metropolis less messy than Turin, in spite of any master plan and everything according to the needs of your citizenship: however, this very game made of intersections and unions inevitably leads to Chaos and very rarely you will be able to avoid the collapse of your city. Unless Drawing from Rise of Nations Unless, the developers have thought, we borrow another idea that enriches the current game mechanics. Thus the Tabulae make their triumphal entry (we never thought that 5 years of Latin would come in handy, at least now we know it reads TABULE), basically mission cards that provide bonuses, malus (the review begins to take on an intellectual tone) and any objectives to be achieved to complete the scenario: yes, the only way not to get to the aforementioned type of game over is precisely to complete the assigned tasks as soon as possible. The Prefectures, civic buildings that are concerned, among other things, with safeguarding honest citizens from criminals, thieves and disturbing bald and malicious editors-in-chief Drawing from Rise of Nations A full-blown ploy, which nonetheless has some interesting aspects: each mission card, while almost always providing for the obligation to build a certain number of buildings or reach a certain level of well-being, is supplemented by an interesting historical description that illustrates why the Senate in ancient Rome really did assign such priorities. You will then discover the reasons why it was necessary to accumulate large quantities of stones during the winter, why the Roman aqueducts had to be emptied periodically, leaving the city without water for some time, and other interesting backgrounds of life in that period: unfortunately, from a purely playful point of view, these Tabulae vary the game action, but in the long run they prove not only too simple to complete, but also rather repetitive. In light of the above, we do not feel like promoting this card system as a real strength, but at least you will not have the impression of getting lost in a very long sand box session. Drawing from Total War In a game about Ancient Rome, the aspect that most characterized the society of that period cannot materially be missing: war. Even IC2 is no exception and, although it is nowhere near the tactical depth of the various Total War, you too will have to worry about enlisting legions to defend your settlement and (in the perfect perspective of preventive peace), massacre the neighboring barbarian populations. Drawing from Total War It is evident that the FX Interactive title is focused on city management, given that the war aspect is simply reduced to building a barracks to enlist, alternatively, Equites (soldiers on horseback), Pedites (soldiers on foot) and Archers , thus following the proven system of Chinese paper. Once you have formed your armies, you can decide to assault the villages on the map, or limit yourself to keeping your troops for any defensive clashes, perhaps infollowing the opening of a Tabula that unleashes a horde of bloodthirsty barbarians against you: the impression is that the developers had to insert this aspect by force, treating it as best as possible and thus lowering the sense of care that instead permeates the entire production. Sense of care that is presented to you through graphics that have nothing to envy to the aforementioned million-dollar productions (has anyone mentioned Empire Earth 3?), showing you a city full of details, which you will see live before your eyes and be reflected in any puddles of water: every building, even if belonging to the same typology (for example, houses), will always be different from the previous buildings, giving you the sensation of not being in front of a perfect IKEA city, but something more personal, where they are the inhabitants themselves to personalize their structures. We also point out, among the gems that are rarely seen in a budget title, a rather intuitive and clean interface, which will immediately make even those who have never picked up a strategy game, and a wheel-structured construction menu immediately gain confidence , particularly neat and well done. Comment We have reached the conclusion and it is therefore our duty to answer the fateful question of whether it is worth spending the 19.90 on this game, or whether it is better to invest it in an evening at a pizzeria. Regardless of the fact that the writer hates pizza (blasphemy! nd Tanzen), without a doubt Imperium Civitas 2 is an RTS that entertains and without false ambitions: it is a game sold at a budget price, but which could easily have been one at full price , you want for the quality not only of the title itself, but also for the goodness with which the whole was created (including, we mention, a manual of 63 pages all in color). Buy it not only if you love the genre, but also if this is your first experience: you will spend several hours having fun and, after all, this is exactly what a game must do. Pros Very affordable price Fun Pleasant graphics Cons Repetitive over the distance It will make you sick of having spent 50 for EE3 Hardware Minimum Requirements: Processor: Pentium 4 2.0 Ghz or AMD 2200+ RAM: 512 MB Video Card: Direct 3D compatible with 64Mb Disk Space: 3.0 GB Recommended Requirements: Processor: Pentium 4 3 Ghz or AMD 3000+ RAM: 1024 MB Video Card : Direct 3D compatible with 128Mb Disk space: 3.0 GB Test configuration Processor: Intel Core Duo E6700 at 2.7 Ghz RAM: 2 Gb Video card: NVIDIA BFG 8800 GTX Operating system: Windows Vista Ultimate The game is presented, on the test configuration , obviously fluid, maintaining a constant framerate around 35/40 fps, with all the details at maximum and at 1650*1050; however, like many strategy games, as your city starts to take on a considerable size, you will notice noticeable drops in framerate. Nothing annoying though. Imperium Civitas II is available for PC. Small Philosophical Digression on the Sense of the Budget When a long-standing player buys a budget title, he knows, more or less consciously, that the game in question will disappoint him at least in one respect, be it of secondary importance (a single page manual printed on recycled paper) or perhaps more fundamental , such as outdated graphics or gross programming errors. The mistake we often, too often, fall into is to associate the concept of a budget game with that of a basket title for supermarkets: in reality, some productions, including this Imperium Civitas 2, have nothing to envy to many others false triple A titles. Indeed, to be sold at  19.90, it has a lot to teach ... Do not expect such revolutions from this new FX Interactive title: Imperium Civitas 2 (IC2, for brevity, which otherwise we will consume all the characters available ) is nothing more than yet another evergreen and rewarding real-time strategy game in which, willy-nilly, the player will be called upon to administer his city, making sure to fulfill all the ungrateful tasks that belonged to a Roman governor. Sounds recycled? It is, however IC2 avoids boredom, managing to capture us with its many merits and skilfully masking some small defects: if in fact the gameplay looks like the usual heated soup, made up of resource collection, building constructions and attempts aimed at satisfying the needs of our population, the real strength lies in a nice combination of the most successful elements of the best RTS.", "date": "2008-01-31", "grade": null}
