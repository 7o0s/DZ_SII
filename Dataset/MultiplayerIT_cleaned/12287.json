Firstly, because it introduced the Rumble Pack for vibration, to be connected to the N64 controller. Second, because it introduced massive amounts of speech into the game, despite the memory limitations of the cartridge. But, above all, because it eliminated all the defects of its SuperNES predecessor, a game evidently penalized by strong limitations of the hardware that hosted it. Freed from the constraints of a console like the SuperNES, designed to process games in bitmap graphics and unable to provide sufficient fluidity to the frenetic concept behind the first title, the programmers have exploited the sixty-four bits finally available to them to do justice to the original idea . Finally the Arwings, instead of dragging themselves heavily, rotated like butterflies, braked and accelerated which changed the pace of the game, loaded the power lasers which would hit multiple enemies in combos while, without striking a blow on the Mhz, the screen was filled with clouds of enemies reflected on the waters of Corneria or dancing in the orbiting spaces, and the lights and explosions built a game universe in which, metaphorically speaking, each level was a separate planet, with occupants, a light, a life of its own. Under the hands of the owners of the game, embedded in the controller, growled the Rumbe Pack, the first systematic application of vibrato on a home console, included in the game package at the time. What was it yesterday The Lylat Wars universe was made up of a great variety of planets, orbital bands, hidden dimensions, lookout space stations, with crossroads to be taken on the game map but for which the progress during the game on the planets proved to be binding. Thus, it became a fabric of playful and narrative possibilities available to the completionist, eager to unlock secret sectors and gates, build ever better percentages, reach the actual ending and, above all, hover like a pro with the Arwing, alternating lasers with repetition of surgical blows, skilfully launching smart bombs, spinning between arches and obstacles expertly built to make the difference between those who lived in Lylat and those who had happened there. What is it today The Star Fox / Lylat Wars saga has been enriched with new episodes, but this one continues to exert the greatest fascination on players and comes with a greater simplicity and solidity of design, which make obsolescence fall into the background compared to current productions . Aesthetically, Lylat Wars is still a good show: the low amount of polygons, at the basis of the extreme fluidity of the title, does not affect the beauty of the spaces, the attention to certain details and, above all, the strong point of a masterful use of light effects, shadows and glows that are always different. And even if the characters are extremely childish and often a little too humorous, and if the dialogues remain at an extreme level of stylization, the general register of the narrated events is strangely serious and creates a strong overall contrast. The way in which enemies die aboard planes, in which they threaten to kill Fox just like their father, or in which our allies ask us for help do not just stud, delimit and ~narrate~ the levels as we play them, but they create an estrangement from character design. Soon, the element of forced cuteness is suppressed and the direction nonetheless projects us into a mythical dimension, particularly strengthened by the excellent musical score, capable of accompanying and often supporting the eminently lyrical and cinematographic vocation of the game. From lightning-fast stunts amid deadly obstacles to massive end-of-level boss encounters, Lylat Wars rarely experiences a lull. What is it today But this successful aesthetic, narrated while playing and distributed over a rich constellation of levels, would not work if it were not based on a solid game concept dominated by rhythm. In the sections with forced advancement, the sense of incumbency of the levels, of the enemies, dominates, and the game world is an almost racing game layout, in which you brake to save yourself, accelerate to succeed, and to make the most of it with the combo technique at the same time. I shoot. In the free-roaming ones dominate the acrobatics, the pursuit on a quadrangular sector, the attack technique, while in the ones in the road the driving of the crawler, reinforced by the sound effects, glues us heavily to the ground, to observe the enemies looming from above. It is this sense of involvement that makes Lylat Wars a winning game, very little aged even despite theits sequels, easy to start and challenging to master at best, strongly recommended also for the fun multiplayer battle mode for up to four players. Lylat Wars  or Star Fox, as we would like to call it with its original title, modified for the European market only due to a coincidence of registered trademarks  is quite possibly the best ship shooter in the now buried 64Bit Nintendo soft library . Despite a presentation occupied by a very childish character design and the level of difficulty initially very lenient with the player, Lylat Wars is a deep shooter, quite complex, challenging if approached with a completionist mentality. Equipped with a great luministic atmosphere, enriched by an engaging narrative and dialogue setting and planted on an extremely solid game mechanic, Lylat Wars is still perfectly able to excite the youngest, satisfy fans and tease even the most hardcore players.", "date": "2007-05-14", "grade": null}
