{"name": "Real Football: Manager Edition 2009", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/real-football-manager-edition-2009_a.html", "text": "It was difficult to imagine a rosy future for mobile management, since it is a very different type of product from the arcades that are usually played on Java-compatible devices. Yet, within a few months, the situation has completely changed, with some manufacturers taking the field to openly challenge each other in terms of features, licenses, AI quality and thickness. Gameloft, for its part, had taken a first step with Real Football: Manager Edition, just a year ago: starting from the popularity of the Real Football football series, it had created a title that put us in the shoes of a coach committed to achieving the goals season with your team. Unfortunately the game appeared too poor technically and was limited in structure, placing itself as a second choice in its vein of belonging. Now things have changed, Gameloft has learned from its mistakes and made a bang for the 2009 edition. From the start screen you can choose whether to start from scratch with a modest team and work your way up to get an increasingly prestigious engagement, or select the team you prefer right away, choosing it from the hundreds available. Depending on the team, our president will set objectives to be achieved by the end of the season: if you choose a club with little means, it is clear that we will be asked to stay in the current category at most; otherwise, we will have to aim for the Scudetto, the Champions League and, in general, to annihilate any opponent. The interface has been optimized compared to the first edition of Real Football: Manager Edition, it appears more readable and various ~places~ can be accessed either by moving the pointer on the screen using the d-pad, or by ~clicking~ on a menu in bottom left, like that of any operating system. We will have the various aspects of our life as a coach distributed within a series of ~buildings~, and we will be able to really control everything: in addition to classic operations such as team organization, training, positions on the pitch, strategy, etc. ., we will have the opportunity to talk to individual players to motivate them, decide on training sessions and perhaps hire specific trainers, as well as negotiate any transfers and purchases. All these things must be carried out during the week, a week which then culminates in the match and where we will see, in practice, the results of our commitment. In the first edition of the game it was possible to watch the match only through a very schematic representation and very little fun to watch, while now you can choose between three types of display: a simple diagram that shows us the progress of the match, a view of the field with the players as dots or a solution worthy of the best football on mobile, with graphics reminiscent of the first FIFA Soccer, with an isometric view and sprites that are excellent in both design and animation. In any case, we will be able to speed up the passage of time up to sixteen times and enjoy the replays of the goals, as well as making any type of choice in real time (tactical change, substitution, etc.). The graphics are really well done and are at the top of the genre, while unfortunately the sound is decidedly subdued. PRO Technically excellent Thick gameplay Equipped with exceptional numbers AGAINST A bit simplistic in some things Mediocre sound", "date": "2008-09-29", "grade": "S.V."}
