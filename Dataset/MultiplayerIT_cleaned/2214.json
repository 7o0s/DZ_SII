{"name": "Fuzion Frenzy-PAL-", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fuzion-frenzy-pal-.html", "text": "Registrations are open! The game is set in a fairly distant future in which one of the most widespread forms of entertainment is a tournament, the Fusion Frenzy, which pits four participants, of both sexes, in a series of very high-risk trials. Registration for the tournament is always open, all you have to do is find 3 more friends, wear the suit of your favorite color and take the field for what could be the most eventful experience of your life. Forty-five mini-games are the calling card of a game that, at least on paper, seems to be able to offer endless fun. There are two game modes available: tournament and mini-games. I have already told you about the first one previously and honestly it didn't seem particularly exciting to me both because the choice of tests to be carried out is automatic and because it does not allow you to unlock any extra mini-games. The mini-games option, on the other hand, offers greater freedom by making all forty-five trials immediately available, which we can choose as we please. This is the recommended solution as it allows you to remedy, at least in part, the major flaw of Fuzion Frenzy. I am referring to the fluctuating quality of the mini-games which are not always sufficiently exciting and amusing. Let's all roll together The variety of tests is not particularly appreciable even if the imagination is certainly not lacking in the programmers of Blitz Games. Many games are clearly inspired by the television program American's Gladiators, which also aired in Italy during the early 90s, such as the battles between the imposing human marbles. Giant steel balls, which contain the participants, roll on platforms suspended in the air trying to make the enemy balls fall, or they challenge each other on the winding curves of a track that seems made especially for sliding marbles. Other games see giant insects as protagonists that we will have to eliminate with a giant club, thus accumulating the greatest number of points, or that instead we will have to chase by painting them our color with a spray can. Then there are the wars between tanks and spaceships or the challenges between motorized donuts. There really is something for all tastes... One of Fuzion Frenzy's greatest strengths is the immediacy that comes from the simplicity of the game and control which in most cases only uses 2 buttons. The decision to make the game accessible, immediately, even to those who have never held the XBox pad is particularly happy. Millions of polygons, high resolution textures, special effects.... From a technical point of view, Fuzion Frenzy concedes little to the show. It's not from a game like this that we should expect millions of polygons, high resolution textures and special effects, and in fact the quality of the images that appear on the screen is certainly not comparable to what is seen in other XBox games but it doesn't matter. The graphics are still very clean, albeit simple, and runs with a fluidity that does not admit criticism. Similarly, the sound does its job well while not excelling. The music, to tell the truth, goes almost unnoticed and I think this is due to their lack of originality. The party is over... Fuzion Frenzy is undoubtedly a good game even if it fails to accelerate in any particular category. However, the purchase is worth it, especially if you have three other joypads and as many friends willing to challenge you. In the future, the Microsoft console will certainly be able to host titles of a much higher quality but, at least for the moment, Fuzion Frenzy represents the definitive solution in case you want to organize a ~party-game~ at your home. Pros: Simple and immediate Guaranteed fun 45 mini-games... Cons: ...the good ones are less Tournament mode of little interest Materials: Tips For each console its own party game A genre that has always garnered much acclaim is certainly that of party games or games that allow at least four people to challenge each other at the same time. I remember with pleasure the evenings spent in the company of friends and the PlayStation with its Crash Team Racing and Crash Bash, still capable of giving hours and hours of carefree fun thanks to their immediacy and simplicity. Just like the PlayStation with Crash, Nintendo's consoles also have their own party games dedicated to Mario and even the XBox seems to want to respect the tradition by giving us Fuzion Frenzy, which arrived just in time for the console's European launch. Will the NoNew game from Blitz Games to still gather us and our friends around a TV? The answer can only be yes even if Fuzion Frenzy does not reach the levels of excellence of other productions.", "date": "2002-03-13", "grade": null}
