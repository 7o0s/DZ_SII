Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to shell out even a penny. In the puzzle game genre it is hard to make something original, and so today as today the various developers refer to classics such as Tetris, Columns or the more recent Puzzle Bobble, churning out more clones or less successful and more or less fun. Matching With Friends, for example, is the typical puzzler with colored blocks to match, enriched however by the presence of a board equipped with score multipliers, as in Scrabble. Our goal, in the game, is to use the blocks that are provided to us from time to time, made up of three squares that can bear as many shades, trying to position the same colors adjacently in order to eliminate them. Depending on the box, as mentioned, elimination can double the score produced or even triple it. Everything works simply via the touch screen: we touch the blocks in the lower part of the screen and drag them onto the board, where we can move them as we like and rotate them to match the parts that interest us most in terms of color. When we have completed the arrangement, we can press the ~play~ button at the bottom right and see the outcome of the various maneuvers. An outcome that will not produce any surprises, given that Matching With Friends will make us understand at any time, through a numerical indicator, the score we can obtain by making a given move, so that it can be changed in the run or modified to make the most of what we have. It's your turn! Well, take these simple and immediate mechanics, the colored blocks and the effective touch control system, and place them in the perspective of an asynchronous online multiplayer, i.e. with the two players who can take turns and therefore dedicate themselves to the game immediately or in spare time, thanks to push notifications that warn them of what the opponent has just done. We saw the advantages and possible disadvantages of such an approach some time ago with the excellent Angry Words (here is our review, in case you don't know it), which then offers an identical structure to Words With Friends, to stay in the Zynga house . Well, the system is the same and allows us to challenge friends on Facebook, find a random opponent, search for a friend by entering his nickname or fish from the contact list. It is possible to start an almost infinite number of games and to conduct them simultaneously, even exchanging a few words with our antagonist thanks to the presence of text chat, a factor that boasts interesting social implications. The match ends when the available blocks are exhausted, proclaiming the winner who has scored the most points. The presence of a relatively limited number of pieces translates into an average duration of the games significantly lower than the aforementioned Angry Words, which is certainly a good thing, but at the same time the thickness of the gameplay is in turn lower: putting together pieces colors is not like composing words. In any case, the game looks very good, thanks to the colorful and always ~readable~ graphics. Too bad for the sound, almost completely absent.", "date": "2012-07-07", "grade": "8.0"}
