{"name": "Monster Hunter", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/monster-hunter-2.html", "text": "An ancient monster If it is true that the first impression is what counts, Monster Hunter does everything to appear dated from the very first bars, thanks to a very poor quality CG introductory movie and an absolutely creepy menu design. After having spread a pitiful veil over the presentation, as usual we move towards the character creation screen, all in all rather conventional: there are no classes to choose from, but it is only possible to adapt the protagonist's look to your needs by setting a not very high set of parameters. After completing these formalities, you are directly catapulted into the game universe, starting with a village where you can shop and face the first training missions. Whether these or other more advanced ones, the gist remains substantially the same, with the user being asked to collect a certain number of objects or to eliminate one or more specific monsters. Once a mission has been accepted, you pass (after a far from instantaneous loading) to the real game scenario, made up of areas that are not too large connected to each other by passages that require countless waiting times. Even passing over this questionable programming aspect, the settings leave a bitter taste in the mouth, either for a decidedly unspectacular graphic rendering, or in any case for the rather flat and banal structure of the locations themselves. In any case, as the title of the game suggests, the queen activity of Monster Hunter is the hunt for a whole series of animals inspired by the collective imagination of dinosaurs and dragons, all of considerable size and which in some cases reach mammoth proportions . The undoubted charm of the basic idea, however, soon leaves room for a disappointment due to an obsolete gameplay and a control system that raises serious doubts. Two aspects in particular sink this element of the Capcom production, namely the choices to entrust the management of the attacks to the right analog stick and that of the -very bad- camera to the D-Pad: in the first case it is immediately noticeable how the blows are not very reactive and precise , while in the second one realizes the absolute impracticability of moving and repositioning the unstable view at the same time, to avoid having two left thumbs. The hard life of the hunter A basic inconvenience, the one found in the Monster Hunter control system, which joins a whole series of other problems: from the poor effectiveness of the parry (the activation of which requires the simultaneous absence of any other type of movement), to the absence of a lock-on system, to the general woodiness of the actions performed by the protagonist, up to the -again- horrible design of the on-screen menus. A situation that becomes even less rosy if we consider how Monster Hunter's gameplay adheres to outdated dictates, generated by the evident and unfortunately fallacious inspiration of the Capcom developers at PSO. As mentioned, the game finds the user engaged in solving rather basic quests, which quickly become repetitive: you accept the tasks in the village, go to the indicated scenario and start killing monsters until you reach the required objectives. All interspersed exclusively by some mini-games (such as the sections dedicated to cooking and fishing) and above all by the shopping activity, which given the very large amount of different weapons and armor present in the game, proves to be one of the few really successful things of Capcom production. But despite this, when you find yourself with a combat system far from the key concepts of dynamism and fun, the final result can only be a little exciting. The situation improves somewhat in optical multiplayer, with up to four users who can cooperate online to complete the various quests. Even here, however, Monster Hunter proves not to be in step with the times at all. In addition to the lack of headset support for voice communication, the Capcom product has several gaps in the organization of the network structure, mainly due to the tedious and unnecessarily long steps necessary to actually join a gaming group. Even from a graphic point of view, it certainly cannot be said that Monster Hunter is properly an avant-garde title. The scenarios offer just discreet glances, and prove to be substantially uninspired as well as covered with poorly defined textures. The polygonal models of the characters do not shine for the amount of detail and quality of the animations, while the considerable personalization potential is certainly to be commendedggio through the purchase of weapons and armor. On the other hand, the design of the monsters is convincing, which also move on the screen in a decidedly natural way. Despite this, in general Monster Hunter in motion is decidedly far from what one would expect from a product of the current generation. The roundup closes with a rather bland sound sector, which for this very reason is paradoxically themed with the entire Capcom production. Comment Obsolete. This is the first adjective that spontaneously associates with Monster Hunter, a title which, in addition to arriving with a very considerable delay compared to the original Japanese release, highlights a visible underlying backwardness compared to current standards. Characterized by a very unimpressive graphic sector, an absolutely uncomfortable control system and a gameplay without treble, Monster Hunter is an action-rpg that struggles to excite in single and that limps in multiplayer, also thanks to a very questionable implementation of the lobbies online. What is certain is that the lack of such titles on PS2 could also justify the purchase of a product like this which, all in all, can be played both on and off the net. Even if the final impression with Monster Hunter truly remains that of going back more than a few years in videogame history. Pros: Interesting settings and design Usable both on and offline Cons: Inconvenient control system Old and repetitive game system Several technical and structural gaps Released in 2001, Phantasy Star Online was certainly one of the most titled and revolutionary products of the ever too praised Dreamcast soft library. A true pioneer of online gaming on consoles, Sonic Team's rpg did an excellent job at the time in offering simple but engaging gameplay supported by a decidedly functional and complete online structure. Of course, seeing it now after more than four years, the good PSO can only appear dated, if not even primitive in certain aspects: but this is obviously not the opinion of Capcom, which with Monster Hunter has well thought of packaging a game on the along the lines of the Sega product, with far from exciting results...", "date": "2005-06-29", "grade": null}
