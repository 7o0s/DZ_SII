{"name": "Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo Revival", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/super-street-fighter-2-turbo-revival.html", "text": "15 years ago... All those moves, combined with the first ~quarter moons~ of the video game which were used to obtain fireballs (later identified with the Hadouken), roundhouse kicks and mammoth uppercuts then made the history of Capcom, the nineties in primis! ....10 years ago..... Five years later, however, the real revolution begins: Street Fighter 2 World Warrior maximizes the game concept seen in the prequel based on the Capcom System 1 motherboard, adding exceptional graphics for the times, with a very high number of animation frames, wonderful music still whistled today by fanatics and non-fanatics, but above all a terrific playability, thanks to the extreme technicality of the fights and very varied characters (8 characters with dozens of moves each, a couple of special moves per skull and 4 very aggressive bosses to beating). ....10 years ago..... The craze for one-on-one fighting games had now begun, brilliantly ridden by Capcom itself and with the exception of Snk (recently bankrupt, sigh Ed), which created exceptional rivals for its favorite saga (The King Of Fighters, Samurai Spirit, Last Blade), other minor software houses such as Data East (Fighter's History) have only collected the crumbs. However, Street Fighter 2 wasn't perfect and Capcom noticed it, improving its little gem annually, starting with the revision called Champion Edition (which made the 4 bosses playable and changed the color palette of the 12 backdrops), passing through the Hyper Fighting version or Turbo (increased speed and various new moves such as the fireball for Chun Li) and coming to Super Street Fighter 2: The New Challengers which brought 4 brand new characters (including Deejay and Cammy), remastered sound, change of digitized voices and Ken Masters' famous Burning Shoryuken. However, the competition from Snk was making itself felt too much (Fatal Fury Special and the progenitor of the famous saga of Samurai Spirits above all) and with Super Street Fighter 2 X: Grand Master Challenge (from us Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo), the updates to the second episode of the Ryu and Ken saga, giving the gaming universe a masterpiece that is still very popular today: the line up of 16 characters seen with the previous update (talking about prequels seems excessive to me! Ed), is enriched by the very strong final boss Gouki / Akuma , the much-loved super moves that Snk has successfully introduced finally peep out and the abilities of the characters, with more or less slight changes, are filed to balance everything. ....and finally the present! The game that we are going to test now is the conversion of that masterpiece already seen on 3do, Pc (Dos only), Saturn and Playstation and waiting for Street Fighter Zero/Alpha 3, The King Of Fighters Ex and Guilty Gear X to come out. Ubisoft distributes for our beloved Game Boy Advance the Pal version of the last chapter of Street Fighter 2, Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo, enriched by the unequivocal term ~Revival~! Technically scares (positively!) Those who thought they were in a cosmetics slightly superior to the various The King Of Fighters already seen for Neo Geo Pocket (monochrome or color) or the pitiful Street Fighter 2 for Game Boy, get ready for a shock: in 64 megabits of (tiny ) cartridge, the Osaka software house par excellence (since Snk is no longer with us) has included all the characters, moves, backgrounds, music and sound effects with which we have had to deal countless times! Technically scares (positively!) Graphically, at first glance the sprites and backdrops are absolutely identical to the original coin-op but after a while you notice that some animation frames have been lost, don't worry though, if you are not aficionados at the extreme levels of yours truly you probably won't even notice it (let's say that the conversion is on the same level as that of Final Fight, therefore excellent all the same): big and well animated, the 16 characters (by default, plus Gouki/Akuma) keep their charm unchanged over the years confirming how Ryu, Ken, Guile, Chun Li, Blanka and company have now entered the Olympus of videogame heroes by right. Now let's analyze the depths: here too, at first glance it seems to be dealing with the coin-operated version that drained us of the best pocket money of our lives, but the water in the tank in the Honda level, absent as in the releases for Megadrive and Snes still avoid the arcade perfect and, again, only a maniac like Latin Lover could pinpoint such a slight shortcoming but I know that many hardcore gamers eagerly awaited this review so... super critical eyes everywhere; however, it is precisely the depths that revealthe first very welcome surprise: some of these have been completely redone and if Chun Li's level is the one already seen and appreciated in Street Fighter Zero/Alpha 2 (with some slight tweaks), Guile, Ryu, Ken and M. Bison (in the Japanese release Vega) each had a brand new backdrop: noteworthy that of Guile complete with a fighter hovering in flight in the backdrop and that of Ryu Hoshi, in perfect harmony with tradition (on the roof of a dojo, in the moonlight). Technically scares (positively!) To act as the icing on the cake on the graphic side, we have 2 new special effects, the first which occurs as soon as you are performing a super move (you see a large X that obscures almost the entire game screen) and the other when you use this stroke to definitively lay down the opponent (the animation of this tremendous explosion is really beautiful, even better than the coin-op!). Particular attention, always within the limits of the Game Boy Advance, has been paid to the sound side: after all, there are many Street Fighter fans who own the original soundtrack and dozens of remixes on cassette and CD and luckily Capcom has not disappointed here either: provided you use earphones to play (as Nintendo recommends), you can enjoy the beautiful music reproduced there in a slightly rearranged form with a clever use of musical instruments, the digitized speech entirely reproposed (not at the quality levels of that of the Super Famicom but eons ahead of that of the Megadrive, just awful) and the well-known sound effects. The coin-op in your pocket basically but... how do you play it on the Nintendo laptop? Playability and longevity How do you say? We have to describe the game structure to you because you don't know this wonderful saga? Very easy: choose a fighter, defeat the various opponents in one-on-one fights based on kicks, punches, throws, fireballs, extendable limbs at will, electric shocks and much more. Playability and longevity Aficionados of the saga know perfectly well that Street Fighter 2 is played (at the highest levels) with 6 buttons, 3 for punches and 3 for kicks. So how to play with the Nintendo portable 32-bit pad? Capcom has included various setup methodologies for the function keys such as the different pressure on a single key: assign the punch to ~B~ and the kick to ~A~ and depending on how you press the key, you will have a light, strong punch (or kick) or medium. Otherwise put a different function for each of the 4 keys used to play leaving the remaining 2 types of attack to the simultaneous pressure of 2 keys at the same time. Last alternative: use 4 keys and goodnight, as I chose (omitting punch and medium kick). Playability and longevity Certainly Capcom deserves praise, as they have included so many different choices for us to enjoy this formidable conversion as much as possible and for sure everyone will find the most congenial configuration for them. What is really sad at the beginning, however, is the console's directional cross: for someone like me who has played with all types of joypads, sticks that they are, having difficulty making a normal Hadou Ken is really a very bad experience, luckily solvable with practice: when you have solved the game the first time, you will already notice that you will be able to perform combos and special moves with great ease, in 1 day therefore you will have found the ancient form. As with Final Fight One, there are many extras such as new game modes, normal Gouki and usable Shin, and more. To unlock this good thing, you'll have to accumulate battle points, taking down enemies as quickly and spectacularly as possible. Dulcis in fundo, if you have a friend who owns a Game Boy Advance like you and loves fighting games, recommend him SSF2TR and divide and spend on a nice link cable since playing in 2, the enormous longevity of the game becomes almost eternal! Conclusions Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo Revival is an outstanding conversion (97% identical, at a rough guess) of the wonderful coin-op and we advise all fighting game fans to buy it immediately, play it and replay it ad nauseam (preferably with a friend) up to the next exponents of the genre, all of the highest level: Street Fighter Alpha 3, The King Of Fighters Ex and Guilty Gear X. Meanwhile.....Shiiiinkuuu Hadoooou kennn!! Conclusions Pros: Conversion almost indistinguishable from the coin-op very fun as always Cons: at the beginning it's hard to play at high levels with the console pad 2 cartridges required for the game in pairs a few missing frames 15 years ago... 15 very long years have passed since the day when CAPtive COMmunication, software house di Osaka, already very well known (Bionic Commando and Ghost'n' Goblins were super popular at the time), introduced Street Fighter, a one-on-one fighting game of undoubted value, onto the market. A fighting game with such sumptuous graphics, really accurate animations and, above all, so many moves had never been seen; the original cabinets were equipped, depending on the model, with a joystick and 6 buttons or with the controller par excellence of the arcades combined with 2 huge rubber buttons which, in exchange for more or less strong pressures, returned punches and kicks of 3 different levels of heaviness", "date": "2001-12-07", "grade": null}
