{"name": "Gamedec", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gamedec-recensione.html", "text": "The twenty-second century imagined by the multifaceted Marcin Przybytek in the Gamedec series (namesake of the video game we are going to inspect in the review) is anything but rosy. In Warsaw, people can no longer move away from the inhabited center, because nature has taken over and venturing outside the walls would mean facing mortal dangers. Thus, to escape the daily routine, citizens take refuge in Virtualia, virtual worlds in which to experience all kinds of situations that can be reached by putting on a helmet, just like the one in Sword Art Online. It is a highly advanced software which, however, has not managed to eliminate the atavistic scourge of cheaters: figures have been created to stem this phenomenon, precisely the Gamedecs. These are investigators who try to unmask the less correct players and to save those who are in danger: some experiences lived in the virtual world can also have repercussions in the real one, with harmful consequences. In the title of Anshar Studios they play the role of one of these champions of legality, on whose desk only apparently unrelated cases end up. Let's find out how in the Gamedec review. A clone of Disco Elysium? A smoky local Gamedec Set in a dystopian future, Gamedec is a narrative RPG. If we wanted to liquidate it in four words, we could say that it is a clone of Disco Elysium, the acclaimed RPG of 2019. As in the title of ZA / UM, in fact, investigations are conducted through dialogues. Similarly there are no fights. Finally, the skill tree branches into four professions. Of course there are also differences: above all the absence of dice and the lack of an inventory. Character creation is limited to choosing gender and physical appearance from a somewhat skimpy list of avatars; then it remains to determine their social extraction. There are no classes and, indeed, the term ~profession~ that we mentioned above and which is used to indicate skills, is misleading. It would be more correct to talk about personality traits that unlock certain options during conversations. Deciding to be an internet celebrity, for example, allows you to get into the good graces of some characters and therefore to obtain some otherwise inaccessible information. The reverse of the coin is that it will not be possible to get in touch with drug dealers, for example, because the path of the survivor, which allows you to have links with the underworld, has been rejected. Some choices preclude others and can blow up entire ~blocks~ of Virtualia: this setting rewards the replayability factor. Simply completing a single game, which takes about ten hours, would not do justice to the efforts made by Anshar who has prepared six different endings. How do I evolve? A glimpse of Warsaw from the windows of Gamedec's apartment One of Gamedec's biggest problems is with character progression. There are no real secondary quests (and consequently the diary that contains them), at most there are requests from some NPCs that can be ignored and which in any case can be completed in a few minutes. There isn't even any party: in some situations the detective can be accompanied by an assistant, but within a few minutes he will find himself alone again. Experience points accumulate according to the investigator's attitude: for example, maintaining a firm approach in interrogation with a hacker should reward charisma, but it is not at all clear how and when this happens. Often, in fact, you end up selecting as many questions as possible so as not to lose any clues, unaware of the fact that certain dialogue options could affect one of the four personality traits of the avatar. At the same time the action is continuously fragmented by the presence of situations in which some information is taken for granted. In order to continue with knowledge of the facts, one finds himself frequently consulting the Codex, a sort of encyclopedia that is enriched as one progresses in the game. Even omitting this aspect, the rhythms remain slow, in some cases in a completely gratuitous way. Once we get to the first ending, it will be discovered that most of the lines of dialogue are accessory and only serve to enrich the narrative universe. Visually pleasing, lacks some variety A sequence from the level set in feudal Japan From the point of view of the game structure, Gamedec presents itself with the classic isometric view at Baldur's Gate. The camera is fixed and it is not even possible to adjust the zoom level: aa limitation that does not weigh excessively in relation to the fact that the levels are small in size and the sensitive points positioned in easy to reach places. The action is basic: if you eliminate interactions with NPCs and with some objects, there's nothing else left to do. What little there is, however, works well: the characters are very well characterized, even if they sometimes fall into some inevitable clichs, and the level of writing is above average in both quality and quantity. Those who don't know English perfectly could use a translator to decipher some idiomatic expressions. This is a stumbling block that could discourage some buyers in our country, given that there is no translation into Italian and the amount of text is considerable. The graphics, entrusted to the care of Unreal Engine 4, are of excellent workmanship. The setting and atmospheres respect the stylistic features of sci-fi literature starting from Blade Runner, passing through Deus Ex up to the Matrix. Some locations are particularly successful, such as that of the detective's apartment which offers a new point of view on contemporary Warsaw. Others, on the other hand, are more canonical, such as the night club and the rainy slums. There are also some exotic digressions allowed by virtual reality, such as the village of the Far West or that of feudal Japan. Overall, however, Gamedec certainly does not shine for the number of scenarios (we counted about ten). From a technical point of view, the presence of AMD's FSR deserves a mention, an option that will delight owners of less powerful video cards. but that doesn't have much impact on high-end configurations that can handle the title with ease. The soundtrack is just ok, while the dubbing is completely missing: it would have been appropriate to include it at least in the key passages, as in the old Interplay titles.", "date": "2021-09-20", "grade": "6.7"}
