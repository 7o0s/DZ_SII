{"name": "Yoshi Touch & Go", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/yoshi-touch-go_a.html", "text": "Go your own way Following the criteria of formal simplicity dictated by Nintendo's policy to the letter, Yoshi Touch & Go presents an elementary and immediately assimilable game mechanic. Nib in hand, the user has the task of guiding the path of Baby Mario first and then of Yoshi by tracing trajectories, bridges and walkways on the touchscreen represented by delightful little clouds. Each of the four available modes opens with the super-baby falling from the sky, visible on the upper screen of the console: the baby is held up by three balloons useful to sweeten its descent and ready to explode in case of contact with enemies, thus decreeing a premature game over. Precisely for this reason, the player must have a good game in tracing a series of lines on the touchscreen capable of directing Baby Mario along a path free of dangers, with an eye for the collection of coins floating in the sky, whose number he is later able to decree the maximum amount of eggs that Yoshi can carry. That's not all: with the exception of a particular category of opponents (the hateful spheres covered with thorns) just draw a circle around an enemy to create a bubble capable of transforming the wobbler into a coin, which can then be thrown at Baby Mario's address with a quick flick of the nib. After the descent, the infant ends up on the back of Yoshi, who begins to trot towards the right side of the screen. As it is legitimate to understand, also in this case the user does not exercise direct control over the dinosaur, but must continue in his work of building paths based on clouds and surrounding the enemies. However, the interaction possibilities offered to the player enjoy a greater extension in this part of the game: and therefore, touching Yoshi with the stylus allows him to jump, while aiming at any other area of the touchscreen causes the dinosaur to throw an egg with surgical precision. Even the Nintendo DS microphone finds its use, transforming the player's breath into an input capable of sweeping away all the clouds on the screen. Basically, this is Yoshi Touch & Go: an original, fun and immediate title, which takes full advantage of the Nintendo DS touchscreen. But the good game does not last long. Very little. One for two Yoshi Touch & Go presents a Vs. mode for two players that is very interesting not so much for specific playful peculiarities (it is a simple race to see who can take their dinosaur the furthest), but rather for the fact that a single game is enough Card to be able to challenge a friend armed with DS. An excellent example of the wireless potential of the Nintendo console, which it is desirable to see applied more and more often in the future. Free fall In fact, Yoshi Touch & Go soon ends up betraying its origins as a tech demo (the concept was originally used as a simple demonstration of the potential of the Nintendo DS), showing an extremely thin game structure and susceptible to various criticisms. The available modes (Score Attack, Marathon, Time Attack and Challenge) are all more or less similar to each other and all characterized by a questionable choice of gameplay, i.e. that of not offering a series of levels but of proposing a playful formula ~for to the bitter end: it goes on until Yoshi falls or isn't hit by an enemy, with the only  not exactly stimulating  end being to set a new record. In this sense, a level structure would certainly have benefited the overall gaming experience, being able to guarantee the user greater incentives to face the dinosaur's adventure: as it is, however, Yoshi Touch & Go is a product that is so fun, but which tends to prematurely lose its appeal. In short, finding yourself having to repeat the same sections of the game exclusively in the name of the score as an end in itself literally destroys the potential longevity of Yoshi Touch & Go. And this is certainly a pity, considering the good game mechanics expressed by the Nintendo product, which would have certainly deserved a greater appreciation. Perhaps an excessively idle attitude, that of the developers, which is also reflected in the technical realization of the game, good but in no way capable of fully exploiting the potential of Nintendo DS. The graphic style broadly follows that of Yoshi's Island, unfortunately revealing itself to be much less incisive and characteristic: the backdrops lack particular personality, while the quality of the animations of Yoshi, Baby Mario and the various enemies settles on more than positive levels. From the sound point of view, discrete effects are recorded (although largely recycled and therefore not particularlyimpact) and an absolutely up to date musical accompaniment, with simple but very catchy motifs. Comment Yoshi Touch & Go is certainly an original and fun product, whose good playful premises unfortunately find little support in an excessively thin game structure. Tracing clouds with the stylus in order to help Yoshi and Baby Mario on their way is therefore a game experience that is so fresh and initially very stimulating, but which tends to become repetitive too soon due to the lack of adequately varied game modes. In short, Yoshi Touch & Go turns out to be more of an ~elongated~ minigame than a real playful product, and this definitely cannot be defined as a merit. Pros: Original and stimulating concept Technically sound Good use of the touchscreen Cons: Gameplay not very varied Inadequate game modes Gets repetitive quickly After grabbing the lead role in Super Mario 64 DS, Yoshi makes his return to the new Nintendo handheld in a sort of spin-off of the wonderful Yoshi's Island: Baby Mario on his back and eggs in tow, the most famous dinosaur in the gaming industry it's time to nurse the newborn plumber again, but in a decidedly different way. Indeed, in keeping with the characteristics of the Nintendo DS, in Yoshi Touch & Go, caring for the boy with the red hat now becomes a matter of tact", "date": "2005-04-01", "grade": null}
