Indeed, the Earth seems doomed to destruction when the polar ice melts, causing the tides to rise and submerge the cities. Only a handful of heroes can save all the people in danger and take them to a new home, in this case a planet that we can shape to our liking using various materials, expanding it clod after clod and recovering an ever-increasing number of potential new inhabitants. The goal of the Finnish Grand Cru team is clear: to shake up the genre of casual-based simulations for iOS devices, focusing primarily on the introduction of innovative mechanics, in this specific case puzzle solving linked to constructions; and secondly on a fairly accessible freemium model, which therefore allows you to play for free for a long period of time, without finding particular obstacles that limit the action. We can immediately say that many of these prerogatives have been respected, given that the game starts first of all from a pleasant and successful cartoon characterization, which gives us characters that seem to come out of a CG feature film, and is very gradual in its progression, so to give us time to familiarize ourselves with the resource management system and with the exploration phases. There are also some nice ideas in terms of multiplayer, with cooperative missions and the possibility of visiting and enriching the places created by our friends. Supernauts undoubtedly stands as one of the most interesting casual simulations for iOS devices We invest in real estate The goal in Supernauts is to build a new world for the inhabitants of the Earth, and it will be up to us to decide how to shape it. The first stages of the game act as a tutorial to understand how the planet works, what are the peculiarities of its upgradeable core and what are the various robots that we can buy with virtual currency, gold coins, possibly speeding up their preparation using the currency valuable, diamonds. A continuously fleshed out achievement system avoids any downtime, urging us now to produce certain objects, now to create particular buildings, now to dedicate ourselves to rescuing the inhabitants of the various cities submerged by water. This last aspect of the experience, evidently inspired by Minecraft, contains great potential and is detached from the simulation mechanics that many other mobile games have put in place so far. By controlling our character through a very intuitive touch system, we will in fact have to discover the secrets of various scenarios, find within them the devices we need (the Zappers, ray guns that allow us to collect or project certain materials) and identify people in danger, then open walls or create ladders or bridges that allow him to escape. Each person saved is transported to our planet and there gives life to a further ~constructive~ minigame, which sees us exploit the blocks obtained up to that moment (produced by the various robots) to trace increasingly more complex projects. Precisely in these situations, which constitute the most interesting part of Supernauts, unfortunately there are problems with the interface. The developers have worked wonders to better calibrate the touch controls, allowing us to manage the view in a simple and immediate way, freely rotating the scenarios and zooming in and zooming out, but even so being able to be precise during the construction phases often represents quite a challenge. In short, you end up creating bricks in the wrong place, thus having to ~delete~ them and constantly moving the view to have better access to the affected area. Ultimately, this is the only limit of a product that attempts to introduce innovative elements within a highly inflated trend, dominated by particularly popular franchises.", "date": "2014-06-26", "grade": "8.0"}
