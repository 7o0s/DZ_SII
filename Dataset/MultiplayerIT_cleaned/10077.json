What do all of these Cassette Beasts claims have in common? Well the answer is simple, they are all inaccurate. The game developed by Bytten Studio, which arrived on Nintendo Switch and Xbox at the end of May and is already available on PC Steam and Game Pass PC, is in fact a monster taming video game, but it is not a Pokmon clone, on the contrary it differs from the Pokmon series Nintendo quite markedly. Full of interesting and profound findings as we never expected, we tell you all the details about the game in the Cassette Beasts review. Origin of a genre Cassette Beasts: The style of the creatures is very special The monster taming genre, or that variant of role-playing games in which creatures are captured in order to collect them and use them in battle, was born in the late 80s with the Megami Tensei series. A very dark series, whose mature and often over the top themes made the expansion of the genre beyond the eastern borders difficult. It will take years, in fact, before the series is cleared in the West, mainly thanks to the spin-off person. Instead, the genre to which they belong finds fertile ground on the Game Boy thanks to Pokmon: the sweet and nice creatures invented by Satoshi Tajiri were more ~salable~, they could fascinate even the little ones and above all they were not associated with satanic themes, like the series Megami Tensei. The success of Pokmon is known and the 90s are therefore the cradle of a sub-genre, that of the Pokmon-like, which will guarantee notoriety to the collection of virtual creatures. In the following years Jade Cocoon, Legend of Legaia, but also Yo-Kai Watch , Digimon and finally the most recent Monster Hunter Stories and Temtem. All examples of a varied genre, stratified and truly full of possibilities. Each of its exponents has been able to take inspiration from some key elements of the role-playing experience proposed by the monster taming genre to make it a distinctive brand. In recent years then, the independent scene has been an important alcove for the growth and experimentation of new forms of playful entertainment linked to this type of virtual collecting. Coromon, but above all the focus of this review or Cassette Beasts. Don't call it Pokmon-like Cassette Beasts: many fusion combinations in play As we said at the beginning of the article, the product proposed by Bytten Studio is not a Pokmon-like. In the Game Freak series, the initial premise is that of a world in which humans and creatures coexist and in which the coach is a prince of the social gears of this fantasy universe. Here, in Cassette Beasts, the narrative premise is different. The game sees us take our steps on the island of New Wirral, a strange and eerie place that does not base its foundations on a re-imagining of the Earth. New Wirral is a place that we will discover to be inhospitable and full of dangers in which the social dynamics we know are rewritten and unusual and in which non-human creatures are an obstacle to survival, a danger that must be faced if one wants to save one's skin. Cassette Beasts has a lot to offer in terms of plot and storytelling. The themes addressed are decidedly mature, unexpected and uncommon in a similar game, especially those with a very colorful graphic style. The same idea of transforming into beasts and not capturing them has a whole series of explanations that have little to do with ~cuddness~. From a playful point of view, the game uses a classic turn-based system in which attacks, use of objects, escape and change of transformation. To this is added the registration system (the equivalent of capture to understand each other). As you can guess from the logo and name, in Cassette Beasts, for a reason that will be revealed to you during the adventures, the creatures of New Wirral can be recorded via a ~cassette eater~. The frequencies that characterize each creature can be stored in virgin tapes which will subsequently allow you to transform into the aforementioned creature. To do this however, you will expose yourself (with your personal life bar, which is separate from that of the monster) to the possibility of receiving damage. The registration will be complex and its success will be influenced by various factors such as damage suffered, inflicted, altered status and number of enemies on the battlefield. During the adventure you will meet different companions that you can take with you. Playing alone you can decide the moves of the protagonist and his companion, in local co-op instead, the players will share the use of human characters. Precisely thanks to this choice, ByttenStudio has decided to insert a fusion system that will allow the players' creatures to be united, thus creating new ones. Cassette Beasts: The combat system is a classic turn-based Speaking of numbers, Cassette Beasts offers 120 creatures with a number of possible fusions exceeding 14,000 variables. Merging with companions, fulfilling missions related to them, and continuing the story with them, will affect a friendship system similar to that used in the Persona series. Precisely this is yet another successful element of Cassette Beasts: the main plot and secondary narrative strands are intertwined in a coherent manner with well-characterized bosses and mini-bosses, and with a pace of the story capable of diluting the new information in a satisfactory manner. Exploring the island, punctuated by gaining new map navigation skills, is also enjoyable. Wise the ability to see monsters on the map, so you can look for the rarest variants without having to go crazy. Lots of lights and very few shadows Cassette Beasts: Remember to cultivate friendships with teammates What amazed us was the elemental damage and resistance system. As in any self-respecting role-playing game, creatures have a type of belonging, from the most famous fire and air to the strangest ones such as plastic and glass. The system of elements in Casssette Beast exploits not only the classic table of strengths and weaknesses (water beats fire, etc.), but also a chemistry system that allows you to interact in a more advanced way with the elements. For example, if you hit a fire-type creature with an air element, you will create a malus on the opponent for damage from both physical contact and distance for three turns. This is because air can weaken fire. Conversely, hitting a type of air with a fire element will cause a tornado of fire in front of the enemy that will absorb damage for three turns. It is therefore a very deep system that we did not expect to find and which dramatically increases the possibilities of fun and strategy. Cassette Beasts also surprised us thanks to the possibility of activating alternative game modes such as speedrun or nuzelock (with permanent death) from launch, two elements that can guarantee good replayability. Too bad, however, that there is no online coop, which given the nature of the title and the settings present would certainly have expanded a satisfying playful offer. Cassette Beasts: travel companions will always accompany you The small problems we encountered while reviewing Cassette Beasts mainly concern what is called ~quality of life~: in other words, nothing overwhelming or too hindering, but small problems that can get boring every now and then. The main things are the feeling of the movement, a bit wooden in some sections (especially in the shot), and also the management of the creatures assigned to the companions that must be removed before replacing the travel companion. Even the environmental puzzles present, although not numerous, have not always fully convinced us in terms of intuitiveness or realization.", "date": "2023-05-09", "grade": "8.0"}
