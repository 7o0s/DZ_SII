Describing it in broad terms, we can define it as an action with a bird's eye view that mixes the gameplay of tactical shooters with that of real-time strategy, without missing a splash of role-playing games and roguelikes. The tactical map Clear isn't it? In truth it is much less complex than it seems, given that the action component prevails over the others and determines a large part of the gaming experience. That doesn't mean it lacks depth. Let's say that the Modulaatio Games title is a successful amalgam, one of those that would have collapsed inexorably in the face of the slightest mistake. But let's try to better understand what we're talking about. The story that is the background to the action is really thin. Indeed, more precisely it is almost completely absent, despite the fact that the main menu speaks of ~campaign mode~. The player takes on the role of an anonymous soldier in a vast army who must conquer strategic objectives by stealing them from rival troops. That's all. There are no other narrative implications. With the rifle shouldered, we just have to head towards the first occupied site, following our companions or going alone. Arrived at the place we are killed immediately. The bullet that killed us was a very clear message: this is not an arcade shooter, slow down! After the respawn we return to the charge, but this time with more moderation. We approach the conflict zone cautiously, finding it dotted with corpses. There are also some broken down vehicles, probably hit by an explosive weapon. Well, apparently the war goes on even in our absence. Sighted by the enemies we run behind a large rock that we use as cover. It seems that now we have started to get serious. You call them if you want, covers The pace of Running With Rifles is fast and slow at the same time. The movements between the targets are very fast, since they are positioned at short distances from each other. It is natural that this is the case, since you die often and when it happens you are regenerated in the vicinity of the last objective conquered; you will understand that creating greater distances would soon lead to the tedium of endless races. Leveling up unlocks new weapons The current structure allows instead to return to action in a few seconds. But we had left our soldier behind a rock. Right now he only has an assault rifle and a few grenades. Soon, as he levels up, he will be able to wield even more destructive weapons such as rocket launchers or heavy machine guns. The unlocking of some special attacks such as air rescue is also linked to the growth of the level. They aren't essential but add some spice to the basic formula. Meanwhile we are still stuck. We are indeed behind solid cover, but we cannot move a step otherwise the enemies would riddle us with bullets. What to do? We throw a grenade towards one of the besiegers, hidden behind a low wall, and we go out into the open to eliminate a second soldier, who is lying in front of the rock. The tactic pays off; not only thanks to us but also to the timely intervention of a group of allies who unblocked the situation on the side that we obviously couldn't cover. Continuing the march we arrive at the site to be conquered. How? You know the ~Conquest~ mode of any team-based shooter? Here, you have to fill a bar by staying for a certain time in the capture area. Meanwhile, your adversaries won't be watching, but it's part of the inconvenience of a soldier's life that someone occasionally tries to shoot at you. Running With Rifles is a successful mix of different genres! Roguelike camera Let's step away from the action and go back to examining the most important elements that make up Running With Rifles, talking about map design. The game maps are very large and can also be observed from a comfortable general map, which shows our position and that of the current objective. Vehicles come into play right away Some missions are played at night Although they are fixed in structure, they offer some roguelike elements that allow you to play them many times. For example, the bonus boxes, useful for replenishing supplies, are always positioned in different places, just as the soldiers, friends and enemies, do not follow pre-established orders to reappear in battle, creating a nice chaos. Even the objectives, while fixed, can follow different paths in order to vary the progression of the missions. In short, before exhausting all the possibilities and starting to feel the weight ofrepetitiveness, several good hours will pass. The roguelike elements also play great in multiplayer, competitive or co-op modes. Unfortunately there are also some sore points to underline. Meanwhile, the scenarios, while offering various forms of interaction (ladders to climb, fences to jump, crates to smash and so on), are literally indestructible. Try firing a rocket into a fence and it won't hurt it. Even the apparently most fragile objects are extremely resistant. If something more could have been done for this aspect, more had to be done for that of camera management. In the open field there are no problems, given that the greatest nuisance is represented by the trees. In short, there are easily circumvented obstacles that do not give problems of legibility of the action. In more complex areas, such as cities, this is not the case. Of course, we have not detected dramatic cases, but there have been situations in which our man was covered by a building, an enemy group was in turn covered by a building and it was not clear where to click to move without exposing yourself too much. Fortunately, the developers have realized the problematic nature of the framing and have found various solutions to remedy it, such as the minimalist graphic style, excellent for not increasing confusion, or the intelligent use of the weapon pointer, with the crosshair that changes color if the trajectory to hit the target is clear.", "date": "2015-04-23", "grade": "8.0"}
