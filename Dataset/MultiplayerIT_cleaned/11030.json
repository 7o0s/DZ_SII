{"name": "Dani Sordo Rally", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dani-sordo-rally.html", "text": "Top-down racing games have never been very popular, after all it is an atypical and forcedly arcade interpretation of the genre. We have seen some coin-ops that proposed this solution, characterized above all by the fact of having to turn the steering wheel like a madman for the car to set the curves in the correct way. We have already seen some titles like this on mobile, but for one reason or another they have never been masterpieces, far from it. Now it's LemonQuest to try, taking advantage of the name of Dani Sordo and the official WRC license to make its latest production more captivating. Sordo, for the uninitiated, is a Spanish rally driver who made his debut in the World Rally Championship a few years ago, but who has already achieved respectable results with a fifth, fourth and third place in the final standings of the 2006 seasons , 2007 and 2008. He currently drives for the Citroen Total WRT team. Dani Sordo Rally offers us a single game mode, which consists of playing a career through a certain number of races. As mentioned above, these races must be tackled taking into consideration a timer that is displayed at the top of the screen: at the end of the race, if our time is lower than that of the other competitors, we will finish in first place. From time to time we will be able to select our car from those available, change the tires according to the type of terrain and opt for an arcade or simulation drive: in the first case, the car will have better grip and more predictable behaviour, but the differences are not extremely marked. As far as the control system is concerned, we have to drive in a context relating to the vehicle and not to the screen: after accelerating only initially with the d-pad up, we will be able to control the direction of the car by pressing the d-pad left and right, paying attention to dose the inputs in order not to end up spinning. Like all top-down driving games, this new LemonQuest title requires a certain period of ~study~, which is essential to understand how the car behaves and what differences there are between one model and another. Since these are rally races, our only opponent will be ourselves: driving clean and without collisions will result in a certain victory, while crashing every two by three will make things much more complicated for us. The technical realization is discreet, even if far from spectacular. The cars are large and visible enough to be controlled without too much trouble, but in terms of detail they are not exceptional. The locations, for their part, are well diversified (among forest scenarios, deserts, snowy expanses, etc.), especially from the point of view of colors, and the objects outside the track are quite well designed. Sure, there is zero interactivity with the environment: our car can collide with anything, but without damage or deformation on one side or the other. The sound is essential as usual, while the control system stands out for its simplicity and quick response. PRO Good number of tracks Technically discreet Simple control system... AGAINST ...but far from immediate Limited and lacking depth gameplay Sometimes frustrating", "date": "2008-11-21", "grade": "S.V."}
