Well these things only happen in those few titles that manage to involve. Today, more than two years later, we have the sequel to that lucky title and that we have previewed (the game will have to be released in Italy in a few days) for you. This time Fox Interactive and Sierra didn't rely on Rebellion, as in the first episode, but on Monolith (who made titles like Shogo M.A.D., Claw, Blood and No One Lives Forever) who chose to use the successful Lith Tech Engine as graphics engine. Well concluded the ritual preliminary information and the time has come to descend on a space rock called LV-1201. So fasten your seatbelts because terror is back on our hard drives! Three games in one For those few who don't know, I remember that in AvP2 we have the possibility of impersonating three types of species, each with absolutely unique characteristics. Humans, Aliens and Predators. The Singleplayer game consists of 7 episodes for each race, which in turn are made up of several levels, which ensure a good longevity (for a total of 21 levels). Three games in one The plot takes place on the planet LV-1201 and each episode intertwines with the others to form a varied and complete experience. It must be said that retracing the levels already visited by impersonating another race can also annoy someone, but I consider it a minimal inconvenience, also because we often travel through areas where transit was previously forbidden to us. The main plot is the one concerning the episode of the Marines and it all begins on January 6, 2231 when a new mission is discussed on the USS Verloc, a military vessel. Weyland Yutani Corporation has been out of contact with its research facility for 6 weeks already and they have been tasked with looking into it. The difficulty of the mission also consists in not being able to use heavy weapons due to the importance of the structures and therefore weapons on the shoulder and good luck!! From this starting point and the presence of the Marines on that rock which is LV-1201, all the events centered on Avp2 unfold. The plot doesn't seem original at all, but I assure you that going forward things will improve with different twists. Three games in one From a technical point of view, the game stands at good levels, mainly thanks to the Lith Tech graphics engine which is able to recreate environments, both indoors and outdoors, with extreme ease and with a good abundance of details. Let's understand we are not dealing with anything miraculous, but the task is carried out in a very convincing way. Of course, to get good results you need fast machines, but we've gotten used to this for some time now. The locations obviously recall what has already been proposed in the films and serve to recreate the right atmosphere. It must be said, unfortunately, that as in the previous episode, the maps are excessively linear and the path to follow is absolutely mandatory, taking away that freedom of exploration present in other titles of the genre. The sound sector is free from criticism, both for the wonderful sounds and for the music that comes from the films that inspire the game. Note that when something is about to happen, the music emphasizes it. Very nice, but to some extent it can prove to be a help. Three games in one A special mention goes to the game interface which has the excellent feature of using customized game profiles, very useful when several people alternate on a machine (can you imagine reconfiguring the keys for all three races every time!! ). At this point, all that remains is to see in detail what the three different species offer us. Life as an Alien Believe it or not, in AvsP2 as an Alien, you will be able to live his whole life through his many forms, up to the adult and lethal Drone. It all starts from the initial form of the Facehugger, that delightful crustacean-like animal whose sole purpose in its short life is the implantation of an embryo in a body that serves as an incubator. And our first mission, after having come out of our cocoon, consists precisely in sneaking through ravines and up false ceilings, in an attempt not to be seen and at the same time find an individual suitable for our mission. Vita from Alien Once this first task has been carried out, all we have to do is grow and then come out in the form of Chestbuster. Of course, the birth of a Drone does not take place in the delivery room with all the comforts we humans are used to, but the life of an Alien is by no means easy. Ah a little note on Multiplayer; there is the option to make the Aliens evolve starting from the initial form of Facehugger even during the games. Eh eh, an excellent thought, I must say! The Drone has the characteristic of clinging to walls and running at high speed, and is also equipped with few offensive but extremely lethal weapons. It uses its claws and tail, although it can produce an extremely lethal attack by jumping from a great distance. The Alien's only weakness is its fragility. Life as an Alien So be careful not to carry out attacks in open spaces, because we will give our enemy time to calmly take aim and strike us. Rather, it is much better to sneak as close as possible to our prey and strike, perhaps using the ability to run up walls. I spoke of prey, because the Alien recovers its vital energy by eating the head of its victims. Creepy right? Indeed, if it does so when our victim is still alive, the amount of energy recovered is even greater. From the series: eat it alive which has more protein! To carry out this ~delicious~ operation we can also make use of the tail blow, which unlike the previous episode where it represented an attack blow, serves to stun our target, thus allowing us to take a single bite in complete tranquility. Another characteristic of the Alien is that it immediately recognizes any form of life thanks to the vital aura that it emanates and which will be of different colors depending on the species, red for its own kind, green for Predators and white for its prey you prefer, humans. Life as an Alien In this regard, we must highlight the fact that synthetics (androids that possess human features) are formidable opponents, precisely because they are not very visible and above all they do not constitute a supply of energy (in short, we cannot eat them!). The Aliens are also equipped with an excellent alternative view that allows them to see easily even in the dark. There are three types of adult Aliens and they depend on the species that hosts us, and therefore there are, in addition to the Drones, the Runners and the Predaliens, the first born from quadrupeds, the second from the implant in a Predator. Ah, I almost forgot the Praetorians of the real Super-Alien!! Do you want to enjoy life? Enlist in the Space Marines!! Who knows if Soldier Andrew Harrison, known as ~Frosty~ will think the same way at least after setting foot on planet LV-1201 at the time of the events narrated in AvP2. Here the ~poor~ Marines, instead of having fun, has the opportunity to become a nice hunting trophy for a Predator or a delicious snack for an Alien and I don't think that in both cases he can say he enjoys life! Well, in fact, one can also end up with an alien embryo thrust into the esophagus, but basically this is the lesser evil, at least the fact of having helped a dear pet to grow can console us, even if this ungrateful creature will not call us never dad! The only thing that separates the brave Marines from an adverse fate is his equipment and on this he must rely the utmost. Do you want to enjoy life? Enlist in the Space Marines!! The technological trinkets at our disposal are really many and all very effective or almost. Compared to the adventure lived with the Alien, that of the Marine is more intriguing, either because in the movies you have always been on their side, or because doing things with the Marine is decidedly more difficult, and then you want to put the Bip-Bip of the motion detector when it tracks something? Throughout the levels the password is tension, especially if you play in a dark room with the surround system at ball. Do you want to enjoy life? Enlist in the Space Marines!! Speaking of tension, I can assure you that the first two missions of the Marines are from an anthology of video games, I can't be more precise because I would spoil the surprise, but I assure you that the result is absolutely fantastic, worthy of the best thriller in which and more important what you hear and what you perceive, than what you see. As the story progresses, there will be twists and situations in which it is better to run away than to shoot, as in a beautiful miRecovery mission where we will find ourselves being chased by a horde of Aliens. But even the ~male~ action wants its share and therefore destruction in profusion! In this respect AvP2 has hit its target in full. The hunter who came from afar Of course the universe is teeming with strange creatures. Take the Predator: a walking closet over two meters tall, all muscle, covered in thick skin like an elephant's and equipped with two little hands that would crush anything, but also endowed with excellent intelligence and with advanced technological knowledge, such as to enable him to build spaceships and sophisticated electronic devices (despite having a vision similar to that of a myopic mole). The hunter who came from afar Well, what does a little creature like that do in life. The lawyer? The maintenance technician? The insurance broker? Door-to-door salesman? No! I really don't see it! And in fact ~ours~ spends his life hunting other creatures to embellish the walls of his bedroom with their skulls. Well, in January 2231 a group of Predators is right on LV-1201 ready to take part in a big hunting trip, where the preys are both Aliens and Humans. But now the time has come to go into detail and find out what it means to impersonate a Predator. So let's start with a small clarification; in the films the Predator was not endowed with good eyesight, indeed to be honest he was blinded and therefore forced to use a mask that allowed him to use various visual spectrums. The hunter who came from afar In the game, for gameplay reasons (a choice that I find perfectly in agreement) the Predator sees us like the Marine, but has also kept the spectrum visuals. The Predator has three camera modes in addition to the normal one. The first is the thermal view and is used to highlight heat sources. Ideal for hunting humans. Then we have a view called EM which highlights objects that have an electric field, in this and the correct choice when we have to hunt down Aliens. Finally we have the Navigation view, which allows our Predator to move easily in the dark, also excellent for seeing other Predators. If we add to these views the fact that the Predator's mask allows 4 zoom levels, we realize that this alien is a born hunter! The hunter who came from afar From a physical point of view, the Predator is not fast, far from it, but it still manages to make mighty leaps and is also endowed with impressive strength. In general it is advisable to act differently depending on the prey. If they're human, the sneak attack pays off very well. The use of stealth techniques together with ranged attacks leads to excellent results. The hunter who came from afar Conversely, against the Aliens, it is better to use more devastating and rapid weapons. It is useless to try to blend in with them because they spot us right away. The Predator, unlike other species, has to manage energy which is essential for almost all of its activities. It draws from this, to camouflage itself, to shoot and even to heal itself. Conclusions (but that's not all!) As you may have noticed during the article I did not talk about the multiplayer modes, which had also been very successful in the previous chapter. The reason is soon said. We will dedicate an entire article to the Multiplayer mode of AvP2. It's definitely worth it! But let's conclude this full-bodied article. Let's start with the comparison with the old title. Well it's a much better product, even if it has been tamed a bit and made less ~heavy~. As you will recall in AvP 1 we were not given the possibility to save during the mission, which exponentially increased the tension (which was later ~fixed~ with a patch, even if I preferred the lack of saves). In the first episode, dimly lit and claustrophobic places were the norm, in this AvP2, however, there is a lesser sense of oppression. I personally found the first Facehugger much more annoying than this one, but that's perhaps a good thing. So AvP2 keeps most of the promises, applying as one of the best games of this end of the year and I bet it will also be one of the best-selling titles during the upcoming holidays. Like any good product there are some gaps that could have been avoided, first of all the excessive linearity of the levels, but the positive aspects are such and many that even these things can take a back seat.
