It is clear that the French house finds this approach more profitable, aiming in all likelihood on the boost in downloads due to gratuity and the even small percentage of users who will then actually put their wallets in their hands to unlock modes, buy bonus packs or simply blocks of useful energy to play the next game without having to wait for the usual ~cooldown~. Whether the transition to the freemium format will prove successful or not, time will tell; for now let's limit ourselves to evaluating the result of these choices, which in the case of Real Football 2012 are unfortunately not supported by substantial innovations. The intention of the developers was to make the game something more than a simple football simulation, inserting in its structure a real ~magazine~ with the latest news on the world of football and therefore addressing fans in the round. who between one game and another also like to find out about the latest market hits of their favorite team. The point is that this ~social~ vocation has not been accompanied by improvements compared to last year's edition, which in many respects was not in the least able to worry products such as FIFA or PES in their iOS versions. However, let's start from the merits of the Gameloft title, which as mentioned can be downloaded for free and played for hours without the particular need to buy any ~package~: you will hardly want to play more than two or three matches in a row, and in the break between sessions the other you will find the energy at your disposal restored, the one that actually allows you to play. At worst, you can use the virtual money (earned thanks to victories or through the now proven system of short advertising films) to buy the energy units you will need at a critical moment, perhaps when you are one step away from winning an important competition and you don't want to postpone the appointment. Different twins The number of modes must certainly be added to the list of advantages of Real Football 2012, also notable in this freemium edition, as well as a clear improvement in the graphic interface, with the on-screen commands rendered in a much more ~elegant~ way compared to last year. Having exhausted these arguments, however, unfortunately we move on to a long list of more or less serious defects, starting with those already present in Real Football 2011 and which we find as they are. Let's start with the physical aspect of the players, which have nothing to do with their real counterparts: given the presence of an editor, it would have been easy for the developers to do something about it, but nothing. Likewise, all the licenses for the teams are still missing, and they are offered to us with improbable names and symbols. The animation of the characters appears to be of good quality, but ends up severely limiting the responsiveness to inputs, with shots and passes that are triggered with guilty delay and make the experience much less immediate and refined than the aforementioned FIFA and PES. Speaking of controls, the assignment of the through ball to the long press of the pass button makes the operation almost useless, given that it takes a few moments too long to activate. Finally, but this is the biggest problem, artificial intelligence is leaking from all sides, both as regards our teammates and the opponents. Situations such as ~I take the ball in midfield and arrive on goal~ are far from rare, sometimes you will even want to leave the controls to see if the CPU is really capable of concluding an action, but given the ability with goalkeepers, anything can happen. The extreme defenders are in fact characterized by an exasperating immobilism, so much so that it is possible to puncture them from any angle and without the slightest effort, ending the games on goals most of the time. Again absent the online multiplayer. The tested version is 1.0.2 Price: freemium App Store links", "date": "2011-12-29", "grade": "5.8"}
