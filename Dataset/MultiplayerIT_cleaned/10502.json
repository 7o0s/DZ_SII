If you win, you earn fame and money in equal measure: the first allows you to move up to higher categories, the second to buy equipment that can further improve your characteristics. Everything can be said about Touch KO, therefore, except that it doesn't offer a good progression: you start from the bottom, you become familiar with the control and therefore we begin to ring victories after victories to make a name for ourselves and move from the suburban gym to the sports hall, with a following of fans that grows exponentially. The title developed by Chillingo doesn't get lost in chatter and basically offers only one game mode (since the ~quick game~ leaves the time it finds), a career in which we have to create our character from scratch and accompany him in his climb to success with fists. There are many innovative elements present in this atypical sports simulation. First and foremost is undoubtedly the control system, which is clearly based on the touch screen and which manages to be convincing right from the start. With the thumbs we control the boxer's arms: a quick touch results in a jab, a ~slide~ from outside to inside becomes a hook and from bottom to top starts an uppercut. To put on guard (independent from one arm to the other) you have to keep your thumb pressed on the screen, while to dodge you have to shake the iPhone left and right. The reactivity of the character, let's face it, is not the best: it takes a few tenths of a second too long for our inputs to be received and transformed into action, and this becomes a problem in the more advanced stages, when the right timing can make the difference between winning and losing. Come on Sugar! As already mentioned, in Touch KO the progression is at the center of the experience, an experience which in the end unfortunately turns out to be very repetitive in its mechanics. Our boxer earns money by winning matches and can invest it to buy new gloves (which improve their power), new shorts (which improve their resistance) and new boots (which improve their agility). There is also a section dedicated to the inevitable tattoos, which however clearly do not affect the various skills. Before each fight you can choose the type of training to be carried out between the punching bag (which increases power), the punching ball (which increases agility), and cardio (which increases endurance). Our characteristics are represented by numbers that can be compared with those of the opponent to get an idea of how things are. Once in the ring, we must be patient and take advantage of every opening to land our shots, better if they are combos made up of several movements. Due to a far from extraordinary AI, however, don't expect great things: often it is enough to wait for the opponent to lower his guard and go with a barrage of hooks to tear him apart and knock him down: if we succeed three times within a single round, it will be a TKO. Otherwise, at the sound of the gong we will be able to try to limit the damage suffered by ~rubbing~ vertically on the touch screen, corresponding to the left and right side of the character's face. The energy management is very original, which divides the bar into a green (dynamic) and red (passive) area to represent what we still have to give and what we have now lost during the match. You make me spin like a doll... The game boasts a well-made technical sector, which however gets lost a bit in the details. There's a good selection of characters to choose from, as well as opponents, but the polygonal models aren't the best in detail and animation. We realize this right away: when we knock our opponent down, our boxer always ~rejoices~ in the same way. Clearly also the movements related to the punches are always the same, and very often the animations are ~cut~ because they cannot keep up with what would be the actual speed of the blow. We therefore end up seeing the enemy spitting blood and sweat at a punch that never reached its destination. When you go down there is a nice spectacular replay with lots of close-ups, and this is certainly a spot-on element, while what surrounds the ring is often a bit drawn out: two-dimensional audience, somewhat anonymous arenas , stuff like that. Unfortunately, the sound is almost insignificant, with too ~soft~ effects and music that fortunately can be replaced with any personalized playlist.The tested version is 1.1", "date": "2009-09-30", "grade": "7.5"}
