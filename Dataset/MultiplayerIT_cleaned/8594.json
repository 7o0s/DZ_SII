In the meantime, as he carries on the creation of Snapshot together with the other members of the Retro Affect team, Pulver has decided to publish a new solo project on PC and Mac, the first ambitious and elaborate enough to be distributed for a fee. Titled Offspring Fling!, it is a pleasant puzzle platformer that mixes tested mechanics, very tender graphics and a high-level soundtrack. Catch them all! Born from an idea during a game jam, Offspring Fling! does not make an effort to hide the titles that, by the twenty-five-year-old author's own admission, have influenced its mechanics, characters and atmosphere. The Kirby series stands out above all, and in particular that Kirby's Fun Pack which accompanied Pulver's childhood and largely influenced his sensitivity towards some design elements. The protagonist of the game himself recalls the chubby Nintendo icon, but in this case it is a creature of the woods who has lost his puppies and who finds himself exploring every corner of the forest to find them and bring them home. Each of the levels sees the player grappling with a whole series of rather traditional actions, from jumping from platform to platform to picking up one or more puppies, and then throwing them, always making sure they don't fall into any traps. None of the ideas behind the game are truly original or atypical, but it's the way each element fits together perfectly that makes Offspring Fling! such a pleasant experience. There are many variants at stake, and even those that appear to be small details actually play an important role in marking the pace of the game and influencing the way in which a puzzle is tackled. The more puppies you carry on your back, the less you are able to jump, forcing the user, especially in the more advanced levels, to think about how many to take with you and often at which points in the level it is best to let them go. This is especially true once the very first schemes have been overcome, when the puppies will not only be burdens to be carried towards the exit, but will prove to be the only tool for solving the puzzles, perhaps by throwing them towards a block, placing them on a switch or, why not, throwing them at an enemy to stun him. Traps, bouncing platforms, mischievous bees and buttons to activate will be the order of the day, but the rest is all the result of a good level design work by the author: Offspring Fling! it succeeds in the not simple objective of constantly introducing the player to each of the mechanics without however proving to be too simple; in the same way, while never reaching excessive difficulty peaks, the game offers challenges that are not at all trivial and which sometimes require a series of attempts by the user. Quantity first Probably the only regret that remains concerns the fact that none of the puzzles are brilliant, crazy or elaborate enough to stick in the mind of those who play and to give enormous satisfaction once completed. In this regard, a parallel with Braid would be too phoned, but unlike Jonathan Blow, who preferred to propose a few but memorable puzzles, Pulver wanted to focus more on the quantity of the same. From now Offspring Fling! offers the beauty of 100 levels, a number which, if on the one hand ensures a few hours of fun, on the other hand often leads to a subtle sense of dj vu already when approaching the second half. Not that the game gets boring all of a sudden, mind you, but some puzzles end up hopelessly similar to each other, sometimes a little, sometimes a little too much. Perhaps this is the only real drawback of an extremely successful puzzle game that satisfies above all those who are looking for an experience that will keep them busy for a long time: as in the more classic time trials, it is in fact possible to tackle the levels completed by challenging the ~ghost~ of their previous performance, while the most skilled players can try to break the records (with respective ghosts) of the same developer. In the latter case, analyzing the author's movements allows you to discover small secret tricks and tricks to improve your records, such as the possibility of increasing speed by pressing the jump button when passing under a narrow tunnel. OffspringFling! in short, it is a game that cannot leave you indifferent, if only for its very pleasant artistic style and the tender design of the characters. To further underline the influence received from some historical platformers, the entire aesthetic recalls the Super NES era, but it is the perfect mix of graphics and sound that makes the game so unique. The soundtrack composed by Alec Holowka, among other things already author of the excellent music of Aquaria, marries sublimely with the lively and tender atmosphere that characterizes the title, delighting the player along the entire duration of his adventure.", "date": "2012-04-16", "grade": "8.5"}
