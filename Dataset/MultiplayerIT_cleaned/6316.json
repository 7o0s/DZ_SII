Marketing naturally makes the difference, but there are many examples of small independent teams who, thanks to word of mouth from users, posts on forums and specialized sites, have managed to offer their ideas to a huge audience and earn quite a bit of money. Well, Ire: Blood Memory represents in many ways the ~phase two~ of this interesting mechanism, and the reason is obvious: instead of promoting simple and immediate gameplay, which immediately catches the attention, perhaps in an endless context, the action RPG made by Tenbirds tries to clear a hardcore approach very close to titles such as Dark Souls and Monster Hunter, therefore with a multifaceted combat system and, above all, a considerable degree of challenge. All within about forty missions, which take place in the perspective of five increasingly complex chapters, playable without having to wait for any recharge or be subject to particular limitations. The freemium model adopted by the developers turns out to be quite generous, allowing you to earn virtual money, materials and diamonds as you complete the many available achievements, and use them to buy new equipment or upgrade the weapons and armor in our possession. Of course, towards the end of the second chapter the pace of progress tends to slow down and it becomes necessary to carry out a bit of ~grinding~, repeating previous quests to get to the desired level of experience, but it is a decidedly bearable aspect. Ire: Blood Memory is an extremely solid and convincing action RPG, with an unexpected hardcore nature Matter of style When you first start Ire: Blood Memory it asks you to select the initial equipment, but it is a choice that we will be able to return to later, simply by purchasing the weapons that define the three ~classes~ available: clawed gloves, a huge two-handed broadsword and the spear/shield combo. Each piece of equipment translates into a different fighting style, and not just that: the gloves allow a quick but less effective approach, the broadsword allows you to deliver powerful blows and literally open your enemies in two, while finally the spear and the shield carry as a dowry a tactical attitude not to be underestimated, with the possibility of keeping one's guard up and charging even from a distance. Beyond a mediocre and not too clear main menu, the touch control system developed by the developers is immediately confirmed as precise and responsive, albeit without any possibility of customization. On the left there is a virtual analog stick, while on the right of the screen there are seven different buttons: two types of attack (which can be combined in various ways to perform maneuvers that are as spectacular as they are effective, but can only be used if the fatigue bar is not exhausted ), the parry, the dodge, the lock-on, the button to drink the single healing position available in each stage (not really an enchanted elixir: the character breaks a fairy in two and drinks its blood, complete with cries) and the one to charge a powerful blow, which takes a couple of seconds to materialize but is important in the boss fight. The rest is all strategy: you access small scenarios and go hunting for monsters to tear apart, sometimes with the help of other players' ~spirits~ controlled by artificial intelligence, also a reference to Dark Souls . When you are faced with the biggest and baddest enemies, it becomes essential to memorize their attack pattern and take advantage of every moment to sink the blows, then trying to move away to recharge your vigor or raise your shield to avoid suffering serious damage. The single possibility of resurrecting after game over in exchange for 500 coins represents a small concession to accessibility, but you will not find anything else from this point of view: to move forward you will have to work hard. If we really want to find a limit to Ire: Blood Memory, we can perhaps criticize the developers' choice to limit the size of the scenarios and therefore the length of the quests, which inevitably comes to the detriment of the depth of the experience. Furthermore, the clash with outnumbered enemies sometimes leads to situations in which you ~get stuck~ between two opponents without being able to escape, but we assume that this last problem will be solved with the next updates. Nothing to say instead on the technical aspect, in some frangreally sumptuous, with excellent animations, a convincing design of the monsters, a nice lighting system and an adequate sound compartment. Too bad only for the repetitiveness of the locations, a price to pay when you have to limit production costs. But now let's reflect for a moment: what would the Tenbirds guys be able to do with more means available? An exciting question, to which we hope to be able to give an answer soon.", "date": "2015-05-23", "grade": "8.5"}
