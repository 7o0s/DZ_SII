With a bizarre concept, a captivating minimalist design and also a free-giving sales model, the game undoubtedly knew how to leave its mark, which is why the developer duo decided to convert it for iOS devices by adding some new nuances to the formula original. So let's see what it's all about... The naked ride As summarized by the title of this article, Fotonica could be considered as an ideal link between Mirror's Edge and Rez: in fact, with the first it shares the subjective view and the platform ambitions, while it approaches the second as regards the graphic style and the choice of an electronic soundtrack with almost hypnotic tones. The result is an action game that pushes very hard on the pedal of originality, without any fear of embracing solutions that are even rather extreme and undoubtedly unsettling at first. One of these certainly concerns the control system, which on PC involved the use of a single key while here it reduces everything to the simple pressure of a finger on the touch screen: it is therefore necessary to keep the index finger on the display to allow the character to run forward, lifting it instead to make it jump and then touching the screen again to accelerate the descent and continue the motion without losing speed. These premises allow you to tackle the three different modes offered by Fotonica, namely Arcade, Endless and Versus: in the first, the goal is to get to the bottom of the various stages (there are seven in all, playable by choosing between a normal challenge level or difficult) without falling on deaf ears, under penalty of having to start over. Although the game basically takes place on a track, since the protagonist moves autonomously following a perfect straight line, the scenarios are full of vertical bifurcations that push the user to explore them all in search of the best possible path to maximize his score: in fact, this is calculated on the basis of the maximum speed reached and the number of purple spheres that are collected during the race. In the second mode, the cards on the table change slightly, given that the aim becomes to survive as long as possible within three randomly generated levels, in a context therefore completely similar to that of the now well-known endless runners. Finally, the Versus section allows two players to challenge each other on the same terminal via vertical split-screen, with the two users having to face each other and act on their own portion of the touch screen. Three years after debuting on PC, Fotonica arrives in great shape on iOS devices While not native to iOS, Fotonica seems to make no effort to adapt to that unwritten rule that invites any self-respecting mobile product to offer an ideal combination of immediacy of use and depth. Hence, the work of Santa Ragione is theoretically accessible to anyone with the gift of sight and at least one finger, but can only be mastered in its entirety by players who know how to express patience and dedication. Precisely for this reason, Fotonica is a potentially divisive title, capable of inducing frustration in less experienced users and vice versa being irresistible for anyone who defines himself as a full-fledged hardcore gamer. Being able to get a high score in the game is an exercise that requires excellent memory and lightning reflexes, also due to a particular gameplay element that contributes to adding a lot of pepper to the playful action: ringing a series of successful jumps, in fact, you enter a sort of turbo mode which allows you to reach extreme speeds (and therefore opening the doors to a better final result) but which at the same time makes it even more difficult to identify in time the obstacles that arise on the way. That Fotonica is not a product with universal appeal can also be understood from its ultra-minimalist look, with almost entirely monochromatic wireframe graphics (therefore made up of bare polygons, i.e. devoid of textures) and an interface very unbalanced towards pure design at the expense of mere usability. In short, what in the eyes of some observers could appear as a real show of subtraction, to others ifit will only seem like a difficult and monotonous game.", "date": "2014-09-15", "grade": "8.0"}
