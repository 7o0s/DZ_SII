{"name": "Buzz! The Mega Quiz - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/buzz-the-mega-quiz-recensione.html", "text": "Enrico Papi virtual As many will remember, the debut of the franchise took place with that Buzz! The music quiz that reminded so much of the famous TV program ~Sarabanda~; the questions were in fact entirely concerned with musical topics, thus cutting out those who did not have particular knowledge in this field. After a sporting parenthesis, with this Mega Quiz the series has therefore finally chosen to open up to a broader range, proposing an extremely broader and more extensive series of topics: sport, cinema, TV, oddities, animals just to name a few collected in a total of about 5000 questions, 500 images, 100 photos of famous people, 50 music videos, 20 sports clips, 10 from famous films and so on. A decidedly substantial number, and which assumes greater value considering the intelligent adoption by the programmers of a system which, by saving on a memory card, avoids the repetition of questions already proposed. For those who have had the opportunity to play the previous Buzz, it will not be difficult to become familiar with Mega Quiz; the game structure has in fact remained almost intact, thus maintaining the characteristic features of simplicity and immediacy that have decreed its good success. In practice it is a matter of facing several rounds in which to answer the questions on the screen correctly; all this via the dedicated controller, the buzzer, equipped with 4 colored buttons in addition to a larger red one on the top. The various tests differ from each other for some rules; in some, perhaps greater speed is required, in others it is allowed to ~steal~ points from an opponent, in still others, the error leads to direct elimination and so on up to the exciting final challenge in which everything can change. But the fulcrum always remains to answer the questions correctly; the latter, a very important factor, are always able to be interesting, almost never too trivial or too complicated. Only on rare occasions does the British production of the game shine through, with some questions on typically English themes (see musical groups or semi-unknown songs outside the borders of Her Majesty). 8 friends in the living room For such a simple and immediately accessible game it is therefore not necessary to spend too many words; Buzz! The Mega Quiz is a very competent product, well crafted and balanced. One of the most interesting novelties compared to the previous chapters certainly lies in the possibility of giving life to challenges for up to 8 players, obviously with 2 sets of buzzers. On such occasions, Sony production really offers its best; in fact, as can easily be understood, the fun obtained from Buzz is directly proportional to the number of participants. So don't even think of buying it if you don't have the possibility to fill the house of friends or relatives; quite simply, it wouldn't make sense. The technical aspect has largely remained the same since the time of the series' debut; rather simplistic and minimalist therefore, even if particular attention has been paid to the characterization of the characters, starting from the presenter Buzz up to the various alter-egos that it is possible to impersonate, all absolutely crazy and extravagant. The sound is excellent, with a high-level Italian dubbing that leaves no room for criticism. Finally, the price at which it is sold deserves applause, interesting both in the version with and without buzzer (in case you already have one). Comment Buzz! The Mega Quiz is simply the best quiz party game out there. The questions are many, varied and interesting, the game structure is robust and enjoyable, but above all the Sony production can count on a really high accessibility and such as to really allow anyone to be able to participate. So if you often have a living room full of friends and you want to have fun with a game of this type, The Mega Quiz is the best choice you can make. Pros Accessible to anyone Lots of questions The best quiz around Cons Some rare questions too British Technically improvable In single player it shouldn't even be touched It is undoubtedly true and there for all to see that Nintendo, with its Wii, has taken a very courageous step by creating a console specifically designed for those who have had little or nothing to do with video games. But even Sony, in a less sensational way, has kept the so-called ~casual gamers~ in mind on more than one occasion, creating titles accessible to grandmothers, mothers, uncles and assorted cousins. The Buzz! series fits fully into this category, back in stores again with this latest episode subtitled The Mega Quiz.", "date": "2007-06-20", "grade": null}
