Even though this is the second season, you don't have to have played the first. We still advise you to do it, because it will allow you to appreciate the main character more. In any case keep in mind that at the beginning of the game the crucial moments of the previous season will be revealed to you, as if to say: either play the first season now or later it will be too late. A final warning: we have done everything possible not to reveal the most intense passages of this new episode, but if you prefer to be in the dark, read only the final commentary, bearing in mind that only at the end of the series will we be able to give you a definitive opinion. In the first season we saw Clementine through Lee's eyes. In a world where the dead find no peace and want to eat the living, in order not to give in to the bestial instinct that is inside every human being, the best thing to do is take care of someone else. And so did Lee with Clementine, teaching her how to survive. Now, however, the field closes in on the little girl. If before our reason for living was to prevent Clementine from suffering, imagine how painful it can be to see her mercilessly abused, in body and mind. Clementine is a child, although already capable of killing with a gun and surviving, certainly more mature than her chronological age, but still a child. This complex psychological picture is represented very well throughout the episode. It should be noted that the tone of the narration is not touching, but cold and impersonal, like nature which, in the world of The Walking Dead, has resumed dominating over man. Clementine's misfortunes are not sadistic rages, nor have she been spared some trials by virtue of her fragility. The world doesn't care how old you are, whether you're noble-minded or a vile rogue: anything can happen, and there's no particular reason. It's simply up to you. And now it's Clementine's turn. In All That Remains, Clementine makes Lara Croft look like a spoiled, mushy child Don't take her by the hand Naturally, the first episode of the series has the task of presenting the initial situation and introducing the event that changes the pre-existing balance. Clementine's initial situation is that of a little girl with a bad heart who is looking for a new point of reference. Instead, he just gets slapped. The game enjoys giving her a handhold (to her, and therefore to us) and then brutally snatching it from her hands. Is there a decent human being? Rest assured that it will come to a bad end. An unexpected companion? It will turn against us. First the psychological disappointment, then the real wounds, the ones that bleed and burn, in a crescendo of suffering, always without respite, because the dead never rest. Clementine struggles as best she can, but has the body of a child, and is well aware of her limitations. There are numerous action sequences in this first episode, very well shot, and for Clementine they are the worst moments: she clings to trees, bites her fingers, sneaks away as best she can and, sometimes, if she gets the chance, becomes lethal in turn. After all, a hammer is enough to break a zombie's head. Some inconsistencies have escaped the watchful eye of the writers, such as when Clementine, already cold, ends up in a river; seeing her re-emerge during the day and proceed with the same clothes on as if nothing had happened is far-fetched. Beyond that, the action from his point of view is plausible and satisfying. And it reaches its climax when it is forced by circumstances to perform such a painful feat that we have suffered as if it were happening to us. Get ready for a scene that will have you twisting in your seat for endless minutes. Eventually it will be impossible not to feel a mixture of compassion and admiration for this little girl. And perhaps you too will wonder, as happened to us, who are no longer children for a long time, if in the same circumstances we would have been up to him. Hope you never find out. Past choices and future choices If you have a save from the first season and the 400 Days DLC you can expect an echo of the decisions made in the past, even if we haven't noticed anything yet. Instead, the consequences of the choices made in All That Remains are all too clear, and the more experienced will immediately understand that only in the finale we are faced with a turn of events that depends on our decision (perhaps even when Christa is attacked, but not we are sure). In any case, you can expect a linear adventure like those of the past season, devoid of puzzles, with an excellent narrative pace, but in whichhow less exciting than the events involving Lee. It must be said that the first chapter, which as we have said must above all present the initial situation, is almost always less engaging than those that follow. Nonetheless, some good opportunities have been lost, as in the long infiltration sequence. Considering we're silently wandering around a house full of people, a few more heartbeats would have been nice. Choosing only whether to hide behind the shower curtain or in the towel cabin seemed little to us, considering the talent of the authors. In any case, the main goal was achieved, if in the end Clementine convinced us without reservations and we were left wanting to know what will happen both to her and to the new group with which she has mingled. Among other things, the latter seems less stable than the one seen in the previous season, because all the components are placed in that gray and nuanced area that does not allow us to separate the good guys from the bad guys and in which everyone is equally guilty. Among other things, Clementine herself can come out harsh and unfair from verbal confrontations based on the answers we choose to give. Perhaps we dare too much, but we feel that the player has been given more freedom to define the personality of the protagonist than in Lee's time. However, there are two negative aspects, which were almost obvious. The first concerns the conflicts, physical or interpersonal, which are simple variations of those already experienced in the previous season. The second aspect that left us a little disappointed is the total absence of new ideas in the game structure. From the art direction to the controls, Season 2 is a near-identical copy of Season 1, only minor superficial details change. Since there is another series in circulation signed by Telltale Games, The Wolf Among Us, which follows the same pattern, we hope that the developers will not remain prisoners of their own success. But we'll talk about it in the next episode. Until then, trust no one.", "date": "2013-12-19", "grade": "7.9"}
