The advent of free-to-play has given a substantial boost to the market, with many titles with low production values that still manage to keep the servers online thanks to the presence of players who, for no cost, are willing to close a keep an eye out for some shortcomings or a general quality below average. Among the software houses that have fully embraced this philosophy, the German Bigpoint Games stands out, one of the most developed and established companies in Europe dedicated exclusively to free-to-play online games which over the years, starting from browser games, has managed to count several dozen of millions of active players every month on its servers. Drakensang Online is perhaps one of the most important projects for the company: since it was launched in 2011 it has managed to obtain a substantial group of fans who play it continuously every month, so as to convince the software house to constantly develop new contents with the intent to expand the dense community as much as possible. The latest update in chronological order was perhaps the most important since its launch with a series of adjustments and technical improvements that were only possible by disengaging from browsers in favor of a client to download and install on the PC. A bold move that allowed the title to take an important leap forward in terms of graphics, but from what we've seen playing it for a few weeks, many of the problems encountered by players have remained, and they are all related to the wallet. PvE promoted, PvP rejected: Drakensang Online could not fully convince us A world to save... Without standing out for its originality, the story behind Drakensang Online takes us to the fantasy lands of Dracania, endangered by a handful of very powerful evil wizards who managed to open an old interdimensional portal connecting the earthly world to the Otherworld, populated by dangerous creatures demonic. Our task will therefore be to defend the cities of the kingdom from the invasion, setting off on an adventure in a succession of quests that will take us through every corner of the game world. Thanks to the presence of various NPCs and a monstrous quantity of quests characterized by rather interesting bosses, the classic triptych ~kill the enemies - collect the loot - continue to the next dungeon~ works properly, cleverly divided between tasks related to the main quest and secondary objectives which favor the development of the character by bringing various experience points and the resources necessary to unlock the rich skill tree, characterized by different talents for each class. In this sense, remaining tied to a rather standard context for the genre to which it belongs, the Bigpoint Games title offers four classes to choose from, each characterized by rather marked distinctive features. They range from the classic warrior powerful in close combat, to the mage specialist in long range attacks and skills aimed at doing area damage, passing through the hunter who is skilled in both and therefore more versatile than the previous ones. To complete the picture there is the steam mechanic, the most recently added class compared to the others which bases its strength mainly on the use of guns, turrets, bombardments and a gigantic mech to be called in the most unfavorable situations. Nothing new under the sun therefore, but what strikes us negatively is above all the presence of only four customization traits in the character creation phase, too few if we are talking about an MMO that has the ambition to welcome thousands of players. In addition to choosing the sex, you have only three shades of complexion, a dozen hairstyles and as many types of beard available. The lack of possibility to intervene on the modeling of one's virtual alter ego by modifying its weight, height, build, facial features and perhaps adding distinctive features such as scars, tattoos or anything else does nothing but excessively homogenize the various fighters, with a consequent poor attachment of the player to his character not so different from all the others. Finally, the limit of four characters for each account remains to be underlined, a little to ensure the right amount of replayability and allow you to experiment with all the classes, especially in light of the fact that to delete a character and make room for a new one, it is need to put your wallet in hand. ...even with real money It is precisely on this aspect that the productionand Bigpoint Game crashes. Let me be clear, it's not a complete disaster, but if we think of the fundamental points around which the gaming experience offered by a theme park MMO should revolve, i.e. endgame and character evolution, Drakensang Online makes a sensational patch. Unfortunately, despite an excellent start in which you can fully enjoy the free soul of the title, it doesn't take too long to understand that by proceeding in the adventure, somewhat questionable choices force the player to put his hand in his wallet in every way. In its fundamental mechanics, Drakensang is nothing more than a hack and slash where dozens and dozens of tasks will be entrusted to us by as many characters scattered throughout the various villages, to which must be added the objectives to be unlocked by completing certain objectives and daily tasks which vary on a daily basis. Originality is certainly not the host, with quests ranging from finding a certain number of objects, obtaining specific resources or going to save a poor adventurer who was attacked by a group of demons during his last exploration. Fighting to earn experience points, coins and equipment is the very soul of the game, dotted with dungeons of increasing difficulty that you can tackle alone, although most of them require the help of other players to be completed . The valid combat system tends to mitigate the cyclical nature of the assignments accompanied by a fairly generous loot system initially, except that it gradually becomes less inclined to drop rare and legendary objects over the hours. The reasons are basically two: firstly, the developers have rationalized the most powerful objects to keep players online for as long as possible, and secondly to induce the most impatient to spend real money. The basic problem, in fact, is that by paying you not only get boosts to level up faster or buy items aimed at personalizing your virtual character, but you have the possibility to make purchases related to very powerful weapons and equipment that completely alter the balance in game between those who decide to put their hands on their wallets and those who don't, especially in the PvP field. In fact, if PvE is very enjoyable up to the endgame even relying on the loot system, the fights between players in the arena have a distinctly pay to win matrix, where in fact whoever pays the most to obtain advanced level weapons and equipment has the most advantage in the clashes , relegating the weakest players to sure defeats. In fact, we are not exaggerating if we tell you that once we have reached the level cap - there are forty-five levels in all - and entered the arena most of the time we have not even managed to put our opponent on his mind, all due to lack of enchanted objects and Extremely hard to find armor sets by grinding. A real shame in the end, given that the work in terms of visual rendering done using the launch of the client has contributed to a better rendering of the title. Its nature as a browser game is still felt throughout, but considering its origins, the work done in terms of detail on characters and settings is more than positive, even if problems remain on the front of the animations which are still rather approximate and limited in variety.", "date": "2015-03-06", "grade": "6.5"}
