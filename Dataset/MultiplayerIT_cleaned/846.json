{"name": "Hearts of Iron 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hearts-of-iron-2.html", "text": "A short but intense scenario HoI2 takes us to the hectic period of the Second World War. We will be able to choose whether to play specific events such as the conquest of Poland, the landing in Normandy or the Winter War, or the Great Campaign which from 1936 to 1947 includes the entire period of the war, or a shorter version of it. Freedom is also total in this initial choice, if in thematic campaigns we can decide which side to control only among those directly involved, in the Great Campaign the choice is between all the states on the map. In fact, just right-click on one of the flags representing the states that have played a more important role, to be able to replace it with one of the many others, which will thus become selectable. Do you want to find out what it would have been like to experience the war from lost South America as Argentina or Brazil? Two clicks of the mouse and it's done! The only comment that can be made is perhaps the excessive brevity of the main campaign, only 11 years compared to the 300 of the two Europa Universalis. However, we must take into account the fact that in the modern world changes (technological, social, cultural) are increasingly rapid and it becomes very difficult to recreate them effectively with a program, not to mention the enormous beta-testing time required to verify their effectiveness: while in Europa Universalis one could spend decades reorganizing the state, in HoI2 one does not stand still for more than a year. A painful choice therefore, but necessary, even if you can easily find handy tools that remove the time block from campaigns. It's not risky! Hoi2 is a historically based strategy, so the old adage mass a lot of troops and dump them on the enemy that works so well in other strategies, this time has diametrically opposite effects, due to the huge amount of factors that need to be considered carefully before even starting to think about launching an attack. At the beginning of the main scenario, the situation of the various sides faithfully reflects the historical one: an almost total stalemate. Reckless action at such a time therefore almost certainly leads to disastrous defeat! It is essential to first verify the industrial productivity of the country, strengthen it and distribute it in order to maximize its effectiveness. All this, however, without losing sight of the resources of materials and supplies, essential to keep the industries running, but also the army itself. In case of scarcity of resources we will have to try to negotiate the exchange with one of the other countries and this brings us to the diplomatic section. Every action has its consequences. The other states will therefore not stand there and watch while we do our thing, on the contrary they could decide to take measures, even drastic ones, against us if we exceed the limit. For this we will have to reflect before carrying out the most important actions, in order to maintain that delicate balance of international relations called peace. This obviously only until we decide to let the guns do the talking instead of the diplomats Another aspect that should not be underestimated is internal politics, which influences all aspects of state management in a more or less incisive way. We can replace a minister to obtain a different bonus with a click of the mouse, or change the level of pluralism in the government, the freedom granted to citizens or to the economy simply by moving the cursor of the relative scroll bars, which however can only be moved a notch every year to allow time for the population to ~digest~ the change. However, no strategy is complete without a section dedicated to research. The system used in HoI2 is very simple: each state has a number of slots available for research based on the number of industries it controls (up to a maximum of 5); each slot must be assigned a project to be studied and a development team among those who have contributed to the technological development of the state (in the case of Italy, for example, we will have Fiat, Lancia and Enrico Fermi among others). The projects are divided according to the type: some allow you to have access to new structures or military units or to improve existing ones, while others, called doctrines, grant bonuses in certain circumstances. Choosing what to study, when to do it, and who to entrust with the task is an operation that needs attention, because it is essential to choose the research team that has the greatest number of fields of specialization in common with the project, in order to avoid waste time unnecessarily. The battlefield We were saying before that amassing a sea of troops is counterproductive the reasonor is that the commanders that we can assign to battalions (set of divisions) or squadrons (set of squadrons) have a limit on the number of units they can command based on their rank, and overloading them drastically reduces their effectiveness. Promoting a commander to a higher rank is a quick way to increase the number of units he can control, but it also increases the time it takes him to improve his combat prowess. The range of military units available is very wide, and can be customized thanks to the introduction of brigades, particular units unable to act independently, but which join the normal divisions and modify some of their values. Thus, for example, if we have to fight in the jungle, we will combine infantry units with brigades of engineers (which increase their defense and movement), while we will add brigades of heavy artillery (which decrease movement but greatly increase the damage inflicted) to paratroopers and marines, since they are transported by other means and almost never have to move themselves. The combat system is a bit complicated, but it allows you to organize totally customized offensive strategies. The orders that can be assigned are extremely detailed, to the point of synchronizing the maneuvers by defining the moment of the start of the action and the period of the day in which to carry them out, in order to seize the right moments and avoid the most unfavorable moments. The battles are represented by a convenient scheme that lists the forces on the field for each faction and the factors that influence the outcome of the battle, and indicates the progress of the fight with a simple bar that changes color based on the development of events. So we can quickly understand the situation and, if necessary, take appropriate measures. Although there are many variables that influence battles, the effects are almost exclusively on the level of organization of the divisions and only to a limited extent on strength. Thus it is normal to route the enemy and make him retreat in disarray, but it is almost impossible to physically eliminate an enemy unit, which therefore, in a short time will have recovered enough to come back to annoy us, perhaps ~eating~ us a territory that we have left unguarded behind the front. The only way to obtain a definitive result is to completely isolate a group of units, which therefore, not having a friendly region to retreat to, are annihilated, or bomb them to death. Perhaps it would have been better to shift the damage more to the strength, in order to make attacking at least a little more dangerous, because, as it is, the risk of suffering losses is too skewed in favor of the attacker. Technical realization HoI2 is a pure strategy game and doesn't need any special effects. It is therefore nice to know that there are none at all: the Paradox team programmers have focused on the substance, leaving behind any useless aesthetic frills. The map is simple, pleasant and effective, the menus functional and easy to reach. If we want to find a defect in the technical realization at all costs, it can be found in the excessive automatism of the production section, which autonomously decides which productions to favor and which to suspend in the event of a shortage of manpower, without respecting our priorities. For the rest, the only real problem is represented by the manual: a beast of 180 pages for a pound and a half (which, by the way, even fell on my head, and I guarantee you it hurts) full of information that unfortunately in many cases they reveal too generic and superficial to be really helpful to the player, who must necessarily turn to online guides in order not to miss many convenient options along the way. As advice we point out this excellent site where you can find all the guides you need to learn how to play better. Final comment Do you remember the maps with the figurines of soldiers that for centuries kings from all over the world have used to study the movements of armies and war strategies? This is HoI2: a king and his kingdom (regardless of government). Some minor aspects are still not entirely convincing, but they do not affect the gaming experience. The distribution of resources is completely biased in favor of the main regions of the various states, while the colonies have almost no resources, thus becoming completely useless (the exact opposite of what happened in reality, when the states acquired the colonies to exploit their resources ). The list of orders could be completed by the most classic of the ~fulfillments~, which would have allowed for further customizationespecially of the air force and navy, and there is a lack of a real intelligence service. Artificial intelligence is not exactly the best, not even at extreme levels, on the other hand there are already many official and non-official mods that allow you to change the attitudes of other states, like any other aspect of HoI2. However, HoI2 gives the maximum in multiplayer games. However well done, the AI of a game still remains predictable, a human being on the other hand can improvise, invent new tactics, play dirty, in other words, surprise. And there is plenty of time to organize your plans calmly, because the matches last for days, if not weeks. Strategist against strategist and the goal can be world domination as well as survival alone. That's why HoI2 is a great game! You need intelligence, cunning, patience, the ability to analyze the situation and plan at least five moves ahead of what you are doing to fully enjoy a title of this kind. It is a niche product, dedicated to a hard core of enthusiasts of strategy pushed to the extreme, who want substance and don't stop at appearances. Those who want action, frenzy and drool behind a sterile breathtaking graphics would do better to stay away: they simply would not be able to understand it. Pros: Moddable in every part Total control of every aspect of the state High historical realism Detailed and engaging combat system Cons: Main campaign a bit short Distribution of resources in the colonies does not correspond to the story AI can be improved Full-bodied, but generic and superficial manual A bit of history A few years ago, we are talking about a couple of abundant decades now, a genius called Thomas Harlan had the idea of merging the strategic components of board games such as Risk and the interpretative components of role-playing games, all in total freedom of action. Thus was born Lord of the Earth (better known simply as Lote). The players, initially his college buddies, played entire states, giving rulers a voice, planning military campaigns and steering the economy to achieve their goals, while a master (or arbiter, for non-English speakers) analyzed the their orders and reported their effects, often in the form of a historical chronicle. Over the years Lote has evolved, adding the precious help of the computer to the master, but it has always remained a game created by enthusiasts for other enthusiasts. This until the release of Europa Universalis, when the Swedish Paradox, perhaps independently, but more likely inspired by Lote, presented a very similar product to the general public, fully automated and equipped with multiplayer modes. After Europa Universalis (set between 1400 and 1700) it was the turn of its worthy successor EU2, then Hearts of Iron, set in WWII, and finally Hearts of Iron 2 (henceforth simply HoI2) .", "date": "2005-09-09", "grade": null}
