{"name": "Dead Space - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dead-space-recensione.html", "text": "Terror from space Years of science fiction and horror weren't enough to understand that it's better to let go of a space station that obviously doesn't respond to radio requests. The ~Planet Cracker~ class mining excavator vessel, USG Ishimura, has long since lost radio contact, after apparently ceasing all activity. Our official mission seems like a simple chore: to board the Ishimura, figure out the breakdown and repair it, then return home. For the protagonist Isaac Clarke there is something more at stake, however: his Nichole is present on the ship, who had made herself heard shortly before the start of the mission with a strangely heartfelt last message, so the occasion seems propitious also for a clarifying meeting. But things begin to fall apart immediately and it is clear that normally there is very little left on the Ishimura, who in his excavations seems to have awakened something terrible and fatal, making the mission of the three special envoys a close fight for survival. The normal reality of working days on the ship has been completely disrupted, and among the spectral lights of the halls and corridors aberrant monsters now drag themselves along, with whom we will immediately find ourselves fighting: a little awkward and weighed down by overalls, Isaac must improvise a fighter, learning to use and distinguish the weapons scattered in the various sectors of the ship. The Ishimura itself progressively loses its technological and human character, transforming itself into a sort of sentient organism, while exploration becomes a hallucinatory journey towards the beating heart of a spatial hell. However, in the narrative setting chosen by EA, there is a sort of logical discrepancy: the protagonist always remains anonymous (silent, his face covered by a helmet), but the ~suture~ perhaps sought by the developers between the character and the player (present for example in Half-Life or Metroid Prime) it is difficult to happen, considering the choice of the shot in the third person, and above all the sentimental bond that should characterize Isaac uniting him to Nichole and therefore to the fate of the ship. In turn, this choice to characterize Isaac with his own background clashes with the character's silence, flaunted to the point of making him a sort of combat automaton. In this sense, it doesn't help that the ~missions~ (at least for most of the game) are a continuous running from one side of the ship to the other, literally carrying out the extremely practical tasks given by the other two shipmates. journey, further thinning the personality of the protagonist and the possibility of seeing great psychological insights into the reign of terror. However, towards the end, there is a crescendo of the story that partially resolves the narrative structure, and does not make the great work done by Redwood Shores on the setting and atmospheres of Dead Space completely in vain. Explore and dismember Once the situation inside the ship has been ~clarified~, our aim becomes to escape from the nightmare: we therefore find ourselves guiding Isaac in the meanders of the Ishimura, controlling him with a system very similar to that adopted by Resident Evil 4 With the camera behind the protagonist, we have to complete a series of missions that are entrusted to us by Kendra and Zach, the other two members of the team, scattered throughout the various compartments of the vast spaceship. The possible actions are linked to the context in which we find ourselves, although they can mostly be assimilated to the transport of objects, the activation of switches and machinery and, obviously, the elimination of the numerous enemies present, with the controls that allow the simple movement of the character and the ability to draw your weapon and fire with the support of a precise light pointer. The puzzles, actually rather simple, are mainly linked to the use of the two special powers supplied to the protagonist, thanks to his particular work suit: ~stasis~ gives the possibility of slowing down moving objects, while ~chinese~ allows to move objects at a distance, in a very similar way to Half-Life's gravity gun. Not much to work with actually, but in an essentially action game it's an understandable scarcity. On the other hand, the two powers are also widely used in combat, with the ability to slow down enemies and throw blunt objects. The normal exploration of the ship is sometimes enlivened by some sections that succeed well in the task of breaking the otherwise monotonous rhythm of the game - We then find the zones of zero gravity, which allow movement along all the walls of the ship, the phases set in the void of space, in which we have to keep an eye on the levelof oxygen present in the suit, or the sporadic clashes with gigantic monsters, in the most classic action tradition. Explore and dismember The attraction exercised by Dead Space fortunately does not end in the powerful atmosphere created by the settings: the other strong point of the game is in fact the excellent combat system studied by EA. The monsters present in the Ishimura are called Necromorphs, and derive for the most part from human corpses re-assembled in a delusional way by the mysterious plague present in the ship. Their design, perhaps a little tacky in the redundant deformations, has the precise function of focusing attention on specific points of the tortured bodies, and consequently developing precise attack strategies. That's why each enemy is equipped with long sharp limbs, offshoots or particularly showy elements: in addition to representing the natural weapons of the Necromorph, the player's blows must be concentrated on them. Unloading shots at random against the big target will not bring great results, surgical precision is often required in hitting the salient points of the aberrations that will come towards us, in order to eliminate them, also due to the limited reserves of ammunition (which can be remedied in part using kinesis to throw objects). Each type of monster requires a particular approach, and the need to adopt balanced attack strategies becomes vital when we find ourselves fighting against assorted groups of Necromorphs. Another tactical element present in the game is the accurate dosing of resources necessary for survival: ammunition, according to the typical survival horror school, is very numerous, as are the medical kits to restore health. If you add to this the fact of having a limited space available for inventory, the elements to be constantly calculated increase. The presence of ~shops~ scattered around the Ishimura makes inventory management more dynamic, with the possibility of buying ammunition and medkits and depositing surplus items inside a ~safe~, which recalls - another classical element - the good old chest from Resident Evil. Amazing journey Dead Space is a sensory experience of great impact. The graphic engine developed for the occasion by Redwood Shores is worthy of a large production (it is no coincidence that its use as a basis for future EA titles is looming) and succeeds in the difficult task of creating an original and distressing atmosphere. The originally gray and aseptic corridors and rooms of the Ishimura, necessarily minimalist in design, are transformed into places that are always mysterious and full of looming threats, thanks above all to the excellent use of dynamic lights and shadows, which enliven the scenarios creating optical illusions and amplifying the horror with the sense of mystery, while the claustrophobic environments are sometimes mitigated by the splendid glimpses of outer space, or by the rare walks outside the ship. In concert with the excellent level of graphics, the audio sector plays its part admirably: the sudden blows, the distant or fearfully close moans of the enemies mix with the background noises of the ship, Isaac's footsteps or the choked breathing of the protagonist inside the heavy diving suit, making the gaming experience a continuous visual and sound stimulation, which favors a truly deep identification. The solution adopted for the interface (perhaps the most purely original element of the whole game) also contributes in this sense: the developers have decided to ban any type of HUD from the screen. All the basic information for the player is visible directly from the elements always in view: the energy is represented by the light bar embedded in the back of Isaac's armor (the ~RIG~), as the charge level of the ~stasis~, while the number of ammunition is clearly visible on the luminous display of the weapon being held. Calling up the inventory or the map does not necessarily pause the game, on the contrary this information is projected in front of the protagonist with a sort of hologram, the same system adopted for radio communications with companions, or with the crew's recorded testimonies . The orientation system is also on the same line: the simple pressure of a button displays a path that goes from Isaac to the objective, simplifying on the one hand all the typical exploration work of this genre, but on the other avoiding the constant recourse to the map. All this, together with the ~real time~ essence of the interlude scenes, helps to never break the suspension of disbelief, which remains intact from the beginning to the end of the games. The double is a bit discontinuousiaggio in Italian (which was handled by none other than Dario Argento), which alternates excellent interpretations with other rather poor ones, but overall stands at good levels. Comment Dead Space is the perfect expression of classic survival horror on ~next gen~ platforms, with all the pros and cons that this entails. It fails to bring anything particularly new, confirming itself as a high school product, however linked to an extremely rigid game structure, which allows the player little freedom and risks being monotonous, also due to a not too engaging level design. But this would seem to be a calculated risk, dictated by EA's choice to remain faithful to a genre by some now considered old and tired, applying an impressive technical sector and bringing atmosphere and identification (the pillars of survival horror) to new levels of depth. without giving up a valid combat system. Pros Excellent technical realization Convincing combat system Interesting setting Cons Repetitive structure of the missions, in the long run Some narrative discrepancies Basically, nothing new Xbox 360 - Goals Dead Space contains 48 achievements for a total of 1000 points. The distribution of Gamerpoints is quite balanced, and reflects the typical structure of the objectives in a game based on the story and divided into levels. The simple progression in the game up to its conclusion involves the achievement of a good number of points, but if you want to delve clearly there is a need for a little more effort, with the achievement of certain requirements: a certain number of enemies killed, of repeated actions, or of particular use for each weapon, for example. Crafting is good The possibility of upgrading the equipment gives an additional layer of depth to the strategy of the combat system. Scattered throughout the levels are some workbenches that allow you to change the characteristics of your weapons, RIG or powers. These objects have some slots, arranged in particular tree patterns. Inside the slots must be inserted the precious energy nodes rarely found in the exploration of the ship (or purchasable at a high price from the shop), which allow the expansion of the power, capacity or reload speed of the weapon, an increase in energy maximum for the RIG or an increase in the effect and duration of the powers of kinesis and stasis. Obviously the rarity of the nodes makes it necessary to make choices on which elements to enhance and which characteristics to focus on.", "date": "2008-11-05", "grade": null}
