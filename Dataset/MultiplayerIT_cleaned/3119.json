{"name": "SnowRunner", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/snowrunner-recensione.html", "text": "After that of Spintirese MudRunner, the time has come for the review of SnowRunner. The arrival point of a story that begins from afar. It all starts in 2013 with a bet won on the Kickstarter platform, and that the following year would give birth to Spintires, a simulator like no other. Halfway between a game and a technical demo, this title immediately captured the attention of Steam users, selling 100,000 copies in just a few days. Numbers that will continue to increase, despite minimal post-launch support and gameplay that did everything to hinder the players. The fortune of Spintires is in fact in its innate charisma, the result of a physical simulation that still leaves you speechless today, after six long years, and a selection of titanic Soviet vehicles that were just waiting to be put to the test in impossible fords, slopes extremes and mud lakes. There is something mesmerizing in the extreme realism in which the huge machines of the Spintires perform on the rough terrain offered to them. The pressure of the cogwheels which opposes boulders and logs, the bubbling of the water between the suspensions, the yielding embrace of the deepest mud, while it slowly imprisons the diesel monster which, under our commands, tries to escape from it in black revs, tires and fatigue, it is physical and mechanical pornography that many cannot resist. Too bad that to convince players to move from one part of the map to another there were, originally, very little motivation. But it is just when Spintires could have started to take a few steps forward to enrich its gameplay, the creator of the game Pavel Zagrebelny comes into conflict with the publisher, suddenly the already gigantic evolution of the game stops permanently. Technical past Zagrebelny will avoid the spotlight for several years, reappearing in 2017 with the announcement of a new project. It's the turn of MudRunner, this time developed together with Saber Interactive for the French of Focus Interactive, people who usually see things short when it comes to niche titles with enormous unexpressed potential, just like that of Spintires. Released in 2017, MudRunner is not a real sequel to Spintires, it's more of a restart: the graphics are improved and the physics perfected, but above all a little order is made in the embryonic gameplay that animated the progenitor. However, MudRunner remains the same game as always, in which with ever more powerful means the player must make his way over impossible terrain to load, transport and deliver timber; all this without breaking the engine, running dry, rolling over or getting bogged down. As you would expect from a game designed and developed by a guy called Pavel Zagrebelny and which revolves around an uncompromising simulation, Both Spintires and MudRunner are afflicted by a long series of problems that make them indigestible to most: zero explanations , confused menus, smoky purpose, mechanics not exactly perfect or sometimes even a little broken. If you weren't and aren't accustomed to the coarseness of certain games, the so-called euro jank, it's really hard to get into the rhythm of these gameplays, yet despite everything, even MudRunner, like its revolutionary predecessor, quickly exceeds the million copies sold. Making gameplay real In the meantime, 2018 arrives, the year in which Pavel Zagrebelny together with Saber Interactive, always under the protective wing of Focus, reveal that they are working on MudRunner 2, a few months later renamed SnowRunner. An announcement that does not create great anticipation among the enthusiasts, by now almost all convinced that Zagrebelny's idea would never again have the right opportunity to improve concretely. At first glance, SnowRunner actually looks like another Spintires, only this time with mud colored white. The perception of the public, indeed of its public since SnowRunner remains unknown to most people, slowly changes with every statement from the developers, with every video diary uploaded on Youtube, where new game mechanics are revealed from time to time, new ideas on which the team is working. Month after month, the unsettling hypothesis that, for the first time, the series will be able to count on a figure that has always been missing, that of the game designer, is becoming more and more widespread; at the same time the fear emerges that with SnowRunner the series also wants to become more accessible by bastardizing its difficulty. Want to know how it went? SnowRunner does not give up on his impertinence, his indomitability, but builds around an idea, which we already know is unique and precious, a real game system, capable of making it much more friendly and understandable than expected.could ever aspire to be its predecessors. Contextualize the purpose With Saber Interactive behind it, not only can the game take advantage of better graphics (the old MudRunner engine has been ~merged~ together with theirs), but significant improvements are made to the entire game system which is enlarged, deepened and above all contextualised. Furthermore, unlike the previous games, SnowRunner was developed to become a real platform capable of hosting an increasing number of new mechanics, some of which are already shown together with all the contents of the appetizing season pass. But let's focus on contextualization, an apparently so unimportant aspect that alone can make the difference, especially in these games. Indeed, MudRunner and Spintires limit themselves to giving you a generic map in which to move wood from one sawmill to another, until the task is complete, while SnowRunner puts you in front of a scenario that gives meaning to all our efforts. For example, the first area of the game is a rural Michigan that has just been hit by a disastrous flood: this is enough to immediately feel part of a reconstruction that will start, together with a more than discreet tutorial, only with our arrival. And the more we explore the large map, the more the list of main and secondary missions will lengthen accordingly, but first it is definitely recommended to restore the most important road arteries. By delivering the various necessary materials, we will be able to rebuild bridges, free the road from huge electricity pylons that collapsed with the floods, save vehicles trapped in the most insidious mud and bring food to the isolated villages. This also means much more complex scenarios than those offered by Spintires and MudRunner, full of unique details, easily recognizable places and real towns made up of terraced houses, hotels, factories, bars and characteristic wooden churches. Regions and reasons As a result, the gameplay immediately turns out to be much more fun, engaging and varied, while remaining basically the same: you explore, drag, push, continuously battling with the surrounding environment. But in SnowRunner the progression almost seems like an RPG: by completing the missions and challenges, in addition to money, we will also collect experience that will give us the opportunity to advance in level, unlocking new vehicles and above all new upgrades. It is an exponential and well directed growth, although the game leaves the player totally free to move between the three different regions (Michigan, Alaska and the Russian Taymir), and to choose in which direction to concentrate his initial efforts. Great satisfaction awaits you when you manage to transform that initially clumsy truck into an irreplaceable companion in the most hostile territories, and it will give you even more to build your own fleet so you always have a vehicle ready to intervene, and in every corner of the map. Who goes slow... In the base game we will be able to use various cranes, sensors to extract oil, testing ourselves with exceptional transport and going in search of forgotten water pumps, loads swept away by the flood, but in the end it will always be a question of driving, for short and long journeys, in the snow, in the mud, in the jagged asphalt of suspended roads. In SnowRunner know that you go slow, sometimes slow as you go slow in other games when you forget the handbrake on: here every meter is a success that is worth a kilometer in normal situations. To get the better of the rough terrain of SnowRunner it is necessary to constantly read the terrain, choose the best roads according to the vehicle driven, avoiding getting bogged down or damaging the suspension and above all the engine, the designated victim of sudden bumps of dry dust, and d 'sudden plunges into torrents deeper than expected. There are situations in which the user suffers a profound discouragement, others in which he is so concentrated that he doesn't even feel emotions anymore, and these are the characteristics of a great human and mechanical challenge that I personally recommend you to experience. Defeating SnowRunner is equivalent to learning the use of low gears to your advantage, understanding when to activate and deactivate the differential, constantly challenging your limits. Yes, it's exhausting, impossible to hide it, sometimes it almost makes you cry, but what a satisfaction to finally arrive at your destination. The maps are the best (and the biggest) in the series also for the challenges they offer: swollen rivers that are waiting to sweep our articulated lorry downstream, low woods that push record trailers, ice roads, valleys that become prisons of powder snow, able marshesto imprison even the biggest wheels in the mud, downhill curves in which you only save yourself with a winch firmly planted on the sturdiest tree. And speaking of vegetation, the weight of the vehicle and its traction force also affect the way we will be able to interact with shrubs, fallen branches, younger trees and secular trunks that will bend until they crack or end up uprooted while we try to use them as handholds for the winch, or lifelines to avoid falling into the void. Meters as kilometers It's a lot of work, but you have to believe it: it's also extraordinarily relaxing in its own way. After all, we are faced with one of those rare cases in which for once the difficulty is not crossing the finish line first, riding a missile traveling at 300 km/h, but keeping a 100-ton colossus upright. SnowRunner totally overturns the concept behind the classic driving game, and this is also seen in the use of the camera which in this case, rather than dwelling on the road in front of us, is designed to always keep the contact of the wheels with the ground in sight . Here we reason in metres, not kilometres, even if kilometers are indeed made; and then there are those moments when you totally dominate the situation and can even dwell on the rest, on the scenery that is actually beautiful, on that lakeside road illuminated only by the headlights of your agile jeep and the moon. And then SnowRunner may be a pretty tough simulator, but fortunately knows when to sacrifice a little rigor in favor of fun. For example, we will be able to teleport to the controls of each vehicle left around the map, as well as in our main garage to choose and use another one. It's a bit like we were several workers at the same time, rather than a single driver, a structure that will also give us the opportunity to position different emergency vehicles on the map, such as intelligently scattering containers and trailers to optimize times. Imagine then that you are driving a truck, one step away from the objective, when night falls and, thanks to the weight of the load transported and an underestimated difference in height, you suddenly find yourself with your wheels in the air; in this case you can teleport the vehicle directly to the garage, but in doing so you will lose the load and a large part of the work done up to that moment, or jump onto a second vehicle to try to rescue the first. The more the explorable areas become impervious, the more it will be useful to have a well-displaced and well-specialized fleet, with powerful trucks equipped with cranes to straighten the heavier ~colleagues~, and more agile and faster engines to intervene in the event of a dry tank. The freedom granted to us in equipping each vehicle present is an integral part of the fun, and the secret of success in completing each game area 100% (this also means finding the hidden vehicles and upgrades scattered around). Note that for the first time in the history of the series, each region consists of multiple maps, and the highest paying missions sometimes use more than one. A beastly physics To make the enormous challenge that is placed before us even fun requires physics that are as complex as they are right, but this is a goal that the series has achieved since its debut. With SnowRunner this essential feature has been further refined, allowing the physics to work even where in the past it showed more limits: for example on normal asphalt. The real novelty here, however, is the debut of snow and ice, both beautifully made and able to further expand the types of terrain that we can and will have to face. Don't let the technicalities scare you: the real challenge is the driving itself, and you don't need to understand mechanics to best set up your vehicle. Even the selection of gears has been simplified so that the normal ones are automatic, and the special ones selectable at will, creating a mix that surprisingly seems to be able to satisfy all types of players. Graphically it has its limits, the world is rather static for example, but the graphics have really done a huge job to go beyond budget limits and SnowRunner, between superlative physics and breathtaking scenery, can be said to be a great game. Important steps forward have also been made as regards the user interface, the readability of the mechanics which are now many more, but some unpleasant situations remain in which the difficulty is not so much completing a mission but how the game wants let it be done. Luckily after a while you get the hang of it all, but it's a slop that these games definitely need to leave behind if they really want to grow.", "date": "2020-04-28", "grade": "8.3"}
