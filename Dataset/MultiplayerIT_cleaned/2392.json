{"name": "Foregone", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/foregone-recensione.html", "text": "The mingling of different genres always gives rise to interesting experiments and already in the past, when we tried this Foregone for the first time, the feedback was certainly positive, although it failed to shine with that proper light necessary to make it unforgettable. In fact, it is perfectly fine to rely on the pillars of the reference genres, but when the final result is a mixture of Dead Cells, Metroid and Dark Souls, at least the characteristic elements of those titles are expected to be reported, if not in a superior way, at least to a equal level. Instead, the work of Big Blue Bubble finds itself dancing in an uncomfortable limbo where comparisons in terms of level design and playability cannot be avoided, making the production leave with broken bones from the clash. Still, during our long ride through the realms of Calagan, we can't say we didn't enjoy ourselves. So let's find out what are the reasons for these chiaroscuro in our review of Foregone. An inevitable comparison Foregone: The Bosses are sublimely crafted In Foregone we take on the role of a judge, a race of modified soldiers, created to bring justice to the futuristic and technological lands of Calagan. The setting ready to welcome our heroine deliberately winks at the architecture of Dead Cells and tries to replicate that 2.5 of pure pixel art by exploiting the same colors, using tricks for the creation of already tasted levels but declining everything in a construction pre-established by metroidvania, wisely abandoning that procedural generation so dear to those who love the Roguelike. Foregone wants to tell a precise story through a specially created world, carefully positioning platform after platform and generating shortcuts and secret passages capable of connecting the play areas to each other as in Souls, or at least desperately trying to. The end result is actually a good attempt to replicate what has already been seen but with an extremely more linear and predictable sum between the parts, surpassed with much more ease even by that little gem that bears the name of Carrion. The story, however, is almost never highlighted by the few dialogues present, but rather told in a spannometric way by ancient tomes scattered throughout the playing area, with a system that did not fully convince us here, leaving us rather chills to the entire narrative. We therefore went ahead more for the sake of playing and overcoming the various challenges proposed, rather than being passionate about the story and discovering what the future had in store for us. Foregone: Enemies look like they came straight out of Dead Cells Not a huge effort anyway, given that the gameplay lets itself be embraced pleasantly with a discreet fluidity even if not at the levels we would have expected. We seem to be repeating ourselves but in reality Foregone's entire analysis can only proceed in this way: telling you how every smallest element introduced is truly one step away from excelling and then getting lost right at the most beautiful moment. The Arbiter's animations, for example, are fluid but often struggle to chain attacks together and even the most basic movement actions such as double jumps or slides to pass under traps, give the impression of being always untied. The enemies in the same way repeat the attack patterns with mechanical movements, celebrated correctly only through the boss fights, those that are truly sublime to see, and to fight. A continuous cycle until the end Foregone hides some interesting glimpses The gameplay of Foregone touches the foundations of the 2D metroidvania, providing the player with additional movement skills as the adventure continues, thus making the levels more varied and giving the possibility of performing melee and ranged shots, with a rather original. The ammunition of the guns, in fact, being decidedly more dangerous than the blows of white weapons, are present in limited numbers and, to reload, the players will not have to collect them around as one would expect but directly hit the enemies in close combat. In this way the fight becomes a continuous dance between the melee and ranged phases, alternating the dedicated styles of the various weapons. Foregone also offers a rather generous loot system, with a huge amount of items, weapons and armor constantly dropped by enemies. These pieces of equipment, divided by power level and rarity, can be upgraded by spending money or even reforged to obtain new suffixes through hidden special missions, a system that works broadly but which we found ratheror limiting in terms of the freedom it leaves the player to use the weapons he prefers. In our runs we have always had to rely on the best types of weapons dropped by the enemies, often having to settle for movements and attack speeds that did not go well with our playstyle, given that the difference in damage was clear between the various options. To give greater depth to the combat system, a whole series of skills are added, the balance of which however leaves something to be desired: the cure you will get in the very early stages of the game is essential and will be substantially impossible to abandon, combining it with only one other spell to be choose from the dozens available. Here too, as for the equipment, it will be possible to vary its effectiveness by enhancing the skills at the base camp, so as to build a single character together with the, meager, skill branches. All the resources necessary to level up items and obtain new skill points are obtained by destroying chests or defeating enemies, with the possibility of losing all the loot in case of death, unless you return to your corpse using the various checkpoints placed available from the game and recover the stolen goods exactly as happens in the most famous From Software series. Finally, to complete the title at its basic difficulty, it will not take you more than eight hours, a period of time sufficient for you to appreciate all the mechanics described up to now but which will leave you on the finish line rather saturated, hardly encouraging further runs on the difficulties higher.", "date": "2021-03-01", "grade": "7.0"}
