The question is simple: Gameloft had a real jewel in its hands, undoubtedly the best episode of the series as well as an excellent example of a mobile game that is anything but limited, endowed as it is with an extremely broad and full-bodied campaign, as well as a myriad of items to buy, resell or upgrade with the aim of making our character as powerful as possible and therefore allowing him to face the next quest with a few more chances of survival. This was exactly how things were and perhaps, who knows, it was thought that it would not have been fair to completely defeat the competition by proposing such a valid, well-directed experience with a great artistic impact. And so it was decided not only to resort to the freemium model, but to make this element central and essential. Every now and then sarcastic jokes appear on the net about how owners of tablets and smartphones are willing to pay figures now close to a thousand euros to grab the latest model of their favorite terminal, yet they get doubts and complexes when faced with in-app purchases from a few cents. Which is true, but it also depends on the situation: if Dungeon Hunter 4 required a cost of five, six, even ten euros to guarantee the absence of any limitation and an appropriate difficulty balance, probably no one would have problems shelling out this amount , considering the quality of the game as already mentioned. Without wanting to give up the attraction of free, therefore, it would have been possible and desirable to release the game as a trial, with the possibility of unlocking the entire package by paying a certain amount. The fact is that instead Gameloft has shown that it does not want to settle and aimed higher, introducing dynamics that even adapt the degree of general challenge and the damage (inflicted and suffered) based on the equipment, thus nullifying the efforts (incredible, ve we can assure you) lavished on getting a better weapon, better armor and an appropriate set of special skills. Fantastic Four There are four character classes that Dungeon Hunter 4 makes available to us, practically divided into two different ~styles~: on the one hand we find the Veteran and the Swordsman, two sides of the same coin, the first slow but endowed with greater resistance and of powerful manoeuvres, the latter agile and snappy but not as incisive; on the other hand there are the Fighting Mage and the Sentinel, who offer the same balance of strength, with the first hitting hard from a distance but struggling to move quickly, while the second shoots his arrows quickly and manages to escape at the same time to the sorties of the enemy. We are talking about two styles because in fact the gaming experience changes substantially if you choose the ~brawler~ solution rather than the ~long range~ one: in the first case we have on the right of the touch screen a button for attacking and an approach to clashes based mostly on individual characteristics, in which the strongest and most resistant always wins, in perfect MOBA style given the presence of special abilities that can mix the cards on the table and turn the tide of a fight; in the second case, however, the attacks are carried out from a distance and instead of the attack button there is a second virtual analog stick, as in the twin analog shooters, a factor which, with a little strategy, allows you to eliminate enemies without being touched, as long as you have sufficient power to stop its advance (otherwise they are peas gone bad). Once the character has been chosen, a spectacular cinematic introduction starts showing how the prosperous kingdom of Valenthia is currently under siege by infernal forces that threaten to destroy it completely. We urgently need a leader to lead the counterattack, and it goes without saying that it will be up to you to fulfill this role Dungeon Hunter 4 is an extraordinary action RPG, whose experience is however undermined by insistent IAPs The multiplayer modes Dungeon Hunter allows you to replay each completed quest in cooperative mode or enter competitive modes such as the traditional team or individual deathmatch, for up to six participants. Unfortunately it seems that these days users have focused on the single player campaign, given that it is very difficult to find someone online for a game; and so we were only able to try the co-op, however experiencing problems that were far from negligible in terms of lag. Need an update... You are morto. Again. After a relatively short but rather complete tutorial section, we find ourselves facing the first quests and appreciating the excellent work done by the developers with regard to the simple but satisfying combat system and the technical sector, which shows off scenarios not particularly original but splendid in composition, color and detail. The sensation is often that of moving inside a hand-painted picture, in which very little is left to chance, even if some places tend to repeat themselves (see the inside of the mills). The animations are also excellent, which lack just a few more connections to reach levels never seen in the mobile sector, while on the sound front things are not convincing in the same way: excellent music, but the effects sometimes leave something to be desired. As mentioned at the beginning, Dungeon Hunter 4 focuses heavily on the amount of objects that can be collected during exploration and which, based on their value, we can decide to use and enhance or to resell to raise more gold. Coins are dispensed with relative generosity and at a certain point it is enough to repeat certain quests to be able to collect respectable sums, but items such as healing potions (essential during the longest and most difficult quests) or certain weapons and armor can only be purchased using the hard currency, diamonds, which are clearly paid for with real money. We therefore arrive at the obvious limits of experience, which we can identify with a management of IAPs that is really too invasive, which pushes beyond all limits on the difficulty to convince us to put our hands on our wallets. Is it possible to play without paying? During our tests we tried to ascertain it, reaching the eighteenth level of experience with a Veteran and completing something like a third of the available missions, but at the cost of great sacrifices in terms of grinding. Fans of desperate deeds, those who may have enjoyed Dark Souls, may even appreciate the perverse charm of this interpretation, the problem is that the reasons behind these choices are so obvious that it is impossible to ignore them.", "date": "2013-04-15", "grade": "7.2"}
