{"name": "Wario Ware Twisted!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wario-ware-twisted-2.html", "text": "Spin the ball Wario Ware Twisted! starts from the same premises that characterize the other episodes of the series, offering the user a vast series of simple mini-games lasting a handful of seconds, divided equally between the bizarre characters that populate the game. However, if the directional cross and the A key were used in the first Wario Ware and in the more recent Touched! the Nintendo DS touchscreen and microphone, in this Twisted! the vast majority of internships are solvable solely by tilting and twirling the GBA. The motion sensor implemented in the particular game cartridge therefore becomes the focal point on which the entire structure of the Nintendo product is based. The results are astonishing: Wario Ware Twisted! proves to be even more immediate than its predecessors, also enriched by a plethora of minigames as crazy as they are fun. And yet another applause must be given to the Japanese developers, capable of filling the game with stages that often leave you amazed by the variety of situations and the deviated underlying intelligence that they are always able to show. On paper, a title based almost exclusively on the physical movement of the handheld would inevitably seem destined to be flat and repetitive: Wario Ware Twisted! however it proves the exact opposite. Oozing creativity from every pore, the Nintendo product puts the player in front of crazy situations to say the least, all characterized by the leitmotif of rotation. They range from more or less ~conventional~ stages in which you have to tilt the console in order to move spheres, objects or anything else towards a specific destination to others that offer extremely bizarre challenges: you therefore find yourself moving a razor to make the shaving an on-screen character, unrolling toilet paper rolls, swinging a samurai sword to defend against opponents' attacks, directing sunlight to grow a plant, and so much more. All by simply rotating the GBA, with only some concessions to the joint use of the A key and with the single exception of a set of levels designed exclusively to be enjoyed in the classic way. Like its predecessors, Wario Ware Twisted! is a title whose enormous variety of situations is really difficult to describe: you have to try it to believe it. Minigames matryoshka As seen in Touched!, Wario Ware Twisted! rewards the player with a whole series of goodies, mini-minigames that accumulate within a special section as they are unlocked. The amount of material in this area is truly remarkable, as is its almost poetic uselessness: most of the extras in question are in fact resolved into mere exercises in dementia by the developers, which certainly don't constitute a great incentive to the longevity of the game but which are definitely capable of eliciting more than a few laughs. As those who have had the opportunity to play at least one episode of the Wario Ware series will well know, however, the exceptional humor of Nintendo products derives as much from the insane game mechanics as from the crazy uniqueness of the audiovisual style. The graphics section of Twisted! therefore follows the multiplicity of game situations proposed with various cosmetic formulas, one more amusing than the other: therefore screens that seem drawn by a child find space alongside others consisting of digitized images, then continuing with stages that recall the style of the old titles for NES and so on. The beauty is that practically every level presents an animation, a writing, a figure or a quote capable of arousing hilarity in those who are able to grasp it. Even the sound has a good job in defining the absolutely insane and light-hearted setting of Wario Ware Twisted!: the music and effects that form the background of the action could not be more adequate, with captivating and ridiculous tunes and the unmistakable voices of the characters of the game that incite the user in his path. Comment Wario Ware Twisted! confirms the goodness of the minigame-oriented formula of the bizarre Nintendo series, adding the original and amusing element of rotation as the main control system to a winning gameplay. Limiting only in appearance, the management of the various mini-games through the movement of the GBA is not only extremely intuitive, but opens the way to even more bizarre and intelligent scenarios, which make Wario Ware Twisted! a fun product like few others. The congenital limit of effective longevity remains, mitigated only briefly by the presence of an enormous amount of extras: but for the type of use for which the title was designed, this does not constituteess that a small mole in a production that is excellent in all respects. Pros: Immediate and very entertaining Excellent audiovisual sector Hilarious situations and characters Cons: Not exceptional longevity Lots of extras ... but useless With the Wario Ware series, Nintendo has been able to create an almost perfect synthesis of the concept of casual gaming. Very easy to assimilate, fast, disengaged and incredibly fun and engaging, the mini-games protagonists of Wario Ware not only lend themselves to an extremely large catchment area, but constitute the best the GBA has to offer for a quick game in their spare time newspapers. And the tradition continues brilliantly with this new Wario Ware Twisted!", "date": "2005-05-02", "grade": null}
