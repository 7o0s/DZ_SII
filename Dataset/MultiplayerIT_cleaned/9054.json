{"name": "Amarcord l'orrore", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/93762-resident-evil-4-hd-amarcord-lorrore.html", "text": "Version tested: Xbox 360 In the Resident Evil series, the fourth chapter plays a role of primary importance. Seminal, perhaps, as much as the legendary progenitor, capable of leaving an indelible mark on all those who have had the opportunity to play it thoroughly, as well as distorting the concept of classic survival horror. It was 2005 when Resident Evil 4 arrived on Gamecube, after an interminable wait during which Capcom decided to radically change its appearance several times, showing ever more promising demos even if with a discordant appearance in the E3 that unfolded between 2000 and 2004 , up to risking everything on total innovation in game mechanics and in the aesthetic aspect. After the apotheosis and the consecration of the first chapter carried out with Rebirth, the Zero had shown that the classic setting had probably reached its limit, a playful structure now stretched by the hair that seemed to creak dangerously under the burden of traditional mechanics. Resident Evil 4 then boldly presented itself as a third-person shooter, displacing the public and dividing it between enthusiastic supporters and traditionalist detractors. In any case, enthralling everyone, in one way or another, even pushing the purchase of exotic Japanese magazines just to have the opportunity to try the demo ahead of time and somehow while away the wait before the release. If the recent flourishing of high-definition re-releases is to be a way to appreciate the masterpieces of the early 2000s, more than simple marketing operations that leverage nostalgia, then Resident Evil 4 has every right to be part of this group of titles, giving the possibility of being able to enjoy a game that is still valid and fun despite the past years. Already this, in the early obsolescence that characterizes the world of video games, is no small thing, although it was legitimate to expect something more from Capcom than a simple increase in resolution on a base that has remained unchanged and sold, after almost seven years, at a good 20 euro. A revolution The digression represented by Resident Evil 4 in terms of gameplay is also confirmed by the story, probably the most demarcated from the classic mythology of the series. Leon S. Kennedy is sent to an area of the European hinterland (unspecified, although the beings the protagonist comes across speak with a bizarre Hispanic accent) to recover Ashley, the daughter of the US President kidnapped by a mysterious organization, behind to which of course the offshoots of Umbrella will be discovered. The game illustrates Leon's long journey through various environments, focusing mainly on the exteriors and encountering large-scale battles, as opposed to the usually single encounters that characterized the mansions of the previous chapters. The game mechanics are completely different from the first Resident Evil: the fourth chapter is to all intents and purposes a shooter with a third person view and a dynamic ~over the shoulder~ shot that follows the movements of the protagonist (another epochal revolution for the series) , in which you find yourself fighting against large numbers of enemies using various types of weapons. The puzzles of the first chapters are found here less frequent and generally more elementary but it is possible to interact with various elements of the scenario in a contextual way, which triggers different situations and breaks the monotony of the action. What amazed and still strikes about Resident Evil 4 is the harmony of its parts and the validity of the overall play package: despite the experimental nature of the game, completely freed from a structure that - despite all its defects - could guarantee the successful at least with fans, Capcom has managed to put together a cohesive and exciting title, long and - which is not obvious, considering the classic mechanics of survival horror - fun. The settings, mostly open, follow one another by imposing an ever-increasing rhythm while the new aiming system makes firefights with enemies truly fun for the first time, divided into various types and each characterized by its own specific weak points. Other characteristic introductions of this chapter, capable of introducing strategic elements, is the management of the inventory based on the ~flat surface~ occupied by the objects and the possibility of buying, selling and upgrading weapons, armor and various equipment thanks to the introduction of the legendary ubiquitous merchant. Xbox 360 goals One of the few innovations introduced by the high definition version to the original structure of Resident Evil 4 are obviously the unlockable achievementsili. Only 12 achievements share the loot of 1000 gamerpoints, so each of these is quite substantial in terms of score. Considering that most of the objectives are related to the progression in the story, a first conclusion of the game already allows you to collect a good part of the 1000 total points. The Chronicles of Leon The siege inside the little house in the village, with the improvised barricades moving wardrobes in front of the doors and the anguish of the enemies penetrating through the windows, the encounter with El Gigante, the storm that catches us in the woods just after the clash with Del Lago and again the arrival between rain and thunder at the isolated church, the entrance to the huge monastery, the numerous battles with the bosses, there are so many topical moments in Resident Evil 4 as to make it one of the most memorable experiences of the last gaming decade. These are the merits of the title dated 2005, to which however this remastering adds absolutely nothing, with the increase in resolution which is not enough to compensate for the inevitable aging of the game and even less to justify the imposed price of 20 euros, really too high when you consider that this is essentially a slight adaptation of the PC version released at the time. Furthermore, high definition does not forgive the maintenance of old textures, enhancing their imperfections and coarseness. Fortunately, the solidity of the original graphic system has allowed it to withstand the onslaught of time in an excellent way, but the fact remains that more could have been done, if not a real remake at least a more accurate reworking. The same problem arises from a content point of view, given that no extras, new portions of the game or additional modes have been added: the package has remained exactly the same as it was at the time, including the control system which already didn't shine for convenience (also if compared to the previous chapters it was a bolt of war), but since this has also remained unchanged in Resident Evil 5 we can now consider it a stylistic feature of the series.", "date": "2011-09-28", "grade": "8.8"}
