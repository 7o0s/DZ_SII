{"name": "FPS in digital delivery", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/78956-blacklight-tango-down-fps-in-digital-delivery.html", "text": "Tested version: Xbox 360Through Xbox Live and PlayStation Network, developers finally have the opportunity to channel releases that would have little visibility on the normal market, for this reason the trivial cost/revenue calculation would not allow their development and publication. The agile download structures of the two consoles, on the other hand, make it possible to enter users' homes by greatly limiting costs, with mutual benefit, without considering that thanks to digital delivery, even independent projects of high quality but too ~weak~ can come to light for the traditional market. Having made this necessary premise, it is clear that we are about to talk about a game that has been available for a few days on Xbox Live and which will soon also be downloadable via PSN. The title in question is Blacklight: Tango Down. Born for online multiplayer The developers of Zombie Studios set out to create a first person shooter that had nothing to envy at least from the point of view of the multiplayer game to famous triple A titles, such as the Call of Duty / Modern Warfare and Battlefield series. This new downloadable game at the price of 1200 MP (14.40 euros) and which occupies more than 700 MB on the console's hard disk is in fact dedicated almost exclusively to the online experience. Set in the near future with two feuding factions, the Blacklight, a U.S. special force. equipped with the best technological gadgets and cutting-edge weapons, they are called to investigate the disappearance of one of its members caused by terrorists known as The Order, rebel former soldiers of the special forces, everything turns into an open fight between the two groups. What is a bit strange is that playing normally you never get to know this information, we recovered it in the Help / Options / How to play menu, certainly some effort could have been made to make the scenario more understandable of war and therefore increase identification. Blacklight: Tango Down without many preambles immediately puts the player on the battlefield, after choosing a type of arsenal (there are many combinations and by playing you unlock weapons and customizations) and the type of game among the seven modes provided. All the traditional challenges are present: Deatmatch and Team Deatmatch, i.e. the trivial free-for-all competitions and team killings, then Retrieval which is none other than Capture the Flag, Domination which involves conquering and maintaining it for a while time of some territories, the Last Man Standing mode and its team variant and then Detonate which involves recovering a bomb in the middle of the map and placing it in the enemy base. There is really a lot of irons on the fire if we think that all these modes are playable on 12 different maps. Xbox 360 goals 200 points divided into 12 objectives which are not exactly easy to obtain, it is in fact necessary to master all the modalities very well and obtain many victories in order to increase our skill and rank. Weapons and more The control system for all players accustomed to playing Call of Duty, Halo and all the latest fps has nothing new, left stick to move and right dedicated to the view, back triggers to shoot and throw grenades. The real novelty of this war of the future is given by the augmented reality viewer that helps us on the battlefield, partly reminiscent of what we saw in Ghost Recon Advance Warfighter, pressing one side of the d-pad activates a visual capable of immediately identifying the position of the enemy, allies and any objectives. An excellent aid for orientation that lasts only a few seconds and could only be so given that by consulting this data the fighter is completely defenceless. So be careful to activate it only in covered positions away from enemy fire. The arsenal is very rich and you can choose between pistols, SMGs, assault rifles, sniper rifles and shotguns, as mentioned, going on with the number of games you unlock various accessories and gadgets that help customize your weapons. The large number of weapons and upgrades are not exactly perfect, we noticed that there is absolutely no balance between the different war machines, the snipers are too weak and the SMGs too devastating, as well as the assault rifles. The grenades are almost unusable since their launch is too imprecise, the weapons that allow you to disturb the viewers are never used and only explosive mines are used. If the multiplayer part is the true heart of the game, we cannot ignore that there is a mode called Black Ops designed specifically for single player and cooperative play fup to 4 players with the aim of advancing in the individual levels by exterminating The Order and the infected SIV (poisoned civilians who move madly on the screen). In searching for matches we weren't exactly very lucky and we were left waiting for several minutes, we hope it's just an initial problem and that with the spread of the game these times will be reduced a lot. From online games we have noticed another problem too delicate to be overlooked in the review phase, the respawn points are too frequently easily targeted by opponents and this transforms matches into trivial pigeon shots.", "date": "2010-07-12", "grade": "7.0"}
