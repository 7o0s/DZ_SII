At a time when Japanese development seemed unable to mesh with the next gen, the Osaka house seemed to want to attack the times with an innovative and deeply strategic solution. The results collected later were not the most convincing, so as to suggest that behind a genuine desire to get away from a difficult moment, in truth, a line of conduct and a real creative strategy were missing. Thus, when DmC - Devil May Cry was presented with a renewed protagonist and development entrusted to the care of the British Ninja Theory team, the spell was already past and the winding disillusionment began to emerge as real distrust, accomplice a profoundly different representation of a historical protagonist rooted in the videogame imagination like Dante, hastily labeled as an emo reinterpretation that can be easily marketed to the new young audience and thus antagonizing an army of passionate fans of the series and of the old character. Few had taken into account that talent resides in that development team, which despite the fluctuating results collected so far has manifested itself in a particular vision of the video game as an expressive medium. Supported by a solid gameplay base, perhaps provided by those who understand this sector - precisely like Capcom - this vision could have led to an explosive result. Despite some imperfections, so it was: DmC - Devil May Cry is probably the best Ninja Theory game (or at least the most balanced in every aspect) and an excellent chapter in Capcom's historic action series. If on the one hand the game dares to overturn the series in its characterization, proposing a protagonist with a less irrepressible charisma but immersed in a more defined and rigorous script, on the other hand the gameplay is firmly anchored to the Capcom tradition, albeit with some added features in terms of level design. A combination that, all in all, fully convinces. A demonic libertine Strengthened by a great work done in the artistic field, Ninja Theory did not have awe in proposing his particular vision of Dante and the Devil May Cry universe. There is a scene, within the first missions, which seems to symbolize the developers' attitude towards tradition: in the midst of the chaos, a white wig somehow flies on the protagonist's head, who, looking in the mirror, states ~ not even a clue!~ (or something like that) and dismissively takes it off. However, it would be simplistic to flatten the team's innovative drive on a stylistic issue linked to character design. Ninja Theory's approach, with its particular way of staging a story in the form of a video game, is evident in the narrative structure and in the cutscenes. The difference with the past chapters seems to present a parallel with the different videogame conceptions that characterize many Eastern action games compared to Western ones. The old Dante was irrepressible, charismatic and over the top, able to catalyze attention and shoulder all the weight of a screenplay that is not always defined, resulting memorable in its recklessness. The new Dante shares part of the ~badass~ attitude of the original, but folded within a more structured story, with stronger relationships with the supporting actors and greater emotional facets (in this sense we can properly speak of the discussed prefix ) and sentimental. Dante's ~origins~ are those staged in DmC, an operation that has much in common with similar comics productions, digging into the personality of a well-defined character in the common imagination and revealing new aspects. Similarly, the idea of bringing the metaphysical world of demons and angels into a contemporary reality in which the devil hides behind consumerism, the media and finance is an original and even courageous idea, in the narrow narrative boundaries of an action game. The story of Dante and Vergil, together with the new entry Kat, and their war on Mundus takes on an epic scale, inserted in a frame more rooted in the reality of the human world. Moreover, the excellent idea of the parallel dimensions of human reality and limbo that intersect contributes to this feeling, distorting the realistic setting in a nightmare of absurd shapes and lurking demons. It is clear that being a game aimed firmly at frenzied action there is not much room for introspectionnor psychological, therefore the evolution of Dante's character and his relationships is compressed in a rather hasty way between one mission and another, just as the social critique of the post-modern world appears rather coarse, but that is enough, together with a directed at times truly exciting, to build a solid narrative foundation. Angels and Demons We talked about the mechanics of the game in a rather in-depth way in the previous hands-on (in particular in the recent test and in the Gamescom 2012 article), so let's avoid repeating in detail the long list of moves and weapons available to Dante. The combat system is played in particular on the alternation between demonic and angelic weapons, capable of causing different damage depending on the characteristics of the enemies, with the constant support of the basic sword and firearms, used above all as a diversion or remote enemy containment system and the further variant added by the ~Devil Trigger~, Dante's demonic transformation which modifies the power of the attacks by consuming its own specific energy, paying homage to the ~old~ protagonist with a nostalgic white hair. The search for complex and elegant attack solutions, the execution of more or less spectacular combos is driven more by the race for the high score than by a real need on the gameplay front, at least at normal difficulty levels, but the system evaluation of the player's behavior in real time, through a continuous calculation of scores and multipliers based on the ~style~ of combat, tends to push even the most pragmatic to the most imaginative solutions possible. Instead, the change of weapons is another matter: the need to quickly switch from one to another is constant, especially in the more advanced levels where the waves of enemies are made up of varied elements that each require a specific approach. From this point of view, there is a lack of a lock-on system on specific objectives, which forces you to go a little blind at certain moments, diminishing the strategic potential of changing weapons to differentiate attacks. The response to the commands in the combat phases is excellent and the combos to be performed are relatively simple but numerous, which allows for a great variety of attack solutions and pushes us to diversify the action, even if only for the satisfaction of seeing the score rise and enthusiastic reviews. On the other hand, the ~stylish~ approach to combat, a founding feature of the series, is also an excellent way to avoid the real danger of monotony, making every fight exciting. The array of weapons allows for numerous approaches to battle, and the feeling of power that many moves are capable of conveying is almost intoxicating once you learn how to best control Dante. There is a certain leveling down of the difficulty, at least as regards the medium level, but the presence of four extra modes to unlock in addition to the Bloody Palace, which pose very demanding challenges, will satisfy even the most demanding hardcore gamer, with the additional ability to compare scores online. The bosses present aren't many compared to the number of missions and despite the undoubted spectacularity of the scenes, they probably don't represent those climactic moments that we might expect in a game of this kind: the attack patterns re-propose somewhat trite solutions, such as the need to hit secondary objectives before focusing on the main ~body~, without presenting particularly creative solutions in terms of gameplay, even if there is no lack of the typical sense of satisfaction once the conclusion is reached and some situations are decidedly engaging. In line with the past chapters, Dante's evolution system is presented, with the typical ~shop~ in which to spend experience points on new skills and attack and defense moves. Similarly, the red globes collected for the levels can be invested here in the purchase of items useful for recharging or expanding the protagonist's energy and the Devil Trigger bar or in the possibility of ~resurrecting~ once shot down. Variegated with a platform flavour If the combat system has remained anchored to the tradition of the series, the Ninja Theory have tried in some way to enhance the level design, hybridizing the classic structure with some platform-style elements that manage well to vary the game action and add new thickness to the gameplay, opening the door to an important replayability, although these elements are not exactly free from problems. The clashes with the waves of enemies therefore alternateexploration phases that do not disdain the use of precision in jumping between platforms, like from the old school. The mixed structure is also reflected in the use of Dante's demonic and angelic weapons, which now also have applications in movement within the levels. Arbiter and Osiris, in the presence of particular hooking points, can be used as grappling hooks able to make the protagonist move from one point of the settings to another or to move sections of the scenario to create new footholds or open the way ( as well as hooking and attracting enemies, during fights). It is a solution that paves the way for a more complex and varied level design, which requires not only moments of precision on jumps and movement control, but also greater attention to the hidden elements of the scenario. There are numerous secondary roads, secret doors and bonuses scattered around the levels that may go unnoticed on a first pass, or are impossible to reach because they await the acquisition of higher powers by the protagonist. It therefore becomes necessary to return later to the missions already completed in order to discover all the hidden contents and to reach some areas it becomes necessary to explore the environments with an attention that is not obvious in a game of this kind. All this adds further depth to the action and significantly increases the longevity of the game, which in itself is not bad even if limited to a first passage: around 10 hours for a first conclusion without going into much exploration of the levels is already a good figure , considering the genre, but if you intend to unlock some content and discover everything that is hidden in the various missions, the time lengthens significantly. Unfortunately, there are also imperfections in these ~platform~ situations: it is not always easy to evaluate distances exactly and Dante's aerial control is not the best in precision and if we add to this some sporadic problems of contact with surfaces and a camera which often requires to be called manually to better frame the obstacles, it is clear that this new gameplay component perhaps requires a little further refinement, but the one undertaken by Ninja Theory to deepen the structure of Devil May Cry is certainly an excellent one . Xbox 360 goals 48 achievements for the usual total of 1000 points are hidden within DmC - Devil May Cry. The achievements are distributed quite evenly throughout the game, with some unlockable simply by advancing from level to level and overcoming the proposed topical moments and others with a progressive structure that require the achievement of certain performances during the games. A first complete run through the game already guarantees a good number of points, but the real challenge is for the more enterprising collectors. Distorted visions The artistic direction of Ninja Theory leaves a notable imprint on the imagination of Devil May Cry, proposing an interpretation of excellent workmanship and characterized by an incisive personality and style, from the excellent ~Caravaggio-style~ artwork to the in-game graphics. The presence of parallel dimensions has allowed the graphics to range with the imagination, distorting metropolitan settings into impossible figures, or indulge themselves in infernal, dreamlike or simply absurd levels. The ~normal~ metropolitan settings refer to the big European cities, in particular London and Barcelona, but when the dimensions get confused within Limbo the structures lose all contact with reality, bending into a nightmare of distorted shapes, or into visions dreamlike cities suspended in the void, in which Dante finds himself hovering between pieces of streets, facades and semi-destroyed buildings. The transition from reality to limbo allows you to range between extremely diversified settings and there is no lack of references to the old gothic style, intertwined with the visionary scenography of the development team, up to truly particular peaks of bizarreness and inspiration, such as the level set in the disco, which offers a rather unique audio-visual experience. It is also thanks to this characteristic style that DMC - Devil May Cry manages in part to distance itself from the classic derivative elements inherent in the Unreal Engine 3, which also emerge here and there during the game. Certain effects applied to the textures and certain reflections with an almost ~lysergic~ look, in addition to the occasional problems of synchrony in the resolution of the textures, seem a little familiar, something common to the infinity of titles built on the Epic engine, but they are noticeable here much less", "date": "2013-01-14", "grade": "8.8"}
