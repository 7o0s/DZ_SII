{"name": "Below", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/below-recensione-ps4.html", "text": "A year and a half after its release on Xbox One and PC, here's our review of Below for PS4. A game that arrives on the Sony console unchanged on the one hand, but also with a tasty novelty, designed for all those who want to approach the game in a more relaxed way: the Exploration mode. Below's editorial history is full of ups and downs. Presented with great pomp during the E3 2013 Microsoft conference, the Capybara Games game disappeared from the radar for several years, until it re-emerged 5 years later in the form we all know. A shape that, as our review of the Xbox One version explains very well, has failed to fully convince. The developer, the studio famous for games such as Superbrothers: Sword & Sorcery and Super Time Force, has not been able to find a perfect synthesis between its souls, giving a title that is extremely artistically inspired, but with a few too many edges. Survival, the original mode Below's base mode arrives on PlayStation 4 virtually unchanged. After a long prologue in which we see a brave hero arriving on an abandoned island, we will have to struggle to figure out how to survive the many deadly dangers that lurk in the depths of the earth. As we said, Below mixes many elements together in a rather original mix : you need to find material and supplies around the levels in order to survive and stay healthy, you have to fight the many enemies like in the classic The Legend of Zelda and you have to explore the levels in a rather similar way to what we saw in Dark Souls: man as you explore the depths of the earth, in fact, you will find secret passages and shortcuts that can simplify navigation between the different parts of the island. Making the homage even stronger is the fact that the checkpoints are represented by bonfires between which it is also possible to navigate instantly. Other elements taken from the souls-like are the luminous spheres left by each defeated enemy which also serve to enhance the bonfires, the need to return to where we were killed in order to recover the materials collected up to that moment and the general difficulty which punishes every minimum mistake. The levels, in addition to being full of enemies and sprawling, in fact, are full of often lethal traps and other jokes of this kind that can suddenly interrupt a game at the most beautiful moment, with the consequent frustrations. This element, plus the continuous need to keeping vital parameters high, crafting mechanisms that are not particularly in-depth and a combat system that is not very complex and technical have prevented Below from breaching the heart of our Emanuele Gregori and many other players. Exploration, for a more relaxed game To meet those who would like a slightly more relaxed mode and try to solve some of the problems that have emerged in recent months, Capybara Games has decided to develop the Exploration mode. This new mode debuts together with the PlayStation 4 version, but will also arrive as a free update on PC and Xbox One. In the Exploration mode the player will be asked to arrive on the island, fight and, precisely, explore without the need to think also to their livelihood. In other words, it is a simplified mode, focused on the adventurous components of Below, which on the one hand sets aside the entire survival part of the game, on the other it slightly facilitates exploration. The purpose of Capy Games is to place more emphasis on the best qualities of the product, so as to transform Below into a more action and dynamic experience, in which to be able to proceed more quickly to discover the island, all its secrets and of the dreamlike and mysterious plot of the game. Coming to PS4 Another element that emerges strengthened by this ~simplification~ is the artistic side of the game. By placing more emphasis on exploration and not survival, you also have more time to admire the work done by Capybara Games. From this point of view, the Canadian studio has done a commendable job, with spot-on directorial choices - able to give spectacularity from a bird's eye view that usually doesn't lend itself to this kind of thing - and excellent taste. Between an architecture that brings to mind Monument Valley, an outing in the tall grass that recalls The Legend of Zelda and the bonfires that recall Souls, the eyes come out decidedly satisfied by this descent into the bowels of the island of Below . The conversion to PlayStation 4 has kept all its qualities unchanged. Our test on a PS4 Pro did not highlight any particular frame rate problems or any bugs, allowing us in thisway to have an optimal experience and to focus on exploration, fights and atmospheres. Atmospheres also guaranteed by the excellent soundtrack, never intrusive, but able to accompany the action in the best way, through distant rumbles of thunder and rather evocative music. Overall, therefore, a job done in a professional manner, without particular strokes of genius, but solid enough to allow correct use also on PlayStation 4.", "date": "2020-04-07", "grade": "7.5"}
