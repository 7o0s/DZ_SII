Since the number three entered the world of entertainment by force, how many of you - over the years - have not unconsciously associated the final part of a triptych with the desire for a closure with fireworks? We did it here, in the last lines. After an awkward, anonymous, unconvincing start, From Software has corrected the shot, leaving ample room for improvements, allowing fans to fantasize. After months of teasers, debates, heated discussions about a ~lore~ mystified and enriched by fans, Crown of the Ivory King responds to all this? Yes, but still not completely. We repeat it again, at the risk of being boring: excellence is expected from excellence, and Crown of the Ivory King only partially satisfies. A very good part, it is true; a conspicuous section, structurally above sufficiency, aesthetically fascinating for setting and chosen atmosphere. But something continues to screech under the surface, underlining our criticism of a now certified idleness of From Software in coloring all the bosses of its DLCs with epicness, and not just a part of them. But we'll talk about this a little further down. The Dark souls 2 crown trilogy ends well, but with some general reservations. Ivory and chaos Without going into details and spoilers, Eleum Loyce is a splendid setting, thoroughly thought out and reasoned, embedded in the narrative fabric with a different and unexpected look. The architecture meets the fantasy standards of a kingdom lost in the grip of ice, raped by non-random storms but characterized by pleasant playful implications. Tradition teaches that in Souls no piece is placed at random, and this satellite section of Lordran that the Japanese have chosen - as always reachable by a teleporter - responds in full. From the very first steps, the team inserts the player into the plot, thanks to scripted events that envelop this DLC in its own charisma. Thanks also to an excellent dubbing, the voice that accompanies the journey is a stimulus to an advancement that finally opens up to explanations in the finale; for once, the typical cryptic nature of the saga is set aside, allowing a clear understanding of the events that led to the disappearance of the ivory king. Ice has always been a faithful companion of early fantasy, almost an archetype in its own right, and perhaps it is also for this reason that Eleum Loyce's art is so pleasant to savour. It is no coincidence that the Painted World of Ariamis and Priscilla of the first Dark Souls is one of the most beautiful and evocative settings of the whole saga, as well as the Crystal Cave. From seems to infuse all its best ideas into the ice, and also in this case the greatest playful satisfactions - in terms of inventiveness and gameplay - derive precisely from the cold. Copy, paste, fight As in Crown of the Old Iron King, acquiring a certain item will open the advancement. If before some roads, chests and enemies were blocked by ice and storms that extinguished every torch, the activation of the event removes the veil from the heart of the DLC. The gimmick of forcing at least two laps to discover everything that the disappearance of the cold was hiding is appreciable; the backtracking is quite fast, fluid even in the level design, albeit with inspirational ups and downs. We also welcome flashes of genius in conceiving some enemies - one wraith in particular - and the final setting. The main problem of this content, unfortunately, does not differ much from what was found in the previous episodes: the bosses. It is unacceptable that for the third time in a row, From Software allows itself to offer an objectively insufficient unique enemy pool. The clash and the design of Aava are remarkable, particular, absolutely noteworthy elements; but the remaining bosses are clones of Aava herself on one side and the classic humanoid clash on the other. Considering what has already been proposed in Crown of the Old Iron King, we would have expected a final fight fuller of ideas and uniqueness. They are not ugly, just very anonymous, forgettable; calculating how much the frozen setting offers itself as a starting point for an exceptional bestiary, it is a great pity that From has archived the practice with such speed. The trilogy of crowns therefore comes to an end, leaving good sensations but also a lot of bitterness in the mouth. Crown of the Ivory King is probably the best content of the three, capable of satisfying even the deepest thirst for ~lore~; impactful chromatic and stylistic choices, however, leave room for a characterization of the bosses - the true fulcrum of the Souls -once again below the sufficiency and sometimes clearly recycled. A nice content, the right conclusion, certainly the easiest of the lot to recommend; but from From Software we would have expected a trilogy of more impactful DLCs. Many of you, driven by passion, will have already invested in the pass, so we can only wish you to enjoy this fluctuating trio of contents to the fullest. Hoping that in the next Dark Souls all day-one buyers will be able to appreciate the whole game in the same way, without spending other money on the side. After all, a year ago, they were the ones who promised it, remember?", "date": "2014-10-03", "grade": null}
