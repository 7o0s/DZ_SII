That this takes place on a digital delivery channel instead of the risky and more rigid traditional path of retail is certainly no coincidence. Trials Evolution is in fact the sequel to that Trials HD which represented the debut of the RedLynx series on consoles in mid-2009 after two chapters that appeared on PC; a game that he managed to conquer thanks to a formula as challenging as it was rewarding, and which contributed largely to highlighting the Finnish team until its acquisition by Ubisoft in 2011. Shall we change the muffler? With this sequel, RedLynx certainly wanted to take the time to reach the desired level without too many worries; the formula of ~it will be released when it is ready~ has been repeated several times during the development of the game, a clear sign of a healthy and promising production process. And Trials Evolution is actually an exceptional game, worthy - as the title suggests - of the evolution and maturation of what was offered in the past. Evolution is not revolution, and in fact the latest effort by the Scandinavian team is an instantly recognizable product for anyone who has had experience with its predecessors; it's always basically about taking your rider aboard his bike from point A to point B of each level, trying to do it as quickly as possible and minimizing falls and crashes. The gameplay is two-dimensional, which means that you can only proceed ~forward~ on a predefined route; translating this design choice into a limit or worse into a simplification would however be profoundly wrong, because Trials Evolution is damned demanding, albeit with a (slightly) less steep learning and growth curve than in Trials HD. In fact, the track design offers, with a constant but relentless progression, all kinds of obstacles, ups and downs, platforms and anything else to be overcome by measuring gas, brakes and weight with surgical attention. In addition to a greater dynamism of the environments compared to the past, which even in the most striking cases offer explosions, collapse of buildings and bombings acting as an exaggerated and amusing side dish, the inclusion of the ~fake~ changes of direction appears to be appreciable on a choreographic level, they bypass the aforementioned two-dimensional gameplay by giving a greater feeling of depth and three-dimensionality to the environments. An irrelevant tinsel in practical terms, but pleasant and effective on an aesthetic level and which amplifies the choreographic skills of Scandinavian game designers. On the other hand, the engine that manages the physics is fundamental in the game economy, almost always perfect in translating the reactions of the bike and the rider in a credible way; the latter is not a simple spectator-puppet on board the two wheels, but rather constitutes a key element of the entire system since the variation of its movements allows you to balance the balance or to give yourself the momentum for the more demanding jumps . Each level allows you to obtain a medal (bronze, silver or gold), as well as a cash payment that varies based on performance; a prize certainly not an end in itself - as is practically nothing in the work of RedLynx - but necessary to unlock the next levels and to customize your bike and rider. Once 135 medals have been obtained, the Extreme races become accessible, an authentic test of nerves and skill destined to stimulate even the most hardcore players. Xbox 360 goals The usual 400 points distributed in goals that are almost never trivial and obvious; if a handful of them are in fact linked to the normal progression in the game or in the different modes, most require a precise commitment in particular and often decidedly demanding actions. Get out with friends As for the social element, obviously one of the most appreciated and important features of the previous episode has been confirmed, namely the possibility of immediately comparing one's performances with those of the members of one's friends list; the desire to excel can push you to repeat the same race dozens, hundreds of times even just to gnaw a few precious tenths of a second off your record. With this in mind, we reiterate the ingenious ability (already present in Trials HD) to restart from the last checkpoint or from the beginning of the level instantly by simply pressing a key (risrespectively B or select); a kind of drug destined to cause addiction very soon. The novelty of multiplayer (local or online) has been implemented without distorting the foundations of the game, but rather exploiting its virtues; up to 4 players can challenge each other on tracks divided into ~lanes~, therefore without the possibility of getting in each other's way but simply trying to reach the finish line before the others. There is also a powerful track editor: although this has always been an option dedicated only to the most interested, curious and patient players, RedLynx also wanted to do things right in this case by even integrating two different ways of creating tracks, with the ~Pro~ one which allows you to create very different gameplay solutions (Angry Birds with the pilot catapulted from the motorcycle instead of the birds is a good example). Community-created levels can be downloaded in an instant, and the ranking system combined with the excellent category structure perfectly underpins a mode destined fatally to extend the longevity of the game almost indefinitely. Finally, from a technical point of view, Trials Evolution is a small show; not only for the variety of environments, the spectacularity of the sections of many of them, the jumps of tens of meters, the level of detail and much more, but for how everything is digested with ease by grinding the fundamental and rocky 60 fps. That the Finnish programmers were good there was little doubt, but Trials Evolution is a splendid and brilliant confirmation. The audio accompaniment is less surprising but still spot on, with absolutely over the top guitar playing that is well suited to supporting what is happening on the screen.", "date": "2012-04-24", "grade": "9.0"}
