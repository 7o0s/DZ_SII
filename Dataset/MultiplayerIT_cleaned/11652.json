{"name": "Neenya Ninja: To the Rescue", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/neenya-ninja-to-the-rescue.html", "text": "A year later, Zed has decided to put his masked heroine back on stage, this time engaged in freeing monks captured by a handful of unscrupulous monsters. The premises are certainly not original, nor is the play structure of the title: Neenya Ninja: To the Rescue is a classic-style platform game, in which the user just has to run, jump, collect bonuses and defeat enemies by jumping on their heads. In short, those who have never digested the genre will certainly not change their mind with this product, but for all the others Neenya Ninja: To the Rescue represents a very valid exponent of the genre, certainly better than many other mobile games with more high-sounding names. The adventure develops over the course of 15 levels created with particular skill, obviously imbued with platforms, monsters and monks to save. This last aspect undoubtedly represents the most important discriminating factor in the playful structure of the game, as access to the more advanced stages is granted only after the release of a certain number of prisoners. Zed has rightly balanced this factor by allowing the user to visit already completed levels at any time, and clearly highlighting the location of the missing monks on the map. As is understandable, Neenya Ninja: To the Rescue is a product aimed at an extremely varied audience, and therefore provided with a difficulty caliber accessible to all, which could make it a little too easy for more experienced players. In any case, this second chapter has been enriched with some new features compared to the prequel: above all, the presence of four spirits scattered throughout the various levels stands out, which can guarantee the protagonist temporary special abilities (the spirit of fire, for example , makes you invulnerable to enemies for ten seconds). Then the coins to collect to increase the score and the shurikens to be used as an alternative offensive tool to jumping on the head make their return. Naturally, having been released a year after the first episode, Neenya Ninja: To the Rescue also denotes some progress from a graphic point of view. Therefore, the tasty cartoon style of the look of the various characters remains, equipped with convincing animations and which move on backdrops that are not too rich in details but extremely lively and colorful. A further touch of variety is then guaranteed by Neenya's costume, which changes in tone at each stage. PRO Curated from every point of view Simple and fun Graphically up to par AGAINST Very unoriginal Non-incisive sound", "date": "2008-01-29", "grade": "S.V."}
