{"name": "Alto sulla traversa", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/124498-fifa-14-alto-sulla-traversa.html", "text": "Although the affinity between football games and touch screen terminals has always struggled to find full realization, Electronic Arts must be acknowledged for having invested constantly in the development of Fifa on smartphones and tablets, carrying out a project capable of standing on its own legs without without wanting to forcefully ape versions for extremely different platforms both in terms of capacity and control system. An investment that has evidently paid off, and the confirmation comes from a simple fact: if on ~real~ laptops like PSVita and 3DS the franchise has recently been going on thanks to depressing reskins, on iOS and Android instead the work continues year after year, even if not always with the desired results. Fifa 14 also convinces on iOS and Android, albeit with some bugs and some defects Plot twist That the main limitation of such a product is purely and fundamentally linked to the control interface is all too clear to everyone; for this reason, once again EA has attempted to offer a method of use strongly based on touches, swipes and various dragging, with the appreciable intention of getting around the issue. In reality, unfortunately, in practice one can only consider the cure worse than the disease, because the solution chosen by the programmers appears frustrating and practically unusable especially on smartphones with small screens, with the fingers inevitably covering the action and a general imprecision remotely sustainable only at the lowest difficulty levels. Considering then that the genre of football video games, and Fifa's approach in particular, is not particularly relevant to the casual environment, we struggle to understand the willingness to focus on this variant. Therefore, wanting to immediately forget this misstep, all that remains is to switch to the use of the much more classic and functional system with virtual keys, which while remaining necessarily very far from the rendering of a physical controller, at least allow us to guarantee acceptable gameplay, albeit imprecise and often confused. From a technical point of view, however, there are no major changes compared to last year, except for details and surrounding elements; the graphic engine, highly adaptable even on devices that are not of the latest fashion, guarantees a sufficiently clean and pleasant glance, even if anything but surprising. The best thing about the package are certainly the animations, well done and without gaps in the transition from one to another, while it is sad to see little resemblance to the real counterparts of many footballers, even famous ones. Even the gameplay has not made great strides compared to last year, confirming strengths and weaknesses together with a modest artificial intelligence. Where, on the other hand, the greatest effort can be seen is in the game modes, with a completeness of the offer that by now has little or nothing to envy to that of the console versions: in addition to the usual flood of championships available, there is in fact that Ultimate Team which for some time has been the spearhead of the franchise, as well as an online multiplayer mode. However, the latter is, at the time of writing, practically unusable, with crashes, lag and frame rate drops that destroy games even in more than good connection conditions. Of particular interest is the fact that for the first time EA has chosen to offer Fifa with the freemium formula, in a solution that is anything but open to criticism as has happened in other cases and which allows you to appreciate good game parts; you can freely take advantage of the Ultimate Team, face the matches of the week (pre-set matches that reflect real matches, like Fiorentina Juve at the moment) and face quick challenges online. By paying instead  4.49 you can unlock all the remaining modes and championships. Finally, the audio deserves a note, which for the first time can count on a localized commentary which in our case obviously relies on the couple Caressa Bergomi; it is an additional element to be downloaded within the game, in a special menu, and which makes the total size of the application even more substantial.", "date": "2013-10-18", "grade": "8.0"}
