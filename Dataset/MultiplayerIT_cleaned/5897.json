There are really a handful of productions that at first glance identify a platform, a genre, an entire deep and multifaceted world that has enthralled millions of players both in facing the adventures of Terran, Zerg and Protoss firsthand, and in passing the evenings admiring the incredible skills of the pro-players during the most important international tournaments. It is precisely this aspect that has given more breathing space to the Blizzard saga, capable of being talked about year after year despite the fact that there was very little to play outside of a very refined multiplayer sector, capable however of intimidating due to the depths of its more which entice comparisons with other players. This was mainly the problem that Blizzard found itself facing at the end of the trilogy into which StarCraft II was divided. During the last BlizzCon announced plans for the future of its real-time strategy ensuring constant support with additional content and DLC such as Nova Covert Ops, in order to feed a saga that despite having reached its epilogue has no intention to fall into oblivion. At the release of Wings of Liberty the developers promised that the remaining two chapters of the trilogy would arrive ~shortly~. This ~short~ then materialized in five long years of gestation interspersed with Heart of the Swarm and exciting competitive seasons, up to the awaited release of Legacy of the Void, the final chapter, which bears the burden and the honor of summing up the events of Raynor, Kerrigan and Zeratul and the many other supporting actors of this epic story. Expectations were naturally very high, but once again Blizzard has pulled out all the potential that has consecrated it in the eyes of gamers, fully proving to be up to the situation by developing an incredible epilogue for a title that has not betrayed expectations in the slightest. both his souls, so different yet equally splendid. Legacy of the Void puts us in the shoes of the Protoss to end the story of StarCraft II For Aiur! StarCraft II was a game of battles and revenge, clashes between races and factions with the sole objective of conquering power and ruling over the entire Koprulu sector. The relationship between Raynor and Kerrigan, the human civil war, the secrets of the Moebius Foundation and the mysterious figure of Zeratul, bearer of terrifying prophecies, accompanied us in Wings of Liberty and Heart of the Swarm, where we respectively took the reins of Terran and Zerg. Now the time has come to dedicate ourselves to the Protoss, a highly evolved humanoid race that bases its strength on psionic energy and on the Khala, a sort of collective intelligence in which memories and emotions merge, making units particularly effective in battle. Zeratul has traveled for six years in search of the truth behind the return of the Xel'Naga, warning both the Terran and the Zerg of the arrival of a very dangerous threat that no race alone could have been able to face. However, in the previous two chapters we focused more on the history of the Queen of Blades and that of the Xel'Naga had become a secondary problem to which our protagonists would have dedicated themselves only after stopping the regime of Arcturus Mengsk. The bittersweet ending of the second episode had rightly left open numerous glimmers and possibilities in view of this third chapter entirely focused on the Protoss and their battle against Amon, a threat that at this point not even the other two races will be able to ignore. The war has raged furiously involving all the factions that in one way or another will have to face the boundless power of the Dark God, coming down to highly unlikely pacts and alliances until recently. Legacy of the Void opens with Artanis, a young Hierarch of the Protoss, who has assembled the Golden Army to lead it into battle to reclaim Aiur, the ancient home planet of his people now completely colonized by the Zerg. However, Amon manages to settle in the Khala and take control of part of his army by adding new units to his hybrids, the result of experiments and fusions between the units of various races. It kicks off with a bang, with a series of pivotal events kicking off a campaign that continues at a breakneck pace to the epic final showdowns, which will lead to an epilogue structured as a jaw-dropping three-mission mini-campaign . Obviously we don't go into details to avoid any possibility of spoilers, but if you're wonderingwhether Legacy of the Void is worth playing, the answer is overwhelmingly positive. The pitfall of having to close the trilogy galvanized Blizzard which was not caught unprepared and gave its best, crafting a full-bodied campaign of a good dozen hours which by setting, rhythm and variety is probably positioned among the best ever appeared in a real-time strategy. Unlike the chapters on Raynor and Kerrigan, in this case the narrative has a more choral tone, focused on the entire Protoss race and its unshakable resilience which leads them to bury the grudges of a fratricidal war to join forces and face an enemy common, delving into new supporting characters and past events that further enrich the immersive and profound universe of StarCraft. Stand alone Although the play system remains absolutely similar to that of its predecessors, albeit with the necessary improvements and refinements of the case, StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void is a stand-alone title in all respects. Anyone can play both the campaign and all multiplayer modes without needing the previous chapters, all you need is an account on Battle.net. Obviously, from the point of view of the narrative, something is lost along the way, but Blizzard has remedied it by packaging a summary video that even starts from the first StarCraft, which can also be appreciated by the most passionate who will not disdain a refresher on the facts that led to the current situation. There is also a rich tutorial that takes the most inexperienced players by the hand to introduce them to the fundamental game mechanics and find themselves ready to face the missions of the main campaign. The grand finale The progression of the nineteen missions is expertly dosed with the intention of taking the player by the hand, even the most inexperienced one, and leading him towards a better understanding of a race like that of the Protoss, which like any other has unique units and peculiar mechanics. In this sense, the possibility of converting unit-producing structures into dimensional gates to summon units directly onto the battlefield near a Pylon, gives a completely new dimension to the clashes and game rhythm, giving a widely different experience compared to to that of Wings of Liberty and Heart of the Swarm. The first missions are a simple tutorial, but things don't take long to get going, arriving in the more advanced sections to clashes that at the higher difficulty levels will not struggle to make even expert players sweat. The challenge therefore is not lacking, indeed, it seems that Blizzard has managed to find the right balance between the danger of the enemy and the growing complexity of the game system in such a way as to make it both interesting and satisfying for players of any level. The classic unit management is joined by the Spear of Adun, the mother ship of the Protoss army which acts both as a hub for missions and interaction with supporting characters, and as tactical support during each battle. From the Bridge we will have access to the celestial framework from which, in the role of Artanis, we can select the next destination, in a game structure that re-proposes the non-linear progression of events. Furthermore, each mission is usually associated with the introduction of a new unit that will have a particular role in the mechanics of the level and in achieving the main objective, with the aim of allowing the player to better master it. Next we find the War Council from which to manage the troops, one of the most interesting aspects of Legacy of the Void which sets aside the biological evolutions in favor of the units belonging to four different factions to be gradually unlocked by advancing in the campaign. For each type of unit there are three variants: for example, for melee warriors we can opt for the Zealot of Aiur, the Centurion of Nerazim or the Infiltrator of the Purifiers, with the first inflicting area damage, the second briefly stunning enemy units and the third one that resurrects when it takes lethal damage. Finally there is the Solar Core in which to invest the precious Solarite recovered during the missions to unlock and upgrade the secondary systems to be used directly in battle. For each of the six categories, only one of the three available can be selected, all quite different from each other: we are talking about summoning Pylons and units anywhere visible on the map, rather than instantly teleporting troops to the Nexus or having cover fire against the toughest units. With these two novelties it is possible to customize not only your army, but also your approach to battle, by addingalso a substantial substrate for the replayability of the campaign. Online with friends The ability to choose the units and upgrades of the Spear of Adun once again underlines the desire of the developers to offer a deep and engaging experience, which is not reduced only to a gym in view of multiplayer, but still manages to convey its complexity. The presence of units that do not appear in the challenges against other players and the relevance that the mechanics of the levels hold in each mission make the gameplay fresh and varied, but crossing weapons with the community remains anything but easy. In this sense, the increase of workers to twelve units at the beginning of PvP matches and the decrease of minerals and Vespene gas go in a diametrically opposite direction, forcing players to expand more quickly in the early game, which for this reason becomes even more punishing for those who take the field without a range of builds to develop and a good speed of execution. You are immediately catapulted into the heart of the action and the dead moments at the beginning of the game are reduced to a minimum, opening up very interesting scenarios for the next World Championship Series. The addition of new units for each race expands the army composition possibilities even further, while the management of the macros radically changes the approach to the game, leading players to use more aggressive strategies right away and having to manage more than one basis for the whole match. It is therefore understandable how the scenario of the ranked presents itself even more inhospitable for novices, who will be able to remedy the problem by playing with better friends. The Legacy of the Void debuts cooperative missions to be faced by choosing between commanders Raynor, Kerrigan, Artanis, Swann, Zagara and Vorazun, each with specific units and abilities, and the Archon Mode, the decidedly more successful introduction of multiplayer which puts two players in command of the same base. It is a well-crafted mode, in which one player can think about economic management and unit production, while the other can lead the army into battle in a very fun mix of cooperative and competitive mechanics. Between one game and another, you can always distract yourself with the Arcades, which collect a large number of modes and minigames created by the community using the game editor. On the technical front, Legacy of the Void is confirmed as a very nice title to look at, thanks to the unmistakable visual style of the Blizzard artists who manage to make even the most desolate battlefields alive and vibrant worlds. The kinematics that accompany the continuation of the main campaign are as always of excellent workmanship, but it is the total surrender of the battle on the screen with dozens of units used simultaneously that leaves the best memory, thanks above all to an excellently made effects. The only note for the dubbing, which in Italian is lost in some situations with dialogues recited without the right transport and expressiveness that they deserved, ending up weakening the impact of some interlude scenes.", "date": "2015-11-13", "grade": "9.2"}
