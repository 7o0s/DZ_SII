{"name": "Giro giro tondo", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/163209-giro-giro-tondo.html", "text": "Everything can be said about mobile gaming, but not that it lacks original ideas and interesting ideas: this is undoubtedly the case of Circa Infinity, a bizarre platform developed by Kenny Sun characterized by a minimalist and monochromatic graphic style and a gameplay that is based entirely on the interaction of the protagonist with concentric circles. As often happens with productions characterized by such extreme design choices, the real risk is to find a title that privileges style in favor of substance: fortunately, Circa Infinity takes very little to demonstrate that its merits go beyond mere appearances. Circa Infinity is original and fun, but it can also be a bit frustrating and repetitive Like circles in trees Circa Infinity belongs to that category of games whose gameplay is much easier to understand visually than to explain in words, so much so that the tutorial (if you can call it that) is reduced to a few seconds in which you are introduced to the basic rules to then be left to naturally discover all the various nuances of the play structure. The humanoid protagonist begins each level on the surface of a circle that stands in the center of the screen, with the player being able to make him run to the right or left using the two virtual keys at the bottom of the display, while the third and last button allows you to perform a jump or - if you are on the portion delimited by a triangle - to enter the circle itself: here a second, smaller, spherical body floats, which allows access to the next diagram (represented by another circle) and which must be reached in one leap while avoiding all the various obstacles. You continue thus passing from one concentric circle to another, with the aim of reaching the exit of the level in the shortest possible time. Although it is not very easy to describe in writing, the gameplay of Circa Infinity works very well, offering the right mix between immediacy and a challenge component that is typical of purebred mobile games. A merit that must be equally shared with a level design capable of skilfully mixing the very few elements available, offering small but significant variations for each stage that allow the player's attention to always be kept alive: the reference goes in particular to the enemies that populate the circles, which in the first levels are limited to standing still while as you continue they prove capable of floating, jumping, changing direction and even passing at will from inside to outside the circles and vice versa. As it is easy to understand, after the first settling bars, Circa Infinity engages the fifth and literally fills the screen with opponents, making the player's passage from one circle to another less and less easy: and although the title is wise enough not to penalize excessively the possibility of being hit by an enemy (which simply sends the character back to the previous scheme) it is undeniable that as the difficulty increases there is also a progressive increase in the risk of frustration, always around the corner in products like this . Also not to be underestimated is the incidence of repetitiveness, the inevitable downside of a title that works by subtraction both from a gameplay and an aesthetic point of view: performing the same few actions in a monochromatic scenario that is always the same in the long run can undoubtedly get boring , perhaps leading to abandon the game before its natural conclusion, however not too stretched.", "date": "2016-02-09", "grade": "8.0"}
