The famous Marvelous ninja tread the videogame stage again in an unprecedented context; this time don't expect action sequences, clashes with water pistols or culinary activities: as the name suggests, Senran Kagura: Peach Ball in fact transports the busty girls of the franchise into the pinball universe, placing them at the center of the inevitable spicy situations that distinguish always the series. Following the publication on the European eShop we tried the game for a few hours and here is our review on time. Spicy pinball Despite being a title entirely focused on pinball, Senran Kagura: Peach Ball offers a Story mode in which you have to face a series of stages alternating with dialogues between the protagonists of the game. Without going around it too much, it's about unattractive content that induces you to jump quickly forward with the aim of finally accessing the first table. From a playful point of view, the proposal is very basic: the rules are the traditional ones, therefore it is necessary to keep your ball alive as much as possible trying to chain each action in order to obtain high scores. The peculiarity is given by the presence on the table of one of the five shinobi included in the game, namely Asuka, Yumi, Ryona, Murasaki and Yomi. In addition to directing the ball towards tunnels and buffers, it will be necessary to interact with the girl by hitting her in various positions to get bonuses. The so-called Peach Missions correspond precisely to small tasks that must be completed during the match to obtain a series of advantages. By filling the Peach Point bar, you then gain access to the Sexy Challenge; in this phase the girl at the table is sucked into another area, where you access a smaller pinball machine in which various objects must be hit within a time limit. Once the operation is completed and the score multiplier is obtained, a part of the shinobi's skimpy clothes will be ripped off, leaving less and less room for imagination. After having repeated the operation three times, the Super Sexy Challenge will be accessed, where the players will move on to the deeds by stimulating the girl's breasts and buttocks with the balls, and then conclude on a high note with a rich barrage of shots scored with the fins. In doing so, the girl on duty will end up completely naked, shyly covering her private parts so as not to be observed. The action is at times fun, although one cannot help but notice the presence of obvious limitations: first of all the poor reactivity of the wings with which the ball must be directed, but above all the lack of gameplay solutions made available by the developers . The levels that make up the story are five, while the selectable tables are only two. The first, called Peach Land, resembles a sort of amusement park, while Spooky Shinobi Park reproduces a typically Japanese-style garden. Both alternatives have proved to be quite flat from the point of view of variety, resulting in all too similar in structure and very little branched in terms of the quantity of objects with which it is possible to interact. With sadness we have found that the only alternative to the already very narrow main campaign is represented by the free game, where basically all one has to do is select the two tables mentioned above, choosing some variants linked to the seasons of the year that affect exclusively the 'aesthetic aspect but not on the structure. Traditionally, in games based on pinball machines, the variety of tables is essential to make the product interesting in the eyes of the paying public, while in the case of Peach Ball, the lack of content does not encourage the player to return to the game after finishing the first game session. . The only side content is the Dressing Room, a section in which it is possible to change the girls' clothes, take pictures by accessing the Diorama mode or access a complete overview of their bodies, being able to decide to wet them with water or grope them repeatedly.", "date": "2019-07-09", "grade": "5.0"}
