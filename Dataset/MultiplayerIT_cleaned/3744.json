It used to be cheaper to develop and also took less time: a few years ago, Square Enix delighted in churning out Final Fantasy spin-offs at a brisk pace, sometimes outsourcing them to third parties such as h.a.n.d. It was 2007 when the small Japanese company in question created the third and last adventure, in chronological order, of the indisputable feathered mascot for Wii, a title that was later converted to Nintendo DS and which today also arrives in a revised and corrected version on PlayStation 4 and Switch. Originally Final Fantasy Fables: Chocobo's Dungeon, today it's titled Chocobo's Mystery Dungeon EVERY BUDDY! and represents a blast from the past that especially lovers of roguelikes and dungeon crawlers should take a look at. The Chocobo's mission There's a reason why our yellow bird explores the randomly generated mazes of Chocobo's Mystery Dungeon EVERY BUDDY! but don't expect an intricate plot worthy of the best Final Fantasy: it's actually a kind of pretext, albeit presented with a delightful pomposity that tries to make it look like the script for a real RPG. Cid and his Chocobo, in search of a powerful artifact, find themselves in the city of Lostime, where a terrible curse is slowly erasing the memories of the inhabitants. When Cid also falls victim to the spell, which seems to be linked to the tolling of the bell tower, the Chocobo decides to take action and explore the labyrinths formed by memories to help the inhabitants and find out who or what is threatening them. The story is told through delightful cinematics and too verbose dialogues: as we said, it is almost a fairy tale, simple and predictable in its resolution, which relies on a rather clumsy direction. It will certainly not be the fate of the inhabitants to push you to undertake the missions that they will entrust you with, but it must be said that the game does everything to make you fall in love with the Chocobo, an unlikely hero without a real characterization who entrusts all his charisma to the context and to the charm of the Final Fantasy mythology. Quotations abound - be they enemies, names, music or spells - and from this point of view Chocobo's Mystery Dungeon EVERY BUDDY! it's pure fanservice, but not an end in itself as happens in many spin-offs. Once passed the very long tutorial, in fact, the title h.a.n.d. takes on an identity of its own and slips on its spiked boot to kick you in the ass. In mysterious labyrinths The structure of the game freely alternates the preparation phases in the city with the exploration of the various dungeons. The latter are randomly generated at each entrance, effectively representing an unknown factor in terms of difficulty and balance of the same: sometimes you may appear right next to the stairs to the next floor, sometimes in a room full of enemies ready to tear you apart . It is therefore important to prepare well for the clash, perhaps by first going ahead to learn the skills of the enemies and their weaknesses. The roguelike component of Chocobo's Mystery Dungeon EVERY BUDDY!, in this sense, is overbearing. Each death reduces the gil in our possession - better to deposit them in the bank, before venturing into a dungeon - and empties our inventory; moreover, not only the layout and the arrangement of the enemies is random, but even the number of objects distributed in the dungeon and their usefulness, which must first be verified, barring unpleasant surprises. In short, despite its cute appearance and cartoonish graphics, Chocobo's Mystery Dungeon EVERY BUDDY! it is a difficult title, at times frustrating, and unfortunately not always due to design choices but mostly due to pure fatality. To our rescue there are a series of mechanics that must necessarily be assimilated if we want to continue the adventure in the most serene way possible. The first of them is the Job System, inspired by the most classic Final Fantasy and above all by Final Fantasy Tactics. Proceeding in the main campaign, our Chocobo will learn the ability to change Job or class at will in the city and sometimes in the dungeons themselves: transforming us into Black Magician, White Magician, Dragoon and so on, we will learn spells and special abilities that will not only make the more varied fights, but which will also guarantee an advantage in certain clashes. Unfortunately not all enemies will earn us the Job Points necessary to increase the level of each Job, therefore a certain grind will be needed to unlock each repertoire. Jobs are especially useful in dungeons subject to specific rules which, for examplepious, they may ban us from using certain items or force us to explore every map with some abnormal condition such as poisoning. From this point of view, Chocobo's Mystery Dungeon EVERY BUDDY! it is an extremely strategic title: following the tradition of ~mystery dungeons~, also in this case the enemies will move or act every time we do it, so it will be important to evaluate each square traveled and each Magic Point spent to fight. The unprecedented Buddy system, designed for this specific conversion of the game and absent in the original edition, balances the difficulty equation by allowing us to recruit enemies so that they accompany us in dungeons, perhaps controlled by a second player. Unfortunately, this system is also subject to randomness, because not all defeated enemies guarantee the points necessary to recruit them, and therefore if you want the company of a Tonberry or a Cactuar at all costs, you may have to grind a lot. It must be said that the grind is an integral part of this type of experience and the Square Enix title manages to make it more interesting - albeit monotonous, in the long run - thanks to a large number of secondary tasks and mini-games, such as fishing or gardening, which offer a decent variety of very useful content and rewards. Furthermore, accumulating gil and accessories becomes increasingly important, since we will be able to combine the equipment at the Lostime blacksmith to move the bonuses from one piece to another, configuring real ~builds~ with which to face the dungeons on duty. In this sense, the handheld mode seemed like a godsend to us, because it allows you to nibble the dungeons little by little, suspending the game when necessary: technically we are talking about a title that dates back to over ten years ago and that in laptop doesn't miss a beat.", "date": "2019-03-30", "grade": "7.5"}
