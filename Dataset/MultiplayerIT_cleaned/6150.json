Since the original version of 2012, the fighting game created by Lab Zero Games has in fact gained a decent following of fans, not only because of stylish characters and beautiful animations, but above all thanks to solid mechanics taken here and there in the genre (in particular, cues from Marvel vs. Capcom, Darkstalkers and Guilty Gear are evident). The last stage in a continuous improvement work made up of patches and beta sessions, Skullgirls 2nd Encore is a completely new version that also brings the game to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita, introducing both various additional contents and aesthetic improvements and refinements to an already very solid. Skullgirls 2nd Encore is the definitive version of the fighting game from Lab Zero Games That's a wrap! Seeking to remedy Skullgirls Encore's meager roster for PlayStation 3, 2nd Encore includes all five additional characters distributed via DLC thus far. Each belongs to different archetypes and differs greatly in design and move skeleton. Beowulf is a versatile and powerful grappler, useful as both an assist and main fighter; Big Band is slow but has a good defense and several interesting set-ups to punish your opponents; Squigly is a fairly difficult stancer to master, but able to have good control of spaces; the exact opposite is Eliza, an extremely more intuitive character but able to take away a lot of satisfaction with mixups that are easy and effective at the same time. Much less inspired is Fukua, endowed with quite personal characteristics but who is aesthetically a simple clone of Filia with different colors. Separate discussion for Robo-Fortune, the only truly unpublished fighter in the cast of Skullgirls 2nd Encore (as you read it has also just been added to Skullgirls Encore in the form of DLC). Used by 17-year-old Dominique ~SonicFox~ McLean to win the EVO 2015 Finals, Robo-Fortune ranks fairly low on the Community Tier list, but is unquestionably one of the most charismatic characters on the entire roster. Robotic variant of Ms. Fortune, Robo-Fortune is a sort of cybernetic cat capable of striking with different types of laser beams, thus being able to keep spaces under control or press the opponent with a series of traps. The robo-feline can in fact throw his head into the air and use it as a sort of explosive mine, and if we consider that you can have up to three flying heads on the screen, it is easy to imagine how much a clever player can put the player in difficulty. 'opponent. Playstation 4 trophies Being able to conquer all the 2nd Encore Trophies isn't easy, both because some challenges require hours and hours (... and hours and hours...) of practice, and because their descriptions are often ambiguous. Many Trophies are obtained simply by completing the story mode with the different characters, or by completing the challenges and the tutorial; others require you to perform certain combos in particular conditions, win a certain number of online matches or repeat a certain action X times. In reference to the over $829,000 raised through the crowdfunding campaign, the developers then added a Trophy that is unlocked - you've already figured it out - by performing an 829-hit combo. Good luck. By playing you learn One of the most appreciated aspects of the old Skullgirls Encore was the art style used and the quality of the animations. From this point of view, 2nd Encore does not change one iota, but the developers have taken advantage of this reissue to enrich the sound component of the game. The cutscenes of the story mode are now well voiced, and this applies to both the main cast and all the secondary characters. However, most of the novelties in terms of gameplay are found under the hood, and mostly concern balances of characters and techniques or subtle changes to the interface. The tutorial, which is further improved and which now also covers the Drama system, the Infinite Prevention System and the various levels of Combo, is of particular interest to novices. It may seem strange to dwell on a tutorial inside a fighting game, but thanks to its numerous practical lessons and text that clearly introduces each mechanic, the Skullgirls training menu makes the Lab Zero Games game one of the ideal tools to allow a complete neophyte to approach the genre. Learn by watching videos on YouTube, frequenting the community of enthusiasts and spending hundreds of hours in Street Fighter probably represents the best way to become at least competitive, but Skullgirls allows any novice to know the lexicon of the genre, to distinguish links, chains and cancels, to defend -up and understand what a hit confirmation is. Above all, the Skullgirls tutorial helps the novice user understand how to approach any fighting game correctly, and finally begin to understand ~what happens on the screen~. Furthermore, compared to the first version of the game, 2nd Encore combines the Tutorial mode and the classic Training Room with a series of challenges and tests in the style of Ultra Street Fighter IV, thus allowing you to practice with the various characters and discover interesting combos. Fighting games are such a complex genre that many budding players are discouraged, but if Capcom really wants to bring as many people as possible with Street Fighter V, we think it would do well to take a cue from this little robot cat game, girls. sexy and jazz giants. PlayStation Vita and crossplay At the time of writing, Skullgirls 2nd Encore was only released on PlayStation 4, while all content and gameplay changes were introduced in the first Encore through recent patches. However, the game is also expected for PlayStation Vita in the coming months, and the developers have already anticipated that the portable version will support crossplay: regardless of the console and the version of the game in your possession, Skullgirls fans will be able to challenge each other online.", "date": "2015-07-31", "grade": "8.0"}
