{"name": "The Fast and The Furious Tokyo", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-fast-and-the-furious-tokyo.html", "text": "The graphic sector of the title published by I-Play, we tell you right away, is very good. The cars that we will be able to drive are well cared for, finished down to the smallest detail and with good physics management. The scenarios, as already mentioned, developed in a completely three-dimensional environment, are very accurate and offer a perfect sensation of speed, which is already felt in the first tests. During our tests we only noticed a few small inaccuracies in collision management, more than once in fact we hit parts of the scenario that we thought we had avoided as a result of our maneuver. The two views available are the classic ones of driving games, one internal and one external. Both are well done, perhaps the internal one is the most successful and allows you to better enjoy the ~drift~ during the curves. Drift as in the cinematic episode will be fundamental, we will have to learn how to drift by drifting to earn money and ~respect points~ that will keep us going in the main mode of the game, the Story. We will also need the money to buy new elements to upgrade our car, until it becomes a real plane on four wheels. In Story mode we will have to unlock and win a series of events, divided into 4 zones to become the King of Drift, obviously to continue the game we will have to triumph in each competition up to the challenges with the final bosses in one-on-one duels. Quick Race is a fast race against three opponents. In the single race mode we will be able to choose five different types of tests, some already available and others unlockable by completing the Story. In these tests we will be asked to perform particular evolutions, a certain number of drifts, not exhaust our reputation or complete a perfect lap, the best way to increase the longevity of The Fast and Furious Tokyo. The control system works very well, it is possible to choose whether to manage the acceleration manually or to leave it in automatic mode and dedicate oneself only to the curves. The reaction of our fireball is good and sudden, in certain situations even too much, so as to be too abrupt. With the 5 key or the central button of the joystick we will be able to use the nitro boost to literally splash on the track and overtake all our rivals. PRO Neat and fun Long lived AGAINST Some minor technical flaws", "date": "2007-07-04", "grade": "S.V."}
