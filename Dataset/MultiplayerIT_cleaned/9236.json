{"name": "Un volo appena abbozzato", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/89312-doodle-plane-un-volo-appena-abbozzato.html", "text": "Apparently Doodle Plane is one of those games that seem to embody the very essence of the iPhone: a casual experience, perfect for short and very immediate games. Even the graphic style seems to have been designed with simplicity in mind: a childish and somewhat naive drawing comes to life on a black chalkboard, and a toy plane takes off. Yet this simple arcade game has a much more complex soul than it seems. Its graphics, for example, don't just want to imitate blackboard drawings: the black background has been designed specifically to reduce energy consumption. And if the gameplay, based on just two keys, seems so immediate as to be ~childproof~, a few games are enough to understand that the difficulty level of this game is not that trivial. Indeed, it reveals pleasant surprises even to the most savvy player. Toy airplanes and fantasy worlds The mechanics of Doodle Plane are so immediate that the tutorial is almost superfluous. In the game we control a small airplane, seen from the side, which moves through the combined use of two virtual keys. The left button raises the aircraft vertically, while the right button increases speed. The plane is made to take off and then moves to the right: the aim of the game is to make it cross the entire level unscathed, and then conclude with a final landing on an ad hoc platform. However, completing your path is not easy at all: the skies are dotted with obstacles of various types, all suggested by the theme of the level. In the initial one, set in New York, the player will not only have to dodge the tallest spiers of skyscrapers and antennas, but also avoid the numerous helicopters. To dodge everything that comes at you and stay alive you need a lot of precision, and quite a few cold sweats in perfect Lunar Lander style. There are ten levels, and the themes dealt with are decidedly diversified: they range from ancient Egypt to space, passing through paintings full of kites, flocks of birds or on the theme of Christmas. In short, there really is something for all tastes: but what makes the game homogeneous is the very pleasant graphic style, which makes everything appear animated on a blackboard. Volcanoes and pterodactyls, rain, witches, cannon shots, palm trees and kites come alive on the black surface of the background: everything is drawn with great immediacy, barely sketched in a quick sketch made during playtime. The journey of our airplane becomes a surreal experience, imagined by a child who ~grows up~ wants to be a pilot. Notes on the blackboard If it is undeniable that Doodle Plane is an almost poetic experience in its childlike immediacy, it is also true that the game is not without limits. The level of difficulty, for example, is decidedly fluctuating. The main problem is given by the slow speed of the controls. Our airplane may be a toy but it is subject, in a decidedly realistic way, to a certain degree of inertia: not only do the controls not act immediately, but you must also take into account the fact that there is no rapid brake button in the sky! In short, if an erupting volcano or a flock of birds suddenly appears in front of the aircraft... well, there's absolutely nothing you can do to avoid them. This dynamic means that in order to pass a painting, not only a certain skill is required but also a good knowledge of the level, its obstacles and its timing. To get to the bottom you need to have memorized the moves to do well, thanks to a good number of training sessions: the promptness of reflexes, in some cases, is not enough! This makes Doodle Plane become, in some cases, a bit frustrating: within each single level there are no checkpoints, let alone extra lives. So you have to start over with every mistake... and repeat each pattern a large number of times. Furthermore, a note of a technical nature must also be made to the graphics: although very interesting, it is not always very fluid and especially on the iPad the poor quality of certain graphic elements emerges, as well as some flickering and visual bugs.
