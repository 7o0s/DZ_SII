Many times we have advised you against buying a title because it was too similar to its predecessor, but more of the same is not always bad, and in the case of Octopath Traveler 2, the sequel to the controversial JRPG released in 2018, exactly the opposite is true: if you liked Octopath Traveler, you absolutely must play the second chapter. And if some aspects you didn't appreciate them, it just so happens that this time could be different. In our review of Octopath Traveler 2 we will explain why, and you will often find comparisons with the first one because, well, it's a more of the same, which sometimes it's even a second chance. New wayfarers, new stories Octopath Traveler 2, Hikari Khu comes from a region inspired by medieval Japan To explain Octopath Traveler 2 to a veteran of the Acquire series it would be enough to make a sterile list of features and add notes, like after a software update: ~fixed a problem with~, ~improved this~, ~increased that~, ~decreased that other~. Having to assume that not everyone has played the first Octopath Traveler, we will start from the beginning, and explain that it is a deliberately old-fashioned JRPG, characterized by a peculiar pixel art that mixes 2D and 3D in Unreal Engine 4, random combat turn-based like in the old Final Fantasy and eight stories that intersect only marginally and only at the end. This is how it would seem that we have described the first Octopath Traveler, when instead we are talking about its sequel: more of the same, in fact. Octopath Traveler 2 is practically identical to its predecessor, from every point of view. And this also applies to the questionable choice to tell eight stories centered on as many protagonists who ideally travel together, but who in fact almost never are. Except in the aforementioned epilogue, which this time is not armored behind a masochistic secondary mission, and in the Crossed Paths, longer and more articulated secondary missions involving two wayfarers each and which are closer to our traditional idea of a Japanese RPG. The greater interaction between the eight travelers promised by Acquire does not revolutionize a bizarre narrative that we had also criticized the first time, but which in Octopath Traveler 2 weighs much less due to the simple fact that the eight stories are all written better on average: even the weakest of the crowd, that of the aspiring diva Agnea, ends up having its own why. The new wayfarers might seem like a reshuffle of the eight that preceded them, and in a certain sense it is, but their stories are compelling, also thanks to the excellent Italian adaptation, and range between various genres, but always with a narrative index noticeably more adult, even compared to the tones already achieved by the first Octopath Traveler. Lovers of classic literature, but also of modern literature, will surely recognize the works and characters that inspired the new stories, from Sherlock Holmes to the Count of Monte Cristo. Acknowledging with a pinch of resignation that the stories of the wayfarers remain mostly autonomous, we also notice a general improvement in the pace of the narrative, which tends to be less fragmented by the strange open structure of exploration: once again a main protagonist is chosen and, having completed its initial chapter, one goes to recruit the other wayfarers in the order one prefers. Octopath Traveler 2, Partitio Yellowil is looking for a way to end poverty This part of the gameplay has not undergone upheavals, for better or for worse. The player is free to recruit the wanderers in the order he prefers, but then this freedom loses value in the face of the brute force of the enemies that separate the localities and, therefore, the chapters of the stories. The recommended level of the various chapters suggests - and not so covertly - the order in which they should be played, but by following it, one realizes that the narrative, despite not having cohesion, has a very precise rhythm. Some details stand out better, especially those that help reinforce the idea that the eight stories all take place in the same world, Solistia, which being completely new allows you to approach the adventure even without having played the first Octopath. If anything, this time, it is not its particular structure that slows down the narrative, but the actual gameplay. Acquire has gotten its hand on the mechanics of Travel Actions, the special abilities that travelers can use tointeract with NPCs, and which are now doubled: each traveler has one for the day and one for the night. The day/night cycle does not decisively influence the gameplay: it limits itself to redistributing the non-player characters in the scenarios, and sometimes it is linked to the resolution of some puzzle or secondary mission. Octopath Traveler 2, Travel Actions are now two per traveler Travel Actions, however, seemed too redundant to us. We have already seen most of them in the first Octopath Traveler, but the others are simply variations of the same mechanism: Osvald, for example, can examine the characters to know their stories during the day, while at night Hikari can do the same by bribing them with money. Temenos can do it too, but he first has to defeat the person metaphysically at night. Osvald can also fight other characters at night: if he wins, he will extort valuable items from them. And even Hikari can face them in a duel, even if during the day, to learn up to a maximum of five fighting techniques. If, on the other hand, you prefer to steal without fighting, you can rely on the skills of the thief Thron, by day, or on the pleas of Agnea, by night. In short, these examples should give you an idea: the travel Actions are all a bit similar, and in certain formations they risk overlapping. From one point of view, this makes sense because the player cannot take all eight wayfarers with him all the time, but only four, while the rest stay in the inn. Certain formations, therefore, allow each Action to be covered both by day and by night, but the dynamics remain cumbersome all the same. Octopath Traveler 2, the Crossed Paths stories involve four pairs of wayfarers The Travel Actions mechanic is now more interesting than in the first Octopath because it is objectively more varied and articulated, and because it allows you to solve side missions or get your hands on consumables, weapons or armor that would have a steep price in the emporiums. In practice, though, one feels almost compelled to scour every single character in every scenario with every Travel Action possible, first by day and then by night: as easy as it is to switch between them - just press a button, literally - this renewed gameplay dynamic tends to get stuck in a kind of obsessive compulsive disorder that ends up dramatically slowing down exploration. Every time you enter a new city or a new scenario, you feel the need to go through every single NPC to discover the possibilities offered by the various interactions, diverting us from the goal. Despite this criticality, Octopath Traveler 2 remains a title overflowing with secrets and opportunities also and precisely because of the new gameplay dynamics. Each scenario hides something, often behind skilful perspective games, and exploration is never an end in itself: there is always a collectible, a bonus, a secret technique, a particularly powerful NPC to recruit and bring into battle. Fighting in Solostia Octopath Traveler 2, the combat system still revolves around Domination and Power The day / night cycle, then, has an even more interesting implication in terms of gameplay. At night, in fact, the enemies are more aggressive and powerful, but they also yield much more experience points. This simple functionality - combined with some particular abilities - helps a lot not only to raise the wayfarers in moments in which it could be necessary, but also to personalize the experience: players who like to fight every two steps can simply move at night, while those those who prefer a more relaxed experience can do so during the day, perhaps by equipping the Scholar's Evasive Maneuvers ability. eight wayfarers are the same as in the first game. The class system has in fact been kept almost as it is, with lots of PCs to accumulate and spend to unlock new skills in the order you prefer and secondary classes to be assigned to experiment with an avalanche of strategies and combinations. The novelties are essentially limited to the EX Skills and the four additional, totally new classes, which are unlocked much earlier than in the past and in a very particular way, and which unfortunately we cannot tell you about in detail. Octopath Traveler 2, the Latent Power is kind of a super move Team that wins, in short, you don't change. Almost. Acquire hasn't even revolutionized the combat system, centered on the conditions of Domination and Power. The first is verifies when the player hits the enemy in its weak point, i.e. using the right weapons or elemental magics, and in doing so resets its shields: at which point the enemy loses a turn, during which it takes much more damage. The Dominion mechanic is not only used to conclude battles faster, but also to interrupt the preparation of devastating attacks: entire boss fights revolve around this gameplay dynamic. Power, on the other hand, is a condition in which the traveler enters when he consumes one or more Power Points accumulated turn after turn: it is a system similar to that of Bravely Default, and in practice it allows you to attack several times in the same turn or to enhance a specific skill.Learning how to exploit Domination and Power is imperative: we tell you right away that Octopath Traveler 2 is not as demanding - not to say, unbalanced - as its predecessor, but it remains a more challenging than average Japanese RPG, with some particularly brutal boss fights where knowledge of the gameplay, a good strategy in team formation and, why not, a few more experience levels can make the difference. Octopath Traveler 2, to defeat the bosses you have to play strategy The fights, however, do not last too long as they did in the first game of the series: the boss fights seemed much less exhausting, and in general the difficulty curve seemed much better balanced, with a fair distribution of enemies both day than night, and a greater variety of weapons, skills, and spells that help induce the Domination condition more often. We also appreciated the introduction of Latent Powers: they are real super moves that you learn very quickly, and that load up much more often than you think. Instead of being a wild card ability to jealously guard waiting for the moment right, the Latent Power was meant to be used as much as possible. Not all the latent powers convinced us in the same way: some seemed to us not very creative, such as Thron's, which merely gives her an extra action in the same turn, or Temenos's, which allows her to hit a weak point regardless of the type of attack performed. Others, however, are much more interesting in their simplicity: Osvald's ability to concentrate his multi-target spells into a single spell opens the door to devastating combinations. Better in everything? Octopath Traveler 2, the richness of colors and details is incredible In general, in short, the combat and gameplay customization system drew heavily on the experience of Octopath Traveler one, but Acquire filed off certain angularities and lent an ear to the criticisms on the balance of the first game, smoothing out the difficulty curve and introducing some small mechanics that more articulate the turn-based combat. Those who had appreciated the predecessor for its brutality, however, can reassure themselves: between dungeons and secret bosses, Octopath Traveler 2 remains a title capable of making you take down all the saints on more than one occasion. 'beginning, but done right, done better. And this philosophy is reflected even more in the way the game is presented on the screen. We played Octopath Traveler 2 on Nintendo Switch and calling it sublime seems like an understatement. Take note: yes, the version we tested drops a few frames when the battlefield fills up with particles or you switch from day to night on the fly in a scenario particularly dense with detail and visual effects. But they are almost imperceptible slowdowns that do not disturb much. Octopath Traveler 2, camera movements embellish some scenes If anything, the other flaws we encountered after playing the demo on PlayStation 5 are disturbing: on the Nintendo hybrid console, Octopath Traveler 2 runs at 30 frames per second, and it lacks dynamic shadows in some environments. It's definitely a shame, but ultimately it also depends on how you play RPGs like this: in our opinion, the Acquire title lends itself particularly well to portability, and on the Switch OLED screen, with its sharp and vivid colors, the pixel art is a real triumph. The Square Enix artists have really outdone themselves, working even better on lighting and effects: each scenario is overflowing with details, and even the small maps that separate the inhabited centers appear drawn in a more linear but not at all trivial way, above all if we compare the too many dead ends of the first game. To embellish the technical sector, which was already excellent in 2018 but which today is truly superlative from the point of view of mere artistic direction, some think about it", "date": "2023-02-17", "grade": "8.0"}
