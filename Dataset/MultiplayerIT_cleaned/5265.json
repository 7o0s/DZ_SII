{"name": "Riparte la stagione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/174280-fifa-17-riparte-la-stagione.html", "text": "Although it is now evident that Electronic Arts, like its competitor Konami, is decidedly concentrated on the development and evolution of the FIFA series on new generation consoles and personal computers, it does not forget all those gamers who for one reason or another other still have the dear old platforms of the now ~past generation~. The 2017 edition of the Canadian company's popular football franchise therefore returns again this year on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 with the intention, albeit lacking some features present in the new generation console one, see for example the mode The Journey or some items related to the different hardware available, to equally offer fans new content. In this sense, as we will see, there are new game options, and some sensitive changes to the already solid gameplay on which the saga has based its foundations for years now. FIFA 17 maintains all the qualities of the 2016 version which significantly improves in this edition Xbox 360 goals FIFA 17 offers forty-six achievements to unlock, for a total of 1000G. To get them you have to satisfy the most varied requests of the game, such as winning a women's soccer tournament, playing the first match with your Virtual Player, scoring goals in counterattack action, and so on. Let's start again! Once the game has started, the user is greeted by the usual window menus, through which, with a quick movement, the various modes present in FIFA 17 can be selected. These are broadly the same as in 2016, apart from those that we will announce shortly, which is why we quickly liquidate the classic ones, such as friendlies, cups and customizable or official championships, almost all covered by licenses as regards the events themselves and the teams (our Serie A and Serie B are presented such as Calcio A and Calcio B, while the top flight clubs have their real names and logos), which are enriched, among other things, by the presence of those of the Japanese J-League and the Brazilian tournament, as well as, at national level women, from the eleven of Holland and Norway. For the same reasons we limit ourselves to mentioning the presence of one's own Virtual Footballer with the relative challenges to increase his characteristics, whether one chooses to impersonate a goalkeeper or a player in another position, the Season and so on, an area reserved for workouts with even tests to pass to earn prizes, or the Xbox Live, always stable during our tests and full of options with friendlies, customizable challenges, Divisions, the possibility of being able to play an entire season and who the more you have, the more you put. However, the fulcrum of the production obviously remains the Career mode, enhanced in FIFA 17 by two new options, one relating to the pre-season retreat, and the other to specific training sessions for the team. For the rest, the playing area is always the same, depending on whether you play a footballer or a coach, and therefore you focus only on the matches and the technical-tactical aspect, or the dual role of coach and manager. In the latter case, in fact, as per tradition, one must try to manage one's club in the best possible way, on and off the pitch, organizing pre-season friendlies to earn money useful for the budget or for the transfer market, managing contracts with sponsors and athletes, but also training, the nursery and all those technical aspects that a trained coach must never fail to support and follow. Dulcis in fundo, there is the Ultimate Team mode, the ~game within the game~ which allows you to create your own ideal team by basing the purchases and exchanges of players, represented by a sticker that indicates their global value, on a system of auctions. The most important novelty of this year is the introduction of the new Squad Creation Challenges (SCR) mode, which consists in a nutshell of a series of challenges with variable difficulty (basic, advanced or specific to the leagues) which put the player's skills in managing his team, to be completed to earn unique in-game rewards. The challenges will be updated constantly throughout the season. Ball in the center, let's go! Once on the field, however, the gamer immediately finds the commands he is used to and the relative harmony with them, even if after a few challenges he realizes that the precision of the movements on the field of the athletes and that of the behavior of the ball are been significantly improved. The complete impact on shots and passes, 360-degree movements, freedom and speed of control (obviously we are talking about manual settings), are all important concepts that come we wrote over the years, they have been improved and perfected over time, and that if we want with FIFA 17 they have grown further almost to the extreme on the old generation of consoles. It's not possible to do too much phenomena in midfield, but rather you have to defend the ball and know how to make it spin properly with the help of your teammates who, thanks to renewed routines that guarantee a greater number of activities without the ball, move in a intelligent to suggest the pass or to create openings, better respecting the new attacking techniques and patterns even on set pieces. From this point of view, however, it must be said that the athletes do not always apply the strategies properly, at least during the corners. Every now and then, in fact, we have seen a couple of athletes not respecting the deliveries, as if they had suddenly ~forgotten~ what the chosen scheme would have required them to do. On the other hand, it goes better with the ongoing action schemes, and overlaps in this sense have been improved, and it often happens that these not only serve to dictate the assist, but also to create spaces for teammates, to offer a greater range of options to the ball carrier, perhaps opening the defenses in two with deadly diagonals. This is made possible by the new system which introduces a constant analysis of the available spaces, increasing the activity off the ball of the virtual players and changing the way they move, choose and react. Everything does not work exactly as on the Xbox One or PlayStation 4 counterpart, but certainly there is still a certain effectiveness in giving a greater quality and variety to the action compared to the past edition, which as mentioned from the beginning, is however the touchstone of this FIFA 17. In the light of what has been described, a slower and more reasoned pace of play emerges, but not for this static or boring, with a moderate increase in the level of difficulty that grows hand in hand with the realism offered . Realism that is also reflected in the way the ball behaves in rebounds, with the consequence that shots on goal and passes are more unpredictable in the trajectories, especially in relation to the position of the shooter with respect to the ball or the obstacles constituted by the body of some opposing defender. In short, steps forward, albeit not striking, in terms of gameplay, a little less as regards the technical part of the EA title. In this sense, we point out that from a graphic point of view there are not huge changes compared to FIFA 16. But on the other hand, the engine is the same, and it has been squeezed properly in recent years. However, long-standing enthusiasts, those attentive to every detail, will have no trouble noticing those small touches that are still useful for improving a face, a shirt or some surrounding element. From the teams entering the field to the actual match, up to the presence of several scenes with the match in progress, which allow you to enjoy the quality of the players' faces to the fullest, everything is done along the lines of a television production. For the faces, as always, those of the most famous athletes or those who belong to teams that have signed special agreements with EA, see for example Juventus, are immediately recognizable and well made, while the generic ones are rather anonymous. The polygonal models of all are better, which in any case remain excellent, well proportioned and masterfully animated to the point of giving the feeling of seeing real people in the field. The reproduction of the celebrations, the uniforms and the animations are also of excellent workmanship. As for the stadiums, FIFA 17 introduces the Olympic Stadium in London, the new ~temple~ of West Ham, as well as the Riverside Stadium in Middlesborough and the Suita City of the Japanese side Gamba Osaka. For the rest there are the facilities of last season, which today as then alternate a fluctuating quality in terms of reproduction depending on the arena. Final note dedicated to the sound sector, which has excellent stadium effects, choirs that are always beautiful to hear and which do not pop up at random, as well as the soundtrack. The commentary by the couple Pierluigi Pardo and Stefano Nava was also good, characterized by some new phrases and a dynamic and engaging rhythm, despite a few too many repetitions on certain plays.", "date": "2016-09-30", "grade": "8.3"}
