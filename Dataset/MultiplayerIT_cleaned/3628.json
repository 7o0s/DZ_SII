However, reality has highlighted how the guys from Brace Yourself Games and Nintendo have certainly been more farsighted than all of us. A few months after the announcement and in the middle of the E3 period, a very special hybrid arrives on Switch, which combines the roguelike/musical gameplay with the atmospheres of the very old chapters of The Legend of Zelda, without neglecting however an aesthetic and stylistic figure taken from the recent Breath of the Wild. With these assumptions, a title with a very strong inspiration and an important legacy is developed, which is accompanied by an almost infinite replayability, culminating in a cooperative mode which is the icing on the cake of the production, net of some deburring. The same story, more or less Cadence of Hyrule is obviously set, as the title itself tends to remind us, in the world that has been the backdrop to the adventures of Link and his companions for about thirty years. Cadence, former protagonist of Crypt of the Necrodancer, finds herself catapulted for no good reason in the lands of Hyrule, forced to choose soon whether to awaken Link or Zelda. This choice profoundly changes the gameplay, which we will discuss in detail later. From a narrative point of view, trying to save the kingdom with one or the other does not change the events, even more so that it is still possible to awaken the second companion through one of the ~quests~ present in the game and alternate at will between the hero and princess. Our aim is to defeat the mysterious Octavo, who has taken full power over Hyrule, delegating the various areas to four of his subordinates. The structure of Breath of The Wild is therefore somewhat replicated, with the need to defeat the four bosses to get to face Octavo who, who knows, may not be the only threat awakened in Hyrule. A trivial pretext for an equally simple and barely sketched plot, as was to be expected from Cadence of Hyrule. Nonetheless, the adventure runs smoothly, between fun encounters, a map that re-proposes the areas of the kingdom as we have known them recently and is embellished by a whole series of non-player characters external to the events of the world to which they belong, who they add color and sometimes even bring a few smiles. As mentioned, replayability is high and this factor is determined by two different elements: the procedural nature of the adventure, which modifies the dungeons in which we will be called to enter from time to time, and the ability to constantly entertain thanks to the randomness that leads to find this or that other object, pushing you to face your game in an ever-changing way. A cadenced gameplay Anyone who has dealt with Crypt of the Necrodancer in recent years will easily recognize the foundations from which Cadence of Hyrule is based. Within real paintings (as the game areas of each individual title were once called) which reproduce an extraordinary, highly detailed Pixel Art, we are called to move following the rhythm of the music of that area. A metronome at the bottom of the screen and the grid on the playing field helped us better navigate this riot of psychomotor coordination, which is more difficult said than done. It is evident that never having played the progenitor of the genre creates moments of initial confusion: on the other hand some design choices such as the automatic attack, the movement on boxes (of which sometimes the directionality also counts) and the need to move time, under penalty of immobility and loss of points, are very interesting elements but difficult for the player to digest quickly. What makes this Cadence of Hyrule more affordable on average than the team's first work is the possibility of instantly returning to life, despite the existence of permadeath, which can be activated initially and which allows the title to be transformed into a very brutal roguelike/ roguelite. As we have already said, it is necessary to count well not only the time but also the movements to be performed. Approaching an enemy to attack him implies the need to wait for the right opponent's position, otherwise you will arrive second on time and be hit. Death leads to a screen (which to tell the truth it is possible to bypass) in which to spend the only exchange currency that can be accumulated between one gameover and another: diamonds. Obtainable at each painting once all opponents have been killed, or recovered in specific points of Hyrule, they join the chiavi and rupees, other consumables that are lost with each death, along with all objects with a durability. This applies to torches, rings, pieces of equipment, shovels for digging and whatnot. The clashes with the different types of enemies and the structure of Hyrule lead to a natural cleaning of the game world, especially when it is possible to recognize areas that are now important for every fan of the saga, to which Brace Yourself Games has given the appropriate recognition. This is how the approach to the Lost Wood inevitably leads to the need to find the way in an apparently dead-end labyrinth (it is possible to recover an object useful for finding the right way). The same goes for the villages, which recall the mythology of the place and which often hide secrets of the lore of The Legend of Zelda. What surprises most of all in the course of the adventure is the way in which the team has managed to give originality and fidelity in equal measure, touching everyone's strings and never getting bored. The possibility then of using both Link and Zelda gives that differentiation of approach that never hurts. While the first is much more classic, focusing everything on the attack and then on the guard with the shield, Zelda is initially more fragile, but will gradually recover a series of stones that will make her a skilled sorceress. Not all objects will be usable by both and this allows you to vary not only the gameplay elements but to make one or the other more suitable based on the situation. To be honest, it must be said that when playing in co-op, the possibility of having both on the screen also often involves the ~breaking~ of the various puzzles, which suddenly become simpler, almost completely eliminating the degree of challenge. Which by the way is also possible individually, thanks to the option that disables the need to go to the rhythm. It goes without saying that this element destroys any reason for the existence of the game itself but, as we always say in this case, better to have it than not. To conclude a rich offer we take care of the ranking of the players, which pushes to always improve with the aim of completing the adventure according to some specific requests. We talked about a rich offer because Cadence of Hyrule is certainly a deep and replayable title, but certainly not a long one. The single game, even if it is the first one that is completed, can be concluded easily between five and six hours, drastically decreasing once the key elements of the gameplay and progress are known. This detail does not nullify its structural fullness, nor can it be considered a real defect - after all, the game world is so vast that it responds to everyone's needs - what, however, is not convincing is its selling price. As often happens when it comes to titles that exploit such strong licenses, twenty-five euros seemed decidedly a bit too much for the amount of content, adequate if instead we consider the care with which they were made. To you the choice. Pixel art and the love of tradition As we've already mentioned, Cadence of Hyrule is a real gem to watch on the go. It is useless to reiterate the usual distinctive element of Nintendo Switch, with a portable version full of colors and with a disarming aesthetic quality, which unfortunately collides with a washed-out, less detailed and even slightly more ~jerky~ vision when it comes to the home and exploits the console dock. Net of this, the work of Brace Yourself Games is incredible. The attention to detail, the ability to reproduce creatures and places in pixel art and the structure of all Hyrule - which in all respects represents one of the protagonists of the game - translates into a declaration of love that is difficult to quantify. It is clear how much the team has felt the responsibility of the legacy placed in their hands, but which evidently has also turned into the drive to give something more, surprising everyone, the first to write. Hyrule is alive, colorful, differentiated and full of little secrets, embellished by a painstaking and very successful work on the soundtrack. Moving in time is not only the aim of the game, but something natural that comes from listening to remixes of dizzying historical pieces. We feel free to recommend it to all Crypt of the Necrodancer lovers, to those of The Legend of Zelda and also to all those who love fully successful experiments, of which this is one of the greatest exponents of recent years.", "date": "2019-06-17", "grade": "8.5"}
