And why should we have to change it? Well, simply because the Urban Trial Freestyle riders, even if they have a helmet and well fastened it, and the lights are very on (not during the day, but let's fly over it), it certainly cannot be said that they are cautious their lifestyle... Like my bike Urban Trial Freestyle, already released last February on PSN in the PlayStation 3 and Vita versions, is nothing more or less a clone of Trials 2: Second Edition, a game originally released on PC in 2008 which has reaped great acclaim both critically and of public. Since the cloning operation is very, shall we say, shameless, anyone who has had anything to do with the aforementioned Trials 2 and/or its sequels also available on Xbox Live already knows exactly what to expect: it is an arcade motorcycle title which at first glance it could appear as the evolution of the very old Excitebike, even if in reality the latter was even more ~three-dimensional~ than the very two-dimensional concept here. On the saddle of an initially rickety motocross bike, our pilot/acrobat has to face routes, set in typical urban scenarios, generally non-linear and bristling with obstacles, ramps, bumps and much less orthodox communication routes than a traditional paved road; this gives the cross rider the opportunity, while trying to reach the finish line, to perform spectacular jumps, real flights, and consequent acrobatic acrobatics. The peculiarities of the Trials 2 concept, borrowed in all respects in the present Urban Trial Freestyle, however, are essentially two. The first is, as we said, a perfect two-dimensionality: despite the polygonal graphics, the stages are framed laterally as in any 2D platform (even if the camera allows itself some digressions to favor the show), and the bike can only go in two directions, forwards and backwards, as well as obviously up and down following jumps and falls. The second is the spasmodic use of the simulation of very unrealistic physics, decidedly exaggerated, but coherent with itself and with the purposes of the game. In short, a concept that is an extreme declination of all those arcade sports titles, like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, which are based more on acrobatics and spectacularity than on a classic competitive spirit; but how does the production object of our test interpret it? The game is spread over five areas, each including four different courses, which can be tackled in two different modes, Against Time and Acrobatics. The first shouldn't give rise to problems of interpretation, while on the second there is a detail to specify: the stunts we are talking about are not the classic ones that can be performed with various combinations of buttons, but more of the objectives that the game sets in particular points of the course, such as a certain distance to beat in height or in length during a jump, or a classic speed-trap. Depending on your performance, the game gives a rating of one to five stars for each stage faced, and only with the minimum of three stars can you advance to the next level. In all this you will be rewarded for each level completed with sums of money, and further bonuses can be reached along the tracks in places accessible only with very high or very long jumps, or in particularly well hidden places, which gives a pinch of exploratory component to the action; with the money thus obtained you can buy new parts for your vehicle that will improve its speed, acceleration and handling characteristics, access motorcycles other than the starting one, and also dedicate yourself to the pilot's aesthetics by buying helmets and fashionable clothing. Urban Trial Freestyle is a decent Trials 2 clone, which is worth the little money it costs The 3D effect As you can easily guess from the game genre, stereoscopy takes nothing away and adds nothing to the playability of Urban Trial Freestyle. However, it is a pleasant addition that increases the already considerable spectacularity of the action, although it is set slightly upwards, and therefore must be managed using the appropriate lever, and has a slight but perceptible influence on the framerate. No, vertigo is really fear of falling Thanking the evergreen Lorenzo Cherubini for the inspiration kindly granted for the titles of the paragraphs, let's first of all say that the first stage, which can be tackled easily with the accelerator at full throttle, managing the analog stick just a little to putstand in line with the ground and avoid a disastrous post-landing fall, it could deceive you: already from the second you will learn that even just to remain standing, without then wanting to go and find the secrets of each circuit and beat the acrobatic objectives, you have to manage well the rotations of the bike, the brake and even the reverse gear, and basically you can forget the five stars before having assimilated by heart the various tracks which also present small events scripted from time to time. In short, like any good self-respecting digital delivery, Urban Trial Freestyle makes up for the non-exciting length with a rather high and steep level of difficulty, fortunately however reserved more for perfectionists than for those who are satisfied with the minimum result; the latter will instead enjoy a typically portable ~pick up and play~ good spirit, made up of short, fast and not excessively frustrating challenges if you only aim, precisely, to get to the end. Longevity is therefore not excellent for those who are not looking for the highest score, but it is implemented first of all with five challenge maps to unlock in which the traditional controls are replaced by motion sensors: good idea, but very forgettable realization, mostly for the obvious management problems of a similar mechanism on a portable console that we have found in practically all 3DS titles that use it. Still to increase the longevity there is then a functional and fun track editor, exclusive to 3DS, very well done and which for the more creative could even constitute the strong point of the game; unfortunately it is not possible to share one's creations with other users, and the online component is very limited, which stops at the rankings, while multiplayer is totally absent. Finally, a mention of the technical component is dutiful, especially because, at least at first glance and thanks to the intrinsic spectacularity of the game, the graphics are very impactful: the scenarios are rich in elements, sufficiently detailed and well textured, and during the jumps , when the camera moves and enlarges, the graphic engine is able to frame a large number of them; the fluidity suffers a bit, lower than its PSN counterparts but always constant, however, since the title also has to manage an unrealistic but somewhat complex physics engine (and from this the motion and rider animations also benefit) the graphics sector can only be promoted. On the other hand, the sound is average, with the classic (and few) ~urban~ punkish tunes and standard sound effects.", "date": "2013-07-15", "grade": "7.0"}
