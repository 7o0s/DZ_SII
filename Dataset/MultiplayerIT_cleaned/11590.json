{"name": "Pro Evolution Soccer 2008 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pro-evolution-soccer-2008-recensione_b.html", "text": "Bread (hard) for your teeth A necessary premise must be made. On a purely ~conceptual~ level, PES 2008 for Wii is immensely distant from the philosophy of the Nintendo console. If the latter has in fact been advertised over and over again as a turning point for non-gamers, capable of offering such simplicity and accessibility as to immediately put at ease those who have always had at least a conflictual relationship with videogames, well, with Konami's fatigue are probably at the opposite end of that spectrum. PES 2008, to be clear, is certainly not the product to choose for playing a game with grandma or little cousin; for such occasions, you can continue to keep Wii Sports good, or even the pleasant Fifa 08. Instead, Pro Evo keep it aside for yourself, for the ~old guard~ player you have inside, or at least to challenge a friend / opponent of a thousand games. This is no joke. Anyone who has followed the development of the project will probably have realized the ambition with which the control system was studied. In practice, the programmers have chosen to offer the possibility of controlling not only one player at a time, but a large part of the team or in any case all those who are participating in the action at that moment, be it offensive or defensive. Someone has brought this type of mechanics closer to that of RTS for PCs, and on balance in many respects the comparison is not risky. In fact, a cursor is always present on the screen, obviously controlled by the wiimote, with which to effectively and continuously interact with your players. Let's take some examples. Imagine being in the attack phase, perhaps in midfield, and looking at your flanks it occurs to you that it would be perfect if one of your players cut inside using a hole in the opponent's defence. With a normal pad, and therefore with all the previous chapters of the series, there was only to cross your fingers and hope for the goodness of the artificial intelligence of your companions. On the wii, however, it is easily done: while you are controlling the ball with one player, just press A on another and then move the cursor to the desired point. By doing so, the athlete will immediately run towards the indicated destination, allowing his ~plans~ to be carried out exactly as planned. We wanted to propose a simple example, but it should be made clear that the movements of multiple teammates can be determined at the same time, always with the same method. It is therefore immediately clear from now on the almost total level of control guaranteed by PES 2008 for Wii, superior in a way not even remotely comparable to all the other football video games we have been used to so far. Football my way The first hours of playing with Konami fatigue pass, especially for fans of the old PES guard, with a smile permanently printed on their faces. For example, the pass is delegated to trigger B; but with the configuration of the controls studied for the occasion, it is possible to aim exactly with the cursor at the point where you want the ball to be kicked. The interesting thing is that the B key can also be held down, and in this case the player closest to the cursor will move towards that area; an aspect that adds further depth to the maneuvering possibilities. As for the player with the ball, this can be controlled via the nunchuk's analog stick; but to dribble and run it is on the contrary necessary to hold down A, and move the omnipresent cursor in the desired direction. Instantly, your athlete will move in that direction, and the farther the indicator is, the faster the run will be. On the other hand, shots are performed by shaking the nunchuk, a movement that also allows high balls to be headed in the defensive phase. A swipe of the wiimote on such occasions allows the line of defenders to be raised to implement the offside trap. But in general it is all the management of the covering phase that further detaches from the ~norm~, given that you have practically no direct control of any player: in fact, to defend you have to draw the running lines of your teammates (always with the usual method) and then click on the attacker by holding down A for a light press, or with Z+nunchuk shake for the slide. We realize that describing the game mechanics of PES 2008 for Wii is particularly difficult in words, but take heart: it is also in deeds. Yes because, as anticipated, the difficulty is really marked and the learning curve extremely steep. We don't mean the ability to score or win matches: on the other hand, the ~stars~ are there on purpose, and at the lowest levels theopponents are really submissive and not very incisive. We are referring to the possibility of effectively exploiting the possibilities offered, of successfully controlling 5 or more players at a time, of building actions and bringing them to a conclusion. The actions that can be performed and the things to keep in mind are many, in a much greater number than in traditional PES, and in some cases the frustration can manifest itself more than concretely. But for fans, for those who intend to spend hours and hours on the virtual turf, it is enough to know that there is simply no football title that offers even remotely comparable depth and the possibility of total control of the team. For football strategists, aspiring coaches, we are in heaven or almost; you have to constantly forget to focus your attention only on the ball carrier and look more broadly at the whole team, the movements and the possibilities of insertion, to then put them into practice and maybe throw the ball into the back of the net. And the satisfaction, in such cases, is truly unique. Defects? Yes please PES 2008 for Wii is such a smart and interesting game that it really exudes the passion of the programmers towards the sport. It is a sensationally successful alternative, which lays extremely concrete foundations for the continuation of the series on these tracks. But there are some defects, both linked to the inevitable sins of youth, and to the ~chronic~ limitations of the gameplay. First of all, the defensive phase, even with the experience gained from many matches, leaves room for some criticism since sometimes it is required to issue so many commands in a few moments that it puts you in serious difficulty and with the risk of leaving defensive chasms which in the most cases turn into goals. Furthermore, in some cases some commands overlap: for example in attack, while holding down A to move the player with the ball, in case you want to make a pass you must be careful to lift your finger from button A, since that A+B leads instead to execute a triangle. Even the possibility of drawing only straight lines, and not curves for your athletes to follow, could somehow ~limit~ the most demanding. And again, paradoxically PES 2008 for Wii is much less suitable for multiplayer than traditional PES; this is due to the confusion on the screen caused by 2 cursors and by the different arrows present at the same time, and above all by the need to have a player with at least sufficient familiarity with the control system as an opponent. Which restricts the field to siblings/family members, friends who also own the game or those who are frequent visitors to their own ~game room~, even if in the latter case it is not guaranteed that those who have used a pad for years tradition wants to roll up their sleeves to throw themselves on this unprecedented challenge. Last but not least, it is essential to play PES 2008 on a fairly generously sized TV, because with just a few inches it could be a challenge to even make a decent pass. From a technical point of view, we are roughly in the Ps2 area or a little more; the 16:9 and 480p allow you to have a more than fair image quality, but graphically there are no significant changes compared to the ~old gen~ edition. The same goes for the sound, which does not give emotions and indeed irritates in the Italian edition due to the usual, unlistenable commentary to be silenced as soon as possible. As far as the available options are concerned, in addition to the classic modes for single game, championship, cup or penalty shootout, there is a sort of Master League called Champions Road and online multiplayer, of good quality even if a little poor in terms of of choices available. On the other hand, any editor is absent in an incomprehensible way, with the exception of the possibility of modifying the names of players and teams. On the next page you can read our interview with the game's producer, Akiyoshi 'Greyhound' Chosogabe. Comment PES 2008 for Wii is a product that really deserves to meet the commercial success that would pave the way for the beginning of a series based on these game mechanics. Because there simply isn't a football title that offers such depth and variety in the range of actions available. For the first time it is possible to control an entire team, and not one player at a time, a revolutionary factor that marks a turning point in the development of video games dedicated to the most beautiful sport in the world. A fantastic starting point, but not a flawless masterpiece. An extraordinarily innovative product, but which for some might be too different from the tradition of years and years of prlinear ogress pad in hand. It is undoubtedly a difficult game to master, requiring dedication and commitment. But, never like this time, it's really worth rolling up your sleeves: Konami's next-gen, at least for this year, lives in the Nintendo house. Pros Revolutionary Oozes passion As fulfilling as few others Cons Long and steep learning curve Hardly accessible local multiplayer For some it will be ~too~ different Time to present to the press the new Pro Evolution Soccer for Nintendo Wii, which perhaps with a touch of surprise is proving to be the most appropriate version of the year and one of the most innovative ideas of recent times in the videogame-football scene. An opportunity also to meet Akiyoshi 'Greyhound' Chosogabe, producer and creator of the title who, despite the limited time available, proved willing to answer a few questions more directly focused on the development and production phase. Multiplayer.it: Before all tell us what projects you worked on before this Pro Evolution Soccer for Wii Akiyoshi 'Greyhound' Chosogabe:I started working in the PES team as a designer and already at the time of the first ISS PRO, while the first game I produced was PES Management three years ago. This version for Wii is the second title that I make myself. Multiplayer.it: The control system is revolutionary and the main point of interest of the production. Where did the idea to develop it come from? Akiyoshi 'Greyhound' Chosogabe: I thought it was time to create a new control system, a new concept for the Wii. My idea is to give the possibility to control the entire team, both defensively and offensively; this is the biggest innovation of this version. Multiplayer.it: Do you think that the chosen setting can favor only the most hardcore users to the detriment of occasional players? Akiyoshi 'Greyhound' Chosogabe: We showed the game in Spain last year, in Seville, and many other journalists told me it looked complex. However, I think it's only an appearance and that once you start playing, you feel at ease immediately. So no, I'm not worried about it... Multiplayer.it: What was the most difficult task you had to face during development? Were there any ideas that you didn't have the time or opportunity to implement? Akiyoshi 'Greyhound' Chosogabe: The hardest thing for our team was to think in a fresh and innovative way, because many of us are big fans of the classic PES and their gameplay. We have created more than 100 different variations on the main game model, such as being able to curve the lines drawn on the field to direct the players; we thought it was too complex for the players. However I think I have realized all the main ideas that I wanted to realize. Multiplayer.it:Online multiplayer only supports single matches. Did the Wii's Friend Codes system influence the creation of more complex content or was there something else behind the decision? Akiyoshi 'Greyhound' Chosogabe: We focused on making one-on-one gameplay that also technically performs well, without too many frills. In the future, however, we think we can add other modes such as tournaments, it is possible. Multiplayer.it: Finally, a joke about the other versions of PES this year. They are still good but lack the freshness shown by yours; do you have any suggestions for those who are working on making those for next year? Akiyoshi 'Greyhound' Chosogabe: Seabass, the producer of the other versions, is working with me on the next incarnation of PES, so I know exactly where next year's one is going and I think it will show a totally new game concept. However, I don't have any direct suggestions for Seabass, I just think he's stimulated by my work due to the new ideas introduced. Multiplayer.it: Thank you very much, see you next time. Akiyoshi 'Greyhound' Chosogabe: Thank you.", "date": "2008-03-05", "grade": null}
