There was a period, between the end of the nineties and the very beginning of the 2000s, in which it was easy to come across the original cabinet. Some of you may have seen one in the town arcade when there still was one; others in the bars frequented during the summer holidays, perhaps even in the seaside ones. However, it was easy to recognize that beautiful all-black vertical pillar equipped with a screen, also because it sported two captivating plastic pistols on the front, one blue and the other red, the so-called ~light guns~. everything and you never really invent anything: it was only a matter of time, before finding yourself grappling with the remake of the very first The House of the Dead. And why not, after all? The developers of MegaPixel Studio immediately found the perfect console, the only one capable of restoring the sensation of holding guns, aiming and shooting. We are talking about Nintendo Switch, of course, and its Joy-Con equipped with a gyroscope, motion sensors and many other beautiful things. The review of The House of the Dead Remake that you are about to read is based exactly on the version tested on Nintendo Switch. Keep in mind, however, that someone has already eyed The House of the Dead Remake also on PlayStation 4. The plot of the good old days The dear old mansion from The House of the Dead Remake The plot: nowadays video games must necessarily have one, because the very demanding crowd of players just needs any pretext to take up the pitchforks. The House of the Dead Remake also has its own narration, but it dates back to the ~good old days~ in which the playful offer - especially that of the arcades - was satisfied with much more modest stories. It should be emphasized that, apart from minimal content elements and updated graphics (which are not that much updated on balance), MegaPixel Studio has proved to be very faithful to the starting content. Maybe some reminders can come in handy, because a lot of water has passed under the bridge. Perhaps you will remember the initial moments of The House of the Dead: the pressing soundtrack, the very rapid shots, the already beautiful enemies ready on the screen, the phone call from a woman, the car speeding on the pavement of the villa; then you start shooting, and good luck in rebuilding the context. Because the title, today as then, demands its good dose of attention: you have to put all the pieces back together one at a time, playing it and if necessary replaying it again, also because between crossroads and alternative endings it is not enough to reach the end credits (it will take you less than an hour) for understanding everything about The House of the Dead Remake. The writer remembers the story in question well, but has also refreshed his memory with due study; the passage of time had erased, for example, the names of all the characters. Anyway, the woman that was rumored is Sophie Richards. Sophie worked for a mad scientist, Roy Curien, who managed to create an army of zombies to conquer the Earth. Thomas Rogan, the woman's boyfriend, and his colleague G arrive on site (the villa-laboratory). From then on, they shoot as if there were no tomorrow, saving (or letting them die, the choice is yours) , up to the comparison with Curien. Sophie's fate will depend on you. A bit, in truth, also from the pointing system on Nintendo Switch. Read on to move on to the ~pains~ of this historic re-enactment. The problems of the remake Not all characters in The House of the Dead Remake fare well It is good that you know what you are buying. Let's start from a necessary premise: the condition of The House of the Dead Remake on Nintendo Switch is not disastrous. The title is enjoyable and for true lovers of the genre, we are ready to bet, it will prove to be an exhilarating experience again. But one must also be objective and admit that much more could have been done, proposing - in all probability - a better return in any respect. A little more effort on the part of the development team would have been enough, clearly in the face of a longer gestation. Among the problems of the remake, the first to report concerns the game system. The cabinet had its beautiful colored guns, while here you will hold a single Joy-Con in your hands, in the hand you prefer: with ZL or ZR you open fire on enemies, while the L and R keys (or with B) reload the gun. It is no longer necessary to ~point~ off the screen, as was the case in the past, which simplifies the situation a lot. If aiming at the TV screen and slaughtering everything that moves on the screen is fun, though, the same can't be said of the implementationentation of gyroscope and motion sensors. Will you be able to save your girlfriend in The House of the Dead Remake? Even if sensitivity, in every aspect, can be modified at will, The House of the Dead Remake is not precise, and even when everything goes as it should, it returns a wooden sensation. Then, don't think of playing in portable mode, that is, with the two Joy-Con connected to the console and tilting it to aim at the enemies, because at that point you would enter the realm of anarchy. Sure, in both TV and Tabletop Mode you could still use the Left Stick to manually move the crosshair around the screen, but at that point the game itself would completely lose sense. The technical sector was also bad: honestly we expected much more, also because the photos published in recent months by the developers on social networks were more than discreet, or in any case boding well. The House of the Dead Remake, on the other hand, is really ugly to look at, including more neglected polygonal models and interpenetrations. All right, even the original wasn't this masterpiece of technique and animation, but twenty-five years have also passed and Nintendo Switch is perfectly capable of offering much more substantial, vast and detailed titles. Will you be able to save all the scientists from The House of the Dead Remake? To counterbalance this general mediocrity, luckily the contents take care of it. From this point of view it is not possible to accuse the developers of laziness: again we note the presence of the Horde Mode (many, many more zombies!), a gallery containing the 3D models of all the monsters eliminated along the Story mode, multiple objectives (you will have to dissect the title in all its secrets to complete the collection), and even a photo with all the scientists of the villa, who are waiting to be saved by you. So be careful where you aim: the monsters are hit, not those poor people in white coats!", "date": "2022-04-09", "grade": "6.2"}
