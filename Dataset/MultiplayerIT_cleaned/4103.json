In recent years, the Swedish software house has given us real immediately recognizable pearls, solid productions with never dull gameplay, always focused on inventiveness: think, for example, of Stick it to The Man and Zombie Vikings. After the slightly more ambitious parenthesis of Fe, Zoink Games returns to its origins with a surreal and crazy puzzle platformer, Flipping Death, set in the same universe as Stick it to The Man, of which it is after all the obvious spiritual sequel. What happens after death? And above all, what happens if you die, but Death decides to go on vacation, leaving us with his scythe in our hands? You are about to find out. A funeral plot After the multiplayer parenthesis of Zombie Vikings, Zoink Games returns to its origins, between the immediately recognizable atmospheres and the refined and peculiar artistic style that at the time were praised in Stick it to The Man. And once again the protagonist of the improbable narration is a decidedly singular character towards which the player immediately feels sympathy: this time it's up to Penny Doewood, a slender, exuberant girl with an immoderate passion for the macabre, the gothic and the color black. Not even on purpose Penny works at a funeral home, at least before being fired (for the umpteenth time) due to her too energetic character. Armed with good will and the desire to have fun, the girl decides to spend a quiet evening in the company of her boyfriend Elliot, proposing a short walk in the city cemetery (tastes are tastes). Penny has no idea that this will also be the last walk of her short and impetuous life: the floor of a mausoleum gives way and she literally breaks her back falling on a giant boulder. Thus she ends up in the Kingdom of the Dead, a place that she doesn't even like to say like crazy because it is perfectly in line with her aesthetic tastes. Among other things, she also finds a new job, given that Death exchanges her with her replacement and flees on vacation to the Moon, leaving her Scythe and Cloak in her hand, as well as the task of listening to the complaints of the various souls present. If all this good dose of madness has already positively amazed and interested you, know that it is not even a tenth of what you will find in Flipping Death: director of the narration, among others, also returns Ryan North of the comics Adventure Time and we ensure that the quality of the stories told and of the main plot is constantly improving, in the face of an unfortunately small duration. Gameplay between life and death Flipping Death's narrative marries excellently with fresh and curious puzzle-platform mechanics. To continue the story Penny must listen to the petulant requests of the souls of the Kingdom of the Dead: each of them is suspended in limbo due to some ~unfinished business~ in the real world (Flatwood Peaks and surroundings), and it will be Penny's job to bring them towards eternal peace. Charisma and funny situations never fail: in hell there is a sailor killed by his wife because he had dedicated his boat to his lover, and his soul is waiting for the boat to receive the last coat of paint, strictly in color blue. And then the player will have to ingenuity to paint it, but how to do if Penny is relegated to the World of the Dead? Here comes the ~flip~ mechanics of the production: the protagonist can travel between the two worlds just as if they were the two sides of the same sheet of paper (artistically created divinely), it is enough for her to take control of one of the living Flatwood Peaks. Once ~possessed~ the unfortunate person on duty, Penny can control his thoughts and his body, exploiting the particular characteristics of each of them. Among the many crazy characters present, in the initial stages you will find a policeman in need of affection, a somewhat crazy superhero who feels the need to touch everything and everyone, and a frustrated dentist. Going back to the example of the boat to be painted, the puzzle is solved by getting the dentist to open the paint can with his drill. From time to time you have to ingenuity and reason with the various characters available to perform certain tasks, but the puzzle game soul of Flipping Death is perhaps the most successful aspect of the production together with the artistic and stylistic sector. The solutions are never obvious, sometimes perhaps even not very intuitive, and for this reason a clue system available in the pause menu helps especially younger players to continue the adventure. If this is the part of thegameplay that takes place ~in life~, the other part belongs instead to the realm of the dead: it is from here that Penny takes control of the living, but to do so she must first collect strange little fluttering creatures, a bargaining chip for possession. In the platform phases an original scythe and teleportation-based mechanism is used: the reaper's weapon can be launched against the platforms and then allow Penny to teleport on them. Unfortunately, everything does not always happen with the required precision, and sometimes in general the movements of the characters seem more uncertain than deliberately caricatural; but they are defects that last just a second and that never really manage to question the general goodness of the entire production.", "date": "2018-08-14", "grade": "8.0"}
