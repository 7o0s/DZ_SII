Dynasty Warriors: Gundam 2 (henceforth DWG2) is the second incarnation of the action starring Amuro Ray, Char Aznable and all the company that made the anime popular from the late 70s to the present day, through dozens of series, OVAs and animated films. Once again the developers are the guys from Omega Force, an internal team from time immemorial and already authors of all Dynasty and Warriors titles. DWG2 follows the path already traced by years and years of experience in the sector, representing a perfect example of how Koei intends the hack'n slash genre with tactical, action and rpg elements, a fusion as particular as it is unique. One of the features of this chapter dedicated to Gundam is being able to choose your own mech and its pilot, thus being able to create hundreds of different combinations that can exploit the strengths of both: the possibilities are many, even if in practice, pad to hand, remain unexpressed and the heart of the gameplay is unchanged. For example, while many Gundams are capable of many ranged moves, flying, missile launches, or special shots, most of the action takes place via melee action. War Chronicles The story mode, the real juice of the game, takes up the events narrated in the original anime during the Universal Century, a fictitious historical period that serves as a guideline for the entire Gundam saga. DWG2 is a small encyclopedia: it contains facts, events, mechs and characters from the entire universe created by the Sunrise studio and which has now become a true cultural icon. The mission mode, on the other hand, takes advantage of the game mechanics of the story mode to make the player participate in totally new missions and recreated specifically for the occasion. It is also possible to take advantage of an excellent cooperative multiplayer, alongside a friend, and the internet connection to play online up to 4 people in arenas, missions and battles. The connection is very stable and there is no lag, even when playing against foreign users at a great distance. The roster of available robots has expanded to 63 elements, compared to the 19 of the first chapter: they include mechs that we had already appreciated in the past but were not selectable, such as the Hambrabi and the Guncannon, and others taken from the Z, ZZ, F91, Victory, G, Wing and the recent Seed Destiny. Unfortunately, however, the original Japanese audio has been eliminated in favor of the US dub. However, the text and subtitles have been fully localized. The game library, available through the options menu, contains a wealth of information on everything we encounter in the game, starting from the enemies, the flying fortresses, the characters and the new huge bosses. A small encyclopedia very welcome to all fans. Xbox 360 goals Dynasty Warriors: Gundam 2 is a title that offers very little satisfaction even from the point of view of unlockable objectives. It offers 1000 as a prize, as per tradition, but finishing the main story you will see only 25 appear. To get the others, the game requires you to complete it with all the characters, repeating the adventure (already boring in itself) dozens of times . Other points are unlocked by accumulating experience with online modes, but it's all terribly slow. It will take months to get all the loot. The world of Gundam in one game The gameplay, the main source of fun and satisfaction in any video game, has remained almost unchanged, not only compared to the previous Gundam chapter, but also considering the old chapters of the Dynasty series. Despite the three selectable difficulties, DWG2 is very simple and can be completed almost exclusively by fighting with swords in hand-to-hand duels. Only on rare occasions, when encountering final bosses, did we encounter a few more difficulties. The very structure of the game is therefore very obsolete and repetitive: you go on for hours destroying opposing mechs, in a no-brain sequence of compulsive and sequential attacks with the sole aim of cleaning up enemy areas. Almost all levels, to be completed, have the requirement to be freed from opponents, nothing more. The various upgrades, armor improvements, secondary weapons and power-ups that we find going forward are added in the briefing screen between one level and another, but they don't particularly affect thethe variety of the game, but rather on the attack choreographies (very numerous, however useless). The graphics sector has remained unchanged from the first Koei game of the genre that appeared on Xbox 360, except for some small additions such as shaders on the robot chassis and little else. The visual horizon shows the structural limits of the engine, with obvious pop-ups in the scenery that stand out behind the battles, which are uninspired and lacking in detail. The on-screen enemies are plentiful, but the limited AI makes them mere visual decor rather than a serious challenge. The level design doesn't shine and forces the player to take long walks between one area and another, without meeting anyone and without the possibility of doing something other than walking. The sense of deja-vu, for those who have already played any Dynasty chapter and especially those who have completed the previous Gundam, is very strong: many locations have been filmed and slightly modified, and the missions look terribly like the first chapter. Even the audio sector has been extensively recycled with already heard and also very repetitive sounds and soundtracks. Not to mention the fact that the speech is entirely in English.", "date": "2009-05-12", "grade": "5.0"}
