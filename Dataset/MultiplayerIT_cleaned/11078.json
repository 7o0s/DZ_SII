{"name": "Zookeeper World", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/zookeeper-world-recensione.html", "text": "Let's go back to the more classic bases of mobile gaming with this Zookeeper World review, which re-proposes one of the fundamental structures of the puzzle game and adds some simple management elements to make it look new. The result fails to rejuvenate the formula too much, but it satisfies the basic purpose perfectly: to offer a fun pastime. After many experiments, digressions into various genres and flights of fancy on the most artistic expressions applied to videogames, Apple Arcade returns to the foundations of mobile gaming to offer to all intents and purposes a thought harp, one of those that have made the fortune of the entire market and which continue however to be among the most played titles ever. Zoo Keeper, in case you don't know it, is an almost twenty-year-old series that started from the Nintendo DS and then moved on to different platforms including iOS, Android and Nintendo 3DS remaining substantially faithful to its origins, as in this case. However, to justify the back on the scene through Apple Arcade, Kiteretsu has decided to insert the classic match-3 style puzzle game within a slightly deeper and more structured framework, transforming everything into a sort of management system in which we build and organize the best our zoo. In this way, the puzzle component is justified by the need to purchase new elements to expand and enrich the theme park, also giving a unitary progression element to the various games, as is now a widespread custom to give new impetus and a sort of ~sense~. deeper to these new iterations of titles related to basic but always perfectly valid gameplay. The result of this mingling doesn't necessarily matter much, because the gameplay remains fundamentally tied to the old puzzle-style scheme, but it works to amalgamate the experience into a more organic and interesting mechanism. Pair animals and manage a zoo Zookeeper World brings back the classic match-3 puzzle mechanics but with different variations The gameplay still resides entirely in the match-three puzzle soul, which has distinguished the series for almost 20 years to date, but the management superstructure provides a sort of justification for direct action on the stickers to be associated. Leaving aside any logic, in the game we find ourselves playing a zoo keeper to whom the director orders to build the park by purchasing new plots of habitat, accommodation facilities and obviously animals, spending the money that accumulates by tackling the puzzle levels. Finding a sensible explanation for the fact that rows of identical animals must be associated on a grid to make them disappear is obviously a difficult undertaking, therefore let's avoid going into subtlety: in fact we find ourselves having to complete the schemes within a certain number of moves , making the animals disappear by associating them in rows of three or in squares made up of four figures, obviously taking advantage of the various linked moves that can derive from the joints and from the use of bonuses such as fruit and various ~bombs~, capable of freeing up extra spaces. It starts from practically the same structure made famous by Candy Crush (and various others), but here it is declined with numerous variations that manage to add various elements of challenge. Each level requires you to achieve certain objectives in a given number of moves, usually it is a question of eliminating a certain number of animals or collecting cards and objects hidden in the background, freeing up the space above. The puzzle parts allow you to get money to invest in the construction and enrichment of the zoo In other cases obstacles are introduced to break down with the association of the figures, which open up further spaces to manage, in general with a notable progressive introduction of variants and alternative elements and variants to be taken into consideration, able to keep the interest high even beyond the simple basic mechanics, which remains virtually constant throughout the game. Outside of all this, the park construction and management part is a very rose-water addition, but above all it serves to give the sense of progression between one game and another, succeeding in a satisfactory way. Purchasing bizarre animals is key to increasing the zoo's value Everything is held together by the typical characterization of the series, which sources the humorous and slightly demented Japanese style with the square graphics of Minecraft, creating a perfect atmosphere for a title of this type, also supported by an always very crazy musical accompaniment but enthralling.", "date": "2021-09-17", "grade": "7.8"}
