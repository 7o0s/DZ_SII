There are excellent games, mediocre games, and games that fluctuate: in the latter case it may be useful to insist on the most successful elements of the production, also to give credit to the hard work that led to the publication. Then come cases like Samael the Legacy of Ophiuchus, and there are two possible choices: change jobs or resign yourself to accepting the reality of the facts, and thus assigning one of the lowest grades ever. Of Samael the Legacy of Ophiuchus, unfortunately, there is nothing to value. Nothing is saved, except perhaps the initial idea and inspiration, which in any case would have done better to stay that way and not lead to the creation of the game we are about to tell you about in this review. Prepare a large glass of water, because while you read this your throat will probably go dry. Plot: not received Once upon a time there was Samael, one of the bravest generals of the Kingdom of Nevaeh, where harmony, concord and happiness thrived for centuries. Then time passed, Samael began to question himself and also his king: he began to wonder if it was possible to govern the vast kingdom in such a way that good coexisted with evil. A very captivating description, don't you think? Among other things, the Jewish reference to Samael is not bad: it is the Angel of Death, a creature considered both good and cruel. The protagonist of the title should therefore be well characterized, adequately represent this dichotomy both in his personality and in his actions within the game plot. But Samael the Legacy of Ophiuchus, on closer inspection, does not have a plot. Not even copied from Dark Souls, a title which is clearly inspired by. In the game you have Samael walking (or if you want to run) at random through a vast medieval fantasy world seemingly boundless, devoid of objectives, goals, motives and anything that would normally envisage such a title, classified by the developer Gilson B. Pontes as ~action~. It is also difficult to forget the name of Gilson B. Pontes, given that for all the endless opening titles it is repeated everywhere: he practically created the game from scratch. There's no reason to despair, however: even without a story, a game can still rely on gameplay, right? No. Not in this case. Gameplay: received, unfortunately If the plot of Samael the Legacy of Ophiuchus hasn't been received, the gameplay is there: the problem is that it doesn't work. Even assuming that your PlayStation 4 allows you to understand something of what is happening on the screen, which is not at all obvious since we had to make do, suspended between graphics that defining grainy is a compliment and then the real darkness of the night settings, it is difficult for you to be able to enjoy the action of the title. The player controls Samael, who as we had the pleasure of informing you shortly before runs like a madman around the game map brandishing his sword. His task is to face certain monsters present almost everywhere, after having duly searched for them at random, guided by some invisible darts present on the upper part of the screen (visible when the game decides it, of course). Approaching the monsters, the combat phase begins, in perfect Dark Souls or Bloodborne style (in theory): figure of our hero seen from behind, bad monster in the foreground, dodges and attacks after learning the enemy pattern. All this in the intentions of the developer, the never too mentioned Gilson B. Pontes, because in fact things go very differently. The protagonist's movements are almost always unpredictable, there is only one main attack, and a command allows you to parry enemy blows. Every single enemy hit proves lethal, there are no equipment of any kind, dodges or miracles, if you get hit you are dead, period. It could also be accepted, if then our alter ego collaborated in some way in the defeat of the enemy: between slow movements, actions performed at random despite the commands given, input lag and the perennial darkness we mentioned before, if you manage to defeat a monsters you will have really deserved the appropriate game trophy on PlayStation 4. In case of death of the protagonist, the game starts over: you will be thrown back into the medieval world (in a random point, there is no map anyway) and you will again have to meet monsters (at random) to defeat, and then move on to the next ones. All without the balbeit minimal purpose, of course. Technical sector: let's forget it The plot of Samael the Legacy of Ophiuchus does not exist, the gameplay (if it is possible to define it as such) does not allow at any time to enjoy something even vaguely similar to an action game: trust remains to be placed in the technical sector. After all, the page of the US PlayStation network reads: ~HDR support~ and ~PlayStation 4 Pro support~. It almost makes you think that even if it is not the GOTY of 2019 it can still offer a satisfactory glance, an interesting artistic direction, a minimum stimulus to continue to understand what the heck is happening on the screen. But it's all a big lie: Samael the Legacy of Ophiuchus is a lethal mix of blur, graininess, randomly thrown light effects, perpetual darkness, minimal polygonal models, grotesque animations and poor graphics. On PlayStation 4, playing it represents an enormous effort, because you really don't see anything and there are no settings with which you can hope to improve the situation in the slightest; everything is made even more disturbing and frustrating by an audio sector that limits itself to continuously proposing a strange mixture of drum roll and tribal sounds.", "date": "2019-02-12", "grade": "S.V."}
