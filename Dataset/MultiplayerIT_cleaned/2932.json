Square and Nintendo had ~broken~ after Final Fantasy VI, in '94, when the former had defected to the PlayStation with its revolutionary Final Fantasy VII. For almost ten years a Final Fantasy hadn't been seen on the big N consoles and that spin-off, which was already unusual in itself, was a bit like the prodigal son coming home. Crystal Chronicles was quite successful above all for its multiplayer approach and the originality of a different formula than usual, which then poured into a short series of autonomous sequels that reached 2009 and finally disappeared into thin air. Until today. For some reason, Square Enix decided to resurrect that 2003 title, remaster it, and bring it back to today's gamers with a few major tweaks. In doing so, however, as we will see in the review of Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles Remastered Edition, it has completely lost sight of the soul of a game which in truth has never been particularly brilliant and which has remained impressed above all on those who were lucky enough to play it by elbowing friends sitting on the sofa. The basics Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles is different from a common Final Fantasy not only in the gameplay, but also in the narration, entrusted to a series of skits that we will see randomly or at predetermined moments, but which in any case do not directly outline the story, but better outline the world in which the adventure takes place, leaving the player to interpret the plot. It is a peculiar approach that gives the Square Enix title a fairytale, subtle outline, but which in doing so sacrifices the characterization of the few supporting actors worthy of the name, characters that in most cases we will forget a few minutes after meeting them. This is why the new Mimik mechanic, implemented in the Remastered Edition, told us little or nothing: by collecting the hidden Moogle stencils it is possible to unlock the aspects of the various secondary characters, so as to be able to assume them during the adventure, only changing the shape of the our alter ego in order to create the illusion that we are playing as a specific supporting character. In fact, we will mainly control a character created on the spot by choosing between four races and five models each. Each race wields a different type of weapon and is more or less suited for magic or melee combat. Once our first character has been created, we will dive headlong into the world of Crystal Chronicles, in which the Miasma, a deadly poisonous mist, forces the inhabitants to leave at least once a year in search of the precious Myrrh, a substance which in some way manages to repel the deadly gas. The adventurers in question, and we are just one of them, travel far and wide forming real caravans: as time passes and myrrh accumulates, new portions of the map are discovered and with them the dungeons and points of interest to explore in search of treasures, resources and blueprints that will help us to craft better equipment. It is a rather simple loop, in reality, which does not even rely on a form of vertical progression since there are no experience points and, therefore, the usual level up. In the dungeons, some relics called Artifacts are collected which give the player permanent bonuses: once the boss is defeated, we will be authorized to choose one and only one, which is why the strengthening of our characters is mainly based on repeating the dungeons in search of different Artifacts and collection of patterns and materials useful for making weapons and armor. Here, however, the donkey falls, and to make you understand what went horribly wrong with the Remastered Edition of Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles we need to explain to you how the game worked in 2003. How it was played in 2003 Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles was basically a couch multiplayer experience. Up to four Game Boy Advances could be connected to the Game Cube and all played together on the same screen. Each player created his character, taking into account the needs of the caravan: an important choice, in fact, was the family trade, so each player contributed to the progress of the caravan, actively being part of the group not only in the dungeons, but also outside , in the city, where each character could take advantage of the advantages brought to the game by his companions. The caravan almost became a ~meta~ feature that reflected from the sofa to the TV. The players traveled together and even tackled the dungeons together, communicating by voice - by elbowing, perhaps, and above all! - during fights. Sinalso regulate the management of the Goblet, an accessory that had to be carried manually to protect the gang from Miasma in the dungeons: in single player, this task automatically falls to the Moogle who accompanies us, but if you play together with at least one friend he must be a player to time to take care of the Chalice, to transport it while the others protect it from the monsters. Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles was an extremely simple title in the design of the combat system, focused mainly on the single keypress that acquires the selected task from a simple scrolling menu. By setting the attack we will be able to strike in melee, perform simple combos and charge a more powerful physical blow; by setting the defense we can, well, defend ourselves; by setting the spells - which are found in the dungeons in the form of spheres - the iconic spells of the series are cast, which can also be combined with those of other players to make them more effective. Playing alone in 2020 Now, if you remove the multiplayer component from what has been described above, what remains is a deeply archaic action RPG which, sorry to say, has no reason to exist nowadays. Square Enix, although aware of the importance of the multiplayer component already seventeen years ago, preferred to focus on the unprecedented online functionality, and even did it clumsily. Let's try to go in order, because it is difficult to articulate the nonsense of this Remastered Edition which, however, has some strings to its bow of a certain value: first of all, the variety of platforms on which it is possible to play - which include not only the consoles, but also mobile devices - and then the so-called Lite version, downloadable for free as a sort of demo, which allows you to play only the first three dungeons of the campaign independently, or all the others (except the final one) if hosting the match is a player who owns the full version of Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles Remastered Edition. All this is very nice, but the online functionality in question is half a disaster, to be generous, because it starts from a completely wrong assumption, which is that the Crystal Chronicles formula is also suitable for modern multiplayer dynamics. Crystal Chronicles was a journey that we faced together with friends sitting next to us as if we were all together in the same caravan. Today Crystal Chronicles has become a single player action RPG in which it is possible to face the dungeons in company, but only those: all the more RPG part, starting with the combination of the individual progressions of the players, has been completely lost. And then, all in all, playing in company isn't even difficult, especially if you prefer random companions rather than friends you know, who you will have to register with a sort of temporary code. Then in that case joining a party in a dungeon or finding someone to keep you company in your raids is quite intuitive. Then the problems arise. The netcode isn't exactly the most stable. An unexpected disconnection will cause you to be kicked out of the party and dungeon, resetting all progress. At the end of the dungeon, you will find yourself on the map, alone, and you will have to reform the group every time. Communication no longer takes place with elbows, laughter, or voice - unless you use special software, of course - but with predefined expressions of dubious utility. The most absurd catch, however, is another: after completing a dungeon and defeating the boss, only the foreman progresses in his campaign. The others have the right to choose an Artifact each, of course, and keep the items found in the dungeon - which can't even be traded between players - but to progress in their personal campaign they will have to redo that dungeon from the beginning as squad leaders. Imagine having found three other friends to play with and having to repeat every single dungeon four times, at least, and more if you are looking for a particular Artifact or pattern: it is clear that something has gone terribly wrong if it becomes preferable to play as alone to have fewer problems in a title that was mainly designed to play in company. Completing the game alone is obviously possible: it takes about twenty hours, going quickly and minimizing the ~farm~ in the dungeons already completed, which however becomes more than appropriate considering how tough the enemies become over time. However, there is no real story that encourages you to continue alone, not to mention that it is impossible to access all the upgrades with a single character: you would have to grow several characters in parallel, choosing combinations of different races and professions. The problem is chand the management of several characters is not as intuitive as in Diablo III, for example, and the combat system lends itself very soon to the multiplayer dynamics for which it was designed. It will also be very easy to meld the spells yourself in the special menu, but it's all extremely woody, stiff, slow, and most enemies are fought by attacking, retreating to dodge their blows, then attacking again. Combos often leave you too vulnerable, so it's not recommended to use them, and the same goes for spells, slow to load and cumbersome to cast (you need to move a cursor on the map to hit a precise point). The bosses become real Chinese tortures: they have few attack patterns and an amount of life points that forces the player to hit and run for endless minutes, draining any semblance of fun. A disappointing retelling We can't blame Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles for its age. It's a game from seventeen years ago, designed for a completely different context, which returns to an era where multiplayer has made great strides. Perhaps Square Enix should have been more careful and far-sighted, and if they had planned a remastered version worthy of the name probably no one would have said a word. Unfortunately that was not the case. The Remastered Edition that we played left us dumbfounded, a lot and on several occasions. The unsustainable length of the uploads, which often follow one another at a fast pace within a few minutes, and the poverty of the graphics engine, to which some filters and unpretentious anti-aliasing have been applied, give the clear feeling that Square Enix has limited to a superficial emulation of the original software, between sizzling textures and inexplicable slowdowns. Loadings, however, are the real scourge of a game with an already too staid pace. Square Enix has also thought of giving voice to the characters, implementing a brand new dubbing that seemed almost improvised: some voices really have nothing to do with certain characters (this is the clear case of Stiltzkin the Moogle) and most of the dialogues are not is voiced at all, but summed up in synthetic grunts. The addition of the much-vaunted unpublished dungeons, which should have represented the extra content for the most tenacious able to finish the game, proved to be an equally disappointing soap bubble: they are not completely new scenarios, but recolored dungeons, full of enemies already seen. Another sting that even fans will struggle to take with philosophy.", "date": "2020-08-29", "grade": "5.0"}
