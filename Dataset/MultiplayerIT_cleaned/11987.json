{"name": "Pro Rally Racing", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pro-rally-racing.html", "text": "It has been since the dawn of wireless gaming that the combination of racing games / mobile phones has been cyclically re-proposed to us, indeed with few new features and always with the same defects. Gameloft tries to change the situation, focusing on those elements that can really make a difference and enriching the experience with various extra applications. This is how Pro Rally Racing was born, a title that on paper has all the characteristics necessary to establish itself within such a controversial genre. The initial screen of the game allows us to try our hand at a quick race or with the championship. The first, of course, is a way to begin to familiarize yourself with the control system and with the underlying philosophy of Pro Rally Racing, where it is the championship that contains the ~heavy~ elements of this production, which are revealed in the presence of numerous events around the world, each of which hides four different applications: the simple race, the time attack, the jump contest and the duel. It is clear that in the simple race you just have to get to the finish line trying to overtake all the other riders in the race, while in the time attack we have a time limit to pass under each check point. The jump contest is a small novelty, in which you have to make three jumps and total the required distance, while the duel is a simple one-on-one competition. One of the peculiar characteristics of Pro Rally Racing is certainly the issue of scoring: once a profile has been created, participating in races and winning them earns us points, and each score corresponds to an unlocked element. Since at the beginning we will have only one car available and three tracks, it is clear that winning will lead us to be able to use all five cars in the game (each different in terms of final speed, acceleration, maneuverability and resistance values) and to access each of the four events enclosed in each location. There are also extra races, which must be tackled in three heats. On the screen we can see the speed of the car but also an indicator that reveals the degree of resistance of the vehicle, resistance that is felt every time we collide with an opponent or with an element of the stage. The control system adopted for Pro Rally Racing is the best possible on a mobile phone: the joystick moves the car on the track, while accelerating with the 5 key of the numeric pad. The races reveal themselves to be rich in substance right from the start, with suggestive routes distinguished by a very beautiful and detailed background image, together with polygonal elements that make up the road but also some buildings and trees (the latter very, very essential) and a interesting rain effect. Everything flows by rather quickly, the sprites of the opposing cars already appear from a certain distance and this allows us to successfully avoid collisions. A greater number of animations for our car would certainly have helped, which turns using a few frames while leaving tire marks on the asphalt. The sound is of an excellent level, with lots of different music and good quality sampled effects: on mobile phones it is already not easy to obtain such a result.
