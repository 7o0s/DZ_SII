{"name": "Botworld Adventure", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/botworld-adventure-recensione.html", "text": "The Pokmon formula has been imitated and explored in various experiments, often without great success, but in some cases a rather original interpretation can emerge, as we see in this review of Botworld Adventure. After a period in early access, Featherweight Games' game is now available in a form that should be complete, expanded and cleaned up thanks to the early trial phase that has met with some success among mobile platform users. The clean graphics, the particular style and the way in which the various components of the gameplay fit together demonstrate a remarkable mastery in the construction of the game by the developers, also authors of the well-known Rodeo Stampede, and these characteristics favor a truly immediate entry into this bizarre world based on anthropomorphic animals and fighting robots. There isn't really a great story behind this adventure, which remains calm and light like its gameplay, also resulting welcoming and almost irresistible, if you get caught up in the mechanics of collection. The protagonist is an aspiring botmaster, or the equivalent of a Pokmon trainer but specialized in the construction and management of combat robots, and his destiny is simply to prove that he is able to build a solid team and complete a series of tasks that they are administered through various quests, scattered throughout a world made up of 12 areas characterized by different natural environments and architectures. Exploration, resource collection and fighting are the basic elements of the game, to which is also added the entire bot management part which represents an element of considerable interest, enriching the simple collection of fighters with a certain level of customization and strategic depth. Gameplay: Robot collecting, fighting and exploration In Botworld Adventure we explore a vast world divided into 12 areas Botworld Adventure is a real open world and although its extension is not exactly boundless, this considerable freedom of movement and the variety of settings are the characterizing elements of the gameplay. The quests lead us to wander around the 12 different areas of the game world, in search of loot and precious objects, with the main purpose remaining to build and increasingly strengthen one's party of combat robots. After having customized the protagonist in the shape of various anthropomorphic animals, choosing colors, clothes and somatic characteristics, we set off on the adventure to become real botmasters starting from a first robot provided by the parents. The collection of bots takes place by conquering the related projects to the different models and collecting materials and objects that allow their construction, but this is only the beginning of their management. As experience levels increase, further materials can be used to enhance each robot by unlocking active and passive skills according to real skill trees for each individual bot. The progression system also includes the bizarre ~house-boat~ which serves as a base and transport system for the protagonist, which can in turn be expanded and enhanced, receiving in return some bonuses and the possibility of customizing the interior. In Botworld Adventure, combat takes place in arenas where bots are thrown In addition to exploration and interaction with scenarios and NPCs, the other key element of the gaming experience is the combat system, which is presented as a mix between turn-based strategy and real-time automatic action: within small arenas, which open directly into the scenario, we can place three robots by choosing them from our team, selecting the position in which to deploy them. Once arranged, these act automatically based on their specific skills and characteristics, while the protagonist (as well as the opposing NPC, in case you fight against one of these) can support the team from the sidelines by launching attacks to distance or support skills, trying to better manage the various cooldowns. It is a rather simple system, but which also includes a certain strategic approach, especially in the preparation of bots through deep customization and their selection and arrangement on the field, which requires balance between melee, ranged, or support units. Microtransactions also develop around the construction of the characters and their management, given that we are talking about a free-to-play: beyond possible pay-to-win elements which, however, remain very much in the background given the lack of relevance of PvP , you have to consider that fuel and oil to repair and usare robots are limited and require a certain amount of time to recharge, except for the purchase of in-game currency with real money.", "date": "2021-10-21", "grade": "7.2"}
