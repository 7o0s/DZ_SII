The Italian version of Asterix & Obelix XXL 2 boasts a complete localization in our language, so both the texts and the dialogues are in Italian. These Romans are crazy Once in Las Vegum, Asterix and Obelix are faced with an entire city built solely for entertainment, with attractions of various types and full of Roman soldiers ready to do battle. From the beginning we see what will be the central theme of the game: among simple soldiers and commanders, it is possible to find a whole series of ~alternative~ Romans, parodies of the most famous video game characters. Mario from Super Mario Sunshine (complete with aqua gear), Ryu from Street Fighter, Sonic, Lara Croft, Rayman and more. The visual humor of the game hits the mark, as does the story and dialogues, which are really hilarious. And the spirit of Asterix cartoons is fully captured by sequences such as those in which Las Vegum is advertised, like a 1950s TV commercial. There is a whole series of really good ideas, placed within a linear but solid game structure. Basically the player finds himself in command of one of the characters (it is possible to switch between Asterix and Obelix at will by pressing the R2 key) and must face an avalanche of Roman soldiers, until he sees a mechanism to activate to proceed further. If at the beginning the switches are placed in plain sight and can be accessed easily, perhaps only by eliminating a certain number of opponents, later everything becomes more complex and you have to solve puzzles (never difficult, in reality) to reach certain areas. In this case the differences between the two characters are also exploited: Asterix can cross narrow spaces or board cabins that move on a circuit of ropes, while Obelix can get shot from a sort of cannon or destroy barriers thanks to his physical prowess. Among simple soldiers and commanders, it is possible to find a whole series of ~alternative~ Romans, parodies of the most famous video game characters. Violent punches The gameplay of Asterix & Obelix XXL 2 is split equally between exploration and combat. The clash with the enemies, in particular, sees you facing truly enormous quantities of soldiers, so much so that you will have to resort to special maneuvers to be right. One of them is to stun one of the opponents, then grab it and use it as a weapon against the others: spinning it, using it as a whip or throwing it. In some cases we will be suggested keystrokes that give life to devastating moves, for which you are also rewarded. Finally, when Asterix drinks the magic potion, it is possible to perform truly spectacular attack maneuvers, which can be unlocked as you progress through the game and can be activated via the usual key sequence. The clashes manage to always be engaging, above all thanks to the continuous arrival of different enemies; unfortunately, however, the management of the view rarely helps us: the further we go and the more enemies we face at the same time, so it happens that we do not see those in front of the character because the view remains stationary and it is not possible to center it with a single press. In addition to the ~classic~ Roman soldiers, the various commanders and parodies, we will also find ourselves fighting against huge bosses. These are generally similar enemies, which however move in different locations and which we will have to defeat precisely by exploiting the characteristics of the stage. Also on Picc! Asterix & Obelix XXL 2, just like the first chapter of the series, is also available for PC. The differences with the PS2 version are reduced to the technical aspect, however: those with a high-performance video card will be able to enjoy high resolution and a constant frame rate even in difficult situations. Given the small number of games of the genre for Windows platforms, the Atari title is even more welcome on PC... Technical realization Asterix & Obelix XXL 2: Mission Las Vegum boasts a high-level realization. All the characters, even the less important ones, have been drawn with great detail, boast excellent animations and are extremely faithful to the originals. The ideas for the realization of the parodies, then, are sometimes brilliant. A tremendous amount of work has been done in this respect; and the locations are absolutely no less, indeed they amaze for the vivacity of the colors, the quantity of polygons and the absolute lack of pop-up effects. All this splendor must have had a flaw, and in this case it's a matter of slowdowns when the situation gets very intricate (but very). The sound commentary manages not to disfigure in front of the graphic sector, withsome good quality music and a series of nice effects, also from the point of view of parodies (the ~mamma mia!~ of the Roman Mario when he is defeated, or the moan of a Ryu who falls to the ground in slow motion, or even the noise of Sonic rings). Ultimately, the tranges Libellules team did a job to be applauded. [C] The big belly in the background is; Larry Croft. And I said it all... This however is; the Roman version of Super Mario. Facing dozens of opponents is a real challenge. normal. [/C] Comment After a first chapter that did not shine from any point of view, Asterix & Obelix XXL 2: Missione Las Vegum presents itself as a solid product, which contributes significantly to raising the qualitative average of the videogame appearances of the two roosters and all their friends. Technically excellent, full of humorous ideas and gimmicks, the game even manages to transform a comic element (the parodies of the most famous video game characters) into its own strong point, as the list of enemies you will face is really wide and varied. Thoroughly recommended. Pros: Really well-made graphics Lots of enemies, of all types Lots of funny gimmicks Cons: Sometimes there are slowdowns Basically linear Some visual problems The clash between Gauls and Romans, given the manifest physical superiority of the former, moves to the level of espionage and deception. Otherwise, the betrayal of Panoramix, the druid who invented the magic potion that gives the Gauls superhuman power, cannot be explained: he gathers all his ~scientists~ colleagues with an excuse and has them captured by Cesare. The shrewd Sam Shieffer, an obvious parody of the protagonist of Splinter Cell, witnesses the scene and runs to warn Asterix and his friends, who rightly find it hard to believe Panoramix's gesture. Was it really him? To find out, and to save all the captured druids, the dynamic duo will have to travel to Las Vegum, a diabolical amusement park built by the Romans.", "date": "2005-10-29", "grade": null}
