We're obviously talking about Insomniac, which with Ratchet & Clank: A Spasso nel Tempo has packaged its fifth title, and is once again on time for the autumn appointment with PS3 users. Two years have passed since the first chapter and the formula hasn't changed, A Spasso nel Tempo is an adventure with strong action elements, but also with several platform parts and renewed puzzle sections, according to a scheme that innovates practically nothing, but which refines and improves all the previous aspects. The game can also be defined as a real sequel from the point of view of history, after that in the original title Clank had been ~kidnapped~ by the Zoni, tiny aliens invisible to most who, it will be discovered, have the task of administering temporal stability of the universe, and they have glimpsed in Clank the one who can perform this task. The continuation of the adventure is therefore all about temporal paradoxes, time management and the usual evil plan of the bad guy on duty, Dr. Nefarius, determined to exploit the ~Great Clock~ for his comfortable robotics. On the one hand we therefore have Ratchet, one of the few survivors of the Lombax race who is obviously looking for Clank, on the other the tiny robot, who finds himself catapulted into this world and burdened with responsibility. Past Present Future Just the sections with Clank, while remaining fewer in number, have undergone the greatest improvements compared to the simplistic ones of the previous chapter. Now they have in fact become the heart of the puzzle parts of the game, thanks to some puzzles that exploit the temporal component. Usually you arrive in large rooms which, to be overcome, need the simultaneous and continuous activation of several buttons, which is impossible for Clank alone. At this point it is possible to record two, three or four actions and then recall them simultaneously, in order to activate the door on duty. Obviously it's not all that easy, because maybe there are platform sections in between, or you have to record one action according to the other, so that your ~clones~ can reach elevated positions, use elevators and then reach the desired button . It goes without saying that as the adventure continues, the puzzles become more and more intricate, and therefore time must be spent thinking about how to deal with them, with great satisfaction after their resolution. Most of the game, however, features Ratchet and his Omni Wrench, capable of operating gears and hitting enemies. The key elements remain identical, with double jump delegated to the X, the square attack, the use of weapons, first person and lateral movement to the lats and so on, but once again Insomniac has done an excellent job on the weapons , gadgets and armor. As for the former, it ranges from missiles to animals that erupt a shock wave, passing through energy spheres, trigger bombs, rifles and the ever-present Mr Zurkon, a little robot who flanks Ratchet, seasoning his presence with jokes and small talk that often elicit a few smiles. Some of these weapons can be customized in various aspects, starting from the color and passing through some upgrades that are obtained during the game, and which vary the power itself, the type of trigger and that of the explosion. There is no shortage of gadgets, another trademark of the series, with the hover boots that allow you to move much faster and reach otherwise inaccessible places and the accumulator, an interesting addition that allows you to take advantage of water, oil and more to unlock gears or cool down, for example glowing platforms. Another novelty is represented by the sections on board the Aphelion spacecraft, much more interesting and integrated into the game perspective. Ratchet & Clank: A Spasso nel Tempo remains in fact a title where you travel from one world to another in search of clues and more, and in this case the passage is much more pleasant because on board your ship you fight (better) against other ships, explore the galaxy, take part in mini missions and above all it is possible to explore, in each sector, some small planets, in search of extras such as zones, which are used to upgrade one's ship, golden bolts, to Ratchet's costumes, and weapon upgrades, for a game duration of around 11-13 hours. Unfortunately, however, all that is not gold is notglitters, despite being improved and streamlined in almost all aspects, Insomniac's game has no particular points towards the top, which, let's be clear, is not a defect in the strict sense, but in any case it is somewhat noticeable in a ten-year saga that does not make innovation its strong point. More important, in our view, is the level of challenge, for most of the adventure really too low even for less savvy players. The advice is to play A Spasso nel Tempo immediately at the highest difficulty level, but even so, as happened in our case, you will not encounter any particular problems, but rather often the enemies represent a diversion for exploration and continuation real, even though the fights are the predominant part of the adventure. In the same vein, collectibles are also quite simple to obtain, albeit high in number, which, together with the absence of any multiplayer or at least additional mode, partially undermines replayability, guaranteed by a new level of difficulty and some tournaments inside the game. Playstation 3 trophies Ratchet & Clank: A Spasso nel Tempo offers 37 trophies, of which 4 are Gold and 6 are Silver. Some require the simple completion of the missions and the game, others instead the accumulation of 1 million bolts and all the Zones and Extra Golden Bolts, still others a certain score in the mini-games. Nothing too complicated to get, but you have to finish the adventure twice to achieve the coveted Platinum. To see and enjoy Weapons of Destruction, two years ago, was rightly considered one of the most beautiful titles from a graphic point of view ever to appear on PlayStation 3, obviously leaving out improbable comparisons made with Pixar films, probably made by people in the throes of hallucinogens. Ratchet & Clank: A Spasso nel Tempo maintains all the positive aspects of the original title and improves some of them, offering a great visual depth, colorful scenarios, good fluidity, a lot of mess on the screen and really excellent settings from an artistic point of view. In particular, some such as the Khroll Canyon rather than the sectors that can be seen on board the spacecraft are very beautiful to see, compared to those indoors which are less impressive. However, time passes and although Insomniac's graphics engine has been enhanced over the years, there is no longer that high impact that the first Ratchet returned, and in 2009 the lack of convincing lighting inside is felt of the game, as well as for the textures and its shaders, which ~enjoy~ too many ups and downs. The title is completely dubbed in Italian and in the main protagonists, between Ratchet, Qwark and company, it is pleasant and seasoned with various nice jokes, even in the new skits that introduce each new weapon. It gets worse in radio and backing vocals, with voice actors who seem to be the same as in Resistance 2 and not very expressive. The video review", "date": "2009-10-29", "grade": "8.7"}
