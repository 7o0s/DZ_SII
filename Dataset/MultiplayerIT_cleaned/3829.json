{"name": "God Eater 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/god-eater-3-recensione.html", "text": "God Eater 3 can count on a terribly fascinating setting, a post-apocalyptic scenario in which humanity has been decimated by the spread of the mysterious Oracle Cells, energy molecules that devour everything they encounter and take the form of huge, unstoppable beasts : the Aragami. Forced to take refuge within the walls of fortified cities, the survivors have found the only weapon capable of facing these monsters: the God Eaters, special warriors compatible with Oracle Cells who are linked to large high-tech weapons in the transformation process. the God Arcs. The latter are hybrid tools, capable of assuming three different configurations: the starting one, which can be a broadsword, twin blades, a war hammer or an axe; a firearm equipped with bullets and varied shooting modes; and finally the form of jaws, when energy cells come out of the device that bite enemies to inflict considerable damage or recover resources once we have defeated them. The first two episodes of the series basically told the development of these events and the progress of a war waged desperately by a few brave fighters, who often move aboard huge motorized caravans to find safe passages between a port and the other. other. In God Eater 3, however, the situation takes on even more disturbing contours, when the appearance of poisonous ashen clouds and new and more powerful Aragami pushes the human race to find a further solution, namely the Adaptable God Eaters, or GEA, capable of to resist the ash and therefore to take charge of the most risky battles. The problem is that over the years these warriors have assumed the status of real slaves, even very young children caught among the poorest classes and forced to fight for life, or to sacrifice themselves if necessary. The protagonists of the game are part of just such a group, they live in a prison and only see the light of day when they are sent on a mission to face Aragami, but luckily things change when they come across the busty Hilda Henriquez, owner of a Caravana and a safe haven, Chrysantemum: the woman proves to be a faithful ally and allows the GEA from Pennyworth to work for her, assuming the burden of the very high penalty for their release. The load that Hilda is carrying is in fact very particular and she needs someone who is able to defend the shipment from the terrible Cinerei Aragami. But what is so important about the ship? In short, the plot of God Eater 3 starts from very solid foundations, but soon turns to a series of stereotyped solutions, also and above all as regards the characters: it remains enjoyable for those who appreciate this type of narration, but in reality it is just one of the many dated aspects of Bandai Namco production. The same protagonist, which we can create using a simple editor at the beginning of the adventure, has the usual problem of being silent, and this element takes on frankly absurd connotations during the dialogues, which are resolved with a nod of the head where it would have been enough to engrave at least some ~yes~ and ~no~ to limit the problem. In short, identification seems to have been an absolute priority for the developers, but with a faceless and voiceless protagonist, involvement is inevitably lost, wasting ideas and situations that with a different representation perhaps would have been more effective. Gameplay and structure The problem of the protagonist recalls the continuity for the God Eater franchise, but it is not the only limitation of this new chapter. The philosophy that moved the authors was to change the cards with respect to the second episode, evidently considered by many to be too slow and more cumbersome than usual, and therefore to introduce mechanics capable of speeding up the action, smoothing out the edges of a experience that too often became frustrating, especially when the Aragami could move with agility and our character couldn't even reach them to hit them. The novelties of the gameplay must be seen in this light; in the first place the charged attack, which allows you to project quickly towards the target after hooking it, shortening the distances in an instant to score some hits or to prevent the monster on duty from fleeing and going to one of the sources present at the inside the scenarios, which allow you to recharge your vital energy. There are several unpublished maneuvers, but from the point of view of immediacy, the ~bite~ on the fly certainly stands out, which transforms the God Arc into jaws much more quickly and makes pobsolete and useless the procedure, still long and tedious, necessary for the transformation. In short, by choosing a balanced weapon, both for the blade and for the rifle shape, it is possible to be very effective on the battlefield, completing even the most complex battles in a matter of minutes. Is there a problem with the difficulty level? Well, during our experience, completing the campaign within twenty hours (but without completing all the secondary missions, indeed leaving out quite a few), we happened to run into game over only once. This certainly means that the new approach makes the game easier and the necessary adjustments have not been made to avoid this phenomenon, but it is also true that the teammates controlled by artificial intelligence, suitably enhanced, represent allies powerful, who not only know how to inflict enormous damage on enemies but promptly take care of putting us back on track when we are down. In short, our feeling is that the action survival genre goes close to the new vision of God Eater, but at the same time it is not explained why the authors did not want to dare even more, revolutionizing a frankly cumbersome and not very customizable control system, born with the original controls for PSP in mind, and allowing for faster management of the God Arc, perhaps with the possibility of transforming it into a rifle by simply pressing the left trigger and then opening fire with the right, thus making the ranged attack very less woody and slow to use. However, the problem lies upstream: the formula of God Eater 3 is dated, and it is even more so since Capcom has renewed the genre with Monster Hunter: World. Instead of looking ahead, the developers have done the opposite, thinking of returning to the mechanics of the first God Eater rather than trying to bring the franchise into 2019. We realize that Bandai Namco is already carrying out such an operation with Code Vein, but throwing such a suggestive and interesting lore to the winds by publishing a distinctly old-gen title, and moreover proposing it at full price, does not seem to us a far-sighted choice, on the contrary. In addition to the gameplay, there is in fact an evident structural problem: the approximately one hundred missions available, between main and secondary, all take place in the same six or seven scenarios: fairly large but terribly generic settings, devoid of any interactive element and almost always entirely unrelated to the narrative, i.e. from what the characters should find once they leave the Caravan. The battles are resolved quickly, and so the whole system takes on the connotations of a not too clever expedient to artificially increase the duration of the game, however forcing us to always do the same things and always face the same enemies. Some Aragami have been added, it is true, and the roster of monsters is therefore quite rich and guessed, but the reasoning remains valid. Co-op missions and assaults God Eater 3 includes a cooperative multiplayer mode that comes in two different forms. On the one hand the standard cooperative, available for four participants, which can be accessed via the terminals present in the base and is organized with simple rooms. On the other side of the special assignments, the assaults, in which up to eight players work together to take out a very powerful Aragami within a limited time, taking home rich prizes if successful. We were able to try both options, encountering some small latency problems perhaps due to the country of origin of the other users. Playstation 4 trophies God Eater 3 allows you to obtain a total of 32 Trophies, unlockable on the one hand by completing the actions necessary to complete the campaign missions, therefore defeating every single Aragami that we will face; on the other hand, by carrying out more particular operations, which perhaps revolve around the cooperative mode, special missions and the crafting system. Graphics and sound The dated nature of God Eater 3 inevitably extends to the technical sector as well, and unfortunately this represents a negative surprise. The series was in fact born as a cross-platform product for PSP and PlayStation Vita, therefore castrated at the origin, and the second episode has landed on current generation platforms only in the form of a remaster. In short, we expected from this third chapter, the first designed specifically for PlayStation 4 and PC, a substantially better visual rendering, and instead we were faced with very generic graphic solutions, to highlight a low production value. The Aragami are probably the coolest thing about the gameo has to show, along with a couple of cutscenes made by an animation studio with counterflakes, but otherwise we're just not there: the characters are only slightly improved, they still have static hair and fabrics, and their appearance appears extremely stereotypical , with a fanservice (see Hilda's giant bowls) that often seemed out of place. The most significant scene is when the team reaches the Chrystantemum landing, which should be a splendid place and instead shows itself as the old-gen graphics fair. A completely similar argument can be made for the scenarios, which as mentioned are too few for the number of missions and appear generic, devoid of personality. On PS4 Pro it is possible to select two different modes, 4K and 1080p, but who knows what differences are not noticed, apart from perhaps a slightly greater fluidity in the second case. We played by selecting the dialogues in Japanese with Italian subtitles, noting some nice tricks by our local translators (~Do you take it, ma'am?~) and appreciating some music from the soundtrack, which however repeats itself to exhaustion in the phases between a mission and the other, when you go around the base in order to carry out the interactions required for the progression of the story. Some of the effects felt downright ugly to us.", "date": "2019-02-06", "grade": "6.0"}
