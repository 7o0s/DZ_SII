Just think of the numerous episodes dedicated to the topic by popular science broadcasts and also of the famous animated series, ~Exploring the Human Body~, which still today has the ability to make us imagine the immune system as a complete army equipped with anthropomorphic infantry and aeronautics . However, when a strange creature that clings to the tissues using 4 extendable arms, all equipped with sharp pincers, makes its way through its cells, the situation becomes a little more thorny; therefore, having abandoned all scientific ambitions, in Tentacles: Enter the Dolphin it's up to us to find the right path to get to the inevitable (and certainly not recommended) exit, taking care of the safety of both the guest and the unwanted, despite him, parasite. If the dolphin becomes a scientist Born as a Windows Phone exclusive, Tentacles: Enter the Dolphin represents the second ~installment~ of Microsoft on the App Store, after the controversial Kinectimals. In reality, this shouldn't be surprising, because Apple's online store is nothing more than a distribution channel, which is particularly rich, and expanding its user base is certainly tempting even for a rival company like that of Redmond. The narrative plot, so to speak, sees the scientist dr. Phluff, a particularly intelligent dolphin considering the context, engaged in his study to conduct some experiments with Lemmy, a single-celled being equipped, as previously anticipated, with 4 sharp arms. These retractable limbs, with which it attaches to any type of protruding surface, act simultaneously as tools for recovering ~food~, i.e. eyeballs, but also as the only means of locomotion. Following a clumsy accident, Lemmy ends up from the microscope slide to Phluff's belly (but not only!); however, interest in science has the upper hand at this point and the ~finned~ scientist, instead of acting according to common sense, perhaps with a strong laxative, prefers to study the behavior of the strange creature, also using electromagnetic diagnostic equipment such as CT or X-rays. Lemmy is therefore forced to survive lowered inside a dangerous human-like organism (the dolphin in fact has human features), so much so that the pitfalls are present practically at every corner. In fact, after the first learning levels, you will immediately find yourself faced with rather tangled situations, due to the numerous environmental obstacles that will force the player to make rapid and precise movements to avoid the worst. Fortunately, the control system that regulates the advance (and also the nourishment) is really very intuitive, with a simple tap, in fact, Lemmy's hooked arms immediately attach to the chosen place and, since there are 4 of them, alternating a superior surface with a lower one it is possible to imagine an almost straight path, especially in areas where precision is essential. Even for feeding, the speech remains the same: a tap on the selected victim and the eyeballs present will be transformed into food and extra points. However, there was talk before of traps and environmental obstacles; with a contextualization work that is sometimes brilliant but, fortunately, not too photorealistic, all the internal organs are visually recalled and easily recognizable. Here, for example, the intestine, always in motion, can turn into a deadly grip, but there will be obstacles made of bone or cartilage, as well as ~explosives~, all positioned in order not so much to prevent the crossing, which in any case is carried easily completed, as well as the success of the various challenges proposed. To increase the score and at the same time give a little liveliness to the journey, Tentacles: Enter the Dolphin in fact offers at each level the opportunity to face tests of special skills, which are worth one evaluation star out of the three available; these include finishing the level within a certain time or not taking the slightest damage during the escape. The boss battles are also fun, always with an ~eye~ theme, so to speak, and the background music, cheerful and pleasant. A few words must be spent in favor of the technical sector, really of the highest level, with accurate 3D graphics but above all a fantastic level design, beautifully rendered by the excellent environmental textures that simulate the different parts of the body from time to time.", "date": "2012-10-25", "grade": "8.8"}
