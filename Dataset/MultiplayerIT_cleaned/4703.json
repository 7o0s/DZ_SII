{"name": "Crociera di sangue in Resident Evil: Revelations", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/187971-resident-evil-revelations-crociera-di-sangue.html", "text": "After seeing the light on the Nintendo 3DS in 2012, where it achieved great critical and public success, and subsequently finding space in a good edition for PC and older generation consoles, Resident Evil: Revelations is back in a ~new~ version remastered, this time on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. In reality, as we will see, apart from some graphic tweaks, a handful of unreleased trophies and additional content that in the past had been made available as DLC, the product has nothing ~new~ and remains essentially the same as the original. Either way, the game tells of the disappearance of Chris Redfield and his partner Jessica Sherawat during an investigation aboard a luxury cruise ship, the Queen Zenobia. To find out what happened and what happened to her historical ~companion~, Jill Valentine and her colleague Parker Luciani take action: once on the ship they discover that it is infested by the aberrations generated by the T-Abyss, a marine strain of the T- virus, and a nightmare begins for them that will lead them to fight for their lives. The Cursed Ship For those few who don't know it, Resident Evil: Revelations is the classic survival horror with a third person view, with the camera positioned over the shoulders of the protagonist, and with a gameplay that repeats for a good part of the adventure, told with a television-style episodic structure, mechanics that at the time marked a partial return to origins. So expect a generally staid pace of the game, apart from some more dynamic phases focused on some shooting, some backtracking, a handful of simple puzzles, a pinch of fan service and a general atmosphere created specifically to generate some tension in the gamer. In this sense, Capcom has made good use of all the elements that the main scenario, that of the ship, offered him from all points of view, both graphic and audio. The long, gloomy corridors of Queen Zenobia lend themselves perfectly to claustrophobic and no-escape situations, as well as to generate tension since anything can be hidden around every corner. In the same way, the water dripping from a leaking pipe, the echo of one's footsteps, the creaking of the ship's metal structure that seems to writhe, are all sound elements that make the atmosphere more engaging, helping the gamer to immerse himself further into the narrative context of the story. Playstation 4 trophies There are 56 Trophies available in Resident Evil: Revelations. These are distributed within both the main campaign and the Raid mode, and divided into 47 Bronze, 5 Silver, 3 Gold and 1 Platinum. As always, the ways to obtain them are different: ranging from killing a Scarmiglione without eliminating the body parts separately, up to passing all the levels in Raid mode in ABYSS difficulty with an S rating or completing the normal adventure in INFERNO difficulty for those more prestigious. Creatures of the abyss In the exploratory phases, the role of the Genesis plays a certain importance, a kind of scanner with which it is possible to examine the settings, the corpses of the victims and the enemies to obtain objects of various kinds or useful information, even if this feature in our opinion is not fully exploited properly and here is limited to homework. As for the combat system, it can easily be described as ~traditional~ with a touch of modern. The commands are in fact inspired by those of Resident Evil 4, with all the strengths and weaknesses of the case, especially in certain ~rigid~ movements when the character is aiming at an enemy. Fortunately, as happened in the first Resident Evil, there is almost never the risk of being outnumbered by enemies, and therefore apart from the consumption of a few more bullets than necessary, this aspect is not very annoying. Among other things, thanks also to the usual paraphernalia available to the user, which can be upgraded through the use of special slots and components which, however, must be used sparingly, since there are not many of them, there is rarely a risk of being killed. At least with the Ooze, the ~cheesy~ monsters that replace zombies and that don't have a particularly advanced artificial intelligence, while some serious danger can initially be run against some ~being~ that requires the elimination of some part of the body before coup de grace, or with the bosses. In any case, during the adventure, the gamer meets other types of enemies, some of which are taken from the other chapters of the saga. In terms of content, this remastered edition of Resident Evil: Revelations offers the same secondary modes as the original, csuch as the missions, or objectives to be met to obtain bonuses of various kinds, and the Raid mode, which can be tackled in single or local or online multiplayer. The novelty consists only in the fact that it contains new levels, weapons and characters (Rachel Ooze, Lady Hunk, etc) which were previously contained in special paid extra DLCs. The mode consists of facing levels infested with a certain amount of enemies, which you have to kill until you reach the exit. At the end of each stage, in addition to developing your character, depending on various factors, you can earn weapons and points to spend in a special shop. As often happens when it comes to remastered editions, to find some real ~novelty~, sometimes even minimal to tell the truth, you need to focus your attention on the technological sector. In this sense, Capcom has done a decent job, keeping in mind the starting point. Compared to the previous edition, for example, the title offers slightly more refined graphics thanks to the presence of new textures that cover the clothes of the main characters, and a handful of others inserted in some key points of the scenarios. From this point of view, an improved lighting system certainly helps, with the beautiful plays of light and shadow, to enhance the new integrated graphic elements and sometimes to mask the preponderant presence of the old and flat textures of the original product. In any case, with 1080p the image is more defined and clean, with a deeper field of vision, and 60fps offer greater fluidity. Too bad that all this is counterbalanced by the poor quality of the ~skin~ of the human protagonists, somewhat dull, and their animations, which have remained the slightly woody ones of the old Revelations. As for the sound sector, however, nothing to complain. The music, the background effects, the moans of the creatures, everything works properly and contributes to rendering well, as previously written, the lugubrious and terrifying atmosphere that one breathes while exploring the various locations. To complete the picture there is also a good dubbing in Italian, which never hurts.", "date": "2017-09-01", "grade": "7.0"}
