Everything in the game communicates tension and unease; starting with the extraordinary sound design, made up of perfectly themed music and sounds that underline the uncertainty of moving within a place besieged by pathetic zombies and infernal creatures of various kinds, from insect summoners to huge monsters built with pieces of corpses, from fiery devils to undead hounds, which can inflict huge damage on us and which must be fought using melee or firearms, the latter often equipped with extremely small magazines and biblical reload times. Gameplay and modes The Hunt: Showdown experience is purely multiplayer, with up to twelve players moving around one of the two large maps, facing the mission alone, each on their own, or divided into teams of two or three components. main mode, Bounty Hunter, involves exploring the scenario in search of clues to find and eliminate a boss on which hangs a rich bounty (there are three: a huge butcher, a giant spider and an elusive assassin), but it is It is also possible to try your hand at a quick game with more linear features, although inevitably less interesting. Using a special vision, which can be recalled at any time, blue traces can be identified in the dark: clues that must be located and activated to get closer to the monster's position. Once three traces have been obtained, it is possible to find out where the target is, eliminate him, perform a long purification rite on his remains, collect them and go to one of the vanishing points located at the ends of the scenario to collect the bounty. There is only one problem: our opponents will not stand by and watch, on the contrary they could wait for us to do the dirty work for them, cold us and steal the resources that we had laboriously obtained. However, we could suffer a further setback: an initial phase has been overcome ~ assisted~, which leads us to a certain level of experience, at each game over we will forever lose the character we are using and its objects. We will therefore have to start over with another gunslinger, fortunately without canceling the general progression linked to the profile, that is, the one that allows you to unlock new weapons, equipment and skills to be assigned. Strategy and peculiarities The particular strategic approach to the action, an often reduced time-to-kill (a well-aimed rifle shot is enough to eliminate a hunter) and the ruthless survival interpretation of Hunt: Showdown, with the element of permanent death, draw the picture of an experience certainly different from the usual, extremely tense. The world outlined by Crytek is really distressing at first and only after a few games is it possible to analyze its structure with a minimum of objectivity, without panicking at every stroke gun fired nearby (indicating that there is some potential opponent ready to kill us), at every loose chain or at every trampled glass. Inside the buildings it is possible to find ammunition or improvised weapons, such as an oil lamp that can be thrown on the enemy, or traps to be placed behind a door to surprise a hunter who has spotted us and wants to come and track us down. Gunplay is another of the peculiar aspects of Hunt: Showdown. As already mentioned, most weapons require long reload times and shooting accuracy therefore becomes fundamental, also and above all because the hitboxes are ruthless and do not allow approximations, thus plausibly representing the pistols and rifles of the late 1800s. However, the shortage of ammunition can push you to give up many times, trying to stay away from zombies and creatures of other kinds, fleeing in case of danger. The management of vital energy, organized into three watertight compartmentalized indicators that can be restored using a medical kit but which are sometimes blocked by particular wounds, whether it be burns or poisoning, closes the circle of a very reasoned gameplay, also made up of risk calculation: where a situation should appear too complicated to us, we will be able to decide to settle for that that we have collected and reach as fast as possible an escape point for usget free from the game and take home something. Playstation 4 trophies The Hunt: Showdown Trophies are practically all linked to progression, therefore they are unlocked when we successfully complete the first missions, level up, obtain new objects and carry out a certain number of specific actions, whether it is to complete match or eliminate enemies. Technical realization We are used to imagining Crytek productions technically focused on the PC version, and Hunt: Showdown is no exception. While boasting a higher resolution on PS4 Pro, in fact, the game does not go beyond 30 frames per second and this creates a significant gap compared to what is possible to see precisely on the Windows platform, provided of course that you have top-level components. The lower fluidity, combined with the ruthless hitboxes mentioned above, often creates frustrating situations, in which maybe we have an enemy running towards us but we can't hit him and we have to helplessly suffer his attacks while we are about to reload the weapon. There is a general feeling of fatigue of the graphics engine that is noticeable not only by the pop-up effect on various assets as we explore the map, but also by the simple interaction with objects, which shows a minimal but annoying latency. Also and above all the fault of the advanced effects that the developers wanted to keep, see for example the screen space reflection on the water and a sophisticated lighting system, undoubtedly able to contribute substantially to the excellent atmospheres of the game. In this regard, the design of the settings appears convincing and functional to the action, as well as that of the creatures. The interface, on the other hand, needed to be rethought, being too focused on the use of the mouse, while the loads are a little too long. We also found ourselves faced with several quite serious glitches. Beyond some bad crashes that the game brings with it from the PC version, inexplicably, and which can result in the frustrating loss of the character, it often happens that enemies get stuck in front of invisible obstacles. On several occasions we were able to shoot very calmly at tanks that were unable to pass a bush, and therefore stopped their charge by flying, and in the same way we saw one of the bosses unable to leave the building he was in, with his therefore the possibility of killing him by remaining quietly on the threshold and pelting him with blows.", "date": "2020-02-22", "grade": "7.8"}
