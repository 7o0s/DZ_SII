In some cases even, see Juventus, the season officially started a few days ago with commitments in the Europa League preliminaries, while in Japan the various national tournaments are in full swing. Precisely to the Japanese A and B series championships, that is the J-League divisions 1 and 2, Konami dedicates a new chapter of its now over ten-year football saga, entitled J-League Winning Eleven 2010 Club Championship. Winning Eleven is a series that has always been able to offer particularly excellent games on PlayStation 2 up to now, renewing itself from year to year, often from month to month when the editions called Evolution were released, without losing sight of the good previously built but rather using precisely the positive aspects developed up to then as a basis for subsequent works. Especially at the simulation level and in the chapters dedicated to the Japanese club football league. Like what we are going to analyze. J-League Winning Eleven 2010 Club Championship offers the gamer a list of 155 teams from which to select the favorite one. There are 37 Japanese clubs fully licensed and with their own personal stadium, 118 international ones, some of which, however, do not have official permits and consequently have non-real shirts and logos. The Japanese league In particular, we have coverage for the Dutch championship, the French one, the local Serie A (which however lacks the logo and name of the competition) and the Spanish Liga, where only 12 teams can boast original shirts and crests. In addition of course to those of the Japanese tournaments and clubs from the rest of the world. All rosters are updated to approximately May of this year. From the main screen characterized by a sober and functional style menu, you can access the various game modes, which are the classic ones and which for this reason we are not going to re-list you. If anything, we limit ourselves to pointing out the unprecedented option that allows you to challenge each other in a friendly match in the Yamazaki Nabisco Cup or in the Emperor's cup. Once you have chosen your team and taken the field, the game offers its best. Immediately after the kick-off, in fact, for the user already accustomed to the series, everything appears natural since he immediately finds his usual feeling with the controls and with the construction of the game, thanks also to a player control system that is rather immediate and which has not undergone substantial changes except for some filings aimed at improving it, such as a greater ~heaviness~ of the ball. Taking advantage of the aforementioned system, the player can immediately build his own offensive or defensive actions without too many problems, helped in this both by the good system that manages the passes (touches from the winger, forward, inside, plate), and by the excellent artificial intelligence that it allows the various teams, whether they are fully controlled by the CPU or partially (that is, when the human gamer manages a single athlete), to move and act in a very credible way. Obviously depending on the schemes adopted, the characteristics of the players and the situations that arise at that precise moment. In the first case, as already in the previous chapter, depending on the amount of time used to press the button, the power with which the pass is made varies in intensity (the same goes for shots), while in the second case the CPU builds actions logical, with credible overlaps on the wings or diagonals forward as well as in defense with the central players who squeeze better, the midfielders who take turns filtering, etc. To try and jump the man, there's nothing better than a good feint, always bearing in mind the fact that in addition to being more functional and natural than in the past, they increase in effectiveness depending on the player being controlled and his technical qualities . Playing in the J-League If the playability is therefore confirmed on the usual high levels to which the saga has accustomed us for years, the same can also be said of the section dedicated to the Japanese championship, which has undergone few significant changes except for the new mode called J-player , which is none other than the old Playmaker applied within a season in the J-League. With this option the user can impersonate any player on the roster of the two Japanese leagues A and B, with the exception offor goalkeepers. Otherwise, as has been the case for a couple of editions now, he can simply start the full season in this competition by choosing the whole team to control to try to lead it to the final victory. As far as the technical aspect of the game is concerned, even in this edition it is the graphics that emerge, which for some time now have become another of the strengths of the series also on PlayStation 2. Let's be clear, we are not seeing any striking changes compared to what we saw in the recent past, and it could not be otherwise given the hardware that has now marked time. However, as per tradition, the goodies and touches of class are there, sometimes imperceptible at first glance but such as to satisfy the eye of the most demanding gamer. The unmistakable Fifa TV style now borrowed by the Asian software house to offer users a total visual experience to say the least is evident in the care with which the stadiums, turf and footballers have been built, increasingly similar to their respective real counterparts even in the movements. The audio is of good quality with music that accompanies the user as he navigates through the game's menus and performs their task well. Like the personalized chants for each club, especially the Japanese ones, which are absolutely atmospheric thanks to an audience that follows more or less directly the actions that take place on the pitch, booing their opponents or praising their favorites. Even if this attitude of the fans has no influence on the behavior of referees and players, it is also true that it is undoubtedly a pleasant presence that offers something more to the general realistic aspect. Final note on Jon Kabira's always splendid commentary: it is not clear what he says, but he is engaging and funny as ever.", "date": "2010-08-04", "grade": "8.8"}
