The game, for its part, does everything to make this bizarre mix as natural as possible and succeeds thanks to an intuitive and immediately fun gameplay as befits a pinball machine, but also structured and progressive as required of a derivative of the game. RPG, which mixes tower defense elements with roguelike-like mechanics. Don't be deceived by the strange medieval pseudo-fantasy setting: here it is above all about fighting against hordes of zombies and to do this we have to use a powerful mechanism that looks like a ballista, but which in fact works like a pinball machine. This opens the door to a very brilliant reinterpretation of the typical game tables of this type of arcade machine, transforming them into a real battlefield against the zombie invasion: at the bottom is the ball-launching catapult, as well as a stronghold to be protected against the advance of the enemies, while in front of these two movable palisades they precisely play the role of the typical flippers of the pinball machine, whose movement towards the sphere thrown at the enemies has the logical effects that one would normally expect in such a case. The result is precisely a pinball machine, but which is also a tower defense, exactly as the strange hybrid concept wants to suggest right from the premises. In short, the idea is quite daring but its realization is perfect, at least from the point of view of the game structure, to which is also added a movement on the map with some tactical and role-playing elements and a progression of the character from level to level, except the restarts required by the rogue-lite style mechanics, with some rewards that however remain between one game and another. Between pinball and tower defense In the thick of the action, Zombie Rollerz: Pinball Heroes is essentially a pinball machine: you launch the ball with the catapult (ballista or whatever) placed at the bottom center of the screen and you try to relaunch it every time it falls down using the two palisades / paddles positioned on the sides, trying not to drop it in the center on pain of losing a life, exactly as you would expect from a normal pinball machine. What is different, but only up to a certain point, is what happens on the battlefield/pinball table, since instead of more or less static elements we are dealing with hordes of zombies advancing from top to bottom low trying to destroy our defenses. We must then try to relaunch the sphere not only to try to collect as many bonuses and points as possible, hitting elements of the scenario and opening special chests, but above all to eliminate the zombies, hitting them directly with a well-aimed throw or enjoying the effects of the typical pinball machine in the middle of a horde. It may seem strange but this bizarre expedient adds a nice dose of satisfaction in seeing the ball bouncing madly among a thousand buffers, boxes and obstacles, decimating the hordes of zombies that advance inexorably, even if to tell the truth, the behavior of the ball is often a bit dubious, evidently not based on a wholly convincing physical simulation. In any case, this particular mechanic opens the door to a real ~level design~, proposing tables with different roads, branches, secret passages and secondary objectives to be hit to maximize the rewards. On the sidelines of the basic gameplay, Zombie Rollerz: Pinball Heroes also features some strategic RPG-style elements: moving between levels takes place within a hexagonal map in which we can choose the path to take and the places to visit, also evaluating threats and dangers along the way. Crossing the boxes it is in fact possible to encounter unexpected events that can be faced in different ways with different consequences, while the progression of the character is ensured by the unlocking of some active or passive bonuses that can be used to enhance the sphere or change its behavior in the game. The graphic style adopted is quite simple, almost crude in some respects, with a sort of cartoonish look created through the use of a sort of cel-shading with very clear outlines and caricatured figures, but it manages very well to characterize a bizarre world like that put in scena in this game.", "date": "2020-12-09", "grade": "7.6"}
