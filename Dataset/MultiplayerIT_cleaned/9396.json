A long-awaited sequel, talked about, criticized and finally, so as not to miss anything, even a leaked game that the vast majority of those who have been waiting for many months have not even played. In theory it should be easy to do better than a 2007 release: four years is an abyss and in the meantime Crytek has grown in size and ambition, yet the cross-platform nature of a much larger project in terms of names involved, marketing and resources complicates not a little matter. Users of three different platforms demand, indeed demand, technological primacy because nothing else would ever be accepted as a success. At the same time, the need to keep one's name high, as well as the desire to raise the bar from a narrative point of view, have imposed a major change in the approach chosen for the design of the levels. And finally, so as not to miss anything, a multiplayer sector had to be set up that can keep up with the other giants of the genre; stuff that four years ago it was enough to insert a few maps and a handful of modes and instead today nobody considers you if you don't have a good metagame, growth systems, classes and that's just to start with. Forced by coat of arms and heritage to focus on certain aspects of the experience, unable by the greater breadth of the project to do so by sticking to the original plan, the German developer had no choice but to try to reinvent his most famous creation. The other jungle As is now very well known, Crysis 2 is set in the city of New York in 2023, following in some way the events, which took place three years earlier, told in the original and in Warhead, although it distances itself sufficiently from these to be entirely enjoyable by anyone who has no familiarity with the series. Without going into the details of the plot, the themes of alien infestation, conspiracy and the ~greater good~ return again this time to animate the events which, it should be said immediately, are not as exciting as they were in the past. Of course, there are several events and some unsolved puzzles are solved, just as someone will be pleased to receive answers on the fate of certain characters, but considering the involvement of the writer Richard Morgan and the latter's words on the inadequacy of plots of modern shooters, it's funny to note how Crysis 2 fits in exactly the same groove. Even qualitatively. Not bad, however, because if science fiction isn't worthy of a Hugo award, the creation of the city will make up for the lack: having abandoned the tropical atmosphere that has characterized Crytek's work since Far Cry, New York itself is transformed into a jungle ; only of concrete, glass and steel. It loses its status as a multicultural temple of modern civilization to be devastated by the alien attack - but not only - in progress. The artistic work is very good, excellent considering that instead it was in the past one of the weakest aspects of the Teutonic developer, and the glimpses chosen for the levels are all very famous even to those who have never set foot in the shadow of the Statue of Liberty. who will be perfectly able to recognize the degree of devastation. It is impossible not to acknowledge the courage to choose only well-known settings and have to support the comparison, rather than inventing locations from scratch that should only seem plausible, as usually happens. From an imaginative point of view, we pass from environments that need no introduction, such as Central Station, Time Square or Central Park, to relatively lesser-known environments, such as Roosevelt Island, from which, however, you can enjoy the protagonist horizon of a thousand postcards, or famous not as independent commercials but as more complex entities, such as the subway. The effort made to recreate the city while giving it a specific dimension, peculiar to Crysis 2, is put at the service of a campaign which, as the first big plus point, can have a longevity well above the average: the writer he spent a good eight hours completing it but it was a pretty quick traverse, with at least a handful of other clockwork that could well be employed by those wishing to take more thoughtful approaches. Among other things, in this case the open level design justifies a speech of increasing longevity as the selected challenge level increases, because the scenarios can be crossed in a more or less shrewd way and consequently it is worth experimenting with different strategies. The typical level has a direct path, the one that declares its presence to enemiesleading to the most classic of clashes, and a couple of alternatives that are usually a shortcut to use to shorten the track by hiding from enemy sight, and then a strategically favorable position, raised or with a fixed position from which to fire. However, there are several exceptions with more linear areas, with a more marked scripting, moments in which to defend the position from the enemy attack and other variants that give a good amount of different situations, conceding as inevitable the flank to moments of slight decline compared to others but always maintaining good quality standards. Even the emphasis given to the vertical component to compensate for the smaller horizontal extension was implemented in such a way as to properly reconcile with the need to stick to the New York aesthetic. Nanosuit and other lethal toys The double threat fought, human and alien, and above all the usual condition of numerical inferiority, must be faced by exploiting a paraphernalia involving the Nanosuit, here in version 2.0. The latter returns revised and corrected compared to how it was in Crysis and Warhead: while the armor enhancement and invisibility are still activated through a special selection, the speed is directly linked to the use of the sprint key and the boosted jump can be used by holding down the button used to perform a normal jump. Similarly, the charged melee shot, applied to an enemy or to some elements such as the cars scattered on the streets, must be performed by prolonging the execution of a melee attack. The result is less articulated in terms of the number of interactions - and therefore more suitable also for the use of the pad - but this simplification is compensated by a freer use of the energy available for the powers, given that they can now be combined together in extensively, however limited in time. If infrared vision is linked to the use of the energy charge available, it was instead chosen to exclude from the Nanosuit's set of ~paid~ powers the augmented reality to which the protagonist has access at any time: when activated it does not allow to shoot or interact with the environment except by jumping, however sensitive strategic points and supplies are indicated on the screen. In short, there are several gadgets to dabble with and the points collected by killing the menacing Ceph aliens, especially in the second part of the campaign, are spent on unlocking new active or passive skills. These are divided into four categories and range from increased silence to the ability to detect enemies equipped with optical camouflage, from the availability of an area blast to execute while landing from a jump to a tracking system for enemy hits and so on . In short, in Crysis 2 as in its two predecessors, we see the commitment to wanting to give the player a good variety of different choices to enjoy, which also extends to the customization of weapons which in any case does not represent anything ever seen nor in quantitative terms or for types of upgrades. For many offensive tools, it is right to imagine an equally worthy quantity of targets on which to let off steam and in fact the choice is not lacking. Apart from some exceptional encounters such as a spaceship fought once or a gigantic mech encountered three others, two on foot and one on board a vehicle, the remaining variety of opponents refers to humans, belonging to the CELL paramilitary group, and then to the already Ceph humanoid aliens mentioned. The former are armed differently depending on the situation while the others have not only different attacks, from distance or melee, but refer to different types, with for example an armored version that closely resembles the Halo Hunter . All the variables mentioned so far distance Crysis 2 from the standard of the ~Call of Duty~ shooter and the less intensive use of scripting is in itself, as previously mentioned, an aspect that makes the gameplay more interesting. It is a pity therefore that the biggest defect found in the single player of the game is also the natural extension of this reasoning: artificial intelligence should in fact be one of the most advanced aspects from a technological point of view to meet the freedom of movement and use powers, unfortunately this is not the case and demonstrates shortcomings. From the middle distance, when the firefight is open, the enemies behave in an almost acceptable way and the Cephs, who have decided to attack up close, also have a credible gait. But as soon as you start to exaggerate with the imagination in the use of invisibility or when you use the sniper rifle to keep a lot of distance between yourself and others, then they are highlightedseveral flaws. For those who thought that Crysis held a technological record with its unbeaten graphics since 2007, just think that the artificial intelligence of F.E.A.R., year 2005, is still being pursued. Comparison of consoles On the sidelines of the test along the entire campaign which took place on PC, we were able to spend a couple of hours dividing ourselves between the two console incarnations, where we played a handful of levels each. Also in this case, as mentioned for the Windows PC version, it was specified that these were not definitive copies, therefore subject to possible modifications. The two versions felt comparable to the lowest of the levels of customization available on PC, Gamer, but as this may sound, this didn't translate into a different kind of break than expected. Certain elements, such as lighting, are less evolved on consoles and the same goes for details related to less rich vegetation angles, especially with some missing grass points, or the presence of a little aliasing. The fluidity is also lower which, however, apart from some drops, has clearly improved compared to the first meetings. Overall Crysis 2 on console is excellent to look at and retains all the positive aspects that make it a joy to watch on PC too. In all of this, the Xbox 360 version seemed to have more convincing colors than the PlayStation 3 version, which also showed some clipping. However, we did not find the same performance abyss visible in the multiplayer demo which, waiting to verify the copies on sale, was subject to a downgrade that we did not detect in those proportions in the single player campaign. Mission Impossible Visually Crysis 2 had the impossible task of repeating what its predecessor was in 2007, an exceptional graphics benchmark but for a long time unusable at its maximum performance in a fluid way, even on the highest-end machines. And in fact the direction taken was different. To see, in the PC version tested, the title is spectacular and the visual component is certainly worth the price of admission, thanks to the use made of CryEngine 3 to model New York in a convincing way. Certain elements, for example the use made of HDR or effects such as lens flare, take the image away from the cleanliness of Crysis and in general the smaller spaces combined with a lower visual distance, can leave you disappointed because not only do they not evolve seen in the past, but they seem to make him take a step back. In reality, the compromises, predictable from the outset, were well balanced by an artistic direction which this time had to commit itself to making the streets of a city credible rather than the green patches of the jungle, managing to balance the spectacular nature of the second part of the two first episodes - the beautiful glaciation as protagonist - with increasingly destroyed environments, flooded, devastated passages and an unexpected - panoramic, we would say - version of Central Park at the end. From an interaction point of view, there remains the possibility of destroying plants with the slenderest trunks and certain concrete roofs, with even the columns and walls that lose pieces in their outermost part when hit by projectiles, even if the absence of shacks and areas entirely covered by plants gives a feeling of less dynamism than in the past. On the other hand, the levels enjoy enormous visual variety and an equally pleasant fidelity in reconstructing the most evocative passages of the metropolis. With also some nice choices in terms of atmosphere: for example an eerie assault on Times Square at night, suddenly left in darkness due to a blackout. For the review, we were able to test a version that was told to us as yet non-final and on a computer made available by Electronic Arts: for these reasons, we cannot comment on the possibility of accessing the configuration files and the demo in the copies on sale. they were encrypted. In a similar way we will return to the discussion of the controls, hoping they will fix the problem of semi-automatic aiming if you use the pad, and of DirectX 11 compared to the beta, when EA and Crytek will clarify things better. Instead, we have already enjoyed playing a few hours in 3D, using Nvidia 3D Vision, with a really excellent result both in terms of image cleanliness - darker and less defined on the sides than when the stereoscopic effect is deactivated, but always much better than the standard one that can be experienced at the cinema - and for the optimization work done, capable of losing very little in terms of images per second. The whole soundtrack that properly accompanies the ups and downs suggested by the events is very good, while s", "date": "2011-03-24", "grade": "9.1"}
