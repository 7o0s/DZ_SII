Released in Japan five years ago, it is the fifth chapter of the main line of Sakura Wars (or Sakura Taisen, if you prefer), but only the first to be launched outside the Japanese borders. However, although the title may suggest otherwise, in Sakura Wars there are wars on the palm of a hand. Probably not to scare off potential audiences, the game is presented as an innovative Japanese tactical RPG with a strong emphasis on story. However, do not make the mistake of immediately thinking of the various Disgaea or Final Fantasy Tactics, since the strategic battles, in this case, represent only a small part of the overall experience. The SEGA series has always stood out for the choice of mixing three different genres, extremely popular in Japan but very niche in the West: in fact, elements of an appointment simulator and tactical battles on board are embroidered on what appears to be a huge visual novel of gigantic mechs. In short, it is a difficult cocktail for many gaijin to digest. Anime or video game? It is clear that So Long, My Love is mainly aimed at otaku: the whole adventure is told in the form of a long anime, divided into seven self-contained episodes that end with the previews of the following one. The plot, characters and dialogues, needless to say, are exactly what one would expect from a Japanese animated product: 19-year-old Japanese Shinjiro Taiga has been sent to an alternative New York City to join Star Division, a undercover organization that fights the forces of evil aboard huge robots. In an attempt to gain acceptance from the other members of the group, he will meet new people and gain more and more experience in battle. Too bad that all the classic clichs of Japanese pop culture are not missing: the game is full of moe girls and sexy bombs who will often give life to covertly spicy dialogues, together with eccentric, sexually ambiguous characters or who love to talk about themselves in the third person. The screenplay does not even spare sensational stereotypes, such as the Texan girl with provincial ways or the black one who grew up in the ghetto. Each episode more or less follows a fixed pattern: most of the time the player will spend chatting with the other characters, building relationships with them, collecting useful clues or looking for particular situations. The story will then be told to him screen after screen, although they are often interrupted by pleasant animated cutscenes. The numerous illustrations of the characters and environments are truly remarkable, and the situations are varied enough to keep the attention high even in the seemingly endless dialogues. Sometimes it will even be possible to physically move from one district to another, moving Shinjiro with the analog stick: a pity that, either due to the scarcity of environments or objects with which to interact, or due to bad polygonal graphics, these are the least interesting moments of the whole game. Fortunately, So Long, My Love brings back the same interaction system with the characters already introduced in the past chapters of the series. Called LIPS, it allows you not only to choose the most suitable answer among several available, but sometimes also to decide the volume of your tone of voice: your teammates will feel more secure if you cheer them on by shouting, while a sleeping character could get angry with you if you don't speak softly. Now the bad news: the play is only localized in English, which, given the immense amount of text and dialogue, makes it inaccessible to anyone not fluent in Shakespeare's language. Battles between robots The turn-based battles, usually placed at the end of each chapter, are the only time the player can immerse himself in the real action. On board the powerful STAR, the war armor used by Shinjiro and his companions, we will move in three-dimensional arenas of rather small dimensions: for some time now the series has abandoned the classic grid that characterizes many exponents of the genre, but the functioning has remained absolutely identical. Each of the units has a points indicator available to use to move, attack a nearby enemy or heal a companion: once finished, the player will only have to finish the turn, but the possibility of defending himself, deciding the power of the attacks or perform a devastating movespecial adds just enough to plan your turn and your strategy. Forging friendships and affection with the characters is essential, not only for the small nuances of the plot and dialogues, but also for their performance in battle: particular combined attacks will in fact be more or less powerful depending on the harmony you are created between the two attackers. Often at the end of a battle the player will have to face challenging bosses, although the strategy to face them will almost always be the same: destroy all their weapons and then make them into meatballs. Unfortunately, to accompany these moments there will always be only the Japanese song that is the main theme of the game, absolutely unable to stir up the player. From time to time the game tries to break up this continuous succession of dialogues and battles with mini-games. One of these seems to wink at Phoenix Wright, and will see the player involved in a tight head-to-head for the victory of an anomalous lawsuit: it will be necessary to choose the correct sentences and advance the right accusations. Other minigames are certainly less successful, almost always requiring interaction via QTE: it's really a pity that they haven't been adapted to the controls on the Wii, while using the Remote is limited to the very rare moments in which it will be necessary to aim and analyze small details on the screen.", "date": "2010-05-17", "grade": "7.5"}
