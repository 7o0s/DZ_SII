{"name": "Star Wars Galaxies", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/star-wars-galaxies_a.html", "text": "Star Wars fans will know that the first film (A new Hope  Episode IV) of the original trilogy ends with the battle of Yavin and the destruction by the rebels of the first Death Star. The events of the MMORPG developed by Sony Online Entertainment and distributed by LucasArts, released in May 2003, take place immediately after the end of the first film, in full time of civil war between the Empire and the Rebels. Let's start our adventure As in any MMORPG, the first thing we have to do after installing it, downloading the patch, and registering with a credit card (15 US dollars is the price to pay monthly to play Star Wars Galaxies, with small discounts if you pay more months together) is the creation of our alter ego. We will only have one character per server so if you want to play a new character after the first one, there are two solutions: either we create it on another server or buy another copy of the game by paying for a second account. A very questionable choice that during beta testing led to countless controversies, a choice that however also has its positive aspects, above all reflected in the economy of the game, thus avoiding the birth of all those secondary characters also called twinks or mules very common in other games like that. In Star Wars Galaxies (SWG from now on) one of the most successful aspects of the game is precisely the creation of your own character and more generally the possibility of changing its appearance even once it has been created. The choices we are called to make are many; they range from the inevitable choice of sex, to that of race and starting class, passing through many options concerning the physical aspect of one's alter ego, such as the size of the nose, cheekbones, jaws, mouth, thickness lips, skin color, eye size, slant and color, freckles, wrinkles, tattoos, breast size, amount of muscle and the list goes on with race specific stuff too , such as the shape and color of the horns for the zabrak, the style of the lekku in the twi'lek etc. In creating the character there is fun and with all these possibilities it is almost impossible to have two people equal to each other, in two words: a show! Also in the game there is a profession, called image designer, which allows, by learning it, to change all or almost all of a person's physical appearance with even more options than there are at character creation, such as new hairstyles for hair, new lip colors etc. This is all helped by the fact that the character models are really well done, but above all they are animated great, seeing NPCs (non-player characters, computer animated extras) gesturing by moving their fingers while conversing with the NPC next to them, seeing a Twi'lek dance an exotic dance in one of the many cantinas, seeing your character nod your head as you said ~no~ to someone you were in conversation with, or having yourself wave when someone said yes he's just dismissed from us, it's really something that makes you realize how well the animations have been taken care of and it's something that really blows your mind. Races and Planets: How to make a Galaxy alive Therefore, we will be able to choose between eight different races (Bothan, Humans, Mon Calamari, Rodian, Trandoshan, Twi'lek, Wookie, Zabrak) each with its own characteristics and special bonuses for certain skills, for example the twi'leks were born to dance and have a bonus to entertainment skills, Wookiees will have higher base stats than all other races because they cannot wear armor or the Mon Calamari more skilled than other races at the jobs of assembling structures and weapons. We will then move on to the already described physical characteristics to end up with the choice of the starting class which can be selected among Artisan, Brawler, Entertainer, Marksman, Medic and Scout, (however the choice is not definitive and you can change profession when you want) and the choice of the name of our pg. Once everything is completed we will have the opportunity to do a tutorial where the main functions of the game will be explained to us, during which we will be able to become familiar with the interface, the combat system, how to use the terminals for Cloning and objects, as well as seeing how the bank system works, that of interacting with objects and NPCs, at the end of the tutorial we will have to choose ourdeparture city. Races and Planets: How to make a Galaxy alive The interface of the game is quite customizable, even if it does not reach the levels of that of Everquest. Through the interface itself it is possible to access the options menu where you can also adjust various parameters of the graphics which in SWG are really well detailed: the cities, the planets, but as already mentioned, above all the models of the characters are really beautiful, but the whole thing is also quite heavy, and if you don't have an adequate PC, you have to play it not at the maximum level of detail. With a P4 at 2.8ghz and a geforce 4ti the fps in the city drop to 3 or 4 with everything at maximum. The SWG Galaxy currently consists of 10 planets (Corellia, Dantooine, Dathomir, Endor, Lok, Naboo, Rori, Talus, Tatooine, Yavin 4). Traveling from planet to planet is done via spaceships that players can take in Star Ports within major cities. Before embarking, the player will have to buy a ticket from one of the terminals inside the spaceport, a ticket that will have a more or less high price depending on the distance from the planet to be reached. Furthermore, in addition to being able to move from planet to planet, you can take spacecraft (always with the same method as the ticket) to move from city to city within the individual planets. The worlds are in fact quite large and it takes a long time to cross a planet on foot, even more than an hour, so moving by ship is essential to cut travel times. Luckily in the last two months both mounts and vehicles have been introduced, the former are nothing more than animals trained by creature handlers and that players can ride to move faster, the latter are instead vehicles (like Luke's landspeeder in first film) which have the same function as the mounts. These two additions have been really well received because they significantly cut travel times within the planets, times that were quite long before, being forced to travel long distances on foot. Each planet has been faithfully reproduced, Tatooine is beautiful, and in traveling around the planets you will also be able to find sites made famous by the films, such as the Sarlacc pit from ~Return of the Jedi~, the royal palace of Naboo in Theed, the by Obi Wan Kenobi, the Mos Eisley cellar where Luke and Obi-Wan met Han Solo etc. One thing that is not very convincing, however, is the lack of variety of buildings within the cities. I'll explain; in the cities, on the various planets you can find different buildings used for specific functions, such as the hospital where you can go to get treatment for your wounds, the cellars where you can rest and cure the fatigues of fighting while watching dancers or listening to musicians, the spaceports of we were talking about before and so on. Here the interiors of these buildings are standard, too similar to each other leaving a little perplexed, and suggesting an aspect of the game that is not very well cared for, a little more variety in the structure of the interiors in the various buildings would not have hurt. Skills and trade: the whole world revolves around the players Unlike other MMORPGs SWG does not have a leveled character advancement system. Each character has 250 skill points at his disposal which he will have to spend to advance in the various professions. There are six basic professions: Artisan, Brawler, Entertainer, Marksman, Medic, and Scout. Each profession is divided into 4 branches which, in turn, are divided into 4 levels each. To level up one must gain the amount of experience required by the next level and go on to learn the next level from an npc or pc at the price of the required skill points. By completing the various levels within the branches, we will acquire new skills or enhance the ones we already have. Once you complete the four levels of each branch you will become a master of that profession. By becoming masters or even by completing specific branches of a profession, you will be able to access other professions called elite or hybrid professions (there are 28 of them). A system that I would define as a tree, a bit complicated on paper, difficult to explain in words, easier to understand when seen in action and which allows you to make beautiful combinations of professions. The only doubt, perhaps, is left by the fact that the 250 points to spend in the various professions are sometimes a bit low, however even if we start our career with one profession, nothing prevents us from learning others, only for reach the highest levels biseach focus on one or two professions. In fact, the limit of 250 points allows you to become masters in, at most, two professions, even if it must be said that the professions you have learned can be ~forgotten~ to recover the skill points spent and devote yourself to other professions. Among the professions that one can choose there is no Jedi. To pursue the career that was Obi Wan-Kenobi and Luke Skywalker, you need to open a force sensitive slot (a second character on the same server, which will give us the possibility to create a Force sensitive player) on which our Jedi character will be born . However, succeeding in the enterprise is not easy, to open that slot you need to become a master in various professions, and once you have succeeded, the life of a Jedi is not easy at all; they are killed on sight by members of the Empire and bounty hunters, they must be very careful to use their powers on pain of being discovered and also have a limited number of lives. Once you die three times the character loses its powers and becomes virtually unusable. However, being a Jedi means having the strength of almost 10 players and essentially killing him is very difficult. Among the various careers that can be undertaken in SWG there are several that concern the so-called trade skills, that is, all those skills that concern the construction by the players of weapons, armor, structures and various objects. In this aspect in SWG it is really at the top level, even professions that are not combat oriented, in SWG can find a way to have fun. The trade skills system is truly one of the strong points of the SOE mmorpg and to talk about it better and in more detail, it is also necessary to introduce the economic aspect of SWG. Unlike other mmorpg, in fact, this one bases its entire economy on the exchanges and sales of items between players. And it is precisely here that the SWG trade skills system comes into play, the best items, unlike other mmorpgs, are not found on the bodies of monsters, but are built by players who will then sell them through their own vendors or via bazaar terminals in cities. Skills and trade: the whole world revolves around the players Among the various professions there are the architect, the manufacturer of weapons, that of armor, the tailor, the cook and others. Going up the branch in these professions you will have access to the so-called schematics and therefore the possibility of building new weapons, armor, constructions. The various objects are built by assembling and working different materials in specific kits. The material is obtained by extracting it from the ground with a skill, or through extractors manufactured by architects, and each type of resource has its own extractor, there is a different one for minerals, for chemical resources, for water, for the flora etc., moreover each resource also has specific qualities; resources with better attributes will lead to the construction of better items. The resources are changed continuously (approximately every 4 or 5 days) thus guaranteeing objects with different characteristics. Both the factories and the extractors are placed on the land and the owner will have to manage them, supplying them with energy and paying the maintenance, otherwise the extractor will be destroyed. In addition to the extractors and the factory, it is also possible to make your own home. There are four different styles (depending on the planet) and each of the four styles has, in turn, four or five different types of house, depending on the size, from small to large passing through the medium and ending with the guild palace. Houses, like extractors and factories, must be maintained by paying a fixed amount of credits each day. Furthermore, the interiors can be completely furnished with furniture, sofas, paintings, tables, bookcases, plants, lights and many other things, all of these things are built by the other players (including houses and factories), in this case, architects. All the various objects built by the crafters can then be sold through the bazaars, which are nothing more than terminals located in the various cities where all the various types of goods for sale are shown divided into categories. Another method to sell items is to do it through sellers (npc) placed by the players themselves (to do this you need to have some points in the merchant skill) in their homes. This method is also the most popular. There is pretty much a near total lack of server managed NPC vendors as often found in other mmorpgs especially in cities. In the towns of SWG there are no shops or vendors (with some exceptions com", "date": "2004-02-11", "grade": null}
