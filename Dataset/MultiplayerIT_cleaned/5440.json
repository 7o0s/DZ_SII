Goodbye dribbling, counterdribbling, control off the ball, four different types of crosses, changing patterns on the fly, artificial intelligences that adapt to your style of play, complex online tournaments that do nothing but ask for money. One key, maximum two, top view, retrogaming-style graphics and off you go! On the other hand, Kick Off and Sensible Soccer have built us an everlasting fame on their simplicity and immediacy, associated with a particularly difficult control system which, however, in the hands of particularly good players, could give life to frenetic and spectacular exchanges. If you want, you can play it on some emulator, but why not offer a revised and corrected version of the great classics? This must have been thought by Dino Dini before developing Dino Dini's Kick Off Revival, an excellent idea, a pity that the result is a game that incredibly manages to do worse than its ancestor. As if grandma's parmigiana placed in the freezer for the best of times turns out to be a colony of mutant molds ready to eat your face when defrosted. We tried Dino Dini's Kick Off Revival and wished we'd played the original Randomness in power The gameplay of Kick Off has always been based on a very simple concept: the ball is not attached to the player, who must learn to control it first to direct it where he wants. A single button performs both the passing and shooting functions. These premises are respected by his successor, with the addition of a sort of lateral ball controls that can be activated by holding down the shot button while moving both in attack and defense. In theory, this novelty allows you to control the ball with a certain precision in the strait and avoid dribbles, but if you don't think it's a good idea by nose, you've got it. There are more times in which it happens to pull or make a tackle by mistake than those in which it actually proves useful, perhaps it would have been to use a second key and risk the accusation of heresy by the more orthodox fans. As for the control, it undoubtedly resembles that of the original game, but the impression it gave us is that it is even more random and confusing. Making two passes in a row is really very complicated, the teammates support the maneuver very badly and being able to reverse the direction of travel while holding the ball in hand is a feat, especially in defense. Obviously we have taken into account that we are no longer the players we used to be and that our reflexes can be a bit rusty, but in Kick Off Revival it seemed more difficult to strike up a game maneuver that is not totally random than eliminating the boss of Dark Souls after drinking ten shots of vodka. As far as game options are concerned, someone has mistaken the concept of ~simplicity~ with that of ~desolation~. We will only be able to play friendlies alone or against a friend, train on an empty pitch, play on the net or participate in the European championship, that's all. No World Cup, no customized cup, not even the oratory tournament. Playstation 4 trophies Dino Dini's Kick Off Revival contains a list of trophies which, theoretically, should be quite easy to obtain. To unlock them we will have to score goals in certain situations, for example from a corner or from the center of the field, both in practice mode and in matches against the PC or online. The only real obstacle to completing this feat is the control system and the quality of the game, which obviously could compromise your desire to continue. Regretting the gaillo card Ok, let's pretend for a moment that our bad feelings about the game are exclusively related to poor control proficiency. It fits, it wouldn't be the game's fault, right? Of course not, a pity that Kick Off Revival's problems do not stop at an imprecise and random control system, but sink to the very basis of this ugly nostalgia operation. To begin with, it is impossible to command the goalkeeper and decide whether to make a long or short throw. Furthermore, the goal lines or out of bounds only make sense for ten out of eleven players, in fact if the goalkeeper takes the ball out during a save we will see him quietly make a clearance and the same goes for when he takes the ball into the goal. So much so that in certain moments we will see him return from inside the net, directly on the post, with the ball bouncing back into the goal resulting in an own goal. Just comical. As if that weren't enough, NoThere is no offside, the computer makes slides with millimeter precision, but if it lands on you, don't expect penalties because Kick Off Revival is set in a dystopian past where red and yellow cards were never invented. And to think that even his predecessor had them. Is it possible that a game from 89 had them and one from 2016, right? Unacceptable. We conclude this tunnel of horrors with a final gem: we won't even be able to decide which player to use, the computer will change it automatically, but only when it remembers it, so much so that we will often helplessly witness the game's artificial intelligence approaching our door while we try to bring an attacker back to defence.", "date": "2016-06-29", "grade": "3.0"}
