Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. Do you remember Gioco pi difficile mai 2, the unfortunate Italian title of Hardest Game Ever 2? Along the lines of the various WarioWare, the title developed by Orangenose Studio tested our reflexes with a series of increasingly difficult mini-games, all united by the absurdity of the situations represented on the screen: the abuser to give as many slaps as possible in a given time interval, the ice cream balls to be stacked in the right way, the tickle to be done with a feather on the sole of a foot and so on. The success of the game could only pave the way for a sequel, and so here is Toughest Game Ever 2: thirty minigames divided into three degrees of difficulty, the same ironic approach and the same, unfortunate Italian translation, in this case ~Gioco pi hardest ever 2~. The main screen allows you to access the three categories of mini-games included in the package, divided by the level of challenge (easy, normal, difficult) and organized in ~watertight compartments~ as regards the achievements. The developers have in fact re-proposed the freemium structure of the previous episode, which allows you to unlock the new missions by obtaining a certain amount of perfect score or, alternatively, spend the daily points earned with a round of slots or, finally, put your wallet for an in-app purchase. An all in all honest solution, which pushes users to commit themselves to obtaining the best possible evaluation in each mini-game, so as to be able to continue their ~adventure~, among increasingly improbable challenges. As a side dish, some little annoying advertising banners, at the top of the screen, and a few pop-ups that generally appear when we touch the ~continue~ button a certain number of times in a row. Hardest Game Ever 2 offers new and fun challenges based on reflexes and coordination Fingers of fire The philosophy behind the casual experience of Toughest Game Ever 2 mainly relies on our responsiveness, both in terms of glance and effective finger speed and coordination. The minigames involve the use of one or both thumbs, and often involve calculating the perfect timing in order to obtain the coveted ~S~ and unlock the next challenge. The difference lies in the ~explanation~ that precedes each challenge, which in the previous episode of the series was represented by a static image with accompanying text, while now there is an animation that makes it clear how the action takes place and what we will have to do. Smashing a cockroach as many times as possible within a certain amount of time? Pick up the handset of the telephone very quickly, as soon as it rings? Charging a car battery even when we can no longer see the indicator, mentally calculating how much is left before exceeding the limit threshold and incurring game over? The style of the minigames hasn't changed, even from a graphic point of view, thanks to a design clearly inspired by Japanese manga but which also draws on the simplicity of children's drawings, always resorting to cheerful and bright tones. Of course, from a technical point of view, the precision of the touch controls is of most interest, and in this regard we can speak of a job done quite well but far from being perfect, at least in certain situations, in which one wonders if really made a mistake or it was the terminal that received the input badly or late. Despite these perplexities, which clearly show up especially during the challenges of the highest difficulty level, Toughest Game Ever 2 does not disappoint the fans of Hardest Game Ever 2, immediately capturing their attention thanks to the crazy ideas put in place and the ingenuity of some solutions.", "date": "2014-10-04", "grade": "8.0"}
