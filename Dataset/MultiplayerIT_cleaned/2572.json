{"name": "The Longest Journey", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-longest-journey.html", "text": "The Adventures of April And now we come to this Funcom game, which as you may have already understood is a classic 2D ~Point and click~ adventure, which takes up the style of the best Lucas Arts creations. This game, which consists of 4 CDs, was released almost a year ago, but the translation into our language (actually the spoken dialogues are in English) brings it back to our attention. So how is this The Longest Journey? Is it worth the purchase? Absolutely yes. I am not exaggerating in saying that it is an absolute masterpiece, one of those games that every good adventure lover must have in their collection. Still not convinced? Don't trust your trusted reviewer (or at least I hope to). You do well!! What did I like the most? I could say the beautiful 3D backdrops, the magnificent cutscenes, the state of the art sound or the simple and intuitive interface. Yet none of these represent the best aspect of the game! Absolutely stunning and the characterization of the characters and the plot of the story! And what should be important in an adventure if not this? From here on we enter a minefield because I don't want to reveal too much of the plot, but at the same time I have to illustrate at least some features that make it so fascinating. Let's start with the protagonist whose name is April and who is an artist! This is already almost unbelievable, no space pilots, adventurers or soldiers, but an artist, who is grappling with strange nightmares that have the quality of real events. It all begins in Newport, an American city in the distant future, but which seems to be the current present, if it weren't for the flying machines and some other infernal machinery. Here everything is in the hands of big companies and it's fun to see the Policemen who, when they arrest you, also give you the advertising gingle of the company that subsidizes them! Even the other characters are all characterized in a superlative way and the dialogues are never trivial or repetitive, and indeed have the right degree of humor but above all a considerable human depth. Want a little example? I tell April to look at the books that are in her room, and she ironically replies that in fact she should read more, but ignorance is one of the conquests of the time she is in!! And then the art, dreams, friends, problems of an 18-year-old girl blend together in a wonderful way to form what an adventure must convey: atmosphere. The same nightmares she is prey to, which take her to a distant and mystical world that seems populated by incredible creatures and which make her ask a thousand questions that we must answer. Even the rest is done with absolute mastery, puzzles and riddles included. What to want more? 4 CDs full of magic and atmosphere. How to be able to stay without it? This The Longest Journey is a throwback, perhaps the latest example of a genre that is definitely transforming itself into something different, but which does it in such a grand and majestic way that it deserves everyone's attention. A must for enthusiasts and a great example of what an adventure should be. I didn't talk about the flaws. Believe me there are none! A single note can be made to the lack of translation of the dialogues into Italian (the rest of the game, including subtitles, is), but the quality of the actors' acting is absolutely sublime and perhaps something would have been lost with the translation. Old memories Every gamer has a game that initiated him into this passion; I'm an ~old man~ and I remember when the very first video games, such as Pong and Space Invaders, popped up in some bars in my city. But the spark between me and video games struck in another way. Let's understand I liked those games, but it wasn't real interest nor passion, but rather curiosity. So? Well those were the times when Spectrum and C64 divided the gaming community when at a friend's house (who had a Spectrum) I saw ~The Hobbit~. Anyone who remembers this incredible text adventure can understand me, for the others I tell you that it was a revolution of the kind, it had a very sophisticated Parsec (the system for understanding commands given via a command line), it also had primordial graphics , but above all the characters lived their own lives and then the background on which the story was based was of the highest level (The Hobbit is a Tolkien story). I rushed to buy a C64 together with the original game (at the time it cost L. 49,000 and I was considered half mad since piracy was not a crime in our country at the time). I can't tell you how many hours I devoted to solving this game which passedalso for reading the original book in English attached to the game. Other times... and how can we forget the Magnetic Scroll games or the Zork saga that made this genre great. Since then, a lot of water has passed under the bridge and the adventures, once intended for a limited audience and enthusiasts, have turned into something different, more usable and immediate, especially when Lucas Arts began producing titles absolutely unique, such as Maniac Mansion, Zac Mac Craken, Indiana Jones and the tasty saga of Monkey Island. The change in the type of game, from text to graphical exploded the genre making it much more usable. However, as often happens when a genre becomes mass, the stories on which the games are based become more commercial, and this may not please someone with the most demanding tastes. Adventure games have recently evolved further, becoming something different and getting closer and closer to the cinematic genre, on the one hand, or merging with the 3D arcade genre to generate new videogame experiences.", "date": "2001-04-27", "grade": null}
