Apple itself probably didn't think that video games (high or low caliber) could become so preponderant within its platform, but it is undeniable that today playing on iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch is increasingly dignified even compared to other dedicated consoles, it being understood that the difference in terms of depth and resources used must always be kept very clear. Having said that, the situation is destined to improve even after the entry into the field of ID Software, which churned out Rage and brought a graphics engine with all the necessary trappings to iOS devices, and Epic, which went further by converting its famous Unreal Engine 3 (of which titles such as Gears of War, Mass Effect and Batman: Arkham Asylum boast) and releasing the Epic Citadel demo a few weeks ago, which left everyone speechless. Here we come to Infinity Blade, the first ~complete~ title that uses the Epic engine and without a shadow of a doubt the current spearhead in terms of hard and raw graphics power, the first and most obvious factor to take into consideration for the purchase. In any case, the Chairs, the same as the excellent Shadow Complex on Xbox Live Arcade, took care of the development of the game, and although the gameplay does not shine in depth and longevity, it absolutely has interesting ideas to take into consideration. I will avenge you, father! The story of Infinity Blade revolves around a noble dynasty of warriors who want to defeat the God King, an immortal fighter who manages to take possession of the souls of all the brave he has defeated. However, its power is clearly superior to any other and different lineages will be needed before being able to face it on equal terms, according to an evolution that provides for having to re-face the game several times, impersonating the various descendants of the initial knight and at the same time maintaining all the previously acquired skills and characteristics. Infinity Blade can therefore be defined as a role-playing game based on fighting, in fact we start from the medieval castle which represents the abode of the God King with the possibility of looking around and touching certain points on the screen to advance to the location and the next battle. Those who have been able to appreciate the beauty and freedom of movement of the Epic Citadel demo will be a bit displaced and disappointed because in this case the management of the camera is completely left to what the developers have chosen, with the greater attention placed on the fights. In this case, the interface shows your character in three-quarter view and the opponent positioned in front, with the various information at the top and three icons positioned at the bottom. At the edges there are in fact the two lateral dodges while in the center the parade with the shield, inside which there is a number that indicates a sort of energy before it is rendered unusable. The slashes are instead unsheathed by ~swiping~ the fingers on the screen in various directions; to prevent your opponent from equalizing all the hits, however, you must stun him with the appropriate skills rather than dodging or successfully parrying a certain number of attacks, in this way it is possible to perform combos and quickly reduce the opponent's energy bar. We said that the game is basically based on having to face the final boss over and over again until your character is strong enough to get the upper hand (depending on the skill it takes from 3 to 5 game sessions). Obviously the God King is well protected by a series of loyalists, to be eliminated one after the other starting from the surrounding walls up to the throne room. After a successful fight, money and experience points are acquired which, at each new level acquired, allow you to receive skill points to spend on various upgrades such as attack damage, maximum energy and shield durability. Another aspect of customization is linked to your equipment, it is in fact possible to buy helmets, armor, swords, shields and talismans, which equally enhance the characteristics of the main character and allow the latter to access the spells. In fact, a special icon at the top right of the screen indicates when the possibility of throwing one is ready, at this point you have to perform the figure indicated on the screen by a rose with your fingers which, based on the type of ring, provides spells of cure, protection or element-based attack. Each piece of equipment can restore an additional skill point that is gained when mastery is achieved thanks to itto its continuous use, a good strategy that leads to changing often so as not to slow down the growth of the character and rather enhance it faster. This is Infinity Blade gameplay, minimal exploration and ten fights to the final boss, then replaying it all over at least three times to see both endings. The first round can be completed in about an hour and it is a pity as mentioned that the exploration is practically absent and that there is not a minimum of variation between one game session and another. Fortunately, the game is still fun thanks to the good variety of fights and its RPG component, which extends to equipment and facing the same fights several times with advanced level and magic. In any case, it is useless to deny that the first thing that catches the eye is the technical sector, absolutely amazing for an iOS device. Filed the disappointment for the impossibility of moving freely around the environment, the show that arises before the eyes is of the highest level, with a very high polygonal mass both in the structures and in the fights, ultra-defined textures, lots of detail and light effects extremely convincing. A more attentive and demanding eye can't help but notice the absence of shadows on many objects rather than the low interactivity of the environment, but in any case the impact is absolutely exceptional and unattainable on Apple devices, with a special mention for the retina display of iPhone 4 and for the larger screen of iPad. The sound sector lends itself perfectly to the epic atmosphere of the title and is excellent in fights, however the most ~funny~ thing about is in any case the Italian translation clearly entrusted to an automatic translator, with the result of having terms completely out of context and difficult to interpret. And so what should be Coming Soon! (Coming Soon) becomes ~Coming Soon!~ the Level Up becomes a nice ~Climbing on the level~ and every time you complete a dodge the game rewards you with a nice ~Clear dodge~... if these are not satisfactions! The strange thing is represented by the fact that the dialogues between the characters are instead perfectly translated into our language, mysteries of whoever takes care of the localization... Dulcis in fundo, the game has full support for the Game Center with 48 objectives to unlock (which is always welcome) while for the future an update is expected at the same cost which will guarantee new settings, weapons, objects and online multiplayer by exploiting the libraries made available available from Apple, a key addition in key longevity.
