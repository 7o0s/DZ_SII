As those who have a few more years on their shoulders will remember, the series created by Amusement Vision is remembered above all for the two episodes that appeared on the GameCube at the dawn of the 2000s. Banana Blitz HD reproduces the formula of the original edition dating back thirteen years ago in a fairly faithful way, eliminating the control system entrusted to the motion sensors to reintroduce a more classical in origin. The title is already available for PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch and Xbox One, but will also arrive in the Steam catalog during the winter. Back to the past for SEGA Super Monkey Ball: Banana Blitz HD therefore draws from the past to re-propose one of its long-running series, after the publication of Super Monkey Ball Bounce for iOS and Android devices, dating back to 2014. This obviously involves an update of the graphics, accompanying some small novelties of a content nature. The single player mode is now made up of eight game worlds, each of which is made up of as many standard levels, a bonus stage and a final stage in which you have to contend with a small boss. In this case the players are called to lead the sphere inside which the funny protagonists are found towards the exit point of each map, doing their best not to fall out of the way and at the same time trying to forfeit the greatest possible quantity of bananas scattered along the track. The final score takes into account various bonuses related to the time saved and the amount of fruit collected, plus the possibility of obtaining a completion medal for passing all scenarios the first time and a champion medal for completing all levels of each world of the game consecutively. Alternatively, it is possible to opt for the Race Against Time mode, where in essence you have to go through all the game worlds proposed in the campaign with the aim of completing them in the shortest possible time. For the first time in the history of the series, online leaderboards have also been introduced, which allow you to keep track of your results by comparing them with those achieved by other community members. During the single player sessions, some difficulties remain in the management of the shots, which do not fail to generate some motion sickness problems, especially when you have to face abrupt changes of direction or jumps. To counteract the single player sessions there are the ten mini games that can be enjoyed in local multiplayer by up to four players at a time. Compared to the standard modality, in this case the approach becomes particularly variable, as there are various disciplines that are inspired by as many sporting activities. Players can therefore decide to try their hand at a frenetic obstacle course on an athletics track, go down a hill at breakneck speed with a snowboard at their feet, or even try to juggle shot put. Other categories, on the other hand, are decidedly more imaginative, providing for example to get shot from a cannon and glide as far as possible to collect the bananas suspended in the air, hit the balloons by hurling the protagonists with a slingshot or compete to see who can hammer the most moles by moving your cursor over the correct holes with the right timing. The mini games are fun enough to enjoy in the company of friends and family, although the control system does not always allow perfect management of one's movements in every single discipline. The Decathlon mode has also been introduced in Banana Blitz HD, with which it is possible to try out consecutively in all ten disciplines accessible locally, collecting an overall score which will then be compared with that of other users through the ranking system.", "date": "2019-10-30", "grade": "6.0"}
