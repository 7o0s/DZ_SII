{"name": "Ape Academy 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ape-academy-2.html", "text": "First assumption: Monkeys are always funny. The monkeys, taken singly or in groups, often make you laugh for their almost human behavior, the monkeys of Ape Escape instead take a further step towards the human race by presenting themselves as comic imitations of famous characters, dressed in the most bizarre costumes and with the always present red light above the head. Behind a game like Ape Academy there is no real story, nothing and no one to save, no worlds in crisis or objects to find, the purpose is one and only one: to play and entertain. The game is in fact composed of a sort of story mode in which increasingly tough opponents are challenged by dint of cards: within the battles, each card used will correspond to a particular category of mini-games to be faced in order to proceed with the clash; in addition to the classic single player, Ape Academy offers the player various possibilities regarding multiplayer (by far one of the most accurate and extensive in the entire psp soft library). It will be possible to play a game locally, with only one psp and two players who literally challenge each other head to head, just rotate the console 90 degrees and the two players will compete by holding one the analog cross and the other the four buttons; despite being a good attempt, local fights are relieved due to the possibility for players to see their opponent's move in real time and act accordingly (and seeing the opponent's move in the rock-paper-scissors game is the death of the game itself) and by the excessive microscopicity of the actual playing area, equivalent to about a third of the screen for each player plus another third with a series of bananas as a divider. The second multiplayer mode is the ad hoc classic, which will allow two willing players with Ape Academy to challenge each other in a battle to the last card; finally, the long-awaited game sharing closes the group mode count, which, while offering a limited version of Ape Academy, will allow you to take advantage of the game even with those who don't have it. Rock, paper and monkey The principle on which Ape Academy is based, in case it wasn't clear enough, is none other than the very old game called Chinese Morra that everyone in this world knows from having played it as children and that few others remember in the now prehistoric Alex Kidd, Master System game in which a boy roamed the Miracle World fighting enemies with rock, paper and scissors. The single player is structured as a story mode in which the player -or better said: the monkey- will have to complete a series of islands each formed by three normal challenge areas, a shop for the purchase (or sale) of particular cards or decks and finally the classic boss fight. Each challenge, whether normal or against an end-of-level boss, will be characterized by a card encounter: for each turn, players will choose a particular card from their deck, these will collide once the choice has been made and according to the rules of the morra Chinese will decree a winner, at this point the two opponents will be transported inside a game arena where the round minigame will be held. While the winner of the Chinese vise will compete to make his opponent lose life points, the loser will have to do everything to win the minigame to make sure that the penalty deriving from the card defeat is canceled and arrives unscathed to the next round. As the rounds go on, a particular number of bananas will also grow (located at the bottom left of the game screen) useful for using more powerful cards: each card in fact, in addition to depicting a particular ~ape~ of a famous character (Bert Fener, Bo D. Gard, Quentin Baboon, ...), will have a certain color linked to its sign (paper, stone and scissors) and finally a number relating to the quantity of bananas useful for its use. Each card will have a different value, some will be useful for accumulating a large number of bananas to then play more powerful cards, while others will simply remove as many points as possible from the opponent. Ape Academy 2 is loaded with a notable strategic vein Rock, paper and monkey However, one of the most important elements is linked to the use of cards in combos to create destructive blows: when players put the same cards on the table (in terms of sign) these will be considered as parity and it will be necessary to play another turn, and so on until one of the two opponents has the upper hand, at this point, the player who loses the minigame will see all the damage accumulated even from the previous cards that ended in a draw charged to his energy bar. It is from this point of view that Ape Academy 2 takes on oneremarkable strategic vein: even the most difficult player will be able to overturn a situation almost given up for lost with an intelligent and studied move (and also a little luck in getting the right cards at the right time). Rock, paper and monkey Graphically, Ape Academy is nothing exceptional and doesn't even try to be, the graphics of the minigames are simple and essential, without getting lost in useless frills (the tests last a maximum of 10 seconds, it is right to leverage other details), the menus and the play areas instead center perfectly on the simian spirit that pervades the game. The sound sector does not record noteworthy peaks, just a couple of well-chosen melodies and nothing more, monkeys have many other weapons to break into the hearts (and PSP) of gamers, and they succeed perfectly. Ape Academy 2 is one of the funniest games for PSP and certainly one of the few that truly exploits the ~portability~ of the Sony console. It doesn't innovate much compared to the first chapter, but it's still a good game. The mini-games are fun, the game structure doesn't get boring and the many multiplayer possibilities will allow you to enjoy the epic of the monkeys with the red lamp on their heads for a long time. The only real criticism that can be moved is towards the not excessive difficulty, but many - given the times - could also see it as an advantage. Pros: Perfect game for a portable console Some minigames are very entertaining One of the best multiplayer compartments of the entire PSP softeca Cons: Sometimes very simple Graphically not excellent The sound falls short compared to everything else According to some gamers, the games that embody the perfect ~portable~ essence are those formed by a series of more or less serious mini-games, excellent for a quick game on the tram and at the same time deep enough to allow for a more intense (and classic) game session, perhaps lying limply on your sofa. The difficulty of making these particular games lies largely in the possibility (or risk) of making a whole series of mini-games that are identical to each other and without the slightest link; Sony, for its part, has found itself in the hands of the perfect brand to bring in a portable version, combining a good basic concept with the innate comedy of monkeys. Ape Academy 2 is the second chapter dedicated to portable primates who fight each other with rock-paper-scissors in an attempt to become the strongest monkey in the world. Will these important ambitions be able to make Ape Academy a good game? To the PSP the arduous sentence.", "date": "2006-10-12", "grade": null}
