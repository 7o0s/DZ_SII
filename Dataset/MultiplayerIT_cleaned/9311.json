Final Fantasy IV undoubtedly falls into this category and even if from 1991 to today technology has made great strides and the franchise has produced at least ten further episodes, not to mention the countless spin-offs, the epic of Cecil, Kain and company remains one of the most loved ever. Not surprisingly, Final Fantasy IV has enjoyed numerous successive releases on multiple consoles, in particular PSOne and Game Boy Advance. A few years ago, Square Enix even offered a complete remake for the Nintendo DS, complete with polygonal graphics and new mechanics. Additionally, Cecil's story also enjoyed an episodic sequel, The After Years, released in Japan for mobile phones and later also for Wii via the WiiWare service. A truly important chapter, therefore, which heavily influenced the JRPG genre and of course the franchise itself, becoming an inexhaustible source of quotes and references. At the dawn of 2011, Square Enix celebrates its twentieth anniversary with a definitive edition full of content: will it reconcile the old and new generations of gamers? From Cecil to Ceodore Final Fantasy IV: The Complete Collection is a real compilation of the universe created by Hironobu Sakaguchi and inherited by Toshio Akiyama with his The After Years. The UMD contains both stories, accessible individually from the initial menu and connected by an intermediate chapter, precisely entitled Interlude, which acts as a bridge between the original story and the sequel, which is also individually accessible. It goes without saying that if you have never played Final Fantasy IV it is advisable to start from the beginning and follow the story in chronological order, since The After Years takes up themes and characters from the original that players are assumed to already know. If you fall into that category of players who have never heard of Final Fantasy IV, it is worth spending a few lines on the plot of the game: the protagonist is Cecil, a Dark Knight from the kingdom of Baron who, after spending years on behalf of the King, he decides to rebel against the tyrant and start a path of redemption that will lead him to become a Paladin. He will be joined by a diverse group of heroes, including the ambiguous Dragoon and fellow soldier Kain and their common love interest Rosa, the lord of the ninja Edge and the summoner Rydia: together with them Cecil will have to face an inscrutable enemy to bring back peace in the world. Seventeen years after the epilogue begins The After Years instead, in which the protagonist is the son of Cecil and Rosa, Ceodore, who in turn will gather around him a cast of old and new characters to face the umpteenth dangers that come directly from past. In Final Fantasy IV: The Complete Collection the story is not told through spoken cutscenes and dynamic shots as in the case of the most recent Nintendo DS remake; directly following the original script, in fact, the story unfolds through textual dialogues (proposing a brand new adaptation, but completely in English) without any cutscenes, apart from the introductory ones, strictly maintaining the classic and exquisitely retro exposition. That of Final Fantasy IV is a story all in all simple and nowadays some situations can seem almost a clich, but the charisma of the characters and their characterization are still unsurpassed, both by the saga itself and by the competition, twenty years later. From 1991 to 2011 The compilation assembled by Square Enix is a product that is difficult to place because diametrically opposed elements coexist in it, such as a very faithful almost retro re-proposition of the gameplay and an equally faithful and colorful 2D cosmetic that re-proposes Final Fantasy IV exactly as it was twenty years ago. enhanced however by a better definition, special effects in step with the times and totally new sprites, redesigned for the occasion. The result is a whimsical blend of old and new that maintains the vintage charm of the game while offering a colorful and enjoyable viewing experience. Mind you, the PSP can do better and the sprites of the ultra-detailed enemies without any animation also make you turn up your nose a little, but with this solution Square Enix manages to pay homage to the original without distorting or changing it drastically: Final Fantasy IV: The Complete Collection is especially aimed at nostalgics and the gameplay also demonstrates it, devoid of all the frills added in the recentedition for Nintendo DS, such as the Augment system and the general rebalancing of mechanics and combat. From a strictly playful point of view, the entire compilation offers a very simple game system, based on the Active Time Battle System which makes the frequent random fights a curious hybrid between turn-based and real-time styles. Each character has various unique abilities and traditional black and white magic, in this sense the adventure does not lack complexity or challenge and it is important to know the weaknesses of the enemies, for example the most effective spells against them. Finally, a nod to the musical accompaniment signed by Nobuo Uematsu cannot be missing, which if he had already distinguished himself at the time as one of the best in the entire franchise now is literally glorified by a perfect remastering work for each track. The result is songs that have made the history of the video game genre, as before and definitely better than before: a true musical triumph.", "date": "2011-05-02", "grade": "8.0"}
