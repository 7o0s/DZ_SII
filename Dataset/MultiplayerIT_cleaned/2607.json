This time Richard Miller will have to investigate the assassination of a Caribbean head of state, who was killed by a Miller look-alike! Three game levels (in order the yacht, the airport and the mine) but with a single main theme: shooting like hell! oh yeah... Project Titan is one of those games that make your fingers cramp! As always you will have to deal with time running out, ammunition running out, bosses at the end of the level and... once again it will be vital to play ~hide and seek~. Here too you can use the analog sticks if you don't have a gun but unlike the point made some time ago for Point Blank, in this game I would advise against it .. here the action is ~less cheeky~ and it is really too complicated to have to manage reload/hide with pad keys. The gun remains the perfect weapon.. even if it occasionally happens to ~misfire~ with the targets at the ends of the TV (because the light-guns interpret that you are shooting outside the screen) but this is not a defect of the games.. the fact is that however accurate, home guns don't quite work on the same principle as those in coin-ops... Incredible! I shoot the tv but it doesn't break! The game has a good graphics engine that makes everything run smoothly, visually it's really good but nothing striking compared to its predecessor. The interactivity with various elements of the seabed has been increased and in some stages you will find directional arrows which, if hit, will make you move (since the joypad is used to move the viewfinder ..) a nice but a little uncomfortable idea. For the audio, a separate chapter would be needed: the music, in the first stages, is the same (legendary!) of the first Time Crisis, further on we find some variations on the theme, while the effects, such as the shots or the voice that says ~Action!~, are just recycled from the old game (well made anyway). The localization in Italian is instead indecent .. the speech of the characters during the interlude scenes is indescribably bad, they all seem like robots who speak (stammering) with a Russian accent, too bad .. I suggest you play it in English, it's more fascinating and paradoxically more understandable. Target shooting on the CD What to say? It's still Time Crisis, shooting again but in different locations.. if you liked the first one you'll gladly play this one too (after the disappointment that it's not the Time Crisis 2 from the arcade). It's a maybe limited concept-game (who remembers the old Operation Wolf?) but unquestionably fun and immediate, to dust off the gun and play something different, in fast arcade-style games or fierce challenges to who gets ~further~ than they will even entertain the uncle who usually snubs ~toys~. Target shooting on the CD Pros: Fun and immediate Difficulty well calibrated Cons: Longevity not eternal The return of a legendary video game. The new Time Crisis has finally arrived on the shelves. Several years after the first episode, the game for which the Gun-con 45 was created, returns with an adventure that is not exactly the official sequel but more of a special edition. Project Titan was created by Namco to give a hard time to all light-gun buyers who want something serious again!", "date": "2001-04-13", "grade": null}
