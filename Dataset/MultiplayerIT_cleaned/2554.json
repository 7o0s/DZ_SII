{"name": "Metal Fatigue", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/metal-fatigue.html", "text": "And now let's talk about technicalities As mentioned at the beginning of the article, Metal Fatigue uses a 3D engine as a means of graphic representation, in fact the style of play remains fundamentally similar to that of classics such as Starcraft and therefore different from other 3d RTS such as Ground Control. In fact, in Metal Fatigue you will have to go back to extracting resources that will allow you to build structures and units using the equivalent of Starcraft's ~drones~ (of the ~HoverTIRs~ according to the game). However, you will have various ways to collect energy, in fact you can either extract it from some areas where the lava comes out or collect it through the use of solar panels. Through the use of the latter, you will have an almost infinite source of energy (but even the lava recharges over time but solar energy will remain the energy source that you will soon learn to prefer) which will often lead the battles in favor (since similarly also the enemy will have an infinite energy source) of the most ~intelligent~, since all the various factions will have full energy reserves for the entire duration of the game. The solar panels mentioned earlier can also be located in orbit, on asteroids on which you can build various structures. In fact, as we have guessed, one of the extremely innovative features of the game is that of being able to lead the battle on several fronts. In fact you will not be limited to the only battle on the surface, but you can also exploit the atmosphere of the planet or the subsoil. For example, you can send your air forces into orbit, thus overcoming the surface anti-aircraft defenses and ~dive~ attacking the enemy base, or dig underground tunnels in order to attack the enemies on the surface by hitting them from behind and so on Of course these ~brilliant~ ideas will not only come to you but also to the enemy. Indeed the artificial intelligence is extremely well developed and will keep you under constant pressure for the duration of the mission. The Robots, er, the Combots As you can therefore guess Metal Fatigue is an extremely frenetic game that will push you to make decisions very quickly since you will soon be pressed on several fronts and there will rarely be a moment of respite. Another of the main features of Metal Fatigue is the same that constitutes the very soul of the game. As can be seen from the images, in this RTS 3d the main weapon of the game will be made up of gigantic ~robots~ (in the style of those seen in many Japanese cartoons, the game itself is, according to the authors, focused on manga themes such as honesty, loyalty, friendship, etc.). These robots will not be simple predefined units but can be customized. In fact, one of the main structures of each base is the one capable of building the various ~parts~ of the Combots. These parts will then be ~assembled~ in another structure. You will therefore have a certain variety for the parts that make up a Combot, namely the arms, torso and legs. You will thus be able to build melee-oriented, heavily armored Combots, or ~sniper~ combots, with a torso that makes them invisible when not fighting and with ~fast legs~ to use the typical ~hit and run~ tactic, or even Combots armed with long-range weapons, etc. etc. Each of the various parts has its own characteristics, for example some of the melee weapons are more or less suitable for ~amputating~ some parts of enemy Combots. In fact, an ax will certainly be more suitable than a ~robot fist~ in ~amputation~ attempts. The amputated parts will be left on the battlefield to the first to recover them. Through your ~drones~ you can then recover and reuse them, furthermore the enemy parts can be analyzed by your research laboratory in order to be built by you. So once a big battle takes place in a location, a number of parts will be available that you can use to repair or build other combots. In fact you can also build them using enemy pieces, which gives a sort of ~living dead~ effect to your combot (in fact each of the various corporations has a different style for building combots) being made from parts originally belonging to the enemies . And in multiplayer it will be easy to imagine the ~morale~ effect that your enemy will have when he sees himself attacked by enemy combots built with his pieces. Finally, the combots will also have a crew that can abandon the unit if things go badly and you can also ~unhook~ the arms to take the ones you giveyou would find on the battlefield. During the game, therefore, the Combots are the masters, thus playing a main role, in fact, the fights between Combots are extremely well done from a graphic point of view (if you have the time to watch one at close range you can see clashes between swords, furious melees, etc. etc.). However, all this makes ~land~ units like the old tanks or missile launchers practically useless (at least on the surface, since the Combots cannot go underground) as they are destroyed in a few hits by the Combots. Much of the game will therefore see gigantic melees between Combots as the other units do not perform as efficiently as the Combots. The matches (which also offer a certain variety of objectives, in fact there will be those in which you will not be able to build a base but you will have a series of units that you will have to maneuver in the best possible way to achieve your goal) can therefore last hours and hours (but it could also depend on my lack of skill...) since due to the presence of virtually infinite resources, the difference will be made by the different combinations of Combots. In fact in one game I slowly but surely lost ground little by little, due to my choice to build all new combots with new and powerful long range weapons. The mistake made was that of not having considered the low effectiveness of these weapons in hand-to-hand combat. So your combot army will need a wide variety of means to be able to defeat the enemy. What's wrong? But in Metal Fatigue it's not all roses and flowers. There is a fair amount of micromanagement in the game which could make the game frustrating at times. In fact, there is no option that tells your ~drones~ to collect all the parts of the combots present in a given area and bring them back to your base, in fact you will have to manually tell your drone to collect the part and bring it back to the base and repeat everything for the number of parties present in the battlefield (which can sometimes be considerable). Furthermore, each of your combots must be built manually by personally selecting all the various parts that will make it up. An option that would have allowed you to save a particular combination of combot parts to be recalled at the right moment would certainly have helped. Furthermore, the story fails to make you participate as happens in Starcraft for example, in fact between one mission and another there will be no cutscenes but only a few lines of text, not even spoken (but this could depend on the fact that the version tested by us was the one intended for testers). The translation carried out is overall mediocre, in fact there will be terms such as ~aiming~ for the sniper weapon or ~plasma-shooter~, ~sup-shield~, ~expl-energy~. The graphics engine does its job fairly honestly and manages to deliver a decent frame rate on my P2 400 in 1024*768 even when the screen is filled with combots (every now and then the game crashed a couple of times though, when the number of unit is extremely high, but this is supposedly corrected in the version you will find in stores). To conclude Metal Fatigue is certainly a good game that will keep you busy for a long time, but due to its frenetic nature I recommend it more to those who prefer this kind of setting. Instead, those looking for tactics and strategy will have to turn to other games such as the new and surprising Combat Mission. Unfortunately Metal Fatigue fails to have that something extra that would have made it revolutionary, perhaps a greater variety between the units would have prevented the battles from being reduced to immense melees between combots, albeit beautiful to see. Let me tell you a story Metal Fatigue is the new 3D RTS from the unknown software house Zono Inc. The game is set in the 23rd century, in a time when man has finally discovered a way to travel faster than light. What happened (or will happen? n.d.Pucci) afterwards is easy to imagine: man began his colonization of the galaxy, until one day the ruins of some sentient populations destroyed by an ancient race called the ~Hedoth~ were discovered. The three largest human ~CorpoNations~ went on a frenzied arms race, building war machines based on the ancient Hedoth war machines. Once the necessary preparations were made, the three corporations decided to attack the Hedoth system, but once they arrived at the place they discovered that their enemy had disappeared and therefore in the name of friendship they decided to pfind the armaments between them, starting a gigantic fratricidal war. It is precisely the case to use this term: in fact the game will see among the protagonists a group of three brothers who will remain embroiled in the war between ups and downs, but participating from opposite sides. The game is then divided into three campaigns, each for CorpoNation (Rimtech, Neuropa and Mil-Agro), where you will follow the exploits of one of the three brothers.", "date": "2001-04-27", "grade": null}
