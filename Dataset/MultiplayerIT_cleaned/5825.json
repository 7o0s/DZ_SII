Many will be wondering and we are convinced that among the comments, in several, it will take very little to cry out to the scandal or who knows what conspiracy. We've actually been wondering for a long time if we'd be able to escape the Star Wars cyclone, a media hurricane that has completely enveloped our lives for weeks now and that seems to leave no one a chance. On the other hand, it was videogames that officially opened this new era of Star Wars thanks to that master stroke by Electronic Arts that responds to the name of Star Wars: Battlefront, and to close the cycle it seemed right to talk about the film itself. here, on Multiplayer.it. But to try to distinguish ourselves from the dozens of ~classic~ reviews that you have already read by now or are about to read, we thought we'd tell you what a gamer can see, notice and find in The Force Awakens. In short, don't consider it a judgment on the film in the classic sense of the term; on the other hand we would not be able to give it either. And if nothing else, this statement can immediately reassure you of one thing: you will not find spoilers, revelations or plot clips in this article. So read it with peace of mind, even if you want to arrive pure and chaste at the screening. The real gamer can't resist the Force Awakens! The classic review If this special article of ours wasn't enough for you and you want to read a real review of the film, written by those who chew cinema from morning to night, we suggest you go to Movieplayer.it where you will find a precise and detailed assessment of Star Wars: The Awakening of the Force. In a nearby galaxy Let's start immediately by saying that The Force Awakens impeccably respects what is expected of a Star Wars film. And depending on the point of view, this can be its greatest strength but also its greatest flaw. On the other hand, how could a film we have dreamed about for years and which is ~forced~ to remain tied to that precise iconography that he himself created ever be able to amaze us? And in fact, in the two abundant hours in which we sat enjoying the show, the screen shot at us exactly what we wanted to see and which, somehow, we had long imagined. We start, of course, with space and immediately our soul as longtime players started to rattle. How far away are the never too late X-wings and TIE fighters and how much more we will miss them after seeing what is possible to bring to a screen with today's technology. In our opinion it is right here, in the moments in which spaceships and starfighters are the protagonists, that JJ Abrams' film reaches its peak. That astounding flash of lasers, that old-school flavor of the classic chases between two aircraft which, armed only with small machine guns and only apparently deadly missiles, in an instant seems to catapult us into any flight simulator, not necessarily space. There is little to do, we intimately feel that desire to take a nice joystick flanked by a throttle with the genuine desire to launch ourselves into some rapid nose-up or in a desperate turn perhaps decelerating suddenly and trying to divert the little remaining energy to the rear shields to resist assaulting a TIE fighter with the hope of getting within range of its tail and taking it out with a couple of well-aimed laser blasts. And months of Elite: Dangerous and a few quick games of Star Citizen weren't enough to make us forget where it all began. A couple of X-wings and A-wings, a handful of TIE fighters with their characteristic ~scream~ and maybe in the background a star cruiser of the First Order (the new Galactic Empire so dramatically similar to its predecessor) are really enough to make us understand in a flash how little it takes to make that really immediate and fast-paced action space simulator that we all want to play within the next six months. The other big component that makes any Star Wars spectacular are the ground battles. And also from this point of view The Awakening of the Force does not deny expectations. The blaster fights with the Resistance on one side and the First Order on the other seem to make full use of all the action that first-person shooters have accustomed us to, but also some of the more recent titles with a point-and-shoot third person. Only this time there are the ~new~ Imperial stormtroopers: much better characterized and refined in the past with a wink squeezed in favor of a division into classes. There is the classic stormtrooper who can limit himselfonly to fire from the medium distance armed with the classic laser machine gun, there is the one capable of thinning the ranks of enemies using a flamethrower, there are those equipped with heavy weapons to be placed on the ground and with which to create huge barrages perhaps for try to stem the adversaries while waiting for a support attack from above, promptly called by radio, to hit the most holed up rebels. And there's even the fully melee-focused Stormtrooper, armed with an energy staff that makes him capable of dealing with even a lightsaber. As long as you don't use the Force. From this point of view it must be recognized that Star Wars: Battlefront has really paved the way for our imagination. Of course, it is true that the Electronic Arts shooter is completely focused on the old film trilogy, but it really will take DICE a moment to update the entire structure of its product, starting from the management of classes and equipment, up to the new ones , inevitable heroes, in such a way as to make it ~compatible~ with what was seen in The Force Awakens. And since there has been talk of heroes, we cannot hide that seeing the rebel group so close-knit and above all well defined in its new protagonists has turned on more than a light bulb in favor of that single player action adventure that we are all waiting for and that we really hope Visceral Games and the new EA Motive studio headed by Jade Raymond, are realizing. There is Finn, the deserter stormtrooper, there is Rey, the beautiful, new heroine of the trilogy, the strongest pilot of the Resistance, Poe Dameron and obviously a series of leading figures from the old trilogy return including, absolute protagonists, Han Solo and Chewbacca. And obviously our imagination ran fast towards a cooperative experience where you can manage and choose your favorite hero from time to time, perhaps even based on the mission to be accomplished. And from this last point of view, we wouldn't mind being able to play some sections with a rather incisive stealth component. The legendary BB-8 The splendid new droid that accompanies the protagonists of The Force Awakens was the undisputed protagonist of an astonishing marketing campaign that resulted in a sea of merchandising that, we are convinced, will not stop in a short time. In the videogame field, however, nothing has yet been seen with BB-8 as the protagonist and we cannot help but think that a nice iOS and Android title could be right up his alley. Perhaps a top-down or isometric environmental puzzle at Monument Valley or Lara Croft Go-style would suit the funny droid well. What do you think about it? And the Jedi? It is no coincidence that the title of the film is The Force Awakens and we must admit that perhaps the presence of the Force is a little too mild and subdued and perhaps we would have expected a greater number of those white-weapon fights that made iconographic this epic saga. At the same time, however, we could not help but notice that the writers have seen fit to enrich that cauldron of powers available to the Jedi and Sith knights with a couple of new skills that, we are convinced, will be well exploited in the next video games on license. The ability to pin any opponent in place, including any blaster shots and other assorted shots, can be transformed in an instant into something that can be used in an imaginary Star Wars: Battlefront 2 or in any other title inspired by the new trilogy. On the other hand, we have more doubts about the real usefulness in a video game of the incredible ability to probe an opponent's mind in search of hidden memories and vital information for the continuation of the story. Maybe it could be a power that can be used during a Knights of the Old Republic-style RPG dialogue, a kind of persuasion at the highest level. But certainly in an action title we find it more difficult to find immediate use in battle. And what about Kylo Ren's mythical, new lightsaber? Such a design, so little credible during a duel but so fascinating to see in action, obviously gave us hope for a future video game where the possibility of creating our own Force adept weapon allows us not only to change the crystal to access the various colors of the blade, but perhaps also to work on the hilt of the sword after all this time we have been used to always and only seeing linear and rather standardized handles with the exception of very few alternative designs. But perhaps we are daydreaming a little too much since for the moment there is no horizonn there is still nothing concrete. Just a few rumors and a handful of rumors. However, we are clawing because the vision of this film, despite its defects given by Abrams' excessive desire not to overdo it, remains well anchored to the ground and brings to the screen exactly what the public expected, carefully avoiding any element criticizable or out of the fan's imaginary canons, it literally galvanized us and we can't wait for Disney, Electronic Arts, or any other software house to announce a new triple A based on the franchise. A video game that can adequately exploit all those elements that we have glimpsed in this new film and that we have tried to tell you about, to build an adventure experience, perhaps in an RPG style, which no longer makes us look nostalgically at that videogame past by Knights of the Old Republic, X-Wing Vs. Tie Fighter and Jedi Knight.", "date": "2015-12-16", "grade": null}
