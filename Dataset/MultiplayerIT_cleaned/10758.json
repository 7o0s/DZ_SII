{"name": "Due ruote sono meglio di quattro!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/motogp-08-recensione_a.html", "text": "It is certainly not the first time that we have welcomed the advent of a videogame product officially linked to the world of MotoGP, but after the Namco Bandai titles first and Climax then, here is a turning point in the management of the franchise: the license has in fact been purchased exclusively from Capcom, which has entrusted the Milanese Milestone team with the development of a racing game inspired by last motorcycle season. So let's see how our compatriots fared in the difficult task of offering a convincing course simulation on the Wii. I move, you move, he moves Milestone is certainly not the last to arrive when it comes to racing games: starting from the beginning with Screamer up to the very recent Superbike World Championship 08, the developers of our house have accumulated a very considerable cultural baggage on the genre, which unfortunately has not been put to fruition satisfactorily in this version of MotoGP 08 for Wii. However, the initial impact with the Capcom product is more than discreet: in terms of the modes made available, the game has a good amount of elements attractive to two-wheel enthusiasts. Career and Championship certainly constitute the beating heart of the entire package, with the first requiring the user to start from the 125cc with his alter-ego and win race after race with the ultimate aim of taking home the premier class trophy. From this point of view, the little space granted to the player in terms of customization of the motorcycle makes one turn up one's nose: only four modifiable parameters, in addition to the - indeed decidedly useless - possibility of changing team at the end of the season. The second section is more conventional, which simply allows you to impersonate one of the official drivers of the tournament (the data are obviously updated to last year) and to accumulate as many points as possible, without the need to start from the basics. The Challenge mode should also be underlined, including 50 scenarios in which you are called to achieve certain objectives in order to progress: you therefore find yourself having to complete a race with worn tyres, complete a lap following a particular trajectory, to overcome a certain number of opponents and so on. The inevitable Tempo Race and Fast Race do not need an explanation, while a pull of the ears should be made to Milestone for the poor management of the Tutorial: instead of explaining in detail how to ride your bike, the developers thought (badly ) to slam the user on the track without too many compliments, limiting himself to making a note appear on the screen when particularly serious mistakes are made or juggles flawlessly. In short, anything but a useful experience to learn the tricks of the trade. Power is nothing without a controller It is sad to note that, even in the case of MotoGP 08, the peculiar Wii control system proves to be more of a limit that hinders the playability of the product, rather than an opportunity to expand the genre towards new horizons. Milestone had the good intuition to offer three different steps of complexity depending on the player's aptitude: Arcade therefore allows you to forget the laws of physics, while Simulation puts them into practice in a decidedly rigorous way, with Advanced acting as the happy medium between the two extremes. It is a pity that the poor precision of the control system via motion sensor makes the more realistic setting substantially inapplicable, and - theoretically - even more interesting: in this situation, managing the motorbike through oscillations of the Remote (to be held in a horizontal position just as if it were the handlebars of a motorcycle) is a titanic undertaking, considering how easy it is to take turns or to tighten the curves too much, finding yourself with your face on the asphalt. Removing the Arcade mode from the deck, which is really too simplistic, only the Advanced setting remains, however far from guaranteeing the user a particularly fun or plausible experience. Things improve slightly if you use the Nunchuck analog to control the bike, but not enough to make MotoGP 08 a valid exponent of the genre. Insipid from a playful point of view, the Milestone work also fails to compensate for this shortcoming with a particularly brilliant audiovisual system: beyond the meager design of the menus, the title showcases barely acceptable, if not downright mediocre, graphics. While trying to overlook the gray and bare scenarios that form the backdrop to the races (these are still circuits), it remains a rather approximate realization of bikes and riders, rough from the point of view of polygonal complexity and textures and absolutely improvesbili as far as animations are concerned.", "date": "2009-04-14", "grade": "5.5"}
