The public rewarded the idea by making NaturalMotion collect several million dollars, and thus a trend was born which later saw the arrival of the excellent Fast & Furious 6: The Game, capable of introducing some interesting variations on the theme, such as drift racing, as well as vintage CSR Classics reinterpretation. In short, we are talking about a widely consolidated genre, which returns today to reaffirm its popularity with CSR Racing 2. The chapter of maturity for the NaturalMotion franchise? Unfortunately not: a few races are enough to realize that the game is a mere ~more of the same~, in which the exact same formula of the original episode is reused, with very few innovations on the tuning front (in this case the ~tuning ~, which allows you to adjust certain components to obtain a further boost), the same limits as regards the freemium mechanisms (with the ~fuel bar~ which is consumed as we take part in the races, and which recharges as the minutes or by watching advertising trailers) an action that therefore becomes repetitive and ~already seen~ in a short time. CSR Racing 2 is a solid and visually spectacular drag racer, but without substantial novelties Gang warfare Even on a structural level, CSR Racing 2 does not invent anything new: in the role of a skilled driver we will have to prove our worth by winning a series of clandestine races and defeating members of different gangs, facing them one at a time until the boss on duty, who we will have to beat three times to be able to unlock the next area, buy a higher class car and repeat the process all over again. Being a freemium product, there is a great emphasis on grinding, which in this specific case forces us to repeat the same races over and over again to raise the money necessary to buy upgrades and thus obtain the necessary power to be able to progress in the countryside. New events pop up on the map all the time, but apart from particular rules, little changes: there is the daily event, which puts us behind the wheel of a different car from time to time, or the race with special conditions, in which participate after modification of the tuning to enter the required range. The most relevant novelty is represented by the introduction of real-time competitive multiplayer, which features a fairly fast matchmaking and allows you to raise the stakes to possibly get more money, but beyond this the gameplay does not change: timing of the change gear and ~strategic~ activation of the nitro, without further variations, with the downshift button which proves to be frankly useless. Of course, if you don't know any drag racers, the system could easily win you over, also thanks to an excellent technical sector, which displays truly splendid polygonal models for the cars, a motion blur effect that emphasizes speed during the races and valuable reflections that enhance the scenarios. It's a pity that the locations are always the same, even if filmed at different times of the day or weather conditions, and that the music gets boring after a while.", "date": "2016-07-18", "grade": "7.0"}
