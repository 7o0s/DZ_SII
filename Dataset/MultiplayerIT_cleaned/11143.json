{"name": "Samba de Amigo - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/samba-de-amigo-recensione.html", "text": "Samba! The main menu of the game offers us various possibilities. If this is our first game, we should start from the ~training~ mode, which will show us how this Wii version of Samba de Amigo works. The developers have tried to reproduce the controls used on the Dreamcast in the best possible way, therefore you have to keep the Wii-mote and Nunchuck (or two Wii-mote) facing up, towards the screen or down depending on whether you want to operate the upper, middle or lower circles. On the screen we will see balls that start from the center of the pattern and head towards the circles: when they are perfectly inside them, following the rhythm of the song, we will have to shake the corresponding controller. A simple and immediate mechanic, which becomes more demanding as the degree of challenge increases: during the first stages we will always find ourselves acting on the central and upper circles, with reasonable breaks between one beat and another; after completing some stages, however, we will have to act on all the circles and intercept double and triple beats, as well as those in rapid succession (it will be a matter of shaking the controllers and that's it, fortunately). This simple and intuitive mechanic finds variations during the dance and pose phases, phases in which we will have to move as indicated on the screen to get extra points. As a good rhythm game, Samba de Amigo puts the rhythm of the songs in first place: following it, we will not have particular difficulties in identifying the exact timing of the beats. Unfortunately the response to the commands leaves something to be desired, and the knots come home to roost very quickly. The repertoire! Samba de Amigo for Wii can count on no less than forty different and rather famous songs. It is interesting to note that they are all in the original version, with the exception of Ricky Martin's pieces (~The cup of life~ and ~Livin' la vida loca~), which are instead present in the form of covers. It is a respectable repertoire, with some really nice reinterpretations in a Latin American key (see ~Take on me~ by A-Ha) and the common denominator of a cheerful and engaging rhythmic base. The number of songs can be increased by connecting via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection in-game and purchasing additional packs. friend! The main game mode is the ~career~, which provides us with four difficulty levels (easy, normal, difficult and extreme) to be unlocked gradually, each consisting of four stages which in turn see us busy with different songs. The aim in each session is to achieve the greatest possible precision, which will translate into a final vote and will allow us to unlock songs, minigames, sound effects and so on. Next to the ~career~ is the ~single player~ mode, which includes different game options (quick game, ~love love~, ~battle~, ~classic~ and ~survival~) as well as a series of eight different minigames . The latter offer an alternative action to the standard one: in ~Watch out for moles~, for example, we will have to move the controllers in the right way to crush the moles that emerge from the six circles; in ~Full Out!~ instead, it will be necessary to shake the Wii-mote and Nunchuck like madmen to break as many stones within a time limit; in ~Dance amigo dance!~ we will have to focus only on the dance sequences, performing them in rapid succession; in ~Volleyball~ we will find ourselves improvising a game of beach volleyball by moving our hands on the screen... These are nice and varied applications, but which unfortunately offer very limited entertainment and of questionable quality, with bits of absolute sadness (see note volleyball~...). The multiplayer mode and the possibility of accessing the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, useful among other things for downloading additional content, complete the circle: a first pack of songs is already available, which can be purchased for 500 Wii Points. Technical realization Samba de Amigo is still an almost ten year old video game, yet the particular graphic style, together with the essential aesthetics of all rhythm games, make it still current, perfectly in line with today's offer for the genre. membership. The developers of the Gearbox team have done an excellent job of adaptation: by connecting the Wii via component cable, the game is a feast for the eyes, a feast of brilliant colors that overshadows the low polygon count on the screen. Unfortunately, the graphic solutions adopted for minigames often leave something to be desired, but this is a problem limited to that type of application. The interface is always legible, and you navigate using the Wii-mote's pointing system. The sound is great, clearly, andcan count on a whole series of nice extras that must be unlocked by proceeding through the stages: in this case, you can choose the sound effect that is played by the Wii-mote speaker, replacing the classic noise of the maracas with a series of other sounds . The musical pieces boast excellent quality, they are almost all in the original version and play their role in the best possible way, always ensuring a cheerful and light-hearted atmosphere. The ability to customize the control system is appreciable: you can choose to use Wii-motes and Nunchucks or two Wii-motes, one in each hand, even if the results are far from satisfactory. If this conversion suffers from a technical problem, in fact, it concerns the controls: regardless of the causes, the final result is very far from that seen on the Dreamcast. This is inevitably reflected in the playability: at the lowest difficulty level you can play without too many problems, but as soon as the action gets faster it becomes really difficult to get all the jokes right. Comment Samba de Amigo deserved a conversion for Wii: it is a classic rhythm game, which still adopts fresh and innovative solutions today, and which on the Nintendo console can aspire to considerable commercial results. The hope is that the series will go on, produce even more entertaining sequels and carve out the role it deserves within the current gaming market. Beyond these auspicious observations with a vaguely nostalgic flavor, unfortunately, it must be noted that the game does not give its best on the Nintendo console. The substance is there and can't be discussed: the game system is the original one, there are so many modes and it's even possible to buy additional packs (which you don't see often on Wii, on the contrary). The problem is that the controls are rather imprecise - too much to guarantee an experience worthy of the original. And that's no small flaw. In short, this conversion of Samba de Amigo for Wii has the bittersweet taste of missed opportunity. Are you willing to compromise? Pros Tested game system Lots of modes Cheerful and engaging sound Cons Inaccurate motion detection Often mediocre minigames Local multiplayer only Longing for maracas? The problem, more than anything else, will be to ensure that the Wii-mote and Nunchuck react appropriately to requests: unfortunately the response to the commands leaves something to be desired, and the knots come to a head very quickly. As long as you try your hand at the lowest difficulty level, this serious drawback is mitigated by the low number of beats to be made: the sensor bar is able to correctly record the position of the controllers, then preparing to receive the relative ~shrugs~. As soon as you move on to the normal or difficult level, however, this becomes really limiting and in fact prevents us from scoring the scores we deserve: the slowness in recognizing the position of the Wii-mote and Nunchuck makes us lose numerous jokes, sometimes resounding. Trying with two Wii-motes, then, the situation becomes even worse, as there is a further delay in the response to inputs. We must also add that, in many cases, the movement that is made to change the position of the controllers is mistaken for a jolt, with all that follows. It goes without saying that getting high scores, under these conditions, requires considerable patience and commitment: you have to go to the rhythm to get the beats right, but remember to change the inclination of the Wii-mote and Nunchuck very slowly for this action to take place ~ read~ correctly. And this does not go well with the nature of Samba de Amigo, which in its Dreamcast version could count on decidedly superior performance in terms of controls.", "date": "2008-10-07", "grade": null}
