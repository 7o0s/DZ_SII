Yes, even buildings have feelings after all: this is the philosophy of the new indie available on PC via Steam and on consoles from April 22, 2021. Basic ideas, game modes, protagonists are all very particular compared to the usual expectations. Our task will be to explain to you why, precisely because of these peculiarities, you could fall in love with the production of Blackstaff Games, a developer previously known only for a handful of titles for Android and iOS. The plot, brick by brick Progress is necessary and inevitable, and from time immemorial it involves structural changes for any self-respecting city center; after even a few years, cities can radically change their appearance, replacing the old buildings with new, more suitable, more useful ones. But the plot of Buildings Have Feelings Too! remember that every change risks inexorably erasing what was there before, and forever, from the collective memory. That doesn't make buildings happy - they have feelings too! Buildings Have Feelings Too!: look how cute they are The funny (but often significant) story of the title in question, then, tells precisely this: the evolution of the city, of the inhabited centers, and of all the spaces annexed to them, but from the point of view of buildings that risk disappearing Always. Buildings such as the Old Pete Shipyard, the first to be demolished to make room for other structures. But unfortunately other protagonists could soon follow his fate: in fact (we are at the beginning of the twentieth century) the Old Bank is in deficit, the linen factory no longer receives the same orders as before, the warehouse has lost contact (and contracts) with nearby cities. What if the demolition workers quickly drop by to pay them a visit too? Buildings Have Feelings Too! and its countless game options The player plays the role of an ambitious and well-willed building, the Via di Mezzo Hotel, in its attempt to ~repurpose~ the historic structures of the city center for new tasks. If a linen factory is no longer in business, why not turn it into a distillery, ready to supply the neighborhood pubs? And are we really sure that old uninhabited buildings wouldn't work even better than before, if they housed administrative offices? The nascent bureaucracy badly needs it. From era to era, from city to city, the narrative of Buildings Have Feelings Too! it shows the constant change of places, in an always precarious balance between the expectations of the residents and the needs of economic activities, also raising very interesting doubts about pollution and the spaces inhabited by human beings, in short, about the so-called civilized world. The gameplay: a very deep management Buildings Have Feelings Too! and upgrade screens From the point of view of the play offer, Buildings Have Feelings Too! is a 2D management game with well-finished backdrops and deliciously funny animations. On balance, the player's task is ~only this~, that is to deal with the development of his own city, managing buildings, constructions, demolitions, readjustments of structures, taking into account a whole series of fundamental parameters. The main adventure is divided into various levels that are unlocked later, after completing all the requirements of the previous one: you start from a small Victorian-era city center struggling with the reconversion of its manufacturing activities, then you continue up to modern times. In this way, the flow of history and territorial changes are represented in an excellent way. Gameplay side and management side, Buildings Have Feelings Too! it may initially seem almost trivial: all right, buildings are positioned guided by a fairly long tutorial, but why? What's the goal? After the first hours of the game, however, it becomes clear that it is also very deep, and that no choice can be left to chance. The experience is never punitive, but very precise: to continue it is very important to understand what the city wants in a given moment, and what are the (few) ways to achieve it. All the buildings of a certain level are connected, and each one, also on the basis of its physical location on the horizon line, exerts an influence on the others, which can be positive or negative. A factory next to apartment buildings, for example, won't make the residents happy at allnts; and this will prevent the development of the condominiums themselves, with all the resulting advantages. Buildings Have Feelings Too! who wants a chimney behind the house? Each building, divided into several categories, can in fact be developed up to the level of three stars, plus a maximum parameter defined as ~appeal~ (ie ~attraction~, unfortunately there are various languages but not the Italian one). And each activity, of course, provides the basis for the development of the rest of the district: thus, before having the cafes available, you will have to bring a three-star pub and also make all the patrons very happy. The progression Buildings Have Feelings Too! here is a very dangerous screen The progression of Buildings Have Feelings Too! it is entrusted to at least two main values: hearts (indicated at the bottom and centrally on the screen) and gold bricks. A city or district with many hearts shows a well-balanced development between activity and population, as well as the overall happiness of the residents: before moving on to a new level, it will be essential to obtain a certain number of hearts in the previous one. At the same time, progression within the world is linked to gold bricks, i.e. the currency needed not only to build new buildings, but also to modify those already built. It therefore happens that you ~run dry~, because perhaps you have built without too much attention a series of structures which later turned out to be excessive in number or function. At that point there are two choices: if there are enough gold bricks in the inventory, a reconversion can be carried out; conversely, game over can be avoided by simply demolishing the entire building (this reallocates the initial resources). Be warned though: not all buildings can be demolished with the lightness star, and some cannot be demolished at all. Buildings Have Feelings Too! each location is perfect for housing only certain buildings The physical location of the structures, as has already been mentioned, also matters: because each one affects the others in the vicinity. How to do, therefore, if that factory built a few minutes ago now finds itself near the offices, and oppresses the employees of the latter? Well, you may have noticed that the buildings in Buildings Have Feelings Too! they can talk, and they have arms and legs. So just ask them, kindly, to toddle away in another position, exchanging places with the others already present or making them all slide to the right or to the left. We have tried to account for the depth of the Blackstaff Games title by showing you some of the mechanics underlying its functioning, but the possibilities are really many; a number indeed unsuspected, considering the indie nature of the title.", "date": "2021-04-25", "grade": "7.5"}
