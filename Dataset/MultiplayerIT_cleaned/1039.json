{"name": "Recensione MechAssault II : Lone Wolf", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/recensione-mechassault-ii-lone-wolf.html", "text": "Who does it himself The single player campaign, which is the weak point of the first MechAssault, has been totally revised. Now the missions are longer and more articulated, and in particular the new objects at our disposal significantly modify the game mechanics. In the missions we will no longer be protagonists only as mech pilots, but we will also have the ability to act as foot soldiers who can enter a BattleArmor, control a tank, installations, such as defense turrets, use VTOLs (support aircraft tactical, vertical take-off) and of course piloting a mech. Who does it himself The Battle Armor is the highlight of the various modifications to the game, in this combat mode the possibilities are numerous, in addition to being an agile and fast device, it offers several advantages to the player. For example, we can hang on to a VTOL, which will fly over the area, leaving us to focus only on firing, we can go to protect a mech, we can also attack an enemy mech from behind and, acting like real hackers, take control of it check. now the cities and palaces are more impressive and the perspective of the game varies depending on whether you are in combat as a soldier or inside one of the mechs Who does it himself One of the other differences compared to the past is a change in proportions, now the cities and palaces are more impressive and the game perspective varies depending on whether you are in combat as a soldier or inside one of the biggest mechs, those of assault. Obviously, like any self-respecting sequel, even in MechAssault2, new weapons and new mechs have been added, also as regards the use of turrets and tanks which, thanks to a stealth device, can be invisible to radars. They are all improvements that only benefit the gameplay and allow you to diversify the type of action and combat. There are over 15 missions, connected to each other by various interludes created with the game engine, the environments are certainly more differentiated than in the past, from forests to metropolitan environments, the levels present, as previously mentioned, more possibilities for the player, but not manage to cancel the feeling of a progression that is still a little too linear. MechAssault 2 offers the three classic difficulty levels, selectable at the beginning of the campaign, and takes an average of around 15 hours to be completed. Technically speaking.. Also from a technical point of view there have been interesting progresses and from many points of view. Starting from the sound, it must be immediately said that MechAssault 2 is extremely accurate as far as this aspect is concerned. Music and dynamic soundtrack, created with the collaboration of artists such as Papa Roach and Korn, environmental effects in game with Dolby Digital 5.1 support are promoted without reserve. From a graphic point of view, although it is not the most impressive engine of the Xbox line up, several additions and changes have been made compared to the past. The environments have a greater polygonal complexity, new graphic effects have been added for what concerns the use of weapons and the destruction of objects Technically speaking.. The environments have a greater polygonal complexity, new graphic effects have been added for what concerns the use of weapons and the destruction of objects, such as for example the construction of buildings that can be damaged on multiple levels, without collapsing immediately, and also the lighting system has been optimized thanks to the greater experience in using the hardware of the Microsoft console. The frame rate is decidedly solid and suitable for the type of game, the slowdowns in the single player or multiplayer section are very rare and do not affect the action in the least even in the most agitated phases. The weak point of the graphics section concerns some environmental textures with uncertain resolution, but the final result is certainly more than pleasant. Live to the fullest.. The core of MechAssault 2 is again the multiplayer section which, in addition to repeating everything we had already been able to see in the first chapter, adds two points of great importance to underline: the Conquest mode and the inclusion of new combat vehicles also in multiplayer. Let's start with a few numbers: the players supported in the matches reach a maximum of 12, and there are 10 game modes that can be selected and include from the most classic Deathmatch, up to the war between bases, passing through the classic Last Man, Capture the Flag, or some most sought after as the Control it, in which, playing in a team, you have to gain control of the five checkpoints in the level. Another detail to rememberare is a further optimization of the already excellent code implemented for the management of online matches, even in matches with several players. thanks to these additions, teamfights have certainly become more tactical and much more fun than in the past Live to the fullest.. In the multiplayer section, additions such as the battle armor or the control of VTOL vehicles significantly modify the game method and strategies. In a well-knit team, the control of VTOL vehicles, for example, can turn the tide of a clash even towards more capable opponents, in fact, these vehicles can carry weapons and tactical support as powerups, be used to move their seriously damaged comrades , or to speed up the movement of players with battle armor in modes such as Capture the Flag. Tanks, thanks to their stealth characteristics, can likewise become much more useful and lethal in online battles than in single-player mode. Ultimately, thanks to these additions, teamfights have certainly become more tactical and much more fun than in the past. Galactic War The Conquest mode is perhaps the biggest novelty implemented in the multiplayer section. The concept represents that of a more or less persistent experience in the Live world, in which, thanks to the options of Xbox Live 3.0, a clan, or rather one of the ~houses~, starting from a native planet, must progressively conquer the other planets or defend their territories. a clan, or rather one of the ~houses~, starting from a native planet, must progressively conquer the other planets or defend its own territories. Galactic War Each planet is divided into territories, and the way to conquer the planet is to obtain a minimum number of points, which the clan acquires by winning battles with other players. It should be noted that, depending on the planet, the clash modes can also change, therefore not only furious assaults in team deathmatch. From the game menu it is possible to select three main options: Attack, Defense or Reinforcement, respectively to enter a battle for the conquest of a new planet, for the defense of one's own territories, or as reinforcement for an attack already in progress. Comment MechAssault 2 brings numerous additions and changes compared to the previous episode and even if the structure, strongly focused on multiplayer modes, remains the same, there are numerous additions that give greater body to the single player game as well. MechAssault 2, supporting downloadable live content like its predecessor, is an interesting purchase also from a future perspective, thanks to updates on all fronts. It remains a definitely recommended purchase for those who live on bread and Xbox Live, but also all fans of Mechs and spectacular clashes are invited to take a look, despite the relative brevity of the single-player campaign. Pros: Renewed game mechanics Live soundtrack well exploited Cons: Some textures to review Still too linear. A little too short It has been over two years since the release of MechAssault, one of the launch games for the Xbox Live service. During this period, the title developed by Day 1 Studios was also the forerunner in terms of downloading content from Live, as well as one of the most popular and used games on the online service offered by Microsoft. Today it's time for the Wolf Dragons to go back to fighting, MechAssault II: Lone Wolf begins shortly after the end of the first chapter, landed on the planet Dante, and with the help of a new technology, the ~Battle Armor~, developed by some data present in the head of a Ragnarok, we will have to ruin once and for all the ambitious plans of conquest of the Word of Blake.", "date": "2005-02-11", "grade": null}
