While not deviating in any way from the Musou tradition, the tie-in developed by Omega Force offers an extremely rich experience for fans of the manga created by Eiichiro Oda, especially from a narrative point of view. In fact, the campaign of the game starts from the beginning, with a Luffy still a boy who promises in tears to his mentor, Shank the Red, to one day become the king of the pirates. The first missions will therefore see us take on the role of the fighter endowed with the powers of the Gom Gom fruit, in search of a crew worthy of his ambitions: a path that will lead him to meet extraordinary characters such as Zoro, Nami, Usopp, Sanji and Chopper , the starting nucleus which will be enriched with further components over the course of the series and will face a sequence of increasingly stronger opponents, navigating the Rotta Maggiore in search of the mythical treasure of Gol D. Roger. Endless combos One Piece: Pirate Warriors 3 Deluxe Edition allows you to select the character you want before each mission, with companions to offer support but without the possibility of making a real switch. There are of course limitations related to the progress of the plot, which however are completely overcome within the Diary of Dreams mode. In that case it is in fact possible to choose any of the over fifty fighters available in the game and explore an archipelago made up of various islands, each with enemies to eliminate but also rich prizes to conquer. Of course, coins stand out among these, which in the title of Omega Force are used with a view to a peculiar enhancement system, which allows you to improve the characteristics of the warriors thanks to specific combinations. But let's go back to the campaign, which as mentioned follows the plot of the manga starting from the first chapter and reaching almost to the end, to be precise to the Dressrosa storyline. The events are introduced by cinematic sequences, after which the various situations are reduced to the typical structure of the Musou, with maps of a fair size that must be freed from the presence of the opponents, going to the hot spots when indicated. You always fight, uninterruptedly, drawing on each character's repertoire of moves to wipe out as many enemies as possible, focusing on the captains and of course on the bosses, which require a minimum of strategy and attention to be defeated. In some cases we will have to submit to precise conditions, under penalty of game over: mechanics that fans of Dynasty Warriors and its many spin-offs know all too well, and which in Pirate Warriors 3 are not declined in an innovative way, quite the contrary. Unity is strength In portable or docked mode, the experience of One Piece: Pirate Warriors 3 Deluxe Edition always remains fluid and convincing, thanks as usual to a polygonal modeling of the scenarios which in some cases appears really modest and clarifies once again how in the Musou the graphics are only functional to the action. Of course, it is a pity that this tie-in does not introduce anything new with respect to the traditional formula of the franchise, which instead had tried to do with Berserk and the Band of the Hawk or Dragon Quest Heroes II, just to name a couple. In short, we find ourselves always ringing the same combos, however spectacular, with a view to a combat system that often becomes very chaotic, thanks to a view tending to go crazy, and does not render the impacts convincingly. Shortcomings that seem really difficult to fix, if we consider that Omega Force productions have been going on for twenty years keeping their formula intact (also because, when they try to change, something always goes wrong). In the case of One Piece: Pirate Warriors 3 it is possible to count on the inevitable super, to be loaded by fighting, and on the combinations that arise from the activation of an additional indicator, which unleashes the support character we have selected at that moment. The Deluxe Edition, as already mentioned, natively includes several extra missions, additional characters and costumes, which significantly increases the duration of the experience; however, even in this case, the developers have not fully exploited the capabilities of Nintendo Switch, given that cooperative multiplayer requires two controllers and therefore cannot be played with the Joy-Con horizontally.", "date": "2018-05-13", "grade": "7.0"}
