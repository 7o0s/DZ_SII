A few days ago we brought you the Monster Energy Supercross review, and it's already time to move on to the next title from the software house: Gravel. On the one hand stunts on two wheels, on the other spectacular racing aboard cars, but the points in common are so many. In the first place, the desire to approach at all costs a type of show that is more American than European: the show is the true protagonist of the title, even before the motorists. And then the presence of the new graphics engine, which has already given the right satisfaction with Monster Energy Supercross, and which also allows Gravel to get closer to the other exponents of the genre without being discriminated against more than necessary due to the dated technical sector. The result is discreet, for a title that convinces, even if it is suitable for everyone but designed for a few. The art of off-roading It is immediately clear that Gravel is aiming for something very different from what has been seen in MotoGP and Ride. The protagonists are large, large and heavy 4x4 off-road vehicles. The tracks leave behind the world-famous serious and professional tracks, even present in Monster Energy Supercross, and instead aim for the invasion of the wilderness. True professionals are certainly not intimidated by sand, mud or rocky sections, nor by waterfalls and underground caves. In this way, Gravel is presented with a certain amount of exhibitionism, a search for excess, then mitigated by the right amount of more formal content. A large part of his charisma lies precisely in this balance, between the Gravel Channel presenters who document the current race in a serious and rigorous way, and the right touches of tamarraggine in the painting of the cars, from the official challenges with true professionals of the sector such as Sean Walker drifting by the sea or in the mountains. As usual, the Career Mode takes care of keeping all the offers of the production together. After a brusque tutorial that throws us on the road, warning us of the existence of just two commands and letting us guess everything else, Gravel gradually discovers his cards, with a sort of studied satisfaction. And in fact it is not that Milestone has skimped on the modalities to propose, grouped under a total of four main labels: Stadium Circuit, Wild Rush, Speed Cross and Cross Country. Even the names actually have a more scenographic than practical function. On balance, the various challenges on the road follow a much more canonical classification: there is the race in which you have to position yourself among the top three out of a variable total of laps, the one in which you whiz at full speed passing through the checkpoints, the time, all topped off with a permanent score counter. The latter warns us of how our performance is going: each drift allows you to accumulate a certain number of points, as well as jumps, clashes with other competitors, road holding in difficult weather conditions, and so on. Career Mode is nothing more than a succession of races after races that take us to visit the four corners of the world, each one chosen by the developers for its particular environment (deserts, mountains, beaches of the Pacific Ocean). The objective of the career is to complete the individual episodes that compose it, each divided into a certain number of races. Each of them allows you to accumulate stars: for example, arriving in the top three on a track we will get three out of three stars, placing ourselves last only one. With an ever-increasing precise number of stars, the next episode is unlocked, until you get to challenge the ~boss~ on duty, who is a professional off-roader. Among those present are Scott Parker, Ryan Carter, Justin Evans, but obviously our goal is to be the absolute best and therefore beat Sean Walker, the off-road master of the Final League. But to do this we will first have to win all the races and take home all the stars of all competitions, a task that is actually not too simple. The good news is that even finishing last Gravel gives us a certain number of experience points, the Show Points, which allow us to level up and unlock new tracks, accessories and paint jobs. Also good news is that the various competitions can be customized before starting the race, including the weather forecast for the day. Playstation 4 trophies Bringing home Platinum in Gravel shouldn't prove too difficult, even for those who don't master racing games. In fact, it seems that the trophies can also be unlocked by completing the title in ~easy mode~. Among the requirements, we will have to complete the entire Career Mode by obtaining thethe maximum score in each challenge, and also dedicate ourselves to time trials and the online sector. The rest will come by itself. Between arcade and simulation Gravel's nature is rather uncertain, and perhaps this prevented him from aiming for higher marks. We said at the beginning that it's a title for everyone, but designed for a few. Some sections are decidedly arcade: we are thinking of the clashes between the cars, the basic speed that dominates the general sense of each challenge, the aggressive customization of the vehicles, the acrobatic jumps, the clashes on the agenda especially in small circuits . We are not at the level of any Motorstorm, mind you, but you can hear the echo. On the other hand, it is also true that Gravel is not an easy title to master for non-experts. The driving system will not be at the levels of the highest exponents of the genre, but it is too technical for an arcade. Correctly drifting or jumping, avoiding collisions with environmental elements, is a task that requires extreme attention. All this talking about the ~medium~ difficulty level, because bringing it to ~hard~ to get to the first place is a real feat. The real simulation then takes over at the time of the challenges with the big names in the sector, where Milestone has aimed directly at photorealism. Here you enter the context and atmosphere of the professionals, in very different situations from the clashes in the Alaskan mountains against strangers aboard off-road vehicles. But perhaps Gravel is simply trying to make the ambiguity that permeates all of American sport, certainly more exhibitionistic than the models we are used to in Europe. The visual impact of the title is very good: we were able to juggle the mode for PlayStation 4 (standard model) and the transition to the Unreal Engine has certainly done the new Milestone productions good. Abandoning the old proprietary graphics engine was almost a necessity to be able to keep a standard in step with the times, in a sector where, especially in simulation titles, more and more attention is paid to graphic and technical rendering. In the latter, however, Gravel discovers the side a bit: it will be that they are the first titles to take advantage of the Unreal Engine, but we have encountered some unpleasant frame rate drops in the most agitated situations, and some loading that is a little too long between game menus. Nothing serious, mind you, but given that the title had been postponed last summer precisely due to the need for optimization, we were hoping for something more. We are also sure that graphically we can do better, and that the next product will already demonstrate it.", "date": "2018-02-27", "grade": "7.5"}
