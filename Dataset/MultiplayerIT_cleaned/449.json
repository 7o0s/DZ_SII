In fact, the game takes place in the distant 1522 and we will have to play the role of Valdo, an ambitious apprentice who worked for Francesco Melzi, the latter a disciple of the great Leonardi Da Vinci. The young Valdo is extremely disappointed when the scholar suddenly dismisses him due to his excessive desire for success. However, our alter ego immediately finds a way to take revenge: in fact, he receives a letter from a mysterious patron who asks him to identify one of the great master's missing codes and which should contain incredible secrets. In order to gain access to Da Vinci's last residence, the Manoir du Cloux near Ambrosie in France, Valdo thus pretends with the new inhabitant of the castle, a courtesan named Babou de la Bourdaisire, that he is still an apprentice of Francesco Melzi to examine the inventions of the genius still present in the property and therefore discover the code requested by its mysterious principal. the game unfolds in 14 chapters in which we will have to solve a good number of puzzles, riddles and combine objects to continue along the course of the plot That point and click was so dear to me... As you may have already guessed from the images, Secrets of Da Vinci remains on the typical coordinates of point and click adventures in the first person, like Myst for instance. The game unfolds in 14 chapters in which we will have to solve a good number of puzzles, riddles and combine objects to continue along the course of the interesting plot without any flaws whatsoever. As expected, these elements are all attributable to the inventions and creativity of Leonardo Da Vinci between alchemy, encrypted codes, painting (could the Mona Lisa ever be missing???) and brilliant inventions. No variations on the theme such as laser game-style sequences or the like: the only particular feature lies in a sort of morality index that will change depending on our ethical conduct. This element does not bring great news in playful interaction in the strict sense but it does affect the conclusion of the game which in fact provides for multiple endings (there are 4 possible conclusions). Chteau du Close Luc While not being able to count on the well-known Dan Brown license, The Secrets of Da Vinci - The Forbidden Manuscript was developed through an exclusive partnership with Chteau du Close Luc, (formerly known as Manoir du Cloux), the last residence in the existence of Leonardo Da Vinci. The Clos Luc is today counted among the most famous French monuments and is the destination of many tourists from all over the world to admire the mansion and discover various artifacts from Leonardo's laboratories. The involvement of the castle owners for the video game was important in order to guarantee the adventure the maximum historical respect and the closest possible reconstruction of the building and Leonardo's works. Renaissance aesthetics Moving on to the technical implementation, the French programmers of Kheops Studio (which in their portfolio have other point and click adventures such as Return to Mysterious Island, Journey to the Moon and Secret of the Lost Cavern) have probably done their best work with a three-dimensional engine capable of offering an excellent visual experience to the player with lots of good light effects, excellent polygonal solidity and good level textures. Certainly the fact that the game develops exclusively in the Chteau du Close Luc, the last residence of Leonardo Da Vinci, and in its vicinity has led to a work that is not quantitatively impressive but everything you see on the monitor is of absolute quality, without having to have a latest generation PC (we believe that even with the minimum requirements foreseen by the game, 900 MHz processor, 64 MB of ram and 64 MB of video memory, the visual experience will still be satisfactory). The sound has also been promoted with the very suggestive musical tracks and in perfect harmony with the Renaissance atmosphere of which the game is imbued and a good dubbing in Italian, absolutely above the average. Final comment Beyond the all too obvious sinister commercial operation (release the game at the same time as the film and the official videogame of The Da Vinci Code, in order to exploit its ~trail~ and create some confusion among the most distracted videogamers ), The Secrets of Da Vinci is a discrete graphic adventure that remains on the typical coordinates of the reference genre but without any flaws whatsoever in the creation of puzzles, puzzles and objects to combine, all focused, and it could not be otherwise, on the invections and on Leonardo's creativity. Good audiovisual realization, multiple endings influenced by the morality index that we will have during the interactive experience, intriguing plot and faithful reconstruction of the Chteau du Close Luc, the last residence of Da Vinci. Between one enigma and another, we'll also do a bit of culture, in spite of those who consider videogames harmful... Pros Intriguing plot with multiple endings Good Audiovisual Realization Riddles, puzzles and combinations of objects without any flaws Cons Nothing particularly innovative Only for lovers of point and click There are various ways for a video game production to gain recognition from users: you can focus on a character, a testimonial, or acquire a license for a film or a television show. Or there is another way: take advantage of the current trend and confuse the players. And undoubtedly this was the logic that led Nobilis to release ~The Secrets of Da Vinci~ throughout Europe simultaneously with the film of ~The Da Vinci Code~ and the official transposition for PC and Console made by Take 2.
