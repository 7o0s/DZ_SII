It is in fact a world completely dominated by Sports Interactive and its Football Manager series, capable of leaving very little room for anyone who wants to compete with what has become the only real point of reference year after year. Even Electronic Arts knows it very well, which just a few weeks ago announced the end of its FIFA Manager series, hoisting the white flag against what, by the admission of lead designer Gerald Khler, is the game that has ~dominated the market in the last years~. Although small, however, there is always a glimmer of opportunity to try to do something, especially if you have a development team behind you with experience within the same genre, gained over the years in which PC Calcio could also be found on newsstands. After debuting the new FX Calcio six months ago, the Spanish of FX Interactive have decided to return to the fray with FX Calcio 2.0, a renewed version of the product with which they hope to be able to recover the fan base known during the moments of glory experienced in the late 90s. To do this, many new features, grown from a dialogue with the online community to improve a game which, as seen in our review, certainly deserved some additional work. So let's see what new football made in Spain tells us. FX Calcio 2.0 is the starting point we wish we'd seen six months ago A world apart Like the previous version of FX Calcio, this 2.0 also does not rely on the licenses of existing players, teams and competitions in the real world. The idea carried out by FX Interactive was therefore to try to make a virtue of necessity, creating a parallel universe within which to enhance the freedom offered by such a situation, not bound to the real world. From a purely content point of view, FX Calcio 2.0 brings with it over 11,000 players divided among 450 teams, involved in 27 national and international competitions, including those of the main European leagues. The evolution we were talking about above is guaranteed by the so-called Merits, a revised and expanded version of what in the previous version were the Pro-Cards: the performances of individual players allow them to dynamically develop real distinctive traits, in capable of influencing their assessment on the market and of making a renewed contribution to the fate of the eleven they belong to, both positively and negatively. According to FX Interactive, the Merits from which to draw are over 100, and also concern the coaches: for example, by often supporting the tournament finals you will earn a sort of fame as a Special One, thus further fueling the chances of seeing your team arrive bottom of the competition over the course of the following season. As far as the game modes are concerned, those that we have already got to know in the first FX Calcio remain: the main one, where you can choose the club to train among the many present in the various competitions, and the so-called Challenge mode, within the which to collect a team of minor category to hit the promotion or win an unexpected permanence in the series where it is to start the season. The absence of official licenses naturally renews the usefulness of the game editor, identified with the name of myTeam: through a simple click of the right mouse button, it is possible to modify the names of players and teams that make up the world of FX Calcio 2.0 , as well as logos and other information are fully editable for the joy of the community which can thus remedy the lack of Cristiano Ronaldo and company. In reality, it is easy to see how some traits and names of some players are perfectly attributable to the truly existing ones (who will this Callejo be in Naples?). Playing football The gaming experience offered by FX Calcio 2.0 naturally rests its foundations on the system already seen in its predecessor, expanding it. Like 6 months ago, it is possible to modify the tactics by indicating to the team the style of play to adopt, however this time emphasizing the pre-match relaxation: in fact, we find a predefined list of movements and mentalities to be adopted on the pitch during the match, between which ones to choose to get a bonus when you are in the field. For example, by dedicating one's attention to the pressing phase, it will be possible to make greater use of it than the attack on the flanks. The various options are selectable at the bottom of the screen as the match progresses via the 3D engine, similar to the pitchside 'shouts' seen in Football Manager. mWe will talk about this later, given that, returning to the game outside the green rectangle, we still have to point out greater attention to the part concerning corporate management, thanks to the possibility of choosing between the contracts offered by some sponsors to earn money. The proceeds can also be spent to expand your stadium, taking advantage of the various slots available to build elements relating to the medical, sports or entertainment spheres of the spectators. For example, it becomes possible to build a clinic where injured players can be treated immediately to reduce their recovery times, or to improve the grass drainage system to prevent players from getting hurt. To make it easier for those sitting in the stands to stay in the stadium, the stadium can instead be equipped with a parking lot or restaurant. Ticket price management can still be increased in a single solution, even if the system now makes a difference between the various sectors of the stadium, without however allowing for a single change. Moving on the market has become easier, thanks to the improved support of the scouts in the process of discovering new talents and the transfer system that has become more intuitive, even if in some cases it is possible to rediscover a certain difference between the declared economic claims of the player or company to which it belongs, and the real ones. In FX Calcio 2.0 there are no intermediate phases, so the ~continue~ of the game is nothing more than a jump to the next match on the calendar. Week after week we also receive updates on the market, practically perennial: in fact, it does not take place in 2 annual windows as in reality, perhaps making the purists turn up their noses a little, but marrying the idea of FX Interactive to give life to a world of its own. Presentation in Madrid On the occasion of the launch of FX Calcio 2.0, FX Interactive invited us to Madrid, where the Spanish company is based, and in particular to the splendid Santiago Bernabu stadium. The occasion was attended by Pablo de la Nuez, creative director, Fernando Morientes, ex-player and coach of the lower divisions of Real Madrid, and Alexis Martn, well-known Spanish sports commentator. Normally this kind of initiative takes place before the game is released in stores, to present the new features of the title and make the press aware of the progress made, but in this case the strategy is a bit different: the team considers its managerial a sort of ~work in progress~, a platform that will develop from year to year until the game designers' vision is realized in its entirety. A first approach to the world of tablets fits into this perspective, with FX Calcio 2.0 which natively supports Windows 8 even with touch controls, and the attempt to give the player the possibility of truly influencing the sporting growth of his athletes, making the database the beating heart of an ever-evolving experience that is never the same from one game to another. Components such as online modes will instead be the subject of future developments, progressing on two paths: that of improvements and additions already planned, then that of user feedback. What will not change, however, is FX Calcio's approach to a very narrow and at the same time super competitive panorama. Indeed, if it is true that there is a certain demand for football management and new opportunities are opening up with the departure of FIFA Manager, which is very strong especially in Germany, it is certainly not FX Interactive's intention to try to compete directly with Football Manager and the its ten-year dominance. For this reason, the title will remain sold year after year at a budget price, around twenty euros, through alternative distribution circuits to the usual videogame store. It will also continue to focus on a more sustainable model that does not aspire to collect licenses but gives the user complete freedom to modify the database. A method that has proved to be very effective in the past when it comes to developing solid and receptive communities. The same approach to the match, with the possibility of completing a season in a few hours or extending it for weeks depending on the level of detail and the skill with which one wants to carry out the task of manager, demonstrates the will not to address only the super passionate but also embrace young users and newcomers. The idea is to re-propose the strengths of the PC Calcio that it was - it is no coincidence that some team members are veterans of that adventure - making a new generation of virtual coaches passionate about the hard work done on the sidelines. An ambitious goal which, as can be guessed by reading the review, is still quite far from its realization, unfortunately.At the same time we hope that the Spanish company will succeed in its endeavor in the long run: fans deserve to relive the rivalries of the past, the entire genre would benefit. Flooded engine FX Calcio 2.0 brings back to our screens the 3D engine we have already known. The alternative is to skip directly to the end of the first half or to the end of the game, with the possibility of resorting to the new functionality offered by the so-called events: by clicking on the appropriate button, you can skip directly to the first salient event of the match, be it a goal or precisely the end of one of the two times. Before the end of the match, clicking on the events button will also signal when there are 20 minutes left to 90', thus giving us the opportunity to review our tactics for the final minutes. On balance, it is an appreciable middle ground between the complete game and the direct jump at the end already available, through which you can still try to have some effect on the team's performance during the match. To have complete control it is obviously recommended to play matches in the 3D engine, especially the important ones, implementing the fruits of the specific training sessions mentioned above: in fact, using a series of buttons, you can order the team to immediately press the ball carrier, or make the players perform certain movements. However, care must be taken not to abuse it, because time is limited to a base of 10 seconds, which can be extended through pre-match training. As far as the quality of the engine is concerned, the lack of a ~fast forward~ continues to be felt, but the worst problem is the too frequent presence of improbable actions, with open defenses in the centre, goals eaten into empty nets and inexplicable back passes of players thrown into the net, with consequent insults from those in front of the monitor. Final notes for the game interface, decidedly more intuitive and flowing than that of the first FX Calcio, and for the sound, composed of little more than the usual commentary entrusted to the Tecca-Altafini duo, easily replaceable by a soundtrack of your own taste.", "date": "2013-12-17", "grade": "6.0"}
