{"name": "Yes", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/yes-your-grace-recensione.html", "text": "We started fantasizing about this new game as soon as we learned its name. And Yes, Your Grace did not disappoint us, immediately proving to be a sui generis product, endowed with a mesmerizing charm, built around a gameplay that is as simple as it is enveloping, inextricably linked to a rich, elaborate setting capable of conquering right from the first, unforgettable steps. With the review of Yes, Your Grace we want to explain why it is one of the most interesting surprises of these first months of 2020. In reality, and the young developers of Brave at Night admit it, the main source of inspiration is the most recent masterpiece by Lucas Pope called Papers, Please. Here too we will have to make choices that will radically change the destinies of the different characters in the game, and which will consequently influence the future of our kingdom. An adventure that makes the user feel all the weight on his shoulders, all the responsibilities of a ruler who ended up with his back against the wall together with his family and his subjects. A daughter in exchange for soldiers Each turn of Yes, Your Grace is equivalent to a week of past time, and we will have around 40 available to be prepared for the inevitable battle. King Eryk's reign is not an idyllic place, perhaps it was in the past but now the decaying state of his castle is evident. But the situation in which it finds itself is far more serious: a shadow from the past is inexorably approaching the lands, bringing constant troubles and growing political instability. It all begins many years earlier, when Eryk and his wife find themselves in front of the blade of a criminal and his seductive witch. To save their lives, the two decide to make a promise: no bloodshed, but their eldest daughter, once she reaches maturity, will be given in marriage to the bastard. The years pass, until a letter arrives at the castle: the moment that the royal couple had tried to forget in the meantime has finally arrived and if the promise is not respected, a large army will reach the gates of the fortress to raze it to the ground. Yes, Your Grace starts here, and will go on between strategic choices, political opportunities and obligatory junctions; among these is having to marry the eldest daughter threatened to the son of a neighboring ruler in exchange for his support during the imminent attack. Everything seems to be going well until, during the wedding, something goes horribly wrong. Point, click and decide We don't want to tell you anything else, perhaps we have already revealed too much; any more detail would be disrespectful to you readers who have every right to experience this story in first person, without spoilers of any kind. Know that each turn will proceed in the same way: we start by receiving anyone who wants to speak with the king in the throne room, we proceed by moving our special units (generals, sorceresses, hunters...) on the map, and then moving to the different key locations of the castle by talking to the characters present and, in some phases, solving puzzles as in a sort of point-and-click adventure. Before the end of the turn, we will be able to spend gold and food resources to solve the internal problems of the castle, and send our carrier pigeon to the various nobles to invite them to the kingdom and propose any agreements to them. This is broadly the structure of Yes, Your Grace net of the various surprises that will be offered to us almost every turn. It goes without saying that we will hardly be able to satisfy every request from the people, or easily visit all the places that will require the intervention of our units; it is necessary to make difficult choices all the time, trying never to bring the gold reserves and resources at our disposal to zero, on pain of game over and reloading in the last round concluded without problems. Waiting for the siege All the choices made will have very important consequences, sometimes immediately and others only after a long time. Denying a loan to a miller with a crop destroyed by bad weather might seem like a trivial choice at first, but in such troubled times, sooner or later, any help will prove to be essential. We will have to deal with nobles looking for works of art, druids of the woods grappling with sacred oaks, swindlers, drunks, braggarts, spies; and we will be offered deals of all kinds, which we will be able to exploit to keep the castle's resources high or to appease the other kings to whom we can ask for help in case of need. King Eryk also has a family: a wise but concerned wife, and two other daughters in addition to the one granted in marriage, and each of these figures will often require the support of the head of the family, even for trivial reasons. The story will bealways the same, but the number of variables on which we will be able to decide is such that halfway through the adventure, just like it happened to us, you will want to start over to try to change choices and strategies. But starting over could even prove to be an obligation: even if it is not easy to find yourself in a dead end, the possibility exists. Real emotions What struck us most about Yes, Your Grace is the attachment that is created between us, our crowned alter ego and all the characters who will take turns on the scene. Over the course of the twelve hours it took to get to the end (which is quite a lot), we experienced a huge range of emotions: hate, love, suffering, and we felt lost, diabolical and infinitely stupid, to then throw our fists at the sky when things finally went right. Having reached the end credits, one cannot but think about why larger and above all richer software houses are no longer able to dare with experiences like this one proposed by the small, indeed very small, Brave At Night (there are only five of them). Yes, Your Grace is a perfectly packaged product, totally comfortable in its ~small~ size, but playing you can't help but think about what it would have been like if they had the chance to become what they can't afford to be today. As we like to repeat, today's little ones will become tomorrow's big ones, and this valiant group of English developers has all the credentials to grow hand in hand with the popularity of its games, if these of course continue to show off a similar quality. Also because it's not just the story, characters and writing that captivate Yes, Your Grace, but also the highly effective pixel art graphics, in addition to the splendid soundtrack which offers, among the various tracks present, also a couple of unforgettable sung songs, like the one that will welcome us every time we load the game.", "date": "2020-03-05", "grade": "8.8"}
