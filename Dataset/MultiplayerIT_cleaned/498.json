{"name": "Mondiali Fifa 2006", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mondiali-fifa-2006.html", "text": "Sior Lippi, look, I would play with a module devoted to attack, to make the most of the jewels we have before us...[continue] In perfect style of the renowned softco, the game starts from a nice big video with, in tow, the usual selection menu embellished with the usual cutting-edge music tracks. Fifa World Cup 2006 logically hinges on the international event, without however skimping on modalities aimed at variegating the player's experience. We therefore find, in addition to the possibility of playing the World Cup with one of the 32 teams admitted to the final round, the opportunity to relive the qualifications with one of the over 100 national teams present. Furthermore, the idea of re-proposing historical matches actually played by giving the player certain objectives to achieve is nice. Objectives that will in any case act as a common thread for each mode present and which, once completed, will give away precious points to unlock as many things as possible. There will be original boots and vintage shirts, as well as balls of all sorts and players who have made history among the gifts packaged by EA and purchasable only with the points donated by the missions. Entering the field, the impact with the home screens, mainly focused on the packed stadiums and the players grappling with entrances and anthems, leave you amazed by the care and feeling with the television counterpart. Certain shots really seem stolen from any football match. At kick-off we soon realize the choices made by the Canadian branch of the Californian major. A fast game, easy to assimilate, with rapid learning; this, in essence, is the realization of a precise project. Project that aims to invite everyone to the grand celebration of the world championship, even the least accustomed to the genre. The presence of default tactics alone speaks volumes, as does that loved/hated through ball, capable of literally deciding the fortunes of every football game. This is the circumstance in which it could really be done without, since, once the mechanism has been absorbed, this passage manages to almost always put the man in front of the goalkeeper. Other mechanisms, such as some cover systems, are less evident, but at the same time manage to work better. In this sense, the Japanese school seems to have played the role of mentor properly. A fast game, easy to assimilate, with rapid learning; this, in essence, is the realization of a precise project. ...I'd say a nice 4-3-1-2, but even a 3-4-1-2 could bring benefits to our beautiful national team. Listen to an ignoramus, sior Lippi, with two mastiffs in midfield we can dare two wingers who see the goal and a midfielder. In the context of the poorly calibrated mechanisms described, artificial intelligence also has a guilty conscience. Too often the opposing defense ends up in the air after a through ball, just as the goalkeepers are incapable of an exit worthy of the name. The same AI of the virtual coach does not shine for efficiency and imagination, but is limited to pre-calculated changes that do everything except follow the progress of the match. Even the physics of the ball certainly does not shine for realism. Without falling into the ridiculous, the ball sometimes seems affected by latent gravity, bouncing in a truly unnatural way as well as lacking in effective speed after a shot hurled at maximum power. For the rest, however, the creature of mother EA behaves really well. The animations of the players both in game and within the colorful cut scenes are good, as is the polygonal complexity of stadiums and players, most of the latter, however, really resembling their real counterparts. However, the real star of the entire production of the Canadian softco is the entire sound package. As already anticipated we will find numerous tracks extrapolated from the radio hits of the moment which, ranging for multiple genres, manage to embellish every single menu. Not happy we will be able to listen to the anthems of each of the national teams present, as long as they win at the end of a match. But the commentary is exaggeratedly well done, this time in the hands of the Caressa-Bergomi duo and able to seem really improvised on the spot. Always effective and punctual comments, reporters with high knowledge and without too many inhibitions the winning points of what is, presumably, the best commentary applied to a video game ever. Final curiosity: we logically succumbed to the flattery of simulating the World Cup for the Italian national team, arriving at the fateful clash with their all-time rival, Brazil, and beating them on penalties after a thrilling match. Too bad it was the final for the third and fourth posto Knock wood. Always effective and punctual comments, reporters with high knowledge and without too many inhibitions the winning points of what is, presumably, the best commentary applied to a video game ever. Comment Fifa world cup 2006 is a good game. It doesn't excel, mind you, but it's fun at the right point and engaging enough to be played for a good chunk of time. When the actual world championships begin, the ludic-sporting parallelism with the EA title will become almost imperative. The glitter and sequins with which the illustrious softco has adorned his newborn football title, rather than dazzling the player, involve him in a whirlwind of national anthems, excellent commentary, illustrious names of modern football and that of the almanac. In short, a party, just like a World Cup should be. It is clear that this golden blanket also serves to mask some defects, and the game, however enjoyable, accuses rather gross gaps on more than one occasion. The AI in general, especially that of the goalkeepers, as well as the lack of customizable tactics, relaunching even with that far too effective through ball, affect an artfully packaged game but which fails to excel even this time. Still recommended to all football fans who are already grinding their teeth in view of the upcoming World Cup. Pro Commentary realistic and effective. Immediate. Game modes present undoubtedly captivating. Really nice audio-visual sector. Against AI to be reviewed. Some poorly calibrated mechanisms lead to the goal nine times out of ten. Physics of the ball sometimes approximate. Minimum depth. The other versions The ~world~ edition of Fifa is also available for Xbox, Gamecube and Personal Computer. The differences between the various versions are minimal and all of a technical nature (obviously higher resolution on PC, cleaner graphics on Gamecube and Xbox) and therefore the game is perfectly usable on any platform in your possession. The football faith. Probably not even by exhuming the wittiest and most intelligent of the ancient Egyptians, or even by catapulting a superior alien race into this dimension, will we ever be able to decipher the codes that lead the fan, the one with a capital T to be clear, to live, breathe and even dream in function of Sunday afternoon. It is said Sunday afternoon more out of lazy and old-fashioned habit than anything else, as football is now played seven days a week. However, Monday morning would not taste the same without the beloved football. A bit like the first coffee of the working week, being able to approach the Inter player on duty and, with the smile that best suits a ravenous hyena, place your hand on his shoulder, well, it's really priceless. What has been written so far must be taken and amplified to the power in the year of the World Cup. Yes, that month, which happens every four years, able to make you review the national anthem and then be able to sing it at the top of your lungs together with the other fans of the pack. Aware of all this, the illustrious kids of Electronic Arts, always able to monetize any event capable of moving the masses, not even this time miss the opportunity to give us the world championships to play on our consoles.", "date": "2006-05-24", "grade": null}
