{"name": "Evil Twin", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/evil-twin.html", "text": "Originality? When a new title wants to face the competition of the historical platform representatives, it needs some weapons to its bow if it is to succeed in its intent. In recent years, only Conker (Nintendo 64) has succeeded, with his decidedly little ~politically correct~ savoir fair (peeing on enemies), and Banjo, with his adventure companion Kazooje (also Nintendo 64). What Evil Twin focuses on to succeed in its intent is mainly the story and the narration of the same: unlike what happens in fact in most platformers, in this case the narrative plot has a rather adult cut (imagine Nightmare Before Christmas ) and unfolds through numerous dialogues narrated with long cinematic sequences. The protagonist, Cyprien, a ten-year-old orphan, is in fact transported to a parallel world, where he will slowly (and rather reluctantly and ironically) assume the role of hero and liberator. To help Cyprien, there will be his ~bad~ part, that is his twin Evil, endowed with particular powers and with different weapons and potentials, in which the protagonist can transform himself at any moment of the game. What makes it rather pleasant, and particularly different from the other exponents of the Evil Twin genre, is, as mentioned before, the evolution of the plot and the amount of time you will spend talking with the various NPCs (non-player characters) that populate the game universe. The same will entrust you with the various quests that you will have to complete in the various maps, quests which in fact constitute the driving event of your wandering. The rules of the game and their strength If some of you have never had the opportunity to either see or try one of the many 3D platformers that have appeared on the market in recent years, I will try to explain what a title of this kind consists of. With the fixed third person view, we control the main character by observing him as he moves around the game's maps, collecting some particular objects (in this case two different types of objects: bear faces that show the way forward and evil twin faces that increase the protagonist's powers) and continuously jumping from one platform to another. This of course trying to avoid the enemies in the game and when necessary, to defeat them through fights. If we wanted to underline the characteristics of Evil Twin, i.e. those that make it typical of the genre but which constitute its originality, we should talk about some particular aspects. First of all the graphics engine, undoubtedly one of the strengths of the title, capable of recreating large but still detailed and rich in details game maps; the same graphic aspect of the title is undoubtedly above the average of what has appeared to date on PCs (but not on the latest generation consoles), even if the FPS count tends to go down in more complex situations. As for the structure of the levels, as complex as in any case consistent with the various settings that we find as we progress through the game, it too should be remembered as one of the positive elements of Evil Twin; even the quests, as mentioned, which are assigned to us by the various NPCs, contribute not only to creating a strong sense of continuity for the entire course of the game, but also do not allow the player to get bored in a short time. The rules of the game and their strength 8 A little leap into the void... After having spoken in an absolutely positive way of the graphic and narrative sector and of the background in general, it is really worth turning our attention to other aspects of the game, which are certainly not marginal but which partly represent its heart: and it is right here that Evil Twin falls rather badly, leaving a certain bitter aftertaste to those looking for the definitive platform. The camera system is in fact not very functional, very often sending Cyprien beyond the player's view, perhaps hidden by a tree, a house or something else. Unfortunately not even the possibility of changing the view, rotating it to the left or right at any time, helps the player, as on more than one occasion it is fixed or in any case not very customizable. It is clear that this represents a sort of ~tile~ on the head of the gamer, who often fails to calculate his movements and for this reason is overwhelmed by enemies or falls on deaf ears: even the enemies themselves certainly do not shine for an artifievolved bat, as they repeat their attacks ad infinitum, not varying them according to our game tactics but repeating them with little criterion. In the end, therefore, they do not represent any challenge for the player, who, when he is put in a position to be able to face them, manages to get rid of them in a short time and without much effort. Another flaw, of no small importance, is represented by the imperfect programming of the collimation system of the polygons: in other words, more than once you will think you are still on the edge of a platform but you will fall on deaf ears, or you will be convinced of hitting a enemy and you will fail. Ultimately, the real challenge for the player is to try to move around the maps without dying on the run from some badly calibrated jumps and not from clashes with enemies, and this is not something we would have liked to try. Conclusions. In the face of a respectable general form, the few flaws of Evil Twin unfortunately undermine the ~playability~ sector in a rather heavy way, relegating the title to a ~second~ choice for platform enthusiasts. But, wait. In fact, in the PC field Evil Twin represents the best of what has been seen to date, far superior to the same Croc 2 which last year fought to be the best exponent of the genre. Despite its structural defects, the game reviewed here still has characteristics such as to make it the only real alternative to the excessive power Console in this field, so much mistreated and little loved by PC users. In fact, it is no coincidence that Evil Twin was first designed for the Dreamcast, then for the PlayStation and finally for the PC. It is therefore impossible not to recommend the purchase of the title if your only gaming machine is a PC, as you will certainly find in Cyprien's features, and in those of his evil little brother, many stimuli to fall in love with a genre that you may never have wanted to consider: this also considered the future landscape, which offers practically no other platform title in the coming years. The only alternative, in this sense, is the Snes or Megadrive emulator, with which you can enjoy playing ~historical~ titles such as Super Mario World or Sonic: for further information, I refer you to Emuitalia. If, on the other hand, like me, you grew up on bread and Mario, Evil Twin's playability will be rather lacking: and it's a real shame, considering the heart that seems to have been put into the other parts by the Software House responsible for the game. And here is Evil Twin's real sin: in our eyes it seems that the programmers, absolutely brilliant and capable of recreating immersive atmospheres and a compelling story, have never picked up a console pad, or at least have failed to transmit this feeling to their creature. What can we say: it will be for the next Evil Twin. From console to PC. Historically, the platform genre, as well as that of two/three dimensional fighting games, has always brought to mind a console for every gamer. Even if some titles, among which it is worth remembering ~Titus The Fox~ and above all ~Gods~, met with moderate success on PCs in the nineties, the best exponents of the genre remained those linked to Nintendo, Sega, and in a minor (much minor) part Sony: Mario, Sonic and Crash have represented over the years real ~mascots~ of the respective aforementioned houses. Even when the genre underwent the radical change with the advent of the third dimension, all that happened was more transpositions to the PC, but no original projects made their appearance on compatible systems. Over the years, and the passing of videogame systems, no Software House decided to devote itself to a Plattform project exclusively dedicated to PCs (from last year we can only remember Croc2 and Eartworm Jim, two console transpositions), leaving enthusiasts dry mouth. Now it's the turn of Evil Twin: Cyprien's Chronicles, a title also designed for console platforms and only secondarily for the PC, and probably the time has come for gamers to stop envying their consular friends...
