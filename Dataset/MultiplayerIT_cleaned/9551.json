{"name": "Un sole splendente", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/83319-golden-sun-lalba-oscura-un-sole-splendente.html", "text": "Fans of the RPG genre who lived through the Game Boy Advance era will probably fondly remember the bilogy developed by Camelot Software Planning, already famous for the Shining Force series: in those days, Golden Sun was greeted with some enthusiasm both for the excellent technical realization and for some gameplay elements that were a breath of fresh air for the genre. The first episode however was almost an experiment, the beauty came with the sequel: The Lost Era extended the best features of the prequel and despite some imperfections it was easily classified as one of the best titles of that period. The epilogue hinted that the story didn't end there: for years there were rumors of a third chapter in the pipeline, first for Game Cube, then for Wii, finally during E3 2009 Nintendo announced with great fanfare Dark Dawn for his portable console. Almost ten years later, therefore, Camelot finds itself challenging giants like Square Enix on their own field: who will win this challenge? A new dawn for Weyard The premise of Golden Sun: Dark Dawn is quite original. Thirty years have passed since Isaac and co. summoned the Golden Sun and saved the world. However their actions were not only positive: the power of the Golden Sun has in fact triggered a series of profound geological and biological transformations. Isaac, Garet and the others, now adults, undertake to study the effects of the Golden Sun in an attempt to reverse them, while training their children in the use of their psinergic powers. The story begins just when Terry, son of Garet, combines one of his mistakes, ruining an instrument of Isaac: the latter will take the opportunity to send his son Matthew, Terry and Karis, daughter of Ivan, on a training trip in order to recover the materials needed to repair it. It goes without saying that this adventure will become much more important for our new heroes. Camelot remedies the most criticized aspect of the two prequels: the characterization of the characters and the complexity of the story. The new protagonists are in fact extremely pleasant and interesting, while the plot reserves some unexpected twists. However, L'Alba Oscura inherits the somewhat verbose script of its predecessors: often the dialogues (completely in Italian) tend to be excessively long and redundant, dampening the pace of the adventure a bit, also due to the insistent presence of moments in which the player is called to comment on the conversation with a precise emotional state, a pause that adds nothing and only modifies the response we will receive before the story continues. Those who have already played the prequels will find numerous characters, quotes and places from the previous adventures in L'Alba Oscura, but newbies should not be discouraged: Camelot has in fact had the good sense to insert a sort of encyclopedia that explains events in detail , places and characters of the original bilogy. Djinns for everyone Golden Sun: Dark Dawn maintains the excellent structure of the prequels with very minimal variations. The game is still a classic-style JRPG that develops in a fairly traditional way between villages in which to interact with the numerous NPCs and labyrinths in which to face enemies in the typical random fights, fortunately not too frequent, and to solve intelligent environmental puzzles thanks to the ~psinergy~ of the characters. The puzzles proposed in the dungeons are the real highlight of the game and, just like with the prequels, manage to keep the experience fresh and interesting. The player must exploit the psinergies of the group in a creative and intelligent way: to reach a platform it will be necessary, for example, to grow a creeper to use as a handhold or move a step with telekinesis. These same ~spells~ can be used in combat and each character's repertoire expands thanks to the influence of the Djinn. The mystical creatures that in 2001 mocked the pokmon are back with great pomp with a function that makes the combat system decidedly unique and original: the Djinn to find are seventy-two and can be ~placed~ on the characters to change their attributes and the psinergies usable during fights. The placed Djinn can also be unleashed to hit enemies or strengthen the party, then becoming a sort of ~resource~ that determines the type of summoning that the characters can perform, truly devastating and extremely spectacular spells. The system appears not very intuitive during the first hours of the game but once assimilated it allows an excellent variety and freedom of customization of the characters and their abilities, a feature that makes the gameplay of Golden Sun: Dark Dawn less trivial than it may seem. The 3D of Camelot Golden Sun and Golden Sun: The Lost Age stood out at the time for the impressive technical quality that clearly detached them from the rest of contemporary productions for Game Boy Advance. The excellent soundtrack by Motoi Sakuraba also returns on this occasion and reconfirms itself as a splendid accompaniment for every situation offered by the game, offering a varied and never banal repertoire of tracks, which fans of the series will recognize immediately. As for the graphic design, the matter is a little more complex: the 2D rendered of the prequels was a small technical masterpiece ten years ago, but in 2010 the choice of Camelot almost obviously fell on a more predictable three-dimensional engine. For the avoidance of doubt, the 3D of Golden Sun: Dark Dawn is absolutely excellent. From a technical point of view, the new Golden Sun is undoubtedly one of the best productions for Nintendo DS and not only thanks to the fluid and well-modelled 3D, but also for the attention to detail and color choices, which embellish any setting or creature. The Dark Dawn, needless to say, technically excels during the fights, in which the super-deformed models of the characters are abandoned to show more ~realistic~ and dynamic clashes, enriched by spectacular animations and pyrotechnic visual effects, especially during the aforementioned summons , at times exaggeratedly long and complex. The only flaw is found in the creation of the interface, in particular of the menu and inventory, whose management is decidedly not very intuitive and too cumbersome.", "date": "2010-12-23", "grade": "8.6"}
