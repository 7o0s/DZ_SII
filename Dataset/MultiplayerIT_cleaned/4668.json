{"name": "McPixel 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mcpixel-3-recensione.html", "text": "The first McPixel was released in the now distant 2012. It was very popular for its crazy gameplay, the many quotes of which the levels were full, the pixel art graphics and for an innate sympathy of the character, who managed to transform tragedies into jokes, in his frantic quest to become a hero, moving from one situation to another seamlessly. Will he be able to do it in 2022? To find out, you just have to read the review of McPixel 2, the highly anticipated sequel that took more than ten years to wait... What do you think? Is this the McPixel 3 review? What happened to the second chapter? To find out, all you have to do is play. Game mechanics Could a mention of The Witcher 3 be missing in McPixel 3? McPixel 3 is ostensibly a point-and-click adventure where you simply interact with hot spots and then see what happens. It is made up of several chapters, each of which is divided into several levels, for a total of a hundred, all with their own common thread, sometimes very weak, other times stronger. The goal of each level is to save the day, whether that means stopping a train from falling off a destroyed bridge or cheating to win a chess game. As already mentioned, McPixel wants to become a hero and will do anything to achieve it. Steve also wants to be a hero. Who is Steve? A character that pops up here and there and unlocks special levels. Among his powers stand out the ability to create giant lemon spiders using a pentagram and to fish for military using a submachine gun as bait. But let's forget Steve and go back to McPixel. Our wanders the city unlocking levels with coins earned during his adventures. The city is strictly 2D and develops along a horizontal line, but it's full of people to kick, wonderful machines hidden in parks or hotels, musicians to kick and couples to kick. After all, becoming a hero is not as easy as it seems and some shoes have to be worn out. Some trolls just want to laugh The typical scenario offered by McPixel's levels is: something is happening, often dramatic, whether it's a burning plane about to crash on a small tropical island or McPixel's bladder is bursting forcing him to urinate on an old man's car resentful, and from there you have to interact with objects to see the effect it has... literally. It's a kind of WarioWare of graphic adventures, but even crazier because it is decidedly more ruthless in its ability to make anything happen to the characters. Each level can be finished with multiple attempts or even on the first try. It matters little. Missing interactions can be viewed later (100% completion is not essential to get to the game's ending); the important thing is to save the day in each level of each chapter and accumulate coins to unlock the next chapters. What is McPixel 3? McPixel 3 also becomes a scrolling fighting game, without ever taking itself seriously McPixel 3 is about kicking people in the testicles for the hell of it. It's grabbing a cup and pulling your pants down in worldwide broadcast. It's defusing bombs or eating bombs or defusing them by eating them. It's fighting against criminals, against dragons or against Uncle Scrooge style cash deposits with the Devolver Digital logo placed on them. It's playing cards in a bar while risking the apocalypse, or finding Steve inside a parachute bag. It's about traveling through space sending kisses to alien bosses to distract them. It is becoming a microorganism and escaping from the primordial soup to the sound of farts to give birth to mankind. It's to celebrate a monolith in the shape of a Game Boy that teaches how to escape from a giant boar. It's beating up a US presidential candidate who looks like Donald Trump to win the election. It's having sex with the CEO of a company while the building you're in is about to blow up. In short, playing McPixel 3 is like lifting the curtain on the concept of interaction and its completely illusory nature, as indeed happened with its predecessor. In its kaleidoscopic succession of absurd sketches, produced by the apparent choices of the player, who in reality is denied any logical connection, given that he will never be able to say what will happen by kicking a door, interacting with a spider or grabbing a shovel, he still manages to produce a playful plot, however surreal and without apparent narrative connections. It is a game that tells stories, without claiming to tell anything. It is pure comedy of the absurd, a play that Monthy Python could have written if they had knownprogramming, in which pixel art takes on an essentially caricatured function. The important thing, however, is that McPixel 3 responds brilliantly to the question we asked ourselves at the beginning of the article: what happened to McPixel 2?
