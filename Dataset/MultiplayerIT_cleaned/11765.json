{"name": "Kane & Lynch: Dead Men", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/kane-lynch-dead-men.html", "text": "As in the console counterpart, Kane & Lynch: Dead Men puts the user in the shoes of such gentlemen, respectively an unscrupulous hitman and a murderer stuffed with psychotropic drugs: together, the two will have to carry out a majestic robbery, not before having faced a series of internships peppered with two-dimensional shootings. Nothing particularly new under the sun, except that the protagonists move around the screen simultaneously, with the player having the option to control one or the other at will. In reality, the lion's share is carried out by Kane, who has the task of moving, jumping, crouching and shooting, all actions that Lynch limits himself to repeating guided by the AI: by pressing the # key, however, the user can exploit the latter's ability to use a sniper rifle to hit enemies, cameras and anything else otherwise unreachable by Kane's fire. A mechanic that differentiates the Kiloo title from the chaos of similar products, but which does not particularly contribute to its playful value: switching to Lynch's commands is in fact a sort of obligatory passage that is required every now and then within a stage, and not a real free choice left to the player. Not only that, the presence of the second character on the screen often proves to be more of an impediment than an added value: it often happens that you have to face hordes of enemies alone or not be able to continue because Lynch got ~stuck~ on a ladder or any element of the scenario. Beyond this, however, Kane & Lynch: Dead Men proves to be an action game without a great personality: you run, shoot and press a few buttons, in a level design that certainly cannot be defined as revolutionary. Even the graphic realization of the product is nothing special, on the contrary, in relation to other recent titles (primarily the Gameloft works), the work done by Kiloo from a cosmetic point of view appears rather mediocre. The animations are in fact woody, the sprites poorly defined and the backdrops characterized by dull colors and a relative dearth of details. Reverse speech as regards the sound, strangely well done and which constantly accompanies the player's progress. PRO Quite funny Good quality sound AGAINST Some poorly implemented features Graphically Spartan Uninspired level design", "date": "2007-12-05", "grade": "S.V."}
