Some may be shaking their heads but it is a path from which - some more, some less - we have all passed. The horror genre is the most fertile ground for exorcising deep-rooted ancestral fears, but there are not many titles designed to enhance a single state of mind and build an entire experience around it. Nippon Ichi tried it with Yomawari: Night Alone, survival horror lived from the perspective of a little girl. Born from an idea of the Japanese developer Yu Mizokami, the game tries to take us back in time and make us relive the anxieties born at an early age, when it happened to slip under the covers at breakneck speed in fear of being overwhelmed by dark presences nestled in the darkness. Mizokami is not new to giving birth to curious ideas, just think of the unpronounceable htoL#NiQ: The Firefly Diary - 2D puzzle adventure launched in Japan in 2014 and arrived here last spring - also described from a girl's perspective. The European release of Yomawari: Night Alone is scheduled for October 28 on PC and PlayStation Vita, let's try to better understand what it is. Yomawari: Night Alone tests those who have a phobia of the dark Presences shrouded in darkness The story of Yomawari: Night Alone begins without many preambles, while a little girl whose name we ignore is walking her own dog Poro. The streets of the city seem deserted and quiet, but when the little girl decides to throw a stone, it only takes an instant for the pet to be brutally run over by a van that appears out of nowhere. As soon as the image of Poro becomes clear again there is no trace, but a copious bloodstain does not bode well; the girl returns home empty-handed and after telling her older sister what happened, the latter decides to go out to look for the dog and bring it home, advising the little girl not to venture outside for any reason. As often happens when bans are placed on a child, the young woman decides to venture out into the city anyway at nightfall. The streets appear sinister, something threatening is looming and the heartbeat of the protagonist becomes more intense. It makes you want to escape. After meeting her sister again near a park, the latter tells her to hide and close her eyes; once the sinister noises are over, the little girl finds herself alone again, at the mercy of the night and increasingly distressing threats. Despite the description, Yomawari starts abruptly, without giving too many indications on what to do or where to go. Factors such as exploration, search for objects and escape are immediately clear to the player, who however must begin to orient himself in hostile scenarios with limited points of reference. The map is revealed in real time during research activities, in the manner of metroidvania: it is necessary to sift through each area one step after another, so as to reveal ever larger portions and move with relative ease. Branched and interconnected, the city streets contrast with more isolated places, immersed in fields or woods. The entities are sneaky, they can't be faced and they appear suddenly, forcing the protagonist to frantic escapes. The game system is regulated by two indicators: on the one hand the increase in heart rate, thanks to which it is possible to perceive the proximity of the threats, on the other the stamina bar, by means of which all you have to do is accelerate the step at the right moments and get as far away as possible from the dangers lurking nearby. In the first part of the adventure a very particular atmosphere is created, dominated by the sense of imperative and the desire to escape. The game uses various tricks, for example the fact of seeing the dangers only at times but constantly perceiving their proximity. In some situations, the lack of visibility takes on concrete connotations, such as when the view is obstructed by objects present in the scenario. Other times it happens to be suddenly wrapped in cobwebs which, by modifying the game screen, decrease visibility and increase the feeling of oppression. PSVita trophies Yomawari: Night Alone offers 28 Trophies, some based on story completion, others related to collectible items or specific actions performed during the game. Deduction and escape Based on ~trial and error~ mechanisms, Yomawari: Night Alone requires the player to learn the paths and location of dangers. Incorrect assessments are always lurking and lead to certain death, since it is enough to receive a single blow to place fend to the game. In other words, the threats scattered around the playing area are simply outflanked or evaded and can never be fought with weapons or other defense objects. If necessary, it is possible to distract the enemies by throwing stones or turning on the lights, but you can also try to go unnoticed by hiding in the bushes or turning off the torch that the girl always carries with her. The presence of save points facilitates the task but requires attention to be exploited correctly. The coins located in several parts of the scenario can be collected and brought near the Jizo statues, safe places where it is possible to make a quick rescue in exchange for an offer. After unlocking new destinations and expanding your knowledge of the map, you also have the opportunity to opt for rapid movement to the other already discovered altars and avoid covering too long routes or crossing already known areas. The continuation of the story is marked by activities of a deductive nature which concern the recovery of key objects and the understanding of the place to go to in order to identify the next clues. For example, it is important to read the signs in some areas of the map, recover keys to unlock doors and so on, but there are also some collectible objects. Yomawari: Night Alone is a particular horror experience also from a sound point of view: the background music has been deliberately left aside to favor silence or ambient noises, dominated by the echo of crickets in the distance. The effectiveness experienced in the first part of the experience lends itself to criticism in the continuation of the adventure. The interaction remains very limited but it is above all the linearity of the gameplay that plays an unfavorable role, without proposing a concrete evolution of the protagonist. On the narrative level, the story proceeds in the absence of dialogue and the text parts are reserved for written messages or simple reflections of the child. Moreover, the presence of only the English language does not create particular difficulties of understanding and it is sufficient to have basic knowledge to orient oneself without difficulty.", "date": "2016-10-19", "grade": "7.0"}
