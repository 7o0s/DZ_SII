{"name": "Ghiaccio bollente", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/93642-nhl-12-ghiaccio-bollente.html", "text": "Tested version: Xbox 360After the dark period of the 2005 lock-out, the NHL is experiencing a new period of great success in recent years and with it also its virtual counterpart developed by EA Canada which has been proving to be one of the best sports simulations made by the US giant. The already excellent NHL 11 had been marginally hit by criticisms about the low weight of the innovations made compared to the previous version, a defect common to most of the sports serializations but justified when, as in the case of this brand, you have in your hands a product that for some years has been bordering on simulative perfection. It is therefore difficult to offer a package of full-bodied novelties without ruining a mechanism that has already been widely tested and appreciated by fans, yet despite this, with NHL 12 we find ourselves having an impressive offer both from a quantitative and qualitative point of view going to add and refine a multiplicity of aspects that in the past have represented historical limits to the series. Choose your destiny As soon as the game is launched, you are immediately catapulted onto the frozen rink to play one of the most particular events of the entire NHL offer: the Winter Classic, a match reminiscent of past times played with vintage jerseys and outdoors in the famous Heinz Field stadium under a 'intense and spectacular snowfall. Here the game is significantly slowed down to simulate adverse weather conditions and lends itself particularly well to acting as an interactive presentation to the deep mechanics of the gameplay. Once in the menus the first thing that catches the eye is the variety of game modes and customization options. In addition to the inevitable career where it is possible to pursue the dream of taking one's team to the league playoffs and perhaps to conquer the cumbersome and desired Stanley Cup, there are other by now very famous Be a Pro, Be a Legend and Be a GM. Playing in Be a Pro it is possible to forge one of our skaters from scratch and follow his career since the dawn of the minor leagues such as the Canadian Hockey League in the hope of being noticed and hired by an NHL talent scout. In this mode, you will always and only have control of your avatar with matches necessarily set to regulation time of 20 minutes per time, logically being players at the beginning of their career it is inevitable having to settle, especially in the first matches, to make a lot of bench work for this the possibility of fast forwarding or even simulating the minutes of play that we do not spend on the pitch comes in handy so as to make the apprenticeship of our digital alter ego less boring. Every victory and good performance give us points that we can spend to unlock many extras and a good way to maximize the points haul is to satisfy the directives of our coach who, based on the outcome of the matches, will tell us how he wants us and the team to perform on the pitch. One of the most interesting unlockable prizes, as well as difficult to obtain, is undoubtedly given by obtaining nine legends from the history of the NHL who are made possible to impersonate in the Be a Legend mode. Big names are Ray Bourque (available right from the start), Chris Chelios, Steve Yzerman, Patrick Roy, Jeremy Roenick, Gordie Howe, Mario Lemieux, Brje Salming and the legendary Wayne Gretzky, all featuring custom animations, these great athletes are obtainable by fulfilling certain related challenges called milestones. Unfortunately, unlike what happened with Michael Jordan in 2K's last NBA, here it is not possible to retrace the careers of these nine historical players, but it is possible to use them only in today's teams, which is certainly interesting given the their exceptional statistics, but a bitter taste remains for a mode, Be a Legend, which might have deserved more depth. To complete the ~Be a~ triptych there is the opportunity to manage the team from the bench thanks to Be a GM where, in addition to some management aspects, the emphasis is placed on the hard work of the coach as regards the directives to be given to the players on the field, an excellent managerial declination for those who want to take a break from pushing on the barriers and from the hard-fought fights for the puck. Cross the clubs If from the point of view of the game modes there is really a lot of irons on the fire, it was much more difficult for the developers to be able to refine the mechanics that already the previous year could boast a level of almost excellence. In this respect too, progress has been made and it is not all that marginali as one might expect, the most substantial evolution has been the physics engine now called Full Contact Physics Engine capable of calculating more precisely the collisions of the puck and the players so as to give the game a sense of physicality and realism never seen before, especially in scrums and in the very frequent deflections of shots on goal. This evolution is easily seen in the way the puck and players glide on the ice, with less inertia, which in the past gave the impression that the elements were almost ~flying~ above the frozen surface. Finally, that sense of magnetism of the puck with the player in possession has also been lost, in fact if we were to load the shot too much we will inexorably see the puck slipping away from the player, this, combined with the all-analog control via the two sticks, significantly increases realism even if it certainly requires a period of adaptation to these new gameplay variables. The gameplay of the NHL series has always been rather complex, especially for us Italians, given the lack of familiarity we have with this singular sport, which leads the learning curve to be rather steep and for the less accustomed to hockey already the level of normal difficulty can present more than a few embarrassments, when instead at a rookie level (equivalent to easy) the gameplay is mortified by a particularly wait-and-see and awkward AI. It is precisely the artificial intelligence of the opponent and of the teammates the other important evolution present in NHL 12 which under the banner of Anticipation AI shows off more credible behaviors especially as regards the participation of the teammates in the action which they now finally cover with greater decision the neutral zone of the track, they do their utmost to intercept opponents' passes and participate in a more choral manner in the actions led by the player, also thanks to improved management of the attack and defense lines. The behavior of the goalkeepers deserves a separate discussion: forget the static figures of past editions, now the goalkeeper does not hesitate to move away from the goal and play ahead of the attackers or to support the defense, moreover today they seem to have been reduced to a minimum those situations in which scoring became extremely easy, perhaps from certain parts of the field and with the goalkeeper covered, given that he occupies the goal with greater awareness and the new animations give a sense of realism to each save made. Xbox 360 goals Given the variety of game modes, to reach the loot full of 1000G every aspiring skater will have to sweat the proverbial seven shirts, doing their utmost in particular in Be a Pro and Be a Legend to be able to unlock each prize and milestone. The rest of the achievements are intended for online multiplayer gameplay. A creepy simulation In addition to the chisel work that has led to the refinement of game mechanics in this year's NHL, there are other ancillary contents such as the Ultimate Hockey League which consists of a sort of fantasy hockey where it is possible to create the team of our dreams through cards depicting the players that can be unlocked by spending points in the game (or by paying them with real money or microsoft points), the teams created by the players can then be used to play online and you are even able to face against the customized teams of other players even offline Once the data has been downloaded to the console thanks to EAUHL 24/7. From a more technical point of view, the game has a cosmetic rather similar to that of the previous episode, with a general improvement more in the details than on the general aspect, an excellent job has been done on the animations, in particular the personalized ones of the most famous players and goalkeepers, thanks also to the more refined physics, now the players react more naturally to clashes and in situations such as fights at the barriers, unbreakable with the hardest shots. It is even possible to be able to throw an opponent over the barriers with the consequent reaction of the benches and the fans who get warm and agitated when the salient actions take place right before their eyes and there are other small pearls such as helmets that fly away in following a tough fight while the fights between two players are ~regulated~ by an ad hoc control scheme that allows you to manage punches, parries and tugs almost like in a first person fighting game (there are also energy bars), of course every punch is punished with an expulsion but the sensation of emerging victorious from the fight is priceless. NHL 12 is also enhanced by the presence ofteams from other leagues such as the Swiss National League, the German DEL, the Finnish SM-Liga, the Swedish Elitserien and the Czech Republic's Extraliga, as well as numerous national teams including Italy, with statistics but rather mediocre. The audio sector is dominated by rock and metal pieces that go well with the speed and violence of this sport while the commentary (exclusively in English, the Italian localization of the texts is also completely absent) is once again entrusted to the tested couple Gary Thorne and Bill Clemente. The game also boasts an excellent replay system whose direction is manageable by the player so as to create movies that can be saved on the hard disk and shared online on EA servers.", "date": "2011-09-27", "grade": "8.9"}
