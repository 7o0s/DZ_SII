{"name": "NHL Rivals 2004", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nhl-rivals-2004.html", "text": "~Ice, ice, baby...~ The new version of hockey according to Microsoft provides us with a mode in which it is possible to replay the matches that have made the history of this sport, perhaps changing the results; a bit as if Italy-Brazil from 1970 could be replayed in Fifa or PES or if Lazio-Inter from the now well-known 5 May could be replayed for the Interisti... But obviously this is not the fulcrum of the game. In fact, as in any self-respecting sports title, in addition to the single player mode, there is also the multiplayer mode and the inevitable championship mode. Superfluous, but necessary, to remember that in the latter mode it is possible to play an entire season with all the official teams in turn complete with all the updated and updatable squads thanks to the now inevitable help of Xbox Live. In fact, thanks to the broadband connection it will be possible to download the official statistics of the players and other contents that have not yet been revealed and new stadiums or new uniforms cannot be excluded. Returning to the offline game, it must be said that one is immediately struck by the good musical accompaniment of the menus, very light American pop and rock, but which helps to enter the atmosphere of a title which, it should be said immediately, has no simulative ambitions, although leaving initially well impressed in terms of graphics. To tell the truth, the good impressions offered by the graphic sector mainly concern the beginning of the match, a phase in which one can best appreciate the good construction of the arenas, complete with a completely three-dimensional audience who cheers, applauds and stands up at the entry of the teams into the field. The reconstruction of the players is also very accurate, completely similar to the real counterparts, even in the facial features. NHL Rivals 2004 was born with the idea of being a fun and fast game, but pays dearly for this feature with a playability undermined by an excessive approximation of the tactical sector which, if on the one hand it shows good movements of the players on the field, from the other nullifies the effects due to the excessive simplicity with which it is possible to interrupt the game action with physical confrontation. Without going into excessive technicalities, it is appropriate to say that NHL Rivals in single player offers very few ideas to be played and even playing in two after a short time you get tired due to the excessive repetitiveness of the game dynamics. On the net... not the disc, but on Xbox Live! We mentioned earlier the content downloadable from Xbox Live, but obviously Microsoft's hockey does not shy away from giving us intense challenges with Internet users scattered around the network. It is, as always, possible to send or receive invitations for the various challenges which are basically divided into three modalities. In the first it is possible to start a quick game without specifying anything about the modalities of the same, in short, just to tinker a bit; in the second option it is possible to choose the mode of the game that you are going to face, while in the third you can create a game to play both one-on-one and five-on-five. It is clear that, as often happens in multiplayer sessions, the more the merrier, even if too often, unless you compete with expert players, the challenges are decidedly chaotic and very similar to large piles. Probably a greater care of the simulation aspect would have also benefited the online sessions, where the limitations of the gameplay inevitably come to the surface. In other productions, which today represent the benchmark of the genre, a slower game speed was chosen, an approach that is fundamental in our opinion to give players the opportunity to create more spectacular actions and bring the game rhythms closer to those of a real match. After what has been said, it is understandable that even the good graphics of Microsoft's work, the good audio sector and the good fluidity of the game sessions, both offline and online, the latter characterized by negligible lag phenomena, are not enough to keep the game on satisfactory levels. Once again we are faced with a production that, as too often happens in sports titles, above all shows off many licenses and only a few rare moments of fun due to an excessive flatness of the gameplay. Try again, you will be luckier! The technical realization of NHL Rivals 2004, while not exceptional, is still good: in fact, the stadiums are beautiful, the players' construction is satisfactory and the quality of the textures that recreate the jerseys of the various teams is average. The animations are also well doneof the athletes, but little appreciable due to the excessive frenzy of the game actions. On the other hand, the creation of the public who applauds and encourages the teams in a dynamic way with respect to the situations that arise during the match is splendid. We have already talked about the music: very light American rock that marries perfectly with the arcade ambitions of the Microsoft title, a game that, as you may have guessed, clearly loses the clash with the competition, especially if we are talking about EA sport or Sega productions. A pity, also because the good support of Xbox live could raise the title to levels much more suited to the sports series of the Silicon Valley softco. In fact, however, even in this area the frivolous playability of NHL Rivals heavily undermines a gameplay, which if it already appeared shallow in the premises, in fact appears flat and smooth like the field on which the athletes skate. Comment NHL Rivals 2004 is a game that will hardly be able to bring newcomers to the genre to this sport. In fact, you soon get tired of playing due to a gameplay characterized by an excessive repetitiveness of the dynamics that regulate it. The technical aspect is good, but below the potential of the hardware it runs on and of the sports series it belongs to (see Links 2004 or Top Spin). We could therefore say that the whole game lives up to the catchy, but very light ~rocket~ that makes up the soundtrack. In short, we are faced with the demonstration that even if a game appears technically valid, the lack of depth and the absence of that aura of magic that should cling to the polygons of every game, represent too high a deficit to fill, even with the presence of good Live support. A quite enjoyable title for those who don't expect to play with a hockey simulation, avoidable for others. Pros: Easy and immediate like the soundtrack Stats, logos, commentary, etc. Good live support... Cons: Little gameplay depth Too flat and boring Let's face it right away, hockey is certainly not a famous sport here in Italy, yet from a gaming point of view it has always achieved some success. Thanks to a background that sees appearances of this discipline since the days of C-64, but also thanks to the spectacularity that hockey simulations have acquired in recent years, thanks to the advent of 3D graphics and in many cases to the emphasis on the ~violent~ of this sport: for the uninitiated, physical fights and brawls on the pitch are an integral part of many matches. As expected, even NHL Rivals 2004 does not abstain from showcasing these aspects which are in any case part of the folklore of a sport that remains above all: technique, competitive spirit, entertainment and lots and lots of ice.", "date": "2004-03-09", "grade": null}
