The first tie-in dedicated to ~The Chronicles of Narnia~ was a sort of action game with puzzle elements, whose structure was based on the control of four different characters (the Pevensie brothers, in fact), with the possibility of switching from one to another with the push of a button. Peter was a reference in terms of physical strength and combat skills, Susan had a bow and therefore could hit enemies from a distance, Edmund boasted the ability to climb everywhere and little Susie, finally, could take advantage of her stature to reach areas inaccessible to others. In this second episode, the group concept is still at the center of attention, but the developers have thought of adding a little variety, greatly increasing the number of characters we can control (from four to twenty) but above all their typology: beyond the four brothers, in fact, we will be able to lead the most varied creatures: minotaurs, centaurs, dwarves, elves, enormous birds and very strong giants, to name just a few. This novelty is ~slammed in the player's face~ already in the early stages, in which some of the battles fought during the thirteen centuries that saw Narnia left ~unguarded~ by Aslan and the Pevensie are told: we will find ourselves controlling a team formed by a mighty minotaur, a centaur, an elf and a dwarf, defending a multi-level stronghold. The location is stormed by enemies, who come from all directions, and you have to move around its various areas to start a series of missions of different types: under the command of strong giants, we will have to destroy the catapults of the enemy army, pilot attack emplacements against opposing ships and recover important items. With the arrival of Peter and his brothers, starting from the second stage, the action slows down sharply and then resumes at full speed until the last bars, in a journey that unfortunately doesn't last more than six or seven hours. The group concept is still at the center of attention, but the developers have thought of adding a little variety, greatly increasing the number of characters we can control. The controls on Wii Given the characteristics of The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian, it is clear that the game control system could not make revolutions to what was already seen in the tie-in of the first episode. On balance, we are faced with a classic setting, to which only a few functions have been added through the movement of the Wii-mote (the launch of objects, mainly), while situations more congenial to the Nintendo console controllers have been beautifully ignored: the ~minigames~ that regulate the opening of the boxes, the movement of objects and the activation of particular switches must be completed by simply repeatedly pressing the trigger B, or even involving the analog stick of the Nunchuck, whose function the main one remains to move the characters. Each of them has a ~light~ and a ~heavy~ attack assigned respectively to the A button and the B trigger, while objects must be grabbed with a press of the d-pad and attacks can be parried by holding down the Z button The C button activates peculiar abilities (for example, the dwarf thus launches his grappling hook), while to switch from one character to another one must approach the ~destination~ and press the ~-~ key on the Wii-mote. Finally, the ~+~ key gives us an overview of the objectives achieved and those still to be achieved for the current stage. As mentioned, each character has different abilities, which are felt especially in battle, and have a single energy bar, which can be topped up by collecting the hearts that spring from eliminated enemies. Unfortunately, Prince Caspian's combat system leaves much to be desired, with the classic ~slippery~ feeling that occurs when the impact of weapons is not enhanced in any way, not even from a sound point of view. This is already noticeable during the clash with the simple soldiers, but it is really evident when the ~commanders~ take the field, enemies that are stronger and more resistant than the average. Technical realization Before the release of the game, the developers insisted on showing the extent of the battles that take place on the screen, and that even on Wii they see the involvement of dozens and dozens of warriors. Unfortunately, a careful look reveals the ~predetermined~ nature of these clashes, which are consumed indefinitely and even ~regenerate~ when we find ourselves visiting an area that perhaps we had previously completely cleanedfrom enemies. It must be said that the ~weight~ of so much action is not felt on the shoulders of the graphics engine, which has its uncertainties and approximations, but still manages to do its duty in a more than discreet way, especially if we think to the technical caliber of most cross-platform titles in the Wii version. The animation of the characters, of the Pevensie brothers in particular, is one of the strengths of the game, while the quality of the locations is decent but nothing more. From this point of view, the presence of a fixed and non-adjustable view appears to be an ideal choice if you don't want to show the limits of polygonal structures, even if it must be said that there are plenty of interactable objects and you never find yourself facing desolate landscapes. Too bad for the cutscenes: those taken directly from the film are nice but short, while the pre-calculated ones use polygonal models that are anything but sophisticated. The sound is average, accompanies the action without disturbing but almost never helps to revive it. The only multiplayer mode present is offline, as in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: two players can cooperate but sharing the same view, without split screens or other solutions that can guarantee greater freedom of movement. Comment The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian is presented as a fairly well-made tie-in, aimed at an audience of young and very young people rather than experienced gamers. The latter will find themselves faced with an action that is almost always devoid of bite, mounted on a linear structure, which follows what has already been done with the transposition of the first film but without adding elements of particular thickness. The increase in the number of controllable characters certainly represents a step forward, as well as the greater tendency towards action with respect to puzzle solving (always simple, however), but the short duration of the adventure and the adoption of too many simplistic solutions it only confirms the initial thesis: this product is recommended only for little fans of the film. Let's hope that on the occasion of the (probable) third release the Traveller's Tales opt for a decisive change of course. Pros A large number of controllable characters Quite varied situations Nice animations Cons ~Slippery~ and unrewarding combat system Too short Lacks depth", "date": "2008-07-08", "grade": null}
