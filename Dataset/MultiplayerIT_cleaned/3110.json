{"name": "Follia: Dear Father", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/follia-dear-father-recensione.html", "text": "As we will see in the course of the review, Follia: Dear Father is a classic survival horror that takes up the Amnesia model and carries it out in a more contemporary key, at least on a thematic level. Developed by two people, it tells the story of Marcus Pitt, a boy who, despite him, finds himself embroiled in a story bigger than him. Having gone in the middle of the night to the university where his parents teach, he soon discovers that something terrible has happened and that the corridors are littered with bloodthirsty creatures who can't wait to tear him apart. What created them? Why is the university in such a state of neglect? Where have his relatives gone? To answer these and other questions he will have to get to the end of the approximately four hours that the adventure lasts, obviously trying to survive. Gameplay Many independent authors have a real passion for the horror genre, to which they often choose to dedicate their videogame debuts. The reasons for such a choice can be many and naturally depend on the sensitivity of the single individuals who deal with the creative choices, but in general we can say with some certainty that in everyone there is some desire for revelation and to express themselves in continuity with your imaginary reference. Videogame horror is above all looking into the unknown, awareness of one's weakness in the face of an overwhelming evil against which the single individual can do nothing. It is also a form of psychoanalysis, a way to see one's most recondite and unmentionable drives and fears staged in a plastic and interactive environment. Follia: Dear Father follows almost to the letter what we can consider a now classic model of videogame horror: played in first person, it sees the protagonist, defenseless against his opponents, moving stealthily through the rooms and corridors of an overall sick and hostile environment. The only weapons at his disposal are a flashlight and a lighter, with the former consuming batteries at an unsustainable rate and the latter illuminating only a small portion of the surrounding environment. In reality, like a new Gordon Freeman, Marcus also has a crowbar, which however he cannot use to offend, but only to defend himself. As you can imagine, the overall gameplay is very slow, with the player forced to crawl from one part of the game environments to another paying attention to every little noise, while enjoying the gore details scattered almost everywhere. Game structure The university is populated by different creatures, even if their behavior is very similar to each other. They usually appear actively seeking Marcus, and when they discover him, the only way to save themselves is to run away until they give up. The settings are very dark, so escaping is often complicated by the lack of precise reference points. Escaping with the lit lighter is actually not possible, because the flame goes out while running, while the flashlight is often empty, so you can't always rely on it (there are batteries around, but not many). After all, dying is part of the game, in the sense that if in a horror game the player doesn't perceive the impending danger, the tension tends to relax and a good part of the atmosphere goes down the drain. The only real complaint we can make to Follia: Dear Father from this point of view is the somewhat excessive use of jumping on the chair, which in the long run tires rather than frightens. Structurally, the adventure follows a fairly precise pattern, made up of exploratory moments, in which you usually have to solve some simple puzzles, and encounters with monsters, in which you try to survive by avoiding being seen. From a narrative point of view, the story of the game is told through the classic documents that are scattered throughout the game environments. In reality they don't say much, leaving the explanation of what happened to the end, which if you like is a logical choice, given that to finish Follia: Dear Father it doesn't take much and giving too many details in advance would have reduced the scope of the already thin texture. Graphics and problems As for the technical element Madness: Dear Father is a fluctuating title. Some things are very good, such as the lighting of some environments and the construction of some of the places that can be visited, while others are less convincing, such as some creatures. There are some graphic glitches and the university doesn't really look like a university, but in the long run, little attention is paid to it. After all we are talking about a production managed by only two developers whose development budget must not have been exactly enormous, so there is nomuch more could have been expected and what they have managed to do is certainly worthy of praise. Unfortunately, some problems should also be reported, such as too many returns to the desktop and the impossibility of remapping the controller keys. We've played with mouse and keyboard on our own and haven't had any issues, but we know some of you prefer to play using one of those satanic contraptions from the console world (just kidding), so it's fair to warn you. Hopefully this will be fixed in future updates.", "date": "2020-05-03", "grade": "7.0"}
