The first thing that catches the eye is a certain resemblance to a cornerstone of the genre, or a certain AoE2, birth of Uncle Bill. This is not bad at all if we consider that he does it fishing for ideas, but with respect for the holder of the throne. Even FoTD is ~historical~ in the sense that there will certainly be no shortage of details on characters and events that really happened... in all honesty, I haven't always been reading all the intros of each mission... ehm... I have some I have trouble remembering that Ming Ping's son attacked Sing to displease Zing who was having sex with Bing's sister, actually the wife of the insurgent Uing. However note of merit for the research in the archives and for the commitment. What I have in mind, however, is a nice graphics, really accurate and detailed, both for the units and for the buildings. The video resolution of 1024x768 is highly recommended to fully enjoy the play area, full of typical constructions and little men dedicated to their work. Work? Did we say work? Well yes, even in FoTD there is the collection of resources. But, and this is a plus point, it's slightly different than usual. Not that we're suddenly picking candy instead of wheat, or cooking ciabatta instead of meat... but we can decide to interact more with workers and structures. Have you ever wondered why when we build a farm we only ever get one resource out of it? One rightly thinks: in a farm there are many things. And in fact by directing the Japanese boys towards the building we can decide to have them cultivate wheat or raise pigs for meat, all of this an infinite number of times, with a maximum of 5 farmers per farm. So the excess of resources will no longer be a problem. Furthermore, a farmer will not have to be forever. He could be a winemaker or a cook, getting hired in the kitchen laboratory... always on the basis of the principle of the division of roles in the buildings. A nice thought. Increase space and practicality. You whiten this facade for me... The famous ~upgrades~ of the buildings will take place from the Academy, the nerve center of the city's development. In this regard I must point out one thing, not so much unpleasant as complicated. When at the 4th mission I asked myself: why does my opponent have archers and I don't? And why does he break through the roofs of my houses with catapults while I only have the siege ladder to climb over the walls? Search for you, probe for an answer (I didn't have the manual available) I proceeded by trial and error, according to the classic RTS canons. That is, if you need a building for archers and you don't have one, you need another building upstream. Well, after having built all the buildings, after having upgraded everything to the academy, nothing. Only after a while do I notice a message written in lowercase... practically to be able to access the advanced buildings I have to appoint a head of the academy. But porc ... said done, and here I am unlocked other buildings and other various upgrades. In reality this initially cumbersome event (mostly one who does not know it does not get there immediately) we come to discover another interesting feature: the charges. There are a bunch of achievements for your heroes (recruitable at the tavern, and possessing unique characteristics) from head of the guard to head of grain production control every possible title for your city. Don't be scared action-man that you are nothing else, it's not a management! This I exclude. But to make the economy work well and turn everything in your favor (see prevailing over the enemy and crushing him with blows) you need that minimum of salt in the pumpkin to make things square for a moment. And there will also be calamities to burn your tail... so let's build a theme and create a cult of adoration of the gods, which is convenient.. often years of famine can only be faced with a good eye from the tenants upstairs. ...and smooth these katanas! We come to blows. No, you understood... I'm not a provocateur and I don't have it against anyone... let's simply get to the climax of the game... the blows. Only one imperative: the enemy must be crushed, whatever the well-meaning court say. To do this you will have at your disposal well equipped troops of battle units between a little man with sword and shield, archers and pikemen. In addition to the ~heroes~ that I told you before. In addition you can also breed horses ~give~ one to whoever you want, effectively creating a very varied cavalry. Will you be Tring Bing Shong, the terrible leader of the army of horse archers? To you the choice. In addition to meat dto slaughter you will also have war machines (siege ladders, ram chariots and catapults, but also others) to inflict heavy blows. And here alas we return to the sad refrain: amass and massacre. Indeed, the old strategy always works so equip yourself with a good army before facing the enemy otherwise it doesn't exist at all. But just really. Fortunately, groups can be assigned, in order to be able to recall them by pressing the corresponding number key... otherwise one would not understand much in the chaos on the screen. So get ready for advances made rather clumsy by the continuous succession of: 1, right click and go there, 2, right click and go there, 3 right click and go there, and so on up to the opposing stronghold. The path will be made interesting for 2 reasons. One reason is closely related to the map. Imagine the classic scaled-down version of the city and surrounding area to the left, if you go to one end magically the units will be mapped to the right of the screen, where the map of the region resides... i.e. a no man's territory where the he only law is first-come-first-grab neutral capitals (which, when conquered, provide extra income to your coffers). In fact, an intelligent system to make the playing area larger, and to better manage things via map. The other reason is that your troops get tired. Yes, marching with all the paraphernalia on without even a glass of sake and a little rice ball in the stomach can create some little problems... said and done, we send a supply wagon and we will establish a camp in the scrub, where our people can rest and prepare for the next day's siege. Obviously imagine the attacks on the supply wagons to keep the opposing troops dry and weakened, they will succumb to our blows! SSSotomair! A mandarin with seeds Not an easy game this Fate of the Dragon. Not too bizarre, but certainly not frivolous, and above all fluctuating. That is, moments will alternate in which everything will go smoothly and things will always go the right way, and you will not notice that time passes in moments of total stasis. Definitely a globally long-paced game. All made even more long-lived by the presence of three large campaigns (here there are not three races, but three leaders). Long lasting but repetitive? Perhaps. Depends. Are you obsessed with upgrading buildings and instant slaughter? Not for you. Are you patient and think that revenge is a dish best served cold? You will enjoy it. That's all... deep down I liked it, because I don't like going crazy behind statistics and flow charts, but at the same time I like building, doing economy, getting attached to the city so then I'll have to shed the blood of my commoners. This is basically Fate of the Dragon. The mandarin trembles... What prompted the noblemen of the Japanese Middle Ages to be called like this? Perhaps an unbridled passion for the tasty fruit? Or perhaps because they were stuffed to the core with vitamin C after a medical examination? Not bad... what matters is that if in those days you were a great ruler and leader they treated you like a citrus fruit. All this introduces us to the setting of this Fate of the Dragon, yet another (but not superfluous) real-time strategy game, with an ~old school~ 2D look and set precisely in the Japan of spears and pagodas. This is the second game I happen to curate (after the preview of the future Throne of Darkness) and it makes me think... maybe the game designers and programmers have found a new and prolific setting so far little explored and full of novelties hidden for too long from the western world? We'll see... now let's shave our heads and attach a fake pigtail to our heads. Fan in hand click on the FOTD executable.", "date": "2001-04-27", "grade": null}
