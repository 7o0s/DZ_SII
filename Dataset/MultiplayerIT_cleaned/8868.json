Yet the talent and ability of some development teams, mainly independent, have shown that theoretically ~exhausted~ strands not only still possessed the ability to give emotions, but were also very open to experimentation. In recent years we have seen the birth of very interesting projects regarding shooters, and the Crossfire series has been able to stand out within this exciting limelight. The first episode, Crossfire in fact, was released on the Xbox LIVE Arcade digital platform in July 2010 and convinced everyone thanks to the simple but effective gameplay, which bases its charm precisely on the concept of ~crossfire~: the ship we control, in a static context a la Space Invaders, it can in fact project itself at any time from the lower to the upper end of the screen, thus avoiding enemy fire or trying to seize a particularly resistant unit from behind in the front. The sequel, Crossfire 2, released in December of the same year, only strengthened the same concepts, simultaneously enriching the starting formula thanks to an excellent upgrade system. And it was precisely this last interpretation that arrived on the App Store with Super Crossfire HD, a title capable of demonstrating its value from the very first minutes, thanks to a recognizable style and a structure full of depth. You surround me by standing in front of me Within five chapters, each formed by a certain number of stages, our task is to eliminate an enemy army that gradually becomes more substantial and threatening. The hostile troops do not come from above as in the aforementioned Space Invaders, but appear in the central part of the screen, while our territory is represented by the lower end and the lower one, along whose lines we can move at will and dispense bullets in large quantities. The control system of Super Crossfire HD is completely based on the touch screen, with a sort of ~slider~ on the left side for the movement of the ship, the autofire activated and two buttons on the right side: one to move from the bottom to the top top of the scenario, the other to activate an enhanced barrage that must be ~loaded~ by achieving a certain amount of eliminations. The basic mechanics tend to repeat themselves, therefore it is the opponents who change and who make the gameplay more varied, proposing formations with armored units on one side and which therefore necessarily require a strategy based on movement so that they can be destroyed, or bosses formed by multiple components that we have to blow up one after another. At the end of each stage, the points collected can be used to upgrade the ship in various ways, through an interface that is indeed not very clear but which, if in doubt, we can fix using an ~auto fill~ function. Furthermore, if our aspiration is to aim for high scores, there are three different difficulty levels and each of them guarantees high scores, with all the consequences of the case. The technical sector and the graphics, in particular, accompany the action in an excellent way: the ~perspective~ changes when we move from one floor to another of the scenario, while wireframe elements and a whole series of spectacular light effects follow one another .
