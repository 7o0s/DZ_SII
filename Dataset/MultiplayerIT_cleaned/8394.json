Fieldrunners 2 therefore seems, if the premise is considered valid, the typical example of a sequel driven by the success (moreover deserved) of the first episode. But behind the Subatomic Studios game there is actually a team that certainly does not like to be satisfied with performing the simple ~homework~; in fact, the news is there and you can see it. Towers without upheavals The hard core of Fieldrunners 2 is always the same, identical not only to its predecessor but also to the entire genre that now almost dominates the Apple mobile platforms: following an invasion that endangers the earth, the player has the task of creating effective lines of defense along certain pre-established routes. It is therefore the usual gameplay based on the placement of defensive turrets, an action that has become so familiar to Apple gamers as to make the various tutorials present in similar titles practically useless. When a concept is exploited up to these levels, the only way to guarantee a minimum of interest on the part of the player is to introduce particular weapons, enemies and variables, capable of giving even a pinch of unpredictability during the otherwise boring waves. From this point of view, in fact, there is really nothing to complain about, given that there are 20 types of turrets that can be selected, even if initially only 3 are immediately available. To unlock the other weapons, just continue in the missions by overcoming them with an adequate score and thus obtaining the necessary golden stars. Defensive emplacements follow the general rule that a low-powered weapon is assigned a low installation cost and vice versa; on the contrary, the most destructive ones need a lot of time (and many victims) to be built so much that in many scenarios trying to accumulate the necessary resources can become too risky. The other element that makes Fieldrunners 2 a deeper tower defense is the very strong strategic component, already detectable even just by looking at the game maps. Rich in ravines, bridges, trenches and tunnels, the battle pattern is almost a chessboard, so important that even the wrong positioning of one or two towers can change the balance of a game. The problem is that we often realize we've made some mistakes when it's too late: in fact, the matches last a rather long time on average, sometimes even 10 minutes, and being defeated perhaps right in the last wave is certainly not a sensation agreeable. Added to this is a general difficulty that is already challenging at an average level, which for many represents a plus, and the presence of some special enemies that are very difficult to shoot down, motorized or equipped with highly armored tanks and even huge bombers and helicopters. A further variable that adds tacticalism to the missions is the need to choose the turrets to bring into battle before a game, with all the risks involved; however there are also bonuses useful for saving the most desperate situations, such as mines to be placed directly in the midst of the most compact hordes, very powerful air attacks and last but not least, the ability to reverse time by 30 seconds to reposition all the defenses in the best possible way. In addition to the classic story mode, it is possible to face the puzzle mode, the classic survival mode and the time trial. Finally, the AI of the opponents is good, who will always look for the least protected routes, but above all the technical sector is excellent, very colorful and with the animations of the weapons and enemies really well done.", "date": "2012-07-31", "grade": "8.7"}
