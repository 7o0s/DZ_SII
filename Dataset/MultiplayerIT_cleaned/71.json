{"name": "Free Fall", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/free-fall.html", "text": "If this were not enough, the enemies present in the form of bombs (!), buffers (!!) and more will do their part to drain all our vital energy (there are first aid kits to recover it) or push us into the void condemning us to a premature game over. The special tiles are: red (acceleration), blue (sliding), green (the ball jumps when it passes over it), mobile ones (allow you to reach otherwise inaccessible places), and then there are the vertical panels, those that can be traversed, those that they dodge on contact, those that act as a handrail preventing you from ending up off the edge and finally in the miscellaneous category, switches for example. Physics is the core of such a game, its engine must manage inertia, gradient, acceleration and the reaction to contact with opponents and special tiles in real time, not all levels are flat, some have a wavy shape like the circles in the water or like the side of a mountain. You can enter map mode at any time and scroll the view independently to a different area of the level from the one you are in to find out if there are any hidden sections. There are two game modes: ~Discovery~ and ~Challenge~, in the first played as described above and in the second you have a handful of seconds to finish the level, you have to complete as many as possible. PRO good game design sound finally valid effective physics AGAINST dated genre the ~map~ function goes on and on the blue writings on the light blue texture are for blindness", "date": "2007-02-24", "grade": "S.V."}
