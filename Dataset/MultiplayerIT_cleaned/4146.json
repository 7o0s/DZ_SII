{"name": "Adventure Time: I Pirati dell'Enchiridion", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/adventure-time-i-pirati-enchiridion-recensione.html", "text": "Adventure Time is a great production, thanks to which you can spend half an hour carefree enjoying extravagant characters, absurd settings and apparently superficial stories but also capable of digging deep into human feelings. Difficult to find games dedicated to TV series, but more generally all licensed titles, which are able to replicate these emotions and perhaps only the most recent South Park have made it, thanks to a truly painstaking care by Ubisoft and a willingness to leave carte blanche to writers. Also in that case, among other things, it was a role-playing game, with simple mechanics it is true but undoubtedly interesting and a good underlying longevity. After having completely completed Adventure Time: The Pirates of the Enchiridion, we are so ready to draw a line and to decree the final verdict. Will it be worth your money? A handful of hours long adventure We didn't approach Adventure Time: The Pirates of the Enchiridion with too many expectations, yet the Namco Bandai title welcomed us with open arms in the first minutes with all the feeling of the TV series. The cel shading graphics, not perfect in every detail, still do their job by offering players a credible and, above all, recognizable universe, with characters with good facial expressions and at the same time capable of making their emotions shine through. Too bad that throughout the course of the adventure, which lasts just under ten hours in case you want to complete it one hundred percent, you will never feel the sensation of being emotionally dragged due to a very flat narrative. Adventure Time: The Pirates of the Enchiridion thus becomes a simple story, created with the intention of throwing in as many characters as possible in a disproportionate fan service, without dwelling instead on the things that really made the Pendleton Ward saga so important in nerd culture . Certainly there are Finn and Jake to control, there is the world of Ooo completely submerged in water and there are also the canonical enemies of the series with some extras that cannot fail to please fans. However, the evolution of the story is followed without ever being really involved with phoned, obvious and rather trivial twists and turns. Our dynamic duo will thus have to navigate far and wide by completing main and secondary missions, trying to untie the knot of the matter and discover the cause of this flood, perhaps even fixing the problem. You then travel between the available islands, through an extremely linear navigation system in its open world structure and unlock new locations to explore. With each added piece, another element of the plot is revealed, and as the mystery unravels our heroes level up, acquire new skills and prepare to face ever more difficult battles. To act as an intermediate checkpoint and to slightly vary the activities to be done, we then take care of the very simple interrogations to be completed through four options, the result of which will only facilitate us in the search for objectives but whose impact on the plot will be essentially nil. Adventure Time, as you may have understood, is not a complex game, it basically never becomes one, above all thanks to the absence of random encounters and the level of the enemies always clearly visible above their head, an indicator that warns you in case you are about to enter an area too arduous for your accumulated experience. However, it is an extremely remote eventuality to end up blocked by the experience wall since with each loading all the enemies, and also the treasures, will reappear as if by magic on the map, allowing you an infinite farming of experience and gold. The currency present in Adventure Time: Pirates of the Enchiridion is useful for two main reasons, since it will serve you not only to buy valuable consumables to use in battle but also to upgrade all party members through a terribly flat growth system and devoid of any innovative ideas. Playstation 4 trophies It's not terribly difficult to get all the Adventure Time: Pirates of the Enchiridion trophies. Most of the objectives can be achieved by simply completing the main adventure and completing some side quests and, with a little extra farming, it is possible to reach the CAP of the characters without the need to restart the game after having concluded it. Certainly to complete all the missions you will have to thoroughly explore the islands of Ooo as you will have some characters to save before you can embrace your coveted platinum, the only slightly more challenging task. Gameplay and graphics... so cOh yeah Adventure Time: The Pirates of the Enchiridion, as we said, is essentially an RPG with turn-based combat with a very simple structure. Your four-player party consists of Finn, Jake, BMO and Marceline and everyone basically has the option to make a standard attack or opt for a special ability that consumes energy depending on its dangerousness. There is not much depth or strategy, unfortunately in combat and the artificial intelligence of the enemies settles on trivial linear choices that are predictable and have little logical sense. They will not attack based on an aggro value, let alone the most vulnerable character, often limiting themselves to a series of completely random attacks. It thus becomes unthinkable to choose, for example, whether to be on guard to prevent fatal damage, an option that we have never chosen, almost always favoring a simple attack. Then there are no healing skills, relegated instead to the use of objects and usable without turn limitation. Another serious lack is certainly the total absence of an interface that clearly indicates the order of turns, once again leaving too many elements to chance and tearing any planning out of the game. In short, much more could have been done. Finally, there is also the inevitable super move to charge by taking damage, healing allies or killing enemies, but it is a superfluous habit that is also unable to add any quality to the combat system. Adventure Time: The Pirates of the Enchiridion closes its roundup of defects with a disappointing technical sector and a frame rate that defining a dancer is little, especially during exploration at sea. The animations are poor and the whole game as a whole seems to have been pushed towards an early closure, leaving some all too obvious problems present. Even the secondary quests cannot be remembered with pleasure, trivial and without any interesting influence for a product exclusively dedicated to fans and designed, perhaps, for a very young audience.", "date": "2018-07-18", "grade": "6.0"}
