{"name": "Resident Evil 4", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/resident-evil-4_a.html", "text": "The revolution of four Nonetheless, the first version of the Resident Evil 4 project on Gamecube was not very dissimilar from its predecessors, so much so that the images released at the time had surprised by the graphic quality, but at the same time left many players dumbfounded facing the risk of rediscover the ~usual~ Resident Evil. Evidently not too convinced of the road he was taking either, perhaps bored or simply enlightened by a new vision, Mikami therefore decided to take on the role of a new Doctor Frankenstein, destroying his creature to shape it bigger, more beautiful but above all, able to amaze anyone with an impact at least equal to what it had in 1996. Resident Evil 4 therefore presents itself as the biggest turning point that such a successful series has ever experienced before. The points of contact with its predecessors are in fact very few, with the exception of the narrated story that fits perfectly into the meshes woven so far by the prolific Japanese game designer, while marking the end word for some of the most important pieces of the plot. No more Umbrella Corporation, nor Raccoon City for example; in fact, with the spread of the T-Virus in the city, the American government first decided to wipe out every sign of the epidemic with an atomic bomb, only to then sever any relationship with Umbrella, thus marking its economic collapse. 6 years have passed, and that Leon S. Kennedy protagonist of Resident Evil 2 has abandoned the police becoming a super-trained agent under the orders of the United States government; the mission, this time, is to find and save the president's daughter, who mysteriously disappeared in a remote village in Europe. The differences of this fourth chapter strike with all their force from the very beginning; the graphics have abandoned fixed shots and pre-rendered backdrops, in favor of a total 3d that exploits the potential of the Nintendo console ~to the metal~. The glance is exceptional, and during the entire short presentation you can't help but be amazed by the results obtained by Capcom's graphics. But it is a short-lived emotion, which must immediately make way for that - with a much stronger impact - of the game mechanics adopted. Forget Resident Evil, here's a whole different story. Surely the most radical change lies in the different graphic perspective adopted, which in fact revolutionizes the approach to the game: while up to now the hallmark of the series had been the fixed cameras, with a cinematographic cut, which deliberately hid portions of the setting to provide the surprise effect on which so much has been played, now the point of view is moved behind the protagonist, giving a complete view of the surrounding environment. But Mikami certainly could not fall into the banality of the classic ~Tomb Raider~-style shot, and so we find ourselves having a slightly off-center Leon on the left, and at an extremely close distance from the virtual camera. It is therefore a very original middle ground between the classic third-person view and the first person, with some variations during certain game situations. Where are the zombies? Resident Evil 4 wastes no time with tutorials or learning stages, throwing the player right into the middle of the action; in fact, as we have already written, the intro is really short and only lays the foundations of the story being told, allowing you to take the pad in hand after just a few moments and take the first steps in the adventure. And they are truly shocking first steps: the welcome of the villagers is in fact anything but friendly, with a small group of farmers determined in no uncertain terms to kill Leon with pitchforks, axes, knives. There is no other solution then than to hold the gun, thus discovering yet another novelty introduced by the Capcom production. In fact, pressing the R key allows you to switch to attack mode using the firearm currently in possession, with the simultaneous narrowing of the camera even closer to the protagonist. In doing so, the analog stick effectively becomes the extension in the player's hands of Leon's arm, allowing free pointing within the screen, supported by a bright laser that indicates exactly the point of impact of the bullet. The repercussions within the gameplay are obvious, with a freedom in this sense completely unknown so far to the series; the good interactivity with the setting also allows you to use this system not only for purely killing enemies, but also to activate traps, destroy elements of the seabed, collect treasures and so on. Butundoubtedly the greatest satisfactions come from the clashes with the hostile creatures present in Resident Evil 4, in the face of the simply fabulous diversification of the ~hit zones~. The work on the animations of the enemies is monumental, to the point of really setting new terms of comparison; being faced with a dozen bloodthirsty peasants is already shocking in itself, but seeing their behavior under Leon's blows is nothing short of unforgettable. For example, hitting a villager in the hand holding the pitchfork immediately sends the weapon flying, not to mention the case in which the unfortunate person is carrying a stick of dynamite But of course that's not all: a precise blow to the face temporarily renders the opponent defenseless leaving him at the mercy of further attacks, even melee. And again, shooting in the legs makes the enemy stagger, kneel or collapse to the ground, allowing you to rage with peace of mind until you have the upper hand. Clearly each weapon has different effects, and if what has just been described can happen with a simple pistol, try to imagine the results of shotguns, grenades, rocket launchers and so on A journey of no return By force of circumstances, the decision to adopt a dynamic view instead of the fixed cameras that have always accompanied the series has significantly changed the balance of the game mechanics of Resident Evil 4. Now the pace is certainly more sustained, the feeling of loss is practically absent and there are no areas hidden by framing cuts; all of which required the Japanese designers to introduce a different kind of fear and tension, no longer based entirely on visual limitation but more varied and satisfying. Of course, there is no shortage of enemies that appear from closed doors or wardrobes, but it is clear how the sensations transmitted by this fourth chapter are enormously different from the previous ones. Resident Evil 4 is in fact based more on the overwhelming sense of being alone against dozens of creatures, of having to constantly look over your shoulder from surprise attacks, of being faced with monsters with truly terrifying features and dimensions. Far be it from us to want to take away the taste for surprise; however, allow us only to tell you that never as in this case have we found ourselves speechless in front of the majesty and the terrible beauty of some of the opponents that we are destined to meet during the adventure, as well as from the differentiation of the clashes with the bosses that impose really different game approaches. But the variety is also surprising, with a mass of beings of the most varied shapes and sizes, as well as obviously with different behaviors for each of them. A few remarks can be made to artificial intelligence, which is not surprising and prefers to be based on mass attacks with heads down without particular tactics of evasion or encirclement. This is a decision that goes well with certain types of opponents, but which makes one turn up one's nose in the face of enemies presumably endowed with superior intellectual abilities. But Resident Evil 4 is obviously not just combat, and a very important slice of the game economy is dedicated to the exploratory phase; in this sense, the collection of hidden treasures within the settings is essential, because it is precisely through the sale of these that large sums can be obtained to spend with the merchants. Yes, because the fourth episode of the series also marks the entry of money, obtainable precisely through the sale of treasures but also to be collected along one's journey from crates, chests or from the corpses of enemies. This money can then be used to buy weapons, ammunition, objects or to modify the characteristics of the same weapons by increasing the offensive potential, the capacity of the magazines, the reload times and the firing speed of the bullets. An intriguing aspect, which adds a managerial element even in the face of the total disappearance of the famous ~crates~ in which to deposit surplus objects. In Resident Evil 4 there is none of this; on the contrary, Leon has a ~space~ made up of a grid of squares, within which you have to fit everything you want to take with you. In fact, each object occupies a certain number of squares and, although the inventory capacity can be increased, it is necessary to make precise choices on what to buy, especially as regards bulky firearms. The save system has also been modified and, while still relying on the typewriters scattered throughout the settings, it no longer requires the use of tapes, thus allowing you to save the game freely whenever you wish. But whatreally surprising in the Capcom production is the quality of every minute of the game offered within the approximately 20 hours necessary to complete the adventure. It is clear how the programmers really wanted to give a clean slate to the past, and to all those aspects that had now become staples of the genre as tricks to ~stretch the broth~. In Resident Evil 4 backtracking is reduced to the bone, and the puzzles are more like short parentheses that don't require particular skills to be solved. So everything is resolved with a constant and rewarding progression within the adventure, with a sequence of situations, settings and events that always keep the game at exceptional levels. Technique and control The control system is perhaps the only aspect of Resident Evil 4 unable to obtain absolute consensus, due to a woodiness that is a partial legacy of the previous chapters. If some movements of the protagonist are in fact immediately executable and natural, others such as for example the rotation from a standstill appear more cumbersome than one would expect. On the other hand, the discussion regarding the lack of mobility during the shooting phase is more complex: if it is true that the implementation of a lateral strafe would have provided greater dynamism to the clashes, it is equally true that in this case we would have strayed too far from the adventure genre in favor of that of the fps, which evidently was not the intent of the developers. Furthermore, the movements and characteristics of the opposing creatures are adequate for this ~limitation~, and the inclusion of dodging would have made everything really too easy or too frenetic. Continuing to talk about the control system, one cannot help but mention the function of the A key, sensitive to the context and delegated to a great variety of actions. In addition to interacting with the elements of the environment, its pressure allows Leon to perform particular actions, such as going down the ladders or jumping off the edges, or even diving through the windows and so on. The meeting with Ashley, the president's daughter, and the subsequent sections of the adventure together also increase the spectrum of the protagonist's faculties, also allowing combined actions with the two characters. Last but not least, the technical aspect. In no uncertain terms, Resident Evil 4 is not only the most graphically beautiful game on the Gamecube, but it is also in all probability the best on any console from this point of view. The work done by the programmers is simply sensational, both in terms of technique and artistic quality; the settings are embarrassing in their beauty, with glimpses of villages, farms, castles, sewers of sublime quality and capable of restoring an unparalleled atmosphere. For example, crossing the country for the first time during the day, and returning later in the middle of the night and in the middle of a storm is a thrilling experience, as is observing the modeling of the creatures and the level of detail that characterizes every single element of the game. The use of colors is as spot-on as it could possibly be, reaching peaks of unmatched realism, as well as the graphic effects that are truly capable of leaving you breathless. In particular, the depiction of fire and flames is sensational, and throwing an incendiary grenade while watching your enemies burn in excruciating pain is an experience that has to be seen to be believed. There is no shortage of blood and mutilations in the best tradition of the Capcom series, obviously to the nth degree with unparalleled particle effects. The same goes for waterways, complete with reflections and dynamic ripples. We could go on talking for hours about the lighting effects, the squeaky clean textures, the amazing animations, the huge and accurate environments in every millimeter, but we wouldn't even remotely be able to prepare for the effect that Resident Evil 4 can have live in front of in your own eyes. It's simply out of bounds. The decision to use a letterboxed widescreen, and not a true 16:9, leaves a bitter taste in the mouth, thus preventing widescreen TV owners from taking full advantage of the screen size except through the zoom function. The sound is splendid, also convincing as regards the acting which has finally been entrusted to real voice actors, capable of transmitting a good emphasis and credibility in the recited sentences. The decision to make human enemies speak in Spanish is excellent, with a set of sentences that will be particularly appreciated by those who understand the language in question but which in general give a greater feeling of involvement in the European setting. The effects are very valid, which above all by using", "date": "2005-03-18", "grade": null}
