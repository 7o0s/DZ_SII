{"name": "The Penguin Menace", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-penguin-menace.html", "text": "The Penguin Menace undoubtedly represents one of the nicest products that have appeared in recent months within the mobile video game market. The plot is as simple as it is insane: the emperor of the penguins Dr. Peng has in fact organized an army of similar ones of him with the aim of building a machine with which to bring frost to the whole world and therefore start the final invasion. The hero ready to throw a spoke in the works of this criminal scheme is a brave chicken named Leo, helped by his earthworm friend Flex. A premise therefore absolutely delusional for what is a rather valid and competent platform / puzzle. In a nutshell, in each level of the game you will be faced with a setting full of penguins, platforms, conveyor belts, bouncing springs and a whole series of various machines that may be used by the protagonist to his own advantage. The goal is to move a simple crate within the level itself until it reaches the ~heart~ of the production cycle, so as to compromise production and destroy the entire factory. But as if moving the aforementioned chest from one point to another wasn't already enough, thinking about how to get it to overcome obstacles and trying not to be surprised by the penguins, Leo will also have to worry about escaping in time by reaching the exit, while a countdown runs inexorably. An interesting idea, executed by the programmers satisfactorily but not without some flaws; for example the particularly severe level of difficulty, which leads to having to restart the level at the slightest contact with the wicked penguins. Unfortunately, game over occurs frequently even for little or no reasons attributable to the player's deficiencies, such as controls that are not perfectly reactive and a camera that is too close, which perhaps hides the enemies from the player's sight in a sneaky and irritating way. The ability to move it in a limited way by holding down the up or down key does not solve the problem. Having said that, The Penguin Menace lets itself be played and intrigues a lot, stimulating us to move forward despite the defects listed above. This is also thanks to the graphic component, really excellent especially as regards the style used; very cartoonish and colorful, and endowed with an irresistible characterization as regards the realization of the characters and above all of the protagonist. So at the end of the day we have a fun puzzle platformer, made with passion and full of quality able to overlook even the weak points that are far from non-existent ... so it's a pity that the 12 overall levels are really too few, allowing you to bring finished Leo's adventure in a couple of hours. We certainly don't ask mobile games to guarantee record longevity, but something in between or in any case something more than what is offered from this point of view by In-fusio production would be at least desirable. PRO Great graphics Intriguing concept Good level of challenge AGAINST Flawed gameplay Longevity too limited Sound disappointing", "date": "2008-02-21", "grade": "S.V."}
