Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to shell out a single cent. Ideas play a fundamental role in the development of new video games, but this is especially true when there are no graphic frills, proven solutions or smokescreens to divert the attention of the user compared to the real paucity of content. Let's take word games for example, a casual genre that has always been very successful on mobile devices. Well, disengaging from traditional mechanics, in the Scrabble style, is really difficult and even just succeeding in it, proposing a minimally original yet at the same time effective concept, represents an extraordinary success. This is the case of WordOn HD, the latest production of flaregames, a team that already authored the excellent RTS Royal Revolt! (here is our review, by the way) which tries to try its hand at words by developing a simple but exciting structure, which on the one hand draws inspiration from the classic composition of words on a table, on the other it introduces interesting mechanics such as letters that we can ~give~ to the opponent to make life more difficult. Everything works through a decidedly functional matchmaking system, which draws users to face randomly or from the list of our friends on Facebook, creating asynchronous multiplayer games that rely on notifications to notify us of each new move made. Take that! Once you have downloaded WordOn HD from the App Store or Google Play, completely free of charge (provided you tolerate some small promotional ads, to eliminate which you need to pay 2.69 euros), you can try your hand at a short tutorial that explains the rules of the game. In the lower part of the screen there are the letters available to us and, a little further up, seven boxes in which we have the task of composing a word in Italian. The reference vocabulary appears fairly rich in terms, not exactly complete but not even ~imaginative~ as that of the famous Angry Words often knows how to be, where it often happens to ~attempt~ absurd terms that the software then judges correct, blatantly patching. As in the traditional Scrabble, each letter has a numerical value depending on its ~difficulty~ of positioning, and this value makes up the score of each word that we play together with the bonuses of the individual boxes, which can multiply the total or, in the case of the ~W~ symbol, send letters to our opponent's area. Our skill will lie precisely in getting rid of very ~uncomfortable~ consonants and leaving them on the other player's back. Composing words without using the two golden letters, precisely the ~imposed~ ones, in fact results in obtaining very low scores, absolutely insufficient in order to win a game. WordOn HD has been available on iOS and Android devices for a few weeks, but the enthusiasm around this product seems really great and in fact it's not hard to find players to challenge and to carry on even a dozen games at the same time, with the possibility to exchange messages, make friends and, why not, mock the opponent. There are some small aids (see the score highlighter) that can be unlocked using the ~stars~ earned through victories or the outlay of real money, but the freemium dynamics seemed anything but stringent and you can easily play without spending a penny.", "date": "2013-01-05", "grade": "7.4"}
