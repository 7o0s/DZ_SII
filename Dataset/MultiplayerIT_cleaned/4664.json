After having therefore reviewed Pro Evolution Soccer 2018, the time has come for us to also take care of its direct ~opponent~, that is to say that FIFA which in recent years has stolen the scepter of best football simulation on the market from the Konami series. A trophy that the developer, EA Sports, does not seem willing to give up, judging by this FIFA 18. Let's see why. The journey continues! Like every year, FIFA presents itself to users with lots of content. From the classic friendlies to be played locally or online, where we have recorded a good matchmaking system and moderate server stability, to the Season mode, which is also available in both the home and online versions, up to the Pro Club, the tournaments official or customizable for clubs and national teams, at competitions for women's football, the offer is as always very rich. However, the fulcrum of the experience remains, as has been the case for some years now, the Ultimate Team and Career modes, and from last season, The Journey. The first is now well known, and is one of the fans' favorites of the series: as always, it consists in creating one's own ideal team by basing the purchases and exchanges of players, represented by a sticker that indicates their global value, on a system of auctions . The biggest novelty of this year is represented by the presence of the Icons, cards depicting stars of the past such as Ronaldo, Maradona and Pele, who have three different versions each representing three different moments in their career, some tweaks to the Squad Creation Challenges section with the inclusion of variables capable of increasing the level of challenge, and the Squad Battles mode which gives the opportunity to contend with other teams created within FUT by players, however challenging the team managed by artificial intelligence. However, we will return to discuss this mode in detail in the future. The Career mode has also been improved, and so much: in addition to more functional menus, a special Hub has been implemented from a market perspective where you can always have everything under control and manage the negotiations personally with the clubs and with the players' representatives, with lots of filmed and interactive skits. Dynamic videos have also been introduced for breaking news in the menu, pre-set workouts and new dynamics such as release clauses or transfer bonuses that make everything more compelling and believable. It's just a pity that, albeit to a lesser extent than in 2017, there are still some improbable market operations. The third of the most important FIFA modes, as written before, is The Journey, which continues this year with The Return of Alex Hunter. The beautiful story mode that last year was able to enthrall many gamers by telling the football and human events of a young talent grappling with his attempt to make it in the football that counts as in an interactive film, returns even richer in content. Starting with the ability to change team and tournament, or the look of the protagonist. The picture is completed by more beautiful graphics, an even more cinematic cut of the events, the possibility of meeting or interpreting new characters and a deeper plot. The latter, in fact, delves even more into the soul of Alex, who begins his new adventure in Brazil, among the favelas, almost as if he were looking for new stimuli before the seasonal commitments, in his eyes full of hope and passion for football of those poor kids he plays with on the street. We will definitely be back to talk about this second chapter of Il Viaggio in more detail in the coming days. Password, fluidity But the beating heart of a sports simulation remains playability, and then once you take the field it is impossible not to notice the tweaks and refinements made by EA Sports to the controls, which are now more responsive, and to the general fluidity. Athletes, in fact, react faster on the field to the inputs they receive, and can naturally perform an innumerable series of movements. Merit of the Real Player technology, which has increased the animations and made them much more natural even when it comes to micro-movements. In this way the action always develops in a fluid way, and the movements of the players are even more related to the dynamics related to running and body gestures in faif acceleration and deceleration, dribbling or changes of direction. In combination with what has just been described, there is a slightly more refined physics management than last year, which is felt for example at every contact, an improved artificial intelligence and a more credible ball in the way it ~behaves~, especially in rebounds. As a result, actions, even personal ones, such as goal shots and passes are more unpredictable; as far as teamwork is concerned, the search for physical contact, the will to manage the ball without losing it with abstruse plays, the commitment made until the end are just some of the key elements that distinguish him. More generally, each training tends to mirror in the way they act that of their respective real counterparts, or at least so do the most famous clubs and national teams. Which translates into an increase in the level of difficulty that goes hand in hand with the increased realism, and in a pace of play that is sometimes frenetic, other times reasoned, depending on the teams in the field or the result, but always plausible. My name is Cristiano Ronaldo In the offensive phase there is more variety in the development of the actions and in the degree of participation of the team members, among other things better positioned on the pitch, with sensible overlaps on the outside by wingers or full-backs, central insertions in turn by the midfielders, and attackers who, depending on their skills, try to dialogue with quick one-twos, to create spaces or to avoid ending up offside. Similarly in the defensive phase the teams are more careful not to give space and to try to avoid one-on-ones, with the full-backs ready to support the work of the centre-backs with rapid diagonals. Goalkeepers are also more reactive, especially on outings, even if they occasionally get surprised at the near post. Overcoming the defenses with vertical launches or sudden spurts is difficult, unless you find yourself having to overturn a situation perhaps in a corner kick, just as it is difficult to unbalance the opponent's marker and overcome the more physical ones, which requires good timing and a careful evaluation of the action in progress. This does not mean that the play of the champion cannot have any effect or that it is not foreseen, on the contrary: a number of Cristiano Ronaldo can always blow up the bank. In this sense, a moment of distraction is enough for the defender: losing the man who is marking or giving him that extra centimeter to allow him to feint or dribble and the omelette is done. The CPU AI takes into account the player's defensive errors and often exploits them properly to go on goal. And that's not all: the new dribbling mechanics really allow for tighter changes of direction and, as seen before, more precise touches, even light ones, which in combination with what has already been written about Real Player technology, can be devastating. Worth mentioning is a small but nice novelty, that is, the one relating to the substitutions that can be performed even without having to leave the match. Like on television Moving on to analyze the technological part, we can only underline the goodness of the work of the EA Sports graphics and the good use of Frostbite in packaging a product visually similar to a television production. From this point of view, the direction of the game performs well, which is particularly exalted in those tournaments such as La Liga and the Premier League covered by an official license, and which therefore offer presentations and superimposed graphics taken from real British and Spanish TV broadcasts . FIFA 18 then takes a further leap forward on PlayStation 4 also as regards the representation of players, shirts, and surrounding elements, which are confirmed to be of excellent workmanship, with attention to every minimum detail. Regarding the athletes, not all the faces are actually updated, but we can't complain, especially considering how the proportions of the polygonal models and their animations in general have been improved, as we wrote earlier in this article. Then those of the most famous footballers are customized, and almost represent the state of the art for a sports simulation like this. The stadiums were excellent as always, animated by a very detailed audience and decorated with new banners and objects that vary according to the nation they belong to, just as climate management changes. There are four novelties in this sense, which are the Huddersfield and Brighton facilities which further enrich the already numerous arena colony of the Premier League, the Wanda Metropolitano of Atletico Madrid and the StubHun Center of Los Angeles FC. Absent the Camp Nou again, but it was obvious,while for Italy there are only Juventus' Allianz Stadium, Milan's San Siro and Rome's Stadio Olimpico. For its part, the audio is as always of a high level, with sounds, choirs and background effects capable of ideally catapulting the gamer into a real arena. Also in this case, depending on the gaming facilities and the regions of the world where the matches take place, the noises, the tunes, the intensity and certain characteristics of the cheering also change. A real show that helps to immerse yourself further in the context of a match or competition. The Italian commentary, as always entrusted to Pierluigi Pardo and Stefano Nava, was a bit disappointing. It's true, there are many new sentences, but basically we have a fluctuating commentary, with Pardo almost always ~dynamic~ and spontaneous, and Nava on the other hand ~mechanical and slow~ in having his say on the various actions. Even with all the sympathy for the former AC Milan player, perhaps the time has come for a change.", "date": "2017-09-21", "grade": "9.0"}
