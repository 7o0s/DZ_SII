The release of The Collectables on the App Store can therefore be seen a bit as the closing of a multiplatform circle, let's call it that, considering the excellent glance that the developers have managed to get on iOS devices as well. In fact, it is rare to appreciate such detailed polygonal grass in the mobile sector, which moves following the wind, such convincing explosions and a lighting system that enhances both the sun's rays, which draw shadows on the asphalt, and the fires lit in the middle of a camp. For 60%, to quote Yerli, we are here; So let's see how the rest of the game is. Free to download according to the traditional freemium model, The Collectables is a real-time strategy game that mimics the movie ~The Expendables~ and puts us in command of a team made up of four heavily armed mercenaries who find themselves facing a entire army of ruthless guerrillas within a single player campaign consisting of over forty missions, each replayable several times to get money, experience points and extra ~diesel~. Diesel represents the virtual currency of the Crytek title, and by spending it between one stage and another we will be able to enhance the team characters and their special equipment, ranging from explosives to first aid kits, from momentary boosts to cloaking devices. This part of the experience is managed through a system based on trading cards, even if some of the features often seen in strategy games of the genre are missing (the merger of two or more identical cards, for example). To obtain further cards and therefore increase our chances of success in the more advanced missions, a second currency is needed, the gold bars, which however can be obtained almost exclusively by putting your hand in your wallet. The inevitable ~paywall~, typical of freemium productions, peeps out after completing a couple of scenarios, with enemies suddenly becoming more resistant to our blows, but with a little ~grinding~ and strategy you can easily pass overcome these difficulties and carry out the campaign. The now inevitable energy points, in fact, allow you to try your hand at quite a few levels before forcing us to pause to restore them. Half hawk The control system adopted by Crytek for The Collectables obviously uses the touch screen and is very simple to master. By touching any point on the map we will order the team to move in that direction, automatically attacking all enemies within shotgun range, while by dragging just one of the characters in the group we will be able to give him specific tasks and order him, for example, to take up position behind a shelter in order to be more effective in a firefight without losing too much energy. Unfortunately this very mechanism, which should have given the experience that something extra, turns out to be inconvenient to implement and poorly supported by the interface. This practically always leads to advancing blindly, trying to hit the opponents closely, bypassing their shelters. Thus a tactical element capable of diversifying and enhancing the gameplay is lost, which without it remains flat and devoid of acute details. It's a shame because, as mentioned, The Collectables lacked practically nothing to establish itself: it has a very valuable technical sector, a lot of missions with an excellent replayability incentive (and additional quests from week to week), a relative elasticity for as regards the stakes of the freemium model, a decent artificial intelligence and a good variety in terms of characters and special abilities. The Collectables boasts impressive graphics and a full-bodied campaign, but the gameplay doesn't take off", "date": "2014-03-26", "grade": "7.0"}
