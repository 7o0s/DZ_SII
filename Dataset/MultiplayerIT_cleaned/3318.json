{"name": "Vampire: The Masquerade - Coteries of New York", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/vampire-the-masquerade-coteries-of-new-york-la-recensione.html", "text": "More than fifteen years have passed since the publication of the controversial Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines, a title developed by the defunct Troika which at the time was at the center of violent controversy as it was released largely incomplete by the publisher Activision. However, the foundations were solid and a large group of modders was soon formed who have continued, up to today, to release unofficial patches that make the experience more complete than what programmers, with the scarce funds at their disposal in the post-launch, they had managed to offer to the public. Some time ago the rights to the franchise passed to Paradox which, taking advantage of the popularity of this late-breakout cult, decided to entrust the sequel to Hardsuite Labs, a developer from Seattle (where Bloodlines II will be set, among other things) struggling with the first major title after a series of prestigious collaborations (including Gears Of War 4) in which he always remained behind the scenes. The release of the new Masquerade chapter is expected in a few months, but to while away the wait you could try the new game by Draw Distance, formerly known as iFun4all, a small team from Krakow that has obtained the official license for the development of this Coteries of New York whose review you read. Literary Vampires You know the old game books? Transport them to a PC screen, add colorful artwork, combine everything with a soundtrack capable of melting the synapses after a few minutes and you will have obtained the Draw Distance game. We know that now this genre must be cataloged under the name of visual novels, but compared to titles like The Wolf Among Us (whose budget was of a much different level), Coteries of New York adds, unfortunately only by hinting them, those gaming nuances of role that are part of the DNA of the White Wolf franchise. The interface is reduced to a minimum: in practice, apart from a dialog with multiple choice answers, there is only an icon that allows you to re-read the previous lines of text. The initial choice must be made between three pre-established protagonists: it is not possible to personalize their characteristics, given that each of them lives in well-defined situations in which it would have been too difficult to adapt a plurality of characters. Different moments of the story are shared: for example all three, despite themselves, are transformed into vampires by a mysterious individual, and all three are introduced into the Camarilla, despite being part of different clans (in this case Brujah, Ventrue and Toreador). The story develops, as easily understood from the title, in the city of New York whose neighborhoods are described in great detail, almost too many for those who have never visited the Big Apple. In addition to the main quest, the player is also called to follow alternative paths that will lead him to make allies (or enemies) with other clans, following a night / day pattern. During the hours of darkness it is not possible to follow all the available missions, so several attempts are needed to fully explore the game. In practice, however, the plot develops on a well-defined path, and always ends in the same way regardless of the choices made which therefore limit themselves to modifying completely secondary aspects. Unfortunately, there are passages in which the consequences of the answers are not clear, but fortunately these episodes are not too frequent. There's also the risk of arriving at the title screen too early - although the text usually helps tell when you're overshooting the limit - and then there's always the option to load a previous save. Words just words The writer is not a literary critic, therefore it is difficult to make ~technical~ judgments on the quality of the writing, even more so if it is a foreign language; however, the text is full of details that help to identify with the situation, whether you are inside a limousine stuck in Manhattan traffic or in the middle of the night, under the Unisphere at Corona Park in Flushing Meadows. During the dialogues some keywords highlighted in bold go to populate the glossary where the most used terms in the world of Vampire are explained, such as Kindred, Vessel, Court, Kine, Sire: in short, a breviary useful especially for newbies of White's role-playing game Wolf. The soundtrack is psychedelic, and adheres perfectly to the dark style of Vampire. From time to time it is seasoned with some environmental effect that underlines an event (the closing of a door, the sipping of a glass of... blood). Unfortunately the voice acting is missing, which is a real shame because they could have given a touch ofmore personality to the production of Draw Distance. The artistic style of the tables is pleasant; they are enriched with some special effect that makes them less static, but it is a pity that they are not numerous and consequently they are recycled too often. The pace of Coteries of New York, not frantic in itself, is slowed down by the English language (there are no other translations) and therefore a few more moments of concentration are required to be able to mentally translate the text.", "date": "2019-12-14", "grade": "6.3"}
