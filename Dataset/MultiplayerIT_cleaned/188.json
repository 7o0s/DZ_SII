{"name": "Sam &amp; Max Episode 2: Situation: Comedy - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sam-amp-max-episode-2-situation-comedy-recensione.html", "text": "A day on set After a first phase set in Sam & Max's office and in the surrounding neighborhood, the player will be engaged for almost the entire course of the experience within the studios where the curious infringement of the law took place. To unravel the skein a series of situations taken from some famous television programs will have to be completed: it will happen, for example, to participate in a singing competition for young talents, or even to have to win a revisited and corrected version, in a comic key, of ~Who Wants to Be a Millionaire~ and play the lead role in a sitcom, hence the title of the game itself. This particular narrative development fortunately has a certain weight in the economy of the gameplay, which tries to faithfully reproduce the rhythms of the small screen; you must therefore complete entire sequences of puzzles without ever making a mistake, so as to have a recording of the transmission without interruptions. These blocks can be solved, by a player of average skill, without an excessive number of attempts, resulting pleasant and satisfying and distinguishing themselves from the past for greater sanity. The absolute protagonist of each puzzle always remains irony, which will not be spared to reflect on the most disparate themes and which, although over the top, never proves vulgar. The sessions in the car have been maintained, which as in Culture Shock only represent a fun diversion between one phase of exploration and the next, without too many pretensions. The controls and inventory management are also unchanged, although this time some objects will have to be modified several times, thus increasing the depth of their management. Longevity is perhaps even less than that already experienced in the first episode of Season 1, limited to about three hours. Nothing to worry about though, the price is still 7 euros and in any case we're talking about a product that must be viewed from the perspective of a larger project. Endless references Telltale Games promised it: every single chapter of Season 1 is absolutely independent from the others, leaving total decision-making freedom on which one to buy; that said, nothing prevents programmers from creating some small references that embellish the work and make fans happy. Therefore, the inevitable presence of Soda Poppers, the group of young pop stars who in Culture Shock had fallen victim to the hypnosis of Brady Culturetuture or even of Sybill, the young ~know-it-all~ once a psychotherapist, now director of a specialized tabloid newspaper in UFO sightings. The only direct references to the previous (dis)adventures are instead conveyed by the interventions of Max, who despite his psychotic and sociopathic character, proves to be a source of valuable advice and a healthy bearer of some ineluctable truths. Handbook of good programming Graphically, Situation Comedy looks exactly like Culture Shock: the same cartoonish style, the same rather low polygon count and the same really nice textures. Similar speech for the sound, very good, regarding which the presence of a new voice actor for Max should only be signaled, which replaces the one previously chosen, repeating his skill and perhaps surpassing it. The great skill with which the game has been programmed also deserves to be praised. In particular, a comfortable and elegant solution has been found to prevent Sam from hindering Max's movements and analysis of the objects: when he meets the rabbit in his tracks, he throws him a powerful punch that throws him into the air, making him land in another area of the screen of less interest. No bugs have been found and the uploads are fast on average, it can only happen that the image freezes for a second or two, and then restarts without further hesitation.

Situation Comedy maintains the qualities already appreciated in Culture Shock, adding a gameplay strongly influenced by the TV setting and a more sensible presentation of the puzzles. Three more hours of laughter and mysteries, therefore, that no lover of the genre should miss, waiting for the third episode in March. Pros Well balanced puzzles Technicallyand valuable considering the requirements Gameplay with original ideas Cons Wait another month to play the third episode Graphic adventures remain a niche genre Just over a month has passed since Sam & Max made their triumphant return with Culture Shock and we are already ready to review this Situation Comedy, second episode of the exalogy Sam & Max Season 1. If for the first the expectations were linked to the very long gestation that had distinguished it, in this case we find ourselves in exactly the opposite situation: publishing several sequels in such a short period of time is inevitably a risky solution, given that it is necessary to satisfy the tastes of those who have already enjoyed the first work, while tracing new paths that make the product original. In this new chapter, the two freelance policemen will have to deal with the terrible Myra, presenter of a famous talk show who, in the throes of a fit, kidnaps the innocent public in her recording studio, threatening not to release them if they are not fulfilled his bizarre and enigmatic requests. Once again, therefore, the plot is bizarre and draws liberally from the daily life of the American people, constantly sitting in front of the television.", "date": "2007-01-03", "grade": null}
