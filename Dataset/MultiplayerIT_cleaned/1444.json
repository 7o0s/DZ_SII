{"name": "Greyhawk : Tempio del Male elementale", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/greyhawk-tempio-del-male-elementale.html", "text": "Troika Games The Greyhawk development team is undoubtedly one of the most famous when it comes to RPGs. The spiritual father of the team is Tim Cain who has worked for many years in Interplay and has personally supervised the development of that absolute masterpiece that bears the name of Fallout. The departure of Tim Cain, and other current members of Troika Games, from Interplay led to the birth of this group, back in 1998, which makes experience in the rpg field one of its winning pillars. Troika Games' first work was Arcanum. Defining this title is problematic. Arcanum was in many respects an incredibly revolutionary game, for example the setting, the high number of dialogues whose quality is almost comparable to those of Torment, the rich and varied gameplay with many very different quests. All these aspects make Arcanum a masterpiece. Unfortunately some defects, largely attributable to the less than perfect balance of the combat, prevented Arcanum from rising to the rank of unforgettable game. Troika Games is currently making its third title: Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines, a first-person RPG that has the same graphics engine as Half-life 2 and which has already made a lot of noise after the publication of the first images. With his second work, Greyhawk: Temple of Elemental Evil, the Troika tries to create a masterpiece of the rpg sector on a par with the various Baldur's Gate, Fallout, Morrowind and Torment. Will she succeed? Rules and Setting Greyhawk: Temple of Elemental Evil is the PC revival of a very famous D&D paper adventure. The name of these rules and of this setting in general is synonymous with a guarantee of fun for hardened gamers even if it is fair to say that even today many have doubts about the real ductility of these rules and above all about the D&D setting decidedly tending towards combat and to action at the expense of a more thoughtful game. The perplexities obviously also embrace the PC or console conversions of these RPGs which generally really tend towards combat, perhaps the only exception in this sense was Planescape Torment. The latest effort from Troika Games boasts the complete implementation of the latest set of D&D rules, version 3.5 to be exact. This version does not bring ~important~ corrections compared to the previous 3.0 but it is still true that the game benefits from greater stability and completeness from this point of view. Rules and Setting The porting of these rules to PC was done with unmatched craftsmanship by Tim Cain's staff. In recent months we had defined Icewind Dale 2 as the new benchmark for this aspect. We are pleased today instead to tell you that in our view Temple of Elemental Evil shows even better than the Black Isle game. The creation of the character, or the party, is incredibly exciting and complete. The more experienced will be happy to be able to balance every single character down to the smallest detail, to be able to choose from many talents and abilities. Unlike Bioware with Neverwinter Nights, Troika Games has opted for a more faithful and also more complete conversion of the rules. A touch of class is also the possibility of viewing always different game beginnings based on the alignment chosen for our party. This aspect is not only limited to the beginning of the game but rather manifests itself with specific missions for each alignment and also different endings. The first steps in the game Once the game is launched after having created our group of adventurers we are catapulted into the first city named Hommlet. Graphically I think I can say without contradiction that Greyhwahk is the new term of comparison and reference for what concerns RPGs with an isometric view. From the very first bars of the game, one is struck by the beauty of the settings and by the feeling of really being in a living world. This is undoubtedly thanks to the programmers' choice not to re-propose an RPG with an isometric view with the background images drawn and displayed on the screen and with the characters moving, therefore, against this background that is beautiful to look at but still stable, still, ~ died~. With respect to this option, Troika Games has instead decided to create all aspects of the game in three dimensions, with the exception of the background, and then insert them into the game. Hence, our characters will move under trees that are not only drawn but ~alive~. Trees therefore that move with the wind, mill wheels that turn, insects that look like firefliesthe least dark nocturnal route, water of the rivers that moves as we cross, fog that rises from the waters of the ponds at night, etc., etc. The same goes for the animations of the characters which, since they are no longer simple ~sprites~ as in Baldur's Gate and the like, can move on the screen with greater detail than the animations both in terms of body movements, such as attacks or running for example, but also with regard to clothing (very beautiful in my view the animations of the cloaks). But that's not the only thing that makes Greyhawk's visuals so satisfying. The buildings are also done beautifully as are the VFX spells. The only flaw from this point of view is the excessive heaviness of the graphics engine that suffers from having to reproduce all these elements on video. Moving the play area is largely very slow, unlike other games such as Icewind Dale and similar where it was sufficient to move the cursor to the edges of the screen to move the view. The same expedient can be used in Greyhawk with the only defect of the slowness of the movement which often forces the player to keep one hand fixed on the keyboard and on the directional arrows in order to move the play area displayed on the screen. The first steps in the game Once we have ~recovered~ and become accustomed to the graphics so pleasing to the eyes our heroes are invited to visit Hommlet. During this first phase of the game we were very surprised by the variety of the game play. In fact, to be honest, prejudices wanted Greyhawk to be a game purely set on combat, and we can partially confirm this trend. During the first phase of the game, on the other hand, one is struck by the variety of quests and above all by the importance of talents and ancillary skills to combat for the solution of the first missions. In fact, skills such as Diplomacy, Intimidation, Bluff will be very important; and it will not only be essential to have chosen them from those available, but also their development since if a mission requires the ~unblocking~ of a dialogue, this can only be obtained with a certain skill score and not with its simple usage. The richness of the missions and their variety has greatly impressed us and makes the first part of the game quite varied and fun. The fight Continuing in the game, after having more hours of play behind it, the purely combative soul of Greyhawk emerges clearly but above all how revolutionary and complete the combat system of this title is. Also in this case, as for the graphic design, we are faced with the best turn-based combat system created so far, unique, revolutionary and captivating. In fact, once you get close to an enemy, the game calculates based on our statistics who should take the initiative and the order in which all the protagonists of the fight will have to move appears on the top screen. This first aspect, sometimes underestimated, is very important in the economy of a duel and is undoubtedly very strategic. Many times I found myself having to repeat a fight and I noticed how this was often different from my previous attempt thanks to the calculation of the initiative and therefore of the order in which the characters can move (for example if our magician is the first to be able to move he could cast a spell that prevents the movement of enemies, although he generally cannot do this when he is last in the turn and our opponents are already in hand-to-hand combat). The fight After the movement sequence has been created our characters go into duel mode and get ready for battle. A vertical bar divided into two colors will appear on the monitor: green and yellow. These two colors show the ~width~ of our moves and therefore which moves we can make or how far we can move before the turn for the single character is over. If our actions consume only the green part of the time bar then our character will be able to carry out these actions and will also have time to do other things within the same turn. If, on the other hand, our moves consume both the green and yellow bars, our character is allowed to carry out these actions with the only condition that after the turn it is automatically over for that character. Important qHence it is always to make sure that you have time available to successfully carry out the chosen move. For example, if we want to make a movement with our character and subsequently hit the enemy in the same turn, we must make sure that the movement is not too long as to prevent us from subsequently hitting and therefore not having ~given~ the movement to the enemy who during his round he won't even have to move towards us to hit us. The ~calculation~ of our moves or our movements within the turn is of fundamental importance and it is therefore essential to note that we are able to control the extent of our moves simply by moving the cursor on the screen and observing how it changes color (from green to yellow and finally to red) based on how long our approach movement is to the enemy. The combat options and strategies are so many that it is difficult to describe them in a small space but it is right to highlight how complete they are. In fact, we will be able to opt for a completely defensive fight which will increase our defensive capabilities but at the same time reduce our effectiveness in hitting or use the whole turn to hit an enemy or deliver a coup de grace etc, etc. Finally, a personal consideration. In such a well-crafted turn-based combat system, it also allows beginners who do not have hours and hours of paper and PC game behind them to understand on the fly what certain characteristics of the D&D rules are. I give the example of the attack of opportunity comparing it to other titles released and with real-time combat. During combat in real time you see the words ~attack of opportunity~ appear without actually understanding what happened and what generated it. Instead in Greyhawk everything is rather linear and it is immediately understood that an attack of opportunity is an attack that we grant or is granted to us if during the fight we move away from our enemy or if we try to hit him from a short distance with non-melee weapons such as bows or if we try to cast a spell when we are close to a warrior ready to strike us. All this demonstrates the goodness of the programmers' choice to opt for a turn-based combat system that is not even boring and slow by virtue of the excellent balance of the duels. The fight A touch of class is, not only during combat, the implementation of the physicality of objects. For example, if we have an object in front of us such as a rock, our archer will not be able to hit the enemy behind him because he simply won't see it; but not only that, doors and corners also play an important role and can be used to hide from enemies. The same concept is applied to the visual cone of the character. Unlike other games with an isometric view, where we could see the whole game area after having explored it, in Greyhawk we will only be able to see what our characters can observe. In fact, moving around a large boulder we will notice how the part behind it is hidden from our eyes and obscured just like it happens to the eyes of the character who certainly cannot see through the rock to find out what is behind it. Trying to move around the rock we will notice how the dark part changes just like the visual cone of the character. Is all that glitters gold? So far the review has praised the game: better graphics, rules implemented in a very detailed way, excellent turn-based combat system. Unfortunately, however, Greyhawk basically stops here, and this absolutely does not mean that the product is little, indeed quite the opposite, but frankly we expected more. The cities are rather ~dead~, very few NPCs, in the streets almost nobody walking or moving. The npc have no hint of scripting that gives them a small semblance of life, and in this sense Gothic remains light years compared to all the other titles made so far. It is frankly a bit frustrating to walk around the city and to notice how an NPC has no life apart from going to retire to his home at sunset. The texture is also almost non-existent. Our group is called to the first city and from there the main events of the game are all rather obvious, we immediately know that we will go to the Temple to eradicate evil. This does not mean lack of originality also because the fact that the game was inspired by the paper form left little room for developers, however this is not a justification for such linearity.
