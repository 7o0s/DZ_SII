{"name": "NASCAR Racing 2002 Season", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nascar-racing-2002-season_a.html", "text": "Targeted improvements It is evident that Nascar 2002 represents the evolution of the previous title, therefore what we must observe are the differences and if these are such as to justify the purchase. Well, then let's start with the graphics which have been revised in many of its parts and have undergone precise optimization work. Let's see the new features in detail: The car models are now made with a greater number of polygons and covered with new and more defined textures that improve their visual impact, the same care has been taken in the circuits which have also increased in number and are all those that make up the 2002 season with the exception of a fantasy super oval 3 miles long and expressly designed for the most incredible On-Line challenges, the cockpit has undergone small refinements and is even more realistic, finally the graphics engine has undergone a heavy optimization work that has improved its already excellent performance, as well as supporting the OpenGL mode. The game interface and menus have also been redesigned, nothing striking or particularly important, but a shot of powder even in the interface doesn't really hurt. Can't you find? The sound sector has undergone a small revolution and is approaching absolute perfection, with the sounds of the cars having achieved extraordinary realism. The AI which was one of the few weak points of Nascar 4 and which now reaches absolute levels of excellence has also definitely improved. The cream of a driving simulator is the physical engine and that of Nascar 4 already bordering on perfection, yet Papy does not like to rest on his laurels and also improves this component, above all I have noticed improvements regarding the behavior of the tires, which in Nascar 2002 has become even more realistic, and at the same time the Force Feedback has also been improved, making it appear even more solid and realistic. In short, as you understand Dave Kaemmer and associates have changed almost everything, optimizing the game in a substantial way and making it almost a different title. In a word: good! and pleasant news But Nascar 2002 is not only the result of an in-depth (I would say maniacal) refinement and optimization work, but also offers pleasant novelties among which the replay theater stands out. In practice, from today it will be possible to create real quality multimedia videos by owning only a simple Nascar replay to which text, special effects, images, an audio commentary and much more can be easily added. Simply fantastic. If someone wonders what is the use of such a thing in a simulator, the answer is quite simple. Meanwhile to satisfy the most narcissistic part of us, but above all to make interesting videos on the races that take place online. An example of the power of this tools is present within the game with useful Driving Lessons, created to let us know most of the circuits, the racing strategies and many other information on Nascar races. One of a kind multiplayer Praises for Nascar (and in general for Papy titles) are wasted: excellent graphics, reference physics engine, incomparable management of controls and force feedback and blah blah blah..... in short, many words to express the simple concept that Nascar is the absolute benchmark in the field of driving simulators (Kaemmer how much a new open wheel simulation?). Yet we have not mentioned the aspect where the differences become even more marked to the point of becoming unsustainable and mortifying for the competition: Multiplayer. Where the direct competitors offer (we are talking about the most gifted titles) barely a skimpy support for 8 players, Nascar 2002 supports 43 competitors and you just need a decent connection to secure a place on the grid. In short, the real show of Nascar are the On-Line races that reach an almost absolute degree of realism and to take part you just have to sign up, launch the game, enter your account and as if by magic you will enter a world made of engines and bits, in which we are the absolute protagonists. Just think of the On-Line Racing phenomenon born thanks to the Papyrus simulators and its numerous championships (such as those organized by Driving Italia or Racesim), where the best virtual drivers (and others) engage in breathtaking races. Conclusions After having praised Nascar 2002 throughout the article, there is no other conclusion than to elect it as the best driving simulator around, light years away from the competition. And that's that. Rather, the only problem comes from the lack of interest that the European public shows towards the car races that take place in aoval, therefore more than a review we need an article on Nascar races, who knows if you don't want to try it. Software craftsmen There are software-houses that publish their games with very specific cadences focusing mainly on market dynamics and others that instead are more concerned with the quality of their products and consequently reduce the frequency of their publications. I compare the latter to good craftsmen, who first of all love their products and who therefore, far from excessive market extremisms, focus more on the quality of the product in order to make it as good as possible. In short, few but good. Yet one of these producers, the ~mythical~ Papyrus, has contravened what I have just said above, given that just one year after the publication of the excellent Nascar 4 (one of last year's best titles), it publishes a new title, subject of this review, which replaces the previous one and which, unlike what we saw in the past, where only simple Add-Ons had been published between one title and another, presents us with a completely new title. We are obviously talking about Nascar 2002, the last chapter of the very successful series on covered-wheel cars which is so popular in North America.", "date": "2002-03-23", "grade": null}
