This is a rather common practice, especially in the field of independent games, where in the face of a limited amount of content or technical constructions, simple and engaging ideas are used, often linked to the basic factors of video games: figures, colors, speed of reflections, application of forces on objects. With the use of modern simulation algorithms of the latter we are able today to enjoy simple games that make the use of physics their founding element, as in this case. And Yet It Moves manages to upset the typical structure of the platform game, one of the most solid and historically established in the videogame market, eliminating any boundary element beyond the protagonist, the platforms and some obstacles along the way, yet managing to propose puzzles intelligent and an absolutely original approach. How is it possible? Simply introducing an additional element to simple running and jumping: the ability to rotate the screen at will at any moment of the game, thus opening up an infinite number of new possibilities for interacting with the scenario. At the simple press of a button, the game action freezes allowing you to rotate the screen but keeping the main character in the position in which he is, which determines the instantaneous modification of the surrounding scenario in reference to where the protagonist is placed. The implications of this mode of interaction are multiple, allowing both the reaching of new areas with the transformation of the ~morphology~ of the platforms, and the possibility of solving various puzzles based on gravity and physics, through the forced movement of objects present in the scenario. A simple but brilliant idea that adapts well to a small game, like this work of Broken Rules. Move with care What makes the game action sensible and enjoyable, despite the absurdity of the premises amplified by the particular rather dreamlike graphic style, is the coherence with which the scenario rotation mechanism has been implemented in the gameplay. By modifying the surrounding environment, the protagonist also consequently suffers the effects of the rotation, both in the positive effects and in the potentially lethal ones. For example, by inverting the position of the platforms and creating the void under the feet of the main character, this will fall into the abyss created with uniformly accelerated motion based on a realistic simulation of gravity and only a quick repositioning of the platforms under his feet or the creation of a ~slide~ through the rotation of these can save it from a lethal crash. In the same way, the laws of physics apply to the mobile elements of the scenario, giving way to move stones, open passages, deliver objects to various more or less hostile animal figures or carry out more complex actions such as triggering a reaction with fire to ignite certain background elements or move a protagonist's doppelganger in a particular way. In a succession of increasingly strange and complicated situations, the game does everything possible not to let the attention drop on the action in progress, making sure that, just when you think you have everything under control, new elements always pop up with which interact, in a succession of surprises. On the other hand, it is precisely the pleasure of simple interaction with the screen that pushes the player to move forward, given the total lack of narration and extra-game elements and precisely due to the ephemeral nature of this entertainment, it is also a pleasure that does not last very long , considering that it takes about 3 hours to finish the game. These can be expanded a bit by the possibility of tackling the levels in new ways, involving for example the amount of lives to be used to the maximum or the time taken, but the ~short but intense~ substance of this title, a characteristic of another typical part of ~indie~ games. The progression between the levels is fluid and natural, without abrupt increases in difficulty but with a constant evolution of the puzzles and the skill required to complete the labyrinthine schemes, which are also well scattered with checkpoints in order to avoid the frustration of having to redo big game fragments due to minor errors, since these also happen frequently. A strange rotating world The transposition from PC to Wii has kept theaesthetic aspect of And Yet It Moves, substantially applying only the control system via ~motion sensing~ through the remote control, a choice that immediately reveals itself as intuitive and precise, although not very comfortable due to the need to rotate the controller along the longitudinal axis, basically ~twisting~ the wrist. The feeling, however, is excellent, making entry and exit from the pause situation fast and fluid, which allows you to rotate the scenario by simply holding down the A key with consequent inclination of the remote control, a solution that seems to make the game truly born to be enjoyed on the Wii. The characterization given by the graphic sector has something poetic and dreamlike, at times disturbing in its abstraction based on decidedly realistic elements. The effect is that of a collage: the bizarre constructions of objects that make up the scenarios are made by superimposing textures that are in some cases extremely detailed, superimposed on each other in a crude way, or hooked together without too much care in wanting to maintain proportions realistic. On the other hand, the main character himself seems drawn with a deliberately childish trait, like a fragile little paper man torn from a sheet of notebook, dragged into a strange world and jerked by the force of gravity, the same sensation that the player experiences in contact with this particular title. The alienating feeling is then amplified by the good audio sector, which above all thanks to the music halfway between psychedelic and almost new-age evocative, manages to further characterize this game as a very special experience.", "date": "2010-09-06", "grade": "8.5"}
