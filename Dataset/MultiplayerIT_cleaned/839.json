{"name": "Rainbow Six 4: Lockdown", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rainbow-six-4-lockdown.html", "text": "Wind of change Let's start with one of the few things in the Rainbow Six tradition that this Lockdown has been able to keep intact, or rather the Clancy-style story that forms the backdrop to the Campaign mode. This time the problems to solve for our agents will be two, namely the hunt for a group of terrorists in possession of a lethal virus and the rescue of a member of the team taken hostage by the aforementioned villains. Rather conventional but still effective, the Lockdown plot paves the way for yet another adventure by Domingo Chavez and associates, which, as we said at the beginning, is affected by several changes compared to the previous chapter. Changes, needless to say, in the negative. If the basic structure of the single player has remained substantially unchanged (Captain Ding commanded by the player and the other three operatives managed by the CPU under orders from the same user), conversely a considerable amount of playful aspects have been heavily modified in the name of a highly questionable imbalance of the title towards the arcade, or worse still caused by obvious defaults on the part of the developers. The first perplexities are aroused by the unnatural movements of our agents, who are excessively quick with their legs and incredibly slow in performing basic actions such as opening doors, climbing stairs, throwing grenades, zooming in with the weapon and so on. Even the simple gesture of leaning out of the corners seems to have been badly done in this Lockdown, which officially throws almost all the semblances of realism of Rainbow Six 3 into the trash. Starting with the look and behavior of the various guns: plasticky, too little differentiated l 'from each other and much less likely as regards their use in battle. The action game-style energy gauge and the ridiculous amount of blood gushing from the bodies of the affected agents are other small details that make you understand the bad turn taken by Lockdown. And the thing does not end there: although it has never really been a trademark of the series, the AI of enemies and companions really manages to hit rock bottom in this last chapter. The ~terrorists~ follow established patterns, which often result in standing still waiting to be killed. A grenade under your shoes? A hole in your neighbor's head? It matters little. The enemies of Lockdown are totally disinterested in the events around them. This and the presence of some gadgets capable of revealing the presence of terrorists beyond the walls definitively kill every possible tactical element still surviving in the last work Red Storm. You no longer need to organize and plan your attacks: just run and shoot head down and the Lockdown Campaign runs off smooth as oil. It follows that not even providing orders to one's companions has any use anymore, and in fact it is exactly like this: despite the addition of some new commands - which are completely insignificant - it is much easier to do all the work by yourself, either for the lack of enemy resistance, or for the questionable brilliance and efficiency of the supporting actors. other aspects of reality However, one of the most ~glaring~ novelties of Lockdown is the introduction of some sniper missions under the command of the German Dieter Weber which break up the rhythm of the 14 scenarios of the Campaign (16 in the PS2 version). In these stages the user has the task of providing cover to the other members of the team by taking out all the visible ... or presumed terrorists. Yes, because the dear boys of Red Storm have well thought of filling these sections with enemies armed with rocket launchers that are absolutely impossible to identify before the good Dieter blows up thanks to them. Everything is therefore reduced to a laconic process of continuous saving and equally frequent loading in order to anticipate the launch of the missiles at our address. Here, Lockdown also allows you to save the game at any time during each mission, making the Campaign even easier and more insipid. You are not satisfied with having robbed the single player experience of all those elements that made it interesting in the previous Rainbow Six 3, the Red Storm developers attempted the coup by also trying to brutalize the online multiplayer mode, fortunately without completely succeeding. Co-operatives, Deathmatch and company can still be played decently, albeit significantly reduced by the defects highlighted above, especially with regard to the movements of the characters and the effectiveness of the available arsenal. However, the rare inconvenience of the lobby menus and some serious lag problems that occurred during our tests should be noted. The most relevant novelty in terms of multiplayer is however constituted by the P.E.C. (only for Xbox), which allows you to create your own character by choosing from some ridiculous aesthetic patterns and above all from four different specializations: Assault, Infiltrator, Engineer and Doctor. Each class has specific skills and items of equipment that can be developed or purchased by spending the points obtained from online game sessions. A valid idea on paper, which transposed on the screen denotes various structural limitations and ingenuity: in addition to the considerable amount of points (and therefore time) required to increase the character's statistics, the evident lack of balancing of the entire system, with level 1 users practically hopeless against more advanced players. Compare versions Among the three versions of Rainbow Six: Lockdown, the winning palm undoubtedly belongs to the Xbox one, not so much for technical merits but rather for the greater depth of the multiplayer part (with the P.E.C. mode) and for the overwhelming superiority of the Live service compared to to online for PS2. For the rest, the differences are very minimal, with Sony users who can console themselves with two more single-player maps and some slightly different contour elements. Instead, the Gamecube version deserves a separate discussion, by far the worst: the total absence of an online mode completely cuts off the legs of a game that makes this aspect its only real appeal, with the consequences of the case. Eye contact Under the technical front, the Rainbow Six series has never gotten used to great things, and Lockdown is no exception. Graphically, the Red Storm title is slightly superior to the prequel, however proving to be very inconstant in its cosmetics, with some rather successful glimpses alternating with others that literally pale in comparison to today's more illustrious productions. The scenarios suffer from a clear lack of inventiveness in terms of setting (the factory, the ship, the office complex... we're still there) but they still prove to be technically sufficient for a multi-platform production. Instead, the lighting and shadow system (which often appears to be managed totally at random), the - obscene - graphic effects concerning grenades and bullets and the modeling of the characters, rather approximate and incomplete in terms of animations, leave somewhat perplexing. To say the least, the almost total absence of interactivity with the setting is scandalous by today's standards, timidly compensated by the rag-doll physical management of the bodies. Note of demerit for the cosmetic device that sanctions the low energy of one's soldier, or the broken visor with a lot of slight motion blur: annoying and useless. As for the sound, there isn't much to say: the Italian dubbing is decent, enriched with those translation errors that are always nice, while sound effects and music (few) are generally average. Comment Rainbow Six: Lockdown represents, in no uncertain terms, a very evident step backwards compared to its predecessor. Characterized by an inappropriate and moreover clumsy arcade imprint and robbed of a good part of the most personal and fascinating elements of the series, Lockdown not only disappoints fans of the series, but it cannot even be a valid attraction for less savvy players, given its certainly not excellent technical and playful qualities. Cloying in single player, Lockdown manages to save itself only thanks to the online mode, however penalized by the questionable choices of the programmers in terms of gameplay. Pros: Technically sufficient Acceptable online mode Cons: Wretched gameplay choices Rough in many respects Definitely inferior to the prequel Fourth chapter of the Rainbow Six series, Lockdown could have been, on paper, an extremely comfortable title to develop and bring to the screens of fans. It would have been enough for Red Storm to take the winning formula of its direct predecessor and re-propose it with the appropriate technical improvements, enriching that Rainbow Six 3 so good at combining good quality with a convincing commercial success. But that didn't happen. Caught by an unusual renewal frenzy, the developers wanted to change at any cost. And this was the first of a series of serious mistakes.", "date": "2005-09-16", "grade": null}
