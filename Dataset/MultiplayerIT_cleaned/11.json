Activision starts from here to present the new chapter of the saga, perfecting the single player mode and with a better online and for the first time on a Sony console. The Call of Duty 3 campaign is divided into 14 missions and is all focused on the long series of battles that led the allies to reconquer Paris, firmly in German hands. Hitler's troops also in this new episode represent the enemy to be defeated in order to bring freedom to the lands of Europe. To succeed in the enterprise you have to rely on four different armies, impersonating different soldiers from time to time, American, English, Canadian and Polish. They therefore take on the role of American troops, fighting side by side with soldiers who often lose their lives, even if the main subjects, moreover very well characterized, follow us throughout the story. His Majesty's army instead will have to do with the French resistance, which will collaborate to carry out all the most delicate tasks to weaken the German brigades. The Poles and Canadians make their appearance in the Call of Duty universe for the first time, and we can only be happy that the importance of their contribution and their means to defeat the Nazi beasts is underlined. The origin of the game is not betrayed by making it remain in the elite of fps The game mechanics of this first person shooter hasn't changed since the second episode, there have certainly been some additions to the gameplay that we will analyze, but we can state without fear of contradiction that the origin of the game is not betrayed by making it remain in the elite of fps set in World War II. The sensation we experienced during our tests was certainly that of a clear general improvement of the Activision title, and realism has never been the master as in this chapter. Call of Duty 3 manages to reproduce on the screen, especially at certain times, the feeling of being on the battlefield. Climbing over a low wall and finding yourself in the midst of thunderous explosions, bullets that graze our heads, comrades running in search of protection and returning fire from the Germans engaged in a strenuous defense. In the background crumbling buildings and a sky crossed by planes engaged in bombing. This is Call of Duty 3. To the front with honor At a normal level, the title already proves to be quite challenging, but the real challenge is experienced at a veteran level, in which it will be crucial not to make a mistake and always seek the right coverage of the structures arranged on the scenario. To break the rhythm of the game, driving interludes have been inserted, for example the English jeep and the Polish tanks, which prove to be decidedly amusing and contribute to a better identification with the campaign. One of the innovations introduced, which has more implications on gameplay, is that relating to enemy grenades which, if they arrive in our vicinity, can be collected and then quickly relaunched back. The right timing will guarantee a perfect boomerang effect that will hit the unbelievers properly German positions.Obviously in case of slow execution we will leave the feathers or, in the event that the grenade we relaunched ends up under the feet of one of our teammates, game over is guaranteed, as always friendly fire is not allowed. When we place the explosive charges, on the walls of the buildings or on the tracks of the tanks, a sort of real-time cut scene will start in which we should insert the charge and start the trigger. To the front with honor It is here, in all these interludes that Sixaxis comes to our aid. In fact, by moving the pad forward decisively we will simulate the use of the butt of one's weapon, with relative animation on the screen, or we will be able to drive the tank and the jeep using the lateral movement of the pad. And again, when we find ourselves having to destroy a particular structure or weapon of mass destruction, we will have to move the pad clockwise to detonate the C4 explosive. Finally, it will be necessary to move the joypad forcefully in different directions to get the better of the aforementioned hand-to-hand combat. In short, the peculiar characteristics of the Sixaxis pad are beginning to have the first applications that go beyond the usual sops. The interlude scenes, as usual for the Activision saga, serve to explain the situation from a historical-strategic point of view and also to let us know our fellow soldiers and allies. At a first glance some of them can also arouse someand laughter, due to the crude military jokes, but certainly the Treyarch developers would have done better to insert the possibility of skipping these clips which, if seen more than once, are decidedly boring. Lights and shadows From a technical point of view, Call of Duty 3 is certainly valid, especially with regard to particle effects and light sources, which are reflected, for example, in every shooting even on the same weapon. The complexity of the scenarios and the behavior of the other fellow soldiers are also excellent, despite being mainly scripted. The interaction with the environment, to be improved, and the physics, which are poorly developed compared to other titles, even if not of the same genre, are more low-profile. The atmospheric agents are faithfully reproduced and the rain, with thunder and lightning to accompany everything, is creepy for how it is made. On the scenario the countless explosions are rendered at their best as well as all the particle effects dedicated to the smoke of battle, such as the one of grenades. Some goodies, such as the blur effect that simulates heat and distorts the view you have when using fixed machine guns, make the overall experience truly immersive. A particular mention from a technical point of view should be made to the creation of the vegetation as a whole, from the polygonal grass that moves in the wind to the leaves of the trees. Truly possibly one of the best greens ever seen in a video game to date. Lights and shadows Our complaints about this PlayStation 3 version begin right from the technical sector, which clearly represents a conversion made with a certain hurry compared to the Xbox 360 counterpart. Starting with the animated icon that allows you to launch the title from the XMB, present in all the other titles but not here, the version for the Sony console denotes several more slowdowns during the action, which minimally affect the adventure but which are nonetheless perceptible. As if that weren't enough, in some points the game seems to freeze, not proceeding with the next event in which, for example, your teammates are involved. The only way to continue is to load the last save or commit suicide to restart from the previous checkpoint. In addition, COD3 also suffers from a general decrease in texture quality. Not that the difference with the X360 version is abysmal, but a close comparison between the two versions is rather against the PS3 one. Comment Call of Duty 3 picks up where the second episode of this beloved saga set in the Second World War left off, filling some gaps, but not innovating much of an already successful formula. COD 3 is the classic ~more of the same~, the offline campaign while remaining in the tradition has been made increasingly realistic, thanks to an excellent game engine that guarantees truly satisfying and exciting moments. The online has been enriched and does its duty very well (although it does not have the completeness of the Xbox 360 counterpart), graphically it lives on ups and downs, the latter detoured by a conversion that is not exactly flawless from all points of view. Recommended for lovers of the genre, with some reservations. Pros: More and more realistic Good technical ideas Appreciable online Cons: Some problems in the framerate and in the color scale Often linear missions Interaction with the seabed to be improved further 24 in battle The multiplayer, on the other hand, is well thought out, with the possibility of up to 24 people playing online in modes such as deathmatch, team battles and one called War, where you have to occupy some outposts for as long as possible. During our test, and after downloading an update patch, we have practically never encountered lag problems, and the experience has always been fluid and satisfying, also thanks to the possibility of using different means of locomotion within the maps such as for example the motorbike with sidecar and impersonating also the different factions and historical roles of the series, such as sniper, medic and so on. Unfortunately, there is no voice chat system like in Resistance.", "date": "2007-03-23", "grade": null}
