Unfortunately for him, Payne soon ends up being framed by his enemies, and so at one point he finds himself alone against everyone, determined to finish the job he started three years earlier despite the accusations. Told through a series of graphic novel-style ~cartoons~, the plot of Max Payne appears today much less brilliant and sensible than in 2001, with a background that could have been represented much better to build the right pathos and a handful of jokes worthy of the worst action movie. However, the merits of the third person shooter developed by Remedy are undeniable, which introduced bullet time for the first time and, therefore, the possibility of eliminating one's enemies ~in slow motion~ during a firefight, to the benefit of fun and of the spectacular. Following the same philosophy behind the mobile reduction of Grand Theft Auto III, Rockstar has entrusted the same team (War Drum Studios) with the task of making Max Payne Mobile, translating the gameplay and structure of the original game on iOS and Android devices (the However, the release on Google Play will take place with a little delay, on April 26th). A long adventure The end result is an almost perfect product from a technical point of view and indeed even improved in textures, now in high resolution, but which due to the touch controls loses its distinctive features, i.e. the ability of the character to shoot ~ on the fly~, during the side slips and, in general, the goodness of the gunplay. Let's be clear: the actions of the character have not been modified, therefore they are all present also in this new version, however by acting on the virtual sticks it is at least difficult to perform the acrobatic maneuvers which instead constituted the best part of the game on PC. Aware of this limit, the developers had to lower the degree of challenge, further depressing an experience which, at the initial difficulty level, is completed without major problems and with plenty of ammunition and painkillers, with the only challenging and frustrating sections represented from the points where you have to jump: the appropriate touch command does not shine for precision and very often you will end up falling because the input has not been correctly implemented. Were there any alternative solutions to overcome the problem of controls? Yes, but they implied a redesign of the gameplay rather than a traditional porting operation, for example it would have been possible to activate the bullet time mode and then insert a different interface to allow us to jump and shoot automatically. Or maybe it would have been enough to assign the jump to a much larger and easily accessible icon, so as to stimulate lateral swerves rather than always relying on automatic aim, which ends up doing the bulk of the work for us. In short, Max Payne Mobile doesn't play as well as the original and so far we probably don't say anything unexpected, but in the current panorama of third person shooters on the App Store it doesn't look bad either and can count on a particularly substantial structure, with all the levels of the PC version and a more than decent Italian dubbing.", "date": "2012-04-16", "grade": "7.0"}
