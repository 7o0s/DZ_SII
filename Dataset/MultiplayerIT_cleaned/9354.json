The idea of the developers is in fact to propose a sort of shareware, to make their title available to all users without releasing the classic ~lite~ version, and therefore allow them to keep any progress made until they reach the second level of experience for the bounty hunters who make up the team. At that point, you can decide whether to unlock the game (paying 3.99 euros) or not, and possibly access further microtransactions that allow you to acquire extra credits (but don't worry, you can easily do without them). We are faced with a turn-based strategy that is really rich in terms of content, in which we control a team of mercenaries who travel around the galaxy aboard a spaceship and go where their services are well rewarded. The number of hunters increases as the general experience level and difficulty increase, adding further elements to an already full-bodied and engaging gameplay. Having selected a mission from those available (but new ones are added every twelve hours), our task may be to eliminate all enemies within a map, escort people towards the exit, destroy mechanisms or even identify and eliminate the leader of the opposing faction. At the end of the day there isn't a huge variety, but from a gameplay point of view the game lives up to expectations. Move and shoot Each of our hunters has a weapon and armor that affects their ability to move and attack. Characters equipped with light armor and a couple of small machine guns, for example, enjoy great leeway and can open fire multiple times before the end of the turn; in contrast, those carrying a heavy warhammer and heavy armor have poor range. Finally, there are the snipers or characters equipped with rocket launchers, who must choose between moving or attacking given the effectiveness of their weapon. The interface shows us an energy bar for each hunter (double, given the presence of the armor) and a variable number of ~balls~ that make up the action points within a turn. For example, if we have four of these points, we can move four boxes, shoot four times (provided our weapon is light) or mix the two actions as needed. It is very important that there is no defined move and attack sequence, i.e. any character still in possession of ~action points~ can move or attack until we have manually ended our turn, thus leaving the next move to the opponent. The ability to identify an enemy or to reach him with a shot also depends on the individual equipment, and this is why the developers have given great importance to the team customization phase, with two different screens in which we can buy or sell weapons, armor and items, or change the configuration of a character. It must be said, however, that in these situations the game is a bit nebulous, dispersive and unclear: it takes a while to understand how to move between the various options, and a more understandable, streamlined and immediate interface would have proved definitely better. Killing enemies translates into gaining experience, with the classic RPG-style leveling not only leading to a semi-automatic upgrade of the hunter in question and his equipment, but also giving access to weapons appropriate to the level reached. The touch screen control system works properly and allows us to zoom or rotate the map at any time, the graphics appear rather detailed and well designed, while finally the sound is the weak point of the technical sector, given that it is almost silent and often suffers from annoying bugs (such as disappearing effects), which we hope will be fixed soon.
