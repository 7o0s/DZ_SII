The Capcom series was the initiator of virtual barrels in their modern form, and to date practically no developer has yet managed to get rid of the stainless foundations laid by the second chapter. Yet despite its status, the historic saga has experienced ups and downs in recent years; Street Fighter V has always created a rift among fans, and it seems to have found some breathing space only now, thanks to an impressive success in the field of esports and a substantial expansion of rosters and content with the Arcade Edition. Whatever you think of that specific title, however, there is no reason not to celebrate its history on its thirtieth anniversary, and Capcom itself has decided to celebrate with a truly massive collection, containing as many as 12 games in the series (although many are perfected iterations of the same title). We have tested this 30th Anniversary Collection thoroughly, and today we are ready to evaluate it in your company. Barrels for all tastes As mentioned, the list of titles fielded in this collection is impressive: five variants of Street Fighter II - Original, Champion Edition, Turbo: Hyper Fighting, Super and Super Turbo - All three Alphas, and all three Street Fighters III, including the immortal 3rd Strike. Finally, among these peeps out the original Street Fighter, from which we strongly advise you to stay away. Seriously, how good the controls of the very first game of this name are in inverse proportion to the importance of its sequel: it's nearly unplayable, it doesn't respond properly to inputs, and it'll just make you yell empty curses for a few minutes (and blame no it's not even attributable to the collection... the original was the same). The more classic fighting games, which don't have to be activated one by one but share a new modern interface, and are easily selectable in offline Arcade mode, are quite another story. Obviously, in the eyes of those who have only entered the universe of fighting games today, the Original Street Fighters may seem limited and wooden, but it is incredible to see how they still hold up to the blow, thanks to their solid mechanics and the considerable variations from chapter to chapter. Predictably, however, the most enjoyable still remains 3rd Strike, whose highly refined and difficult to master system is unsurpassed according to many (the parries give that game a match-in-match variability and a level of tactics non-existent in 90% of the genre , and I'm certainly not the only good thing about the combat system). However, aware of which were the most popular games in the group, the developers decided to make only four available online: precisely the 3rd Strike, the Alpha 3, Street Fighter II Hyper Fighting and the Super Turbo. The other chapters are only available locally and put more to make numbers than anything else, given the presence of the classics mentioned above. However, we consider it a great thing to have so much content available in a similar operation, complete with ranked matches, lobbies (which we should return to later), and even a ~museum~ section dedicated to music, individual characters and to the development of the best chapters of the series. Joy and pain Also from a technical point of view, a discreet job has been done, even if it is obviously not the case to expect upheavals. Everything can be played with three different filters (one of which, the arcade one, uses the inevitable scanline of the cabinets to make the age of the games involved less evident), while the screen can be zoomed or even enlarged up to the edges of the television (which is not recommended, given the deformation it entails). Ordinary administration in simple terms, with a somewhat light-hearted approach that may have also extended to online. In fact, the game didn't give us and many others problems: we played several games with all the titles available and, apart from some inevitable heavy hiccups in a handful of fights, the situation always danced between the excellent and the ~playable without woes~. However, opinions on the netcode are extremely fluctuating, and it seems that with some connections the situation is far from stable. Unfortunately there is no absolute assessment on this aspect, one of the most unpredictable in games of this type. What is certain is that perhaps more effort could have been made in the management of the previously mentioned lobbies, because selecting four available games leads to having to face random roulette with each game, and in general the options related to unclassified matches seem very limited. More problematic however is a specific lack of collection forwho uses a certain device: the stick. Most arcade modes have the ~start~ key tied to the playstation pad touchscreen, which for obvious reasons is missing from most of those controllers. You can temporarily assign the key to something else, but it's really annoying to have to do it for every holy game, and we find it quite absurd that the developers have not considered this in a collection dedicated to the only niche of players who often do not use pads. Also curious is the total lack of multiple key assignments: you'll have to get by with the basic commands, without the possibility of assigning the three punches, the three kicks or other combinations to a single trigger or key. They're easily patched oversights, we think, but they just didn't have to exist in an operation of this type. If you manage to overlook these marginal but annoying shortcomings, however, you will still find glorious games waiting for you today, we assure you.", "date": "2018-06-01", "grade": "8.0"}
