{"name": "Resident Evil 2 per PC", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/resident-evil-2-pc-recensione.html", "text": "Resident Evil 2 is an explosive blend of emotion, tension and nostalgic feelings. Those who have had the opportunity to play with the classic survival horror from Capcom back in 1998 will find many of the original atmospheres in this title so solid and well-finished, which takes up the story of Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield but reinterprets it in different ways, so as to offer a fundamentally new experience. The male protagonist is a rookie on his first day on the job at the Raccoon City Police Department, while Claire is looking for her brother Chris and is heading to the same place to get information on where he ended up after the events of the first chapter. The two find themselves by chance in a service area which they discover to be infested with zombies and manage to escape together in a car, only to have to separate due to a terrible accident once they enter the city. Whichever character is chosen, our task will be to avoid the living dead and gain entry to the ancient building where the police station is located, the only place apparently safe from the chaos and death that have invaded the streets . Once there, however, we will discover that things are not as we imagined and the spread of the horrible epidemic that transforms people into undead hungry for living flesh has done more damage than we thought. Will we be able to escape from the nightmare? Structure and gameplay Just like the original, the remake of Resident Evil 2 boasts a structure consisting of four variants of the campaign, to which are added two extra unlockable modes. By completing the first campaign with a character, we will be able to access the second with the other protagonist and experience parallel and alternative events to those we have already experienced, with a higher degree of difficulty and some more boss fights, which will also allow us to witness the true ending of the game. Then we could possibly decide to carry out the reverse path, taking advantage of all the notions learned up to that moment (in particular as regards the resolution of the puzzles) to arrive at the end in a much more expeditious way. To regulate the intensity of our efforts we will find three levels of difficulty. The lowest, called ~assisted mode~, corresponds more or less to today's standards for an intermediate level challenge: we will be able to find a greater number of ammunition and resources around, eliminate enemies with less effort, enjoy a larger inventory and of a semi-automatic aim, as well as seeing our life energy gradually restored automatically. The normal difficulty is clearly much more punishing, in particular as regards the killing of zombies, which often requires a disproportionate amount of bullets even if we always and only hit the headshots. In this case health is recovered only through the use of specific items (medical sprays and/or herbal mixes), you have to aim manually and endure a reduced inventory in the number of slots. The third and highest degree of challenge further increases the complexity of the gameplay: we suggest you use it only after completing a couple of runs, because with so few resources it will be a problem even just stopping to figure out where to go and what to do. From a gameplay point of view, the developers have employed a series of interesting gimmicks to replicate the great sense of tension of the original Resident Evil 2: if in that case everything depended on the ~tank~ style controls, which prevented you from moving easily in combination with the static shots, the remake has chosen to use a fairly realistic aiming system, unpredictable movements for the zombies and a sometimes deceptive camera to achieve the same effect. The result is a truly engaging experience, very demanding at the beginning, which can also count on a total redesign of the puzzles and on many new elements also in terms of narration and characters. A very suggestive and cinematic direction has also been adopted, with cutscenes perfectly integrated into the action, as in the most famous videogame productions. From this point of view, the game is capable of giving greater depth and credibility to the protagonists of the adventure, their motivations and everything that gravitates around them. The extra modes By completing Resident Evil 2 campaign 1 and campaign 2, with any score, you can unlock The 4th Survivor mode. It is precisely a survival in which, in the role of a mercenary in the pay of the Umbrella Corporation, codenamed Hunk, we will have the task of carrying out the reverse path compared to the stories of Leon and Claire, therefore starting from the sewers, crossing the dungeons, returning to the police department and finally on the street in order to reach the extraction area. Succeeding in the enterprise will not be easy, however: along the way we will find an enormous amount of zombies and other monsters, and we will be able to count only on limited equipment, with different weapons but a small number of ammunition. If we manage to complete the mission, we will also unlock the Tofu Survivor mode: it is a funny easter egg in which we will find ourselves controlling a sort of soy-cheese man, without weapons and therefore forced to flee from zombies to survive. Speaking of extras, in addition to the various costumes, it is possible to purchase a DLC for only 2.99 euros that adds the original soundtrack and audio effects of Resident Evil 2 to the game: a great way to take a dip in memories. The PC version The technical sector of Resident Evil 2 is exceptional on consoles, so we expected really great things from the PC version. Were we satisfied? In terms of quality, yes, without a doubt, but we encountered some small hitches on the optimization front. Let's say immediately that the visual limits of the game on PlayStation 4 Pro, in this case some artifacts that manifest themselves in the reflections on the surfaces, and which are especially noticeable in the scenario of the Police station, on the Windows platform are not seen or in any case are really minimized. The amount of graphic adjustments available is quite large and will undoubtedly allow you to scale the experience on machines equipped with different components, but with some perplexities regarding the maximum settings. Our personal experience with the test configuration, equipped with a GTX 1080 Ti, reveals that at 4K / 20160p resolution and all effects maxed Resident Evil 2 has obvious difficulties reaching 60 frames per second, and even doing some try lowering shadows, antialiasing and texture width you can't get a constant fluidity other than that of the 30 frames. The strange thing, as we mentioned earlier, is that setting the resolution to 1440p and keeping all the adjustments at maximum, instead, you get 60 unshakable frames, absolutely perfect. Given the vast difference in terms of performance - practically double the frames - it is possible that there is something that annoys the RE Engine when you go too high in resolution, and perhaps that can be fixed with an update. That said, the detailed settings list includes quick presets and entries for graphics libraries (DirectX 12 or DirectX 11), resolution, rendering and image quality (a scaler, basically), refresh rate, freeze speed, v-sync, anti-aliasing (choice of FXAA, TAA, SMAA, or FXAA + TAA), texture quality (shown by amount of video memory used, up to 8GB), anisotropic filtering, mesh, shadows (with possible cache), perspective shadows, reflections, translucency, volumetric lights, particles, ambient occlusion (up to HBAO+), bloom, lens flare, motion blur, depth of field, lens distortion and grain effect. In short, a complete range that allows you to run Resident Evil 2 at its best on different configurations, preferring performance or the level of detail. The PC version supports HDR and includes separate settings to adjust it to the best, it is of course compatible with the Xbox controller and boasts the same great voice acting in Italian that we enjoyed on consoles.", "date": "2019-01-28", "grade": "9.0"}
