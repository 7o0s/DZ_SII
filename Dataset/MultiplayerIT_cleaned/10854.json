{"name": "Naruto Clash of Ninja Revolution 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/naruto-clash-of-ninja-revolution-2-recensione.html", "text": "Naruto: Clash of Ninja Revolution 2 European Version: this is the original and extended title of the last chapter available on consoles of the successful adventures inspired by Masashi Kishimoto's Manga. From now on CONR2 is the direct successor of that fighting game released on Wii almost a year ago and already a sequel to the successful Naruto Gekitou Ninja Taisen series seen in Japan. In short, the tradition now boasts countless titles inspired by the series, which have been released for years on practically any existing console. CONR2 is an atypical match fighting game, because it not only boasts classic match matches like any good Virtua Figher or Tekken have always taught us, but it diversifies its gameplay through new gimmicks, unpublished modes, an articulated story and the possibility of playing together until to four people. Variety and simplicity Once again the developers are the Japanese of Tomy, in collaboration with the Eighting team which has dealt, in the past, also with other famous brands such as Bleach, Zatch Bell, Bloody Roar, Castlevania Wii and the recent Tatsunoko vs Capcom always for the Nintendo flagship console. The experience made with the Wii hardware shows it all: CONR2 is an extremely fluid, colorful and visually satisfying game, while showing the limits of the hardware compared to competing consoles and the probable legacy of the graphics engine already developed for Playstation 2. Just to diversify the gaming experience compared to other chapters available elsewhere, CONR2 can take advantage of all the versatility of the Wii Remote combined with the Nunchuck, in order to perform moves and specials by drawing shots in the air just as if we were doing them live . This is not the only control system available, however: this Naruto chapter can also be played with the classic controller, with the GameCube joypad, or even with the Wii remote but using the keys, instead of the movement. The first method, the more original one, is certainly the funniest and gives the series a touch of freshness compared to the previous chapters. However, CONR2's gameplay is decidedly simplified, and moves, combos and specials are almost always carried out with the same key combinations and movements. The excellent amount of selectable characters and related combos does not therefore follow an equal variety of combinations in the control system, making it quite simple (and little differentiated) to use one rather than another. The various combos (which can be performed both alone and with the help of a companion in battle) are excellently choreographed, spectacular and impactful, in full anime style. CONR2 has been well designed to offer accessible playability to the greatest number of people, and above all to that age group that historically follows the series. It follows that the Tomy game is fast, frantic, fun, but does not offer much room for improvement to the player's skill and is very simple to master. Multiplayer revolves around the sofa at home Despite being a genre lent to multiplayer, Naruto CONR2 does not offer any online mode via the Wi-Fi Connection service. Rather, the Tomy game focuses on the full-bodied story mode and local challenges for up to four people. The single player consists of numerous Chapters, divided into Episodes, which tell stories based on the first series but never told either in the anime or in the manga. We don't take away the pleasure of discovering them by yourself, but we can only say that some obscure and unclear events will finally be further explored. Cutscenes are sometimes animated, but often consist of single frames over which the story text flows. During the dialogues, however, the characters appear on the screen with subtitles, all in Italian (as well as the menus). The multiplayer was developed around the ability to face up to four friends, with large arenas and an arrow under each character to indicate who is attacking. The game is always a lot of fun, and even if the saying - winning team doesn't change - is always valid, it's also true that the sense of deja-vu is decidedly strong because even this last chapter doesn't differ much from the previous ones. The novelties of Revolution 2, in addition to a slight graphic make-up as regards the menu and general presentation, mainly concern the update of the available characters (almost 40) and some absolutely new additions: Komachi, Towa, Bando and Kagura. A work of resizing the damage of some combos, evidently too devastating, and a general leveling of the characteristics of all the available fighters has also been carried out, so as not to give too much advantage to any of them. Special moves can be used once the pool is filledchakra bar, a kind of ~fury~ available in a limited way and to be managed during the match. Naruto Clash of Ninja Revolution 2 supports 16/9 at a resolution of 480p: owners of HD televisions connected to Nintendo Wii with a component cable will benefit above all. In this way the native resolution of the game shows all its strengths and weaknesses. First of all an excellent definition of the image, with clear and deep colors, but also numerous jaggies in the polygons of the characters and a low quality of the backdrops which in this way stands out clearly. The graphics engine seems to be the one used on Playstation 2, and this can be seen from the fact that the backgrounds are composed of mixed 2D and 3D elements, with bitmaps that are often not very clean and grainy. A console like Wii could do much more. The characters, on the other hand, are well done, and their cel-shaded style makes them almost indistinguishable from the cartoon. A good number of polygons and the perfect use of color choices help create the illusion of watching a real interactive anime. The animations, in fact, are very accurate and numerous, enriched by dozens of different effects. Explosions, fire, water, particles, sand, transparencies in quantity, motion blur: despite all this, CONR2 runs smoothly and without uncertainties, with a stable and fast framerate. Even the sound effects are very accurate, being fished from the vast library now available for the series. The use of the remote control is also valuable: in addition to being able to be chosen as an alternative control method, its speaker is activated with special attacks and other small effects. Ultimately, the general ~package~ of this latest Naruto chapter is very nice and pleasant, even if it doesn't take full advantage of the Wii's video processor. Comment Clash of Ninja Revolution 2 is a great ~more of the same~ for the series. New characters, an expanded roster of fighters, better balance of moves and many game modes combine to create one of the best Naruto fighting games for Wii and beyond. Too bad for the lack of options for online play and some graphic details that could be improved. Despite this, CONR2 is a pleasant and fun game, especially suitable for fans of the series and for those who want an easily accessible, fast and frenetic fighting game.Pro Lots of characters from the series Fast and frantic gameplay Intuitive and playable with both the remote and the traditional controller Against Shallow move and combo system The Wii hardware could do more No online multiplayer", "date": "2009-02-24", "grade": null}
