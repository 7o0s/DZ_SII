Monster Menu: The Scavenger's Cookbook is a set of features placed in a bag, mixed, left to rest and gently placed in a gaming pouch. The result? Less confusing than expected and closer to the by now peculiar narratives of the volcanic publisher: yes, because we now expect everything from NIS and Monster Menu is just one of the many candles on the cake, one of those that could have done better but that will be able to entertain anyone looking for a perfect halfway Japanese game of a cross between at least 4 different genres. Let's see the reason for this preamble in our review of Monster Menu: The Scavenger's Cookbook. Many mechanics in one In Monster Menu you will have a team entirely made by you, so don't expect great relationships between supporting characters Monster Menu, on balance, is told as a Japanese strategic role-playing game: the truth is that we could add many suffixes. Let's try to give it a genre: Japanese strategic RPG dungeon crawler survival roguelike. Here, it took a handful of words to let you enter the typically light-hearted but tangibly hardcore atmosphere of the most recent NIS production, in which a trademark aesthetic is combined with a mix of less banal mechanics than expected. The playing group is entirely decided by us, in all its characteristics: apart from some fairly sketchy aesthetic sampling, we will have to establish the class and the personality. If we really wanted to imagine a little creative contamination, we would dare to say that the NIS team of Labyrinth of Galleria inspired the Monster Menu team next door: NIS continues to lighten the cast of controllable characters in every way, in what at this point appears to be a stylistic choice. Protagonist - initially alone and then accompanied - and his supporting allies are essentially three-dimensional characters taken and placed inside the dungeons, drawn and enriched with traits chosen by us, little living puppets that we have impregnated with our desires in terms of hair, accessories, class and character. If the idea intrigues you or if you are fond of a more romantic character concept, your choice: the cornerstone of Monster Menu does not lie in the team, but in sending you to kill monsters and collect items in dungeons quite basic in their essence, but full of unaccommodating monsters. Dungeons galore The level design of the dungeons is very minimal, probably too much to fascinate in the long run Exploring dungeons by going down is nothing new for the Japanese market: the emblem of JRPG underground exploration has always had the descent into the depths as a conceptual foundation. Dungeon Encounters, to take a relatively recent example, has even taken this concept and blow-dried it, even drying it out too much. Monster Menu tries to stay in the middle, providing a fairly dry exploration experience where monsters are only one of the challenges. Wandering the dungeons consumes calories, so - guess what - you have to cook and eat. The survival aspect, as well as the character aspect, should not be underestimated, especially in the initial stages: consuming pieces of monsters, found dishes or cooked delicacies between one dungeon and another helps exploration and combat not a little, giving boosts, various bonuses and improvements to our characters, all useful things given that the difficulty level - selectable at the beginning - is not as accommodating as we would have thought. Unfortunately, it must be said that the dungeons and levels do not shine in terms of characterization or objectives: we have the usual chests, the elements to find on the ground, the shops, the altars to upgrade only for that specific floor of the dungeon, all within an exploratory framework that is too minimal for the medium term. If the basic system works in the short term, entertaining, intriguing and pushing to improve one's team with better equipment and dishes, that sense of enthusiasm remains stable and then decreases after a few hours, when one understands that this is the game and that will be forward there. The strategic mechanics add a touch of peculiarity, forcing you to hit enemies from behind so as to have the advantage, combining JRPG commands with a strategic grid, knowing full well that if you die, you go home with nothing. The degree of challenge, as we said, is not high but neither is it caressing: you have to stay therewith the head, calculating well which foods to eat, which team to create and how long to risk going down, in what is a fluid exploration cycle but too often similar to itself.", "date": "2023-05-19", "grade": "6.5"}
