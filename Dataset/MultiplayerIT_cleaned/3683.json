{"name": "Rumble Stars Calcio", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rumble-stars-calcio-recensione.html", "text": "Rumble Stars Calcio is a clone of Clash Royale: it takes up the type of view of the Supercell title, the concept of the three points for victory, the management of units that can be projected onto the map provided you have the necessary energy (rechargeable with time) and the enhancement of the characters by obtaining identical cards and spending some coins. In short, we are talking about an extremely derivative product with only one important distinction: it is a football game. The idea of applying such a highly successful formula to the sports genre had not yet come to anyone, and so the developers of Frogmind Games have seen fit to take advantage of it, characterizing the project in a clear way thanks to the use of anthropomorphic animals wearing the ordinance shirt and crowd the field with the aim of scoring. So think of that type of strategic gameplay, with the same one-on-one competitive multiplayer, however applied to the ball: it's easier to play it than imagine it, we agree. A brief tutorial introduces the controls and prerogatives of the match, after which you can launch yourself headlong into competitive matches, which, just like in Clash Royale, provide for the gain of experience points and the increase in level, with the possibility of accessing new fields for a total of four variants net of ~specializations~ and divisions: Greenfield, green and luxuriant; El Dorado, set among some ancient ruins; Palazzo Zen, which incorporates the aesthetics of imperial China; and finally Valle di Ghiaccio, with its snowy lands. Gameplay and structure As already mentioned, unit management works in a very similar way to the Supercell blockbuster, with an energy bar located at the bottom of the screen that indicates when we can use certain units belonging to our deck. The latter can be customized in various ways, with the addition and replacement of characters that we consider useful for our style of play, and that behind the appearance of more or less ferocious animals hide peculiar functions: there are athletes who bring the ball, those who shoot with precision, the center forwards who receive and run into the net, the ~hounds~ who weaken the opponents and a whole series of figures with special abilities, such as the magnet or the cannon. In fact, the design fails to be completely consistent, but in the end the formula works: after completing a few warm-up matches, you finally enter the mechanism and take away some great satisfaction. The matches have a duration of three minutes, so they lend themselves very well to impromptu use, and it is possible to join a club to get extra rewards to add to the traditional boxes, which take a variable amount of time to open. Also from the point of view of the freemium dynamics Rumble Stars Calcio does nothing but imitate Clash Royale, which means that it is possible to download the game and use it completely free, with the possibility, however, of speeding up the progression by putting your wallet in hand. In any case, it is a free and not forced choice: during our tests it never happened to be faced with significantly stronger opponents, therefore the matchmaking not only appears fast and effective but also well balanced. From a technical point of view, a good job has been done: the graphics flow smoothly and the characters are nice, net of those inconsistencies we mentioned earlier, which make the idea of using exclusively anthropomorphic animals a little dirty. The sound sector exalted us a little less due to the use of nice but a little too repetitive tunes.", "date": "2019-05-04", "grade": "7.8"}
