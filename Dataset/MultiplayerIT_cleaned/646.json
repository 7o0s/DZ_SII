Bradley, the author of Dungeon Lords also mentioned on the packaging of the game, has become famous for having created the three most beautiful chapters of the Wizardry series Create the character Bradley's latest effort is, unfortunately, not an RPG. Instead, it is an action set almost completely on combat, but with many role-playing elements (especially in character management). The story is classic: a wizard (Galdryn) is defeated by a conspiracy hatched by some of his colleagues He doesn't know it, but he's about to make a fine (sure, however, that he could sense that something was wrong when they invited him to a gloomy and gloomy place at night...) and his main ally (Lord Davenmor) now has to deal with hordes of infernal creatures sent against him by Lord Barrowgrim who, looks at the case, he is a megalomaniac intent on dominating the world (one of the many that populate video games, especially action ones... they will have a union...). Will you, hero without blemish and without fear, be able to save the kingdom of Lord Davenmor from the imminent threat? Hopefully so (otherwise the games you buy them for?). In order to save the world, of course, you will need to create a character. To do this we will have a handy summary screen available with various customizable factors. Thus we will have to choose the name, gender, race (human, elf, dwarf and various others), class (warrior, wizard, thief and so on), distribute the initial experience points among the various characteristics (there are combat skills melee, magical abilities, thieves' abilities and others of various nature) and go on an adventure. The premises are really good: you will hardly find an action game that allows such a customization of your alter ego (in reality it is even superior to that of many latest generation role-playing games). you will hardly find an action game that allows such customization of your alter ego Where are my dice? You will start in a forest near the town of Fargrove (Lord Davenmor's residence). In front of a bonfire you will receive a letter, to be delivered within the city which, unfortunately, is sealed to prevent it from filling up with scum of various kinds (a completely useless security measure, given that when you find us it will be full of enemies. ..). The initial impact is not the best. After the first dialogue, you will be able to explore the surroundings of Fargrove (hunting for experience and objects) facing the first fights and discovering some of the great defects of the game: yes, the fight is managed in real time, but the blows are calculated as if it were of a role-playing game, without therefore taking into account some essential factors for the action genre: timing, the position of the enemy and the speed of movement. Let's explain it better with an example: by attacking an enemy from behind, it is not certain that the blow delivered will be successful since, once performed, calculations will start that will make it more or less effective. We will therefore find ourselves several times seeing blows taken against uncovered enemies that will have no effect. One could assume that blows are absorbed by armor or dodged, but such a damage determination system (essentially invisible to the player) may be fine for an RPG with turn-based combat, not for an action game where it is assumed that each of the moves performed produces sensible effects. Where are my dice? Let's also assume that our hero's movements are rather slow and awkward to understand how in Dungeon Lords the clashes are static and uninteresting. Moreover, a general lack of refinement is also noticeable, which translates into rather frustrating and decidedly avoidable situations. For example, colliding against a troll, it can happen to be knocked to the ground by one of his fists (and up to here...). It will take a few seconds to get up again... which will allow the troll to give us another volley of punches making us fall back to the ground. We then happened to see our character slaughtered with full health, just because a troll landed a handful of hits in a row without us being able to do anything. such a damage determination system (basically invisible to the player) may be fine for an RPG with turn-based combat, not for an action one in which each of the moves performed is assumed to produce sensitive effects Artificial intelligence Still talking about the combat system (it is not for nothing that it is the most important aspect of Dungeon Lords and must therefore be investigated properly), how can we fail to notice the general stupidity of the enemies (and others)? These point straight (inevery sense) towards the player without caring in the least about the elements of the scenario that are in front of them. Thus it will happen to see shows such as groups of ferocious monsters stuck in a door, just because two of them have tried to pass through it at the same time (killing one to unlock them is in these cases a gesture of profound humanity), or as a single enemy who continues to walk towards us despite having a stream in front of him that prevents him from passing. But there are also other subtleties that must be told, such as some bosses who, during the fight, remain motionless and let themselves be slaughtered in joy (it happened to me a couple of times) or opposing wizards who shoot fireballs despite having allies in front of them (the effect is often that of an involuntary massacre). Given the difficulty of some direct clashes, we often end up taking advantage of all these bugs to move forward ... as you can well imagine, this is not pleasant. Even the AI of neutral characters leaks everywhere. For example, the city is protected by guards who should react immediately to the arrival of groups of bandits. Unfortunately it is not uncommon to observe them disinterested in criminals as they attack us. Thus it will happen to see shows such as groups of ferocious monsters stuck in a door, just because two of them tried to pass it at the same time But how many are there? Still talking about bugs, how can we not mention the bad interpenetration between the polygons? Want to see enemies and items disappear into walls? Characters suspended in the void? Fireballs going through thick rock walls? Enemies stuck everywhere? Buy Dungeon Lords. But, as the good Corrado said, ~and it doesn't end here~. The last aspect of the ~combat~ issue remains to be dealt with: random encounters with enemies. To make the player's life difficult and not empty the dungeons too quickly, the developers have thought of including numerous random encounters with the various monsters that populate the different environments. The idea wouldn't be bad, if it hadn't been implemented terribly. For example, it would have been the case to repopulate areas crossed by the player only when he had gone far enough, so that, going back over, he would have found fresh meat to butcher. The problem is that random encounters are completely irrational and are very frequent (unless you limit them in options, which in any case alleviates the problem without solving it). For example, it happened several times to have cleared a dead end and, going back, as soon as we turned the first corner, feeling that enemies had reappeared inside it. ~Where they come from?~ is the question we constantly ask ourselves, bringing down any possibility of involvement. But how many are there? The massive presence of random enemies also leads to another problem: the reckless accumulation of items and money. Once you have passed the first dungeon, if you have explored it well, you will have so much money and objects at your disposal that you will be able to buy all the best wares in the Fargrove shops (by taking advantage of a rather hallucinating exchange system, given that distinguishes between the objects we wear, and those that we simply have in our inventory). It's always a pleasure to wander through dark corridors filled with chests to crack and secret buttons to push A little light at the end of the tunnel The presence of these defects unfortunately veils the merits. Primarily the design of the dungeons which have evidently been crafted by expert hand. Various, vast and full of secrets, they manage to surprise for their freshness while maintaining an approach derived from the 90s. It's always a pleasure to wander through dark corridors full of chests to break into (the method of doing this is very well done) and secret buttons to push. Above all, some goodies bring to mind the old first-person RPGs mentioned at the beginning of the article. Another advantage is the presence of many different objects and various spells with pleasant effects. Citing the spells allows us to talk about the graphics engine that we can define as simply fluctuating; elements made very well (some textures, light effects, flames, controllable character models and more) add up to some that are only fair (especially the enemy models) and other bad ones (some textures, the design of some locations which are visually poor and animations in general). From the sound point of view, the beautiful music that accompanies the action and the good sound effects are worth mentioning. Hardware boxes The requirements indicated to run Dungeon Lords are: 1 GHz processor or higher, 64 to 128 MB of Ram, a 64 MB graphics card (GeForce 2 or higher) and 400 MB of hard disk spacedo. The game was tested on a 3.4 GHz Pentium 4 with 2 GB of ram and a 256 MB GeForce 7800 GT video card where it performed well in terms of fluidity but showed several uncertainties in loading between areas the other, where the ~adjustment clicks~ were numerous and annoying. Final comment Dungeon Lords was a huge disappointment. Those who expected Bradley to make a big splash in the action genre will be deeply contradicted. More than a definitive title, it seems the embryo of something unrealized. Profusion of bugs (let's mention another one: the automatic map that occasionally cancels, making our explorations useless), a dull and unsatisfactory combat system, a fluctuating technical realization and a myriad of other more or less evident problems, make this product below the average of current games. Avoid it, even if you have fantasy deficiencies that need an immediate drip. Pros Dungeons are very well designed Deep character management Large number of items Cons Overall poorly done combat system Bugs scattered all over the place (tested version is updated to patch 1.3) Bad enemy AI The dungeon lords Not even too many years ago, RPG enthusiasts could count on a few reference series to blindly rely on. From titles such as Ultima, Might and Magic, Eye of the Beholder (which I mention even if as a series it has three chapters of which only the first two are worth playing), Wizardry and some others, an attention to detail transpired and a love for the genre that will find no equal in the following years. All these series aimed, in different ways, at recreating the spirit of paper role-playing games on a computer monitor, and they did so by going through paths which, not infrequently, ended up crossing each other, generating continuous pursuits for improvement, as the years passed and the available technologies improved. D.W. Bradley, the author of Dungeon Lords also mentioned on the packaging of the game, has become famous for having created the three most beautiful chapters of the Wizardry series (Wizardry V: Heart of the Maelstrom, Wizardry VI: Bane of the Cosmic Forge, and Wizardry VII : Crusaders Of The Dark Savant) which are also three real masterpieces of the genre. The affection of the fans grew when, having founded the Heuristic Park, Bradley created Wizards & Warriors, a decidedly little-known title among the masses, but undoubtedly one of the role-playing games that most managed to capture the spirit of the ~years of oro without forgetting to innovate. So imagine the excitement of the fans (including myself) when a new project of his (Dungeon Lords, in fact) was announced.", "date": "2006-01-12", "grade": null}
