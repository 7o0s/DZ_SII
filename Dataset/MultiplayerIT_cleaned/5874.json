Let's start immediately by saying that there are several types of offer, attractive for those who already own the game but also for all those who, for one reason or another, have kept a certain distance from Ubisoft's racing in these first twelve months of presence on the market. The expansion itself can be downloaded at the price of 29.99 euros, while for 49.99 euros you can also get access to all the original contents. Finally, the Complete Edition is available, which for 69.99 euros includes the material planned for the Season Pass. We also point out that the package is available for PC, Xbox One and PlayStation 4, while the Xbox 360 version has not been updated. Wild Run was developed by Ivory Tower, the same studio that had previously collaborated with Ubisoft Reflections on the development of the first season of The Crew. Moreover, the Lyon team has received clear signs of trust from Ubisoft, to the point of being acquired in October, entering the internal teams of the publisher from across the Alps. All these months have served to correct the many aspects of the game that last winter had been badly digested by a large part of the critics and the public. After all, The Crew had to deal with a very ambitious idea: the attempt, not at all simple, to adapt the racing genre to the typical trappings of MMOs. The debut was less brilliant than one might have wished, due to graphical deficiencies and the poor reliability of the servers, accompanied by deficiencies in the guide system and in the tasks to be performed. Despite everything, the first season hosted over three and a half million players and the support from the developers took place without interruption, thanks to the publication of corrective patches and the creation of the supplementary contents already planned for the annual Season Pass, among such as new missions to complete, more spare parts for the workshop and a plethora of additional vehicles that have replenished the forty models available at launch. Wild Run completes some of the shortcomings suffered by the original version of The Crew The Summit awaits you The idea of proposing an expansion pack was born to satisfy the needs of the public and to show off unpublished contents, which are placed independently of the material of the single-player campaign or the sections dedicated to PvP. First of all, the Summit was introduced, a new periodical competition that has the advantage of involving the entire community. Thanks to this sort of festival, located a bit in the manner of the Race Wars of the first Fast & Furious, it is possible to take part in a series of qualifications involving all players. The top finishers in at least three of the available categories then have the opportunity to compete for the top of the leaderboards in the main race. The first of these events kicked off today and will run until November 29, while the related qualifiers have been staged over the last four days. Moreover, the subsequent session, which will be held from 28 December to 3 January, will last more than four weeks overall. In this context there are three competitive variables, clearly distinct from the other tenders already available. We go from the more called Drift competition, which allows you to travel segments of the map and accumulate a score through the use of the handbrake, to the singular acceleration race, which transports us to the middle of the Nevada desert aboard vehicles capable of easily overcome 500 kilometers per hour. Finally we have the Monster Truck Arena, a sort of playground in which you can take control of massive Big Foot and perform extreme evolutions with the aim of collecting points within a time limit of a few minutes. However, the Summit also offers more, such as qualifying in timed races, solo or on behalf of your crew, PvP clashes, personalized challenges and comparisons in disciplines such as jumps, slaloms or stunts. Also in terms of gameplay, the Freedrive challenges and stunts have also been included, which can be activated freely while moving from one area of the United States to another and make covering long journeys more interesting, especially if the fast journey to these destinations has not yet been unlockedto. There are also undoubted advantages for the growth of one's vehicle, which in this way can take place without interruption even during exploration. But the innovations developed within this new offer are not limited to expanding the actions to be carried out. Ivory Tower has also overhauled the technical sector and introduced new significant details. The graphics engine that moved The Crew has been modified to allow the implementation of the so-called Physically Based Rendering. Thanks to this technique, the quality of the lighting system has been increased - one of the main Achilles heels of the first version - and the general impact of the many landscapes that make up the over 5000 square kilometers of the map has also improved. The corrections have also allowed an advancement of the depth of field, which now extends up to a maximum of twelve kilometers. Nonetheless, we still encountered some anomalies that call into question the credibility of the scenario, for example the sudden disappearance of vehicles traveling in the background or the elimination of substantial parts of the city skyline, especially when you are in mountainous areas and it is natural slow down to enjoy the horizon. Dynamic weather was then introduced, which now allows you to change the weather conditions in real time, even during missions. Now there's wind and rain, but you can also appreciate the large puddles that remain on the asphalt when the sky is about to clear up. Finally, the guys from Ivory Tower worked to increase the impact of the polygonal structures that make up the vehicles, improving their color rendering and adapting the materials to the aforementioned climate changes, with undoubted advantages over the debut version. There would still be work to do As you could have guessed, the innovations brought about with this expansion pack are quite substantial, but there are also various problematic aspects to underline. Leaving aside the details about the narrative, which inevitably cannot be changed unless the single-player campaign proposed in the original version is entirely rewritten, the most important critical issues continue to concern above all the driving model. Regardless of the selected category, the well-known lateral slipping problems that we had already highlighted in last year's review continue to be grasped. This means that the traction control feedback is not so exciting and, although we are talking about a totally arcade product, the difference compared to other competing titles is felt. The situation is equally unchanged with regard to the collision system, which continues to prove to be sub-standard with respect to inert objects as well as with respect to the cars that make up the traffic. We also saw very little improvement in the rubber band effect that plagued the AI. As a result, we continue to see a bad management of the chronometric advantages and disadvantages, which induces the CPU to excessive recoveries in the moments in which the player is placed in first position, or vice versa to improbable slowdowns when he is trudging behind the lines. Again, there are other contemporary products that manage to camouflage these impressions much better and offer a more balanced experience. The same discourse can be extended, in some ways, also to the feedback received at times when the climate changes. Contrary to what happens elsewhere - think for example of Forza Horizon 2 - in The Crew the driving system is not subjected to any alteration worthy of note and instead it seems that the ground conditions remain static. On the other hand, good as regards server management, definitely improved compared to the uncertainties that emerged last year.", "date": "2015-11-23", "grade": "7.8"}
