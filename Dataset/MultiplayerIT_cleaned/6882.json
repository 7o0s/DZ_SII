{"name": "Twerkare next-gen", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/137523-dance-central-spotlight-twerkare-next-gen.html", "text": "Since the launch of the first Kinect, the Dance Central franchise has represented for this device and for Xbox one of the most appropriate and above all fun exclusives of its line up. The game, signed by the expert hands of the creators of Guitar Hero and Rock Band, this time comes in the form of DLC downloadable from the marketplace instead of a physical copy for an important market choice. Dance Central Spotlight costs only 9.99 euros and gives users the possibility of being able to create a customized tracklist by downloading, in addition to the 10 songs present in the main download, other songs for 1.99 euros each. As in the previous chapters of Dance Central, there are ~offer~ packages that include more songs by individual artists or genres, some of these coming from the Xbox 360 versions of the game. A negative point to report is certainly the fact that it is not yet possible get the songs already purchased in the previous Dance Central as promised, it is not yet clear whether it is due to an error or a precise choice. Some bugs with incorrect billing have also been reported and we personally were unable to download some songs in the store, thanks to a generic error connecting to the servers which hopefully will be momentary and solvable. Doing a quick search on the developer's official forums we discover that our case is not isolated and that Harmonix is working to solve various problems of this kind and more. It would seem that the title came out without an adequate beta test phase and that now we are trying to hastily run for cover to avoid ruining its great potential. The beginning of our road test is not the most comforting, to be precise. While detecting us perfectly, and the comments on the moves were indicative, giving us continuous ~perfect~, during the tutorial we remained in line for twenty minutes to perform the same choreography waiting for the CPU to consider us ready to start with the actual game. And without the possibility of skipping this phase of approaching the game. The bug was brilliantly fixed by having a second person enter the Kinect's field of vision and from that moment Dance Central Spotlight exclaimed ~congratulations, you seem to be ready!~. A daring start for sure! It seems that the game came out a bit too hastily, without proper debugging. A half successful game If on the one hand Dance Central Spotlight does not betray the expectations of all fans of the series thanks to its navigated playability, on the other it is managing to put everyone's nerves to the test, both old fans and new buyers who have approached it with the Xbox One version. We won't dwell much on how the game works in and of itself but rather on the differences, strengths and weaknesses of this version because we believe that the original gameplay of Dance Central is no longer a secret for almost anyone. In any case, it is obviously a musical game based on the coordination and execution of dance ~moves~ and choreographies in front of a dancer who, positioned in front of us in the mirror, introduces us to the various figures to imitate. The use of the Kinect has the multiple function of monitoring us in real time, giving an opinion on our performance while we are running it, and receiving some live voice commands. Kinect 2.0 does its job very well by processing a 1080p image against the ~old~ 720p and perfectly detecting the body in situations of much more restricted space than the first version required. We tried to dance just one meter away, and even with a table in the middle of the room, the game still manages to capture every movement of all parts of the body correctly, without errors. As in any musical title, the objective of Dance Central Spotlight is to be able to get as many points as possible by performing the moves precisely and rhythmically in time, perhaps by trying to chain combos to increase the score, or you can dance next to a friend in fun local multiplayer. Also in this case there is a strange bug, apparently related to the use of two user profiles, which blocks the game and causes it to crash in some moments the game for two, for example at the end of a song, or if you you unlock an achievement. On the official Harmonix forum there are reports of this annoying problem and the developers have promised a quick solution, probably arriving while you are reading these lines. Returning instead to the single player, the game goes straight to the point without many frills. Features already seen in the packaged chapters are missing, such as the ability to change the clothes of the selected charactersionable, or to change the dance stage. Harmonix has also been stingy with options and features: you can select single or double play, dance to your chosen song and that's it. There is only a variant called Fitness which lets us choose the duration of the training from 10 to 90 minutes and allows us to dance continuously for this period of time, after entering some of our data such as height and weight which allows the game to make a more precise calculation of ~how much~ we are disposing of. Fortunately, each song can be tackled with eight different dance routines, and when we start we find only one selectable. Borrowing a role-playing term, one could say that in Dance Central Spotlight the character needs to be ~grinded~, because all the various figures and choreographies are unlocked as one advances with the scores and improves. Most of the available moves have already been seen and tried in Dance Central 2 and 3 before, only a small part are completely new. From a purely manufacturing point of view however, the game is once again extremely pleasant to admire visually and with greater detail of the characters and background, combined with greater dynamism (any element moves, dances or is animated), it has a very pleasant, despite running at 30fps instead of the usual 60fps. Xbox One goals As per tradition, even the latest Harmonix effort gives gamers the canonical 1000 points to unlock, through 35 objectives that are not always easy to obtain. Most are unlocked simply by progressing, doing so you learn new dance ~routines~, get special moves and get better and better combos. Some objectives are tougher, such as those that need to have completed 900 moves or 100 routines, but in general this game certainly won't drive you crazy to get to the fateful ~1000 points~. The Dance Central Spotlight tracklist In a music game the choice of songs is a good half of the success of the title itself. It is not always easy to be able to satisfy a large audience such as that of Xbox One, made up of players of all ages, genders and backgrounds, but we certainly appreciate the choice undertaken with the new Dance Central course to distribute it only digitally at a very low price, leaving the possibility for everyone to be able to create their own favorite tracklist. Even the price of the individual songs, 1.99 euros, seems honest to us and even lower than that of the previous chapters of the series (2.85 euros). The songs available with the DLC are relatively recent: #thatPOWER by will.i.am; One Republic's Counting Stars; Rihanna's Diamonds; Pharrell Williams' Happy; Cher Lloyd's Wishes; Lorde's Royals; Kid Inc's Show Me; Jason Derulo's Talk Dirty; Titanium by David Guetta and Wake Me Up by Avicii. We therefore go from dance to hip-hop, the most popular genres at every longitude of the globe, passing from ballads to Latin American as regards the single paid songs. We certainly expect more work from the talented Harmonix team, certainly that of solving the numerous problems that afflict their latest creature, and subsequently a full-bodied addition of new songs and choreography. In our opinion, the direction taken is the right one.", "date": "2014-10-01", "grade": "6.5"}
