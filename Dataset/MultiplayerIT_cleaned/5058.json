The title, although it did not aim to slavishly recreate the life of the youtuber, still proved to be interesting and able to give a few smiles. Compared to our test of the Early Access version, the game that is available to buy now on Steam is its definitive version. Although we had already adequately pitted the experience, it seemed right to go and check the status of the work and the support offered by the developers in recent months. Youtubers Life is fresh and fun, but it will certainly not remain in the history of the genre to which it belongs Because iutubber is beautiful! Where the title up until six months ago gave the possibility of pursuing only a career related to the gaming channel, today it also allows you to launch yourself into the world of music or that of the now ubiquitous kitchen. Everything happens exactly as before. You create your own avatar, to which you apply a modest array of physical variables and immediately launch yourself into the cauldron. Having already talked in depth about what a gaming career is, let's try to give an idea of the differences and the strengths of the new opportunities. It is precisely on the basis of this purpose that the first major problem arises. Although the effort of the U-Play guys to give a specific connotation to both the musical and culinary choice is appreciable, the not extreme depth of the gameplay of the title still hides a certain repetitiveness of the actions to be carried out. It cannot be denied that the developers have read and assimilated the feedback from the players over the months, but the feeling of always playing the same thing with a change in aesthetics and themes is quite pressing. Don't misunderstand, there are differences and they are reflected in the obvious change of setting, in the need to collaborate with major record labels or very important chefs. You may travel the world playing or practice catering, but inevitably that sense of chronic dj vu makes itself felt. The problems on the exaggeratedly fast passage of time have been filed and an attempt has been made to make the editing of the videos less random and more reasoned, but the juice remains the already fun one of the first version. Your tasks will always respond to the primary need to produce good videos, following a process of assembling various randomly generated sections that will be received by your audience. Every time you upload a video to your channel, the statistics relating to that content will increase for a period of time directly proportional to the quality of the video itself. This basic rule will produce new subscribers, new views and the consequent increase in your finances. Alongside your avatar's main activity, it will then be possible to take advantage of all the Sims-like substrate that the game has to offer. It won't be enough to package videos in profusion if you don't maintain your interpersonal relationships and you don't participate in events and collaborations, necessary for the growth of our business. Dinners, parties, outings with friends, meetings with producers and colleagues will form the basis of the gameplay of the title and also represent its strong point, as well as the most successful of the two new campaigns. Let me be clear: we are certainly not talking about gameplay distortions, nor about an extraordinary innovation of the ideas underlying the genre to which it belongs, but Youtubers Life continues to offer a few hours of pleasant company for all management lovers looking for something less demanding than usual. And now what job do I invent? Having to try to analyze the progress made during the Early Access period, one cannot fail to realize the positive attitude of the development team. For months the guys at U-Play have read, assimilated and put into practice the good ideas coming from the community. This has translated into a series of updates to fix the flaws present in the release of the new campaigns. As for the music channel, among the interesting features it is possible to note that of the procedural generation of the tracks that are composed by one's alter ego. This will involve a series of variables capable of making each game different from the others. Thanks to the possibility of playing in real live concerts, the musical campaign is fresh and fun, probably the best and most stratified among those present. As for the latest arrival, which has now been present for a couple of months, the narrative arc of the chef campaign has a particular appeal on its side given the great success ofi this kind of content, both on TV and on the web. From the simple dish cooked and taken at home, you get to be noticed, through your own channel, by the main executive chefs of the best restaurants, and invited to cook for them in their own premises. Nothing striking and certainly less spectacular than a career as a professional singer, but still able to give smiles and pleasant sessions between a first course and a dessert to conclude. In short, the new careers work without upsetting the system, keeping the creation of the videos linked to the choice of cards to be placed in specific points of the timeline. However, it is the small additions, such as the musical mini-game linked to live concerts, that add that pepper that is perhaps still missing from the title to make it a complete and lasting tycoon. Now I'm redoing my wardrobe Two words are required regarding the technical aspect. Youtubers Life does not claim to establish itself as a milestone in the gaming landscape. The purely aesthetic aspect does not represent its most inspired and most successful side, but over the months something has certainly been retouched. The addition of a good deal of detail, general cleaning and a fair amount of work on the models, have made the simple and cartoony style of the game, something really pleasant to look at. In a market where the most pumped texture is blindly sought, or artistic research where there are no big budgets, the U-Play title aims for simplicity. Whether this is good or bad is up to you to decide. As for the translation of the game, this is limited to making understandable in our language, whatever is said or written during your campaign. It certainly does not shine for lexical refinement and the impression is that not everything has been translated in the most suitable way, but in the end we are not talking about a Dark Souls full of history to be assimilated, so we can be satisfied with the work done.", "date": "2017-02-08", "grade": "7.3"}
