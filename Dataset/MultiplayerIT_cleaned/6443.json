So let's see if with this Silly Sausage in Meat Land, the positive streak of Nitrome is destined to continue ... Stupid sausage The protagonist of Silly Sausage in Meat Land is a dog in the shape of a sausage (or a sausage in the shape of a dog, for posterity the arduous sentence) capable of lengthening his body to excess, which must exploit precisely this ability to cross a magical world full of pieces of meat that smile happily but also fraught with pitfalls. Excluding perhaps only the most uncompromising vegan audience, it is inevitable that the bizarre setting of the Nitrome title will immediately be liked, thanks both to the crazy premises and to a technical realization that exudes joy from all pores: graphically the style is the classic one of the team London, with a colorful pixel art that refers to the 16-bit era, while on the sound front the chiptune background music manages to accompany the action well without being monotonous or annoying. If we add to the calculation the fact that the game offers an achievement that is unlocked when the protagonist dog ends up sniffing his butt, it is clear that we are faced with a title that does not take itself at all seriously, but which nonetheless presents a playful structure that is anything but stupid or trivial: Silly Sausage in Meat Land could in fact be described as an evolution of the old Snake concept, with the user controlling the extendable body of the four-legged sausage simply by swiping on the screen in the direction you want to go. We continue looking for surfaces on which the protagonist can hang to then shrink back to its original size in a short time, an operation to be repeated in order to further advance in the scenario: a literally ~fast and loose~ game mechanic that the developers have been good at exploiting with playful side elements that are always spot on. Silly Sausage in Meat Land isn't Nitrome's best game, but it's still nice and fun Silly Sausage in Meat Land is technically composed of a single large level that develops without interruption, but the sensation is still that of being faced with a succession of small stages joined together: thanks to a good design capable of combining variety and raising the level of challenge as you continue, but also a well-chosen checkpoint system. In essence, at regular intervals there are kennels that can be set as a rebirth point in the event of death, by paying a certain amount of diamonds (to be collected along the way) or by agreeing to view an advertisement. An aspect that gives the game a pinch of strategy, given that precious stones are available in a limited number and in any case not sufficient to cover the costs for the purchase of each individual checkpoint. However, this is not the only aspect of Silly Sausage in Meat Land that forces the user to use his head a little, given that the game is full of obstacles that are only apparently trivial: therefore overcoming a rotating blade can appear simple, but it must be considered to pass it with the necessary timing to ensure that the protagonist dog has time to withdraw its extensible body before it comes into contact with the source of danger. In short, everything works properly in the Nitrome product, just a pity that the very nature of the gameplay tends to become rather repetitive ahead of time, making the game's charm diminish in the more advanced and demanding phases which for this very reason could lead someone to abandon the title before completing it.", "date": "2015-04-01", "grade": "8.0"}
