{"name": "Mario Power Tennis", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mario-power-tennis.html", "text": "The basic formula Mario Power Tennis immediately strikes the viewer with a spectacular presentation in FMV and with characters with excellent details and fluid animations, which move at 60 frames per second, even leaving some nice details on the backdrops. The graphic design of the game is engaging, colorful, in some moments similar to the cleaning levels of a pre-rendered movie. To make everything more spectacular, the view behind the player's shoulders is taken care of, selectable in addition to a fixed picture and a dynamic camera. In itself, this would not count for much without an actual value for the player, which fortunately is on the same level as the episode for Nintendo64. The harmonious combination of disarming simplicity with an initial approach and surprising complexity of the technical potential is the real strength of Mario Power Tennis, a title that can happily entertain both the most total, casual and inexperienced owner of the joypad as well as the expert shooter visitor accustomed to dual and triple keyboard/mouse controls. Also in this version, it would be sufficient to use only the forehand and backhand assigned to the A and B keys to have fun. However, the game offers more. There are strokes with greater power, which can be performed either by doubling the pressure of the button in question in time or by pre-loading the stroke by keeping the key pressed. But also lobs (A followed by B) and blocks at the net (B followed by A), which guarantee the strategic use of depth of field. Recoveries in full stroke can be carried out using the L key, which in the offensive phase also serves to get back on track instead of continuing to load a shot that would risk not hitting the mark. The basic moveset is simple, but guarantees a very deep strategic use to the advantage of any type of player. The selectable characters, then, come with very different basic skills, now unbalanced on power (Bowser, Wario), now on technique (Peach, Daisy), now on speed (Yoshi, Koopa), with all-round characteristics (Mario , Luigi), with an unsettling hitting technique (Bowser Jr., Boo) or with a marked propensity for defense (Waluigi). If the single game turns out to be not too demanding and the various extra modes are welcome but sometimes not exciting, in terms of multiplayer the control system, combined with the possibility of selecting team composition and level of preparation of any computer-controlled opponents, translates into the potential for exhilarating challenges at various levels of technique. The special shots The real novelty of Mario Power Tennis, however, is the presence of special moves. Activated in a totally automatic, partially or completely manual way, the special shots are on the one hand a source of entertainment and on the other a strategic factor. Each character has two supplied, which he can also implement several times within a single game every time his racket starts to sparkle, based on the goodness of the shots and the movements made. The offensive moves, carried out when standing very close to the ball to be hit and presented as animated deadlifts in ~frozen~ time, produce very powerful shots, which are difficult to intercept and which, if received, jolt the opponent backwards, making it difficult to recovery. Defensive moves allow the character to recover the ball when it would be far away and lost by now. For example, Yoshi enters an egg, travels the path that separated him from the ball and hits it, Wario recovers the ball with a spring and sends it back to the sender, and so on. Special hits, however, also expose you to potential backlash. Defensive strikes are fairly bland, and an opponent's reply is always close at hand. The offensive ones, even if difficult to intercept, can be returned to our half of the field, probably finding us slowed down and unprepared to reply in turn. The special shots Obviously, the blows and the answers tend to accumulate, often creating an all too evident accumulation of hits, answers in extremis, frontal attacks, explosions and exchanges at the millisecond. This, in part, presents problems. The special shots, in fact, freeze the game with their animations for a couple of seconds, and when the camera goes back to play mode, the attention on the ball is particularly affected, a fact aggravated by the presence of special effects and explosions that actually cover the yellow sphere sometimes preventing precise answers. This problem does not always become effective, and it is always possible to exclude special shots for ~pure~ games. But it would have been better to guarantee the possibility of disabling or not cluttered animations and/or effectsnts for a happy compromise between the two methods. Other forms of tennis The modes of Mario Power Tennis offer a good variety of approaches and various diversissements on the main game. First, you can choose whether to play in normal, ring or bonus mode. In ring mode the field is filled with rings in mid-air, and victory is determined based on the points obtained by hitting them. In the bonus mode, it is possible to hit Mario Kart-style power-up boxes, releasing shells, banana peels and all the mushrooms, invulnerability stars and lightning-shrinkers on the field against the opponents to our advantage. Extra modes are also available, set in typical scenarios of the Mario universe. In the sunny settings of Mario Sunshine it will be possible to play a tennis variant with octopuses to be hit to dirty the opponent's court and fountains to be activated to make our part usable. In Luigi's haunted house it will be necessary to hit the ghosts, while in Wario's factory the goal is to satiate one's Chain Chomp to prevent it from attacking us and direct bombs to those of others to awaken them. There is no shortage of stages with self-propelled blocks that determine whether the portion of the field is valid or is to be considered out, and others. Finally, there are extra modes, such as the one that imitates coloring books and invites us to hit the areas to be filled with colorful water balloons, or unlockable stages such as a tennis fight to destroy a Bowser mecha. Other forms of tennis The modalities are certainly interesting, but tend to be repetitive and are often more imaginative in concept than actually well implemented. The single player game features several cups in ascending mode and cute victory animations, which highlight the beautiful polygonal models and very welcome slapstick comedy gags. During the end credits, for example, alternative clips of the presentation FMV are presented, purported to be alleged ~shot errors~ of the Nintendian characters. And the cups made with nice refraction effects and a fair number of polygons remind the production behind Mario Kart that every fifteen years a little attention to the aesthetic realization of the endcaps would also be needed. There are some unlockable characters. And if Yoshi, increasingly kawai, remains the favorite of the fairer sex, this time Nintendo even takes the liberty of providing Daisy and Peach with a set of skirts that should not be underestimated. A prelude? Be that as it may, the real raison d'tre of Mario Power Tennis remains the multiplayer mode, which risks making the risk of losing friendships to the control of a gamepad concrete. It's just a shame that there isn't a co-op mode in the tournament as well. Mario Power Tennis has a solid basic formula: it is easy to approach and complex to use technically. The addition of special shots has its relevance in the economy of the simulation and could arouse many objections from those looking for ~dry~ gameplay. On the other hand, if racket purists consider them a nuisance, they can deactivate them at any time. A middle ground is missing and would have been welcome, but the gameplay of Mario Power Tennis still shines and the multiplayer projects it towards almost infinite use. Not to mention Daisy's aesthetic accomplishment and hot pants. Pros: brilliant presentation and aesthetics multiplayer and various extra modes intuitive start, technical potential new special shots and characters Cons: special shots are likely to just cause confusion it would have been better to be able to turn off the effects is there no cooperative mode in the online play tournament? Nothing... The assumption underlying the creation of Mario Power Tennis is that, starting from a solid tennis simulation, it is possible to build a surplus of chaos, fun and strategy by enriching the interaction with special moves with flaming effects and with the appeal of the characters from the big N, framed in a brilliant and compelling audio-visual presentation. The explosive defensive and offensive special moves are the real novelty behind this substantial upgrade of the Nintendo64 title. In some moments the new special shots can create too much visual chaos or risk harming the clarity of the tennis simulation. However, in general they constitute an additional strategy factor in a simulation that manages to balance the simplicity of the approach and a considerable technical potential. With successful interaction, a wide range of options, a presentation of high production standards and multiplayer for up to four players, Mario Power Tennis is one of the best tennis propositions in the commerchandise.", "date": "2005-03-04", "grade": null}
