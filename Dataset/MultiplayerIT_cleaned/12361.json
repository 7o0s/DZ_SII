{"name": "Il Padrino: BlackHand Edition - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/il-padrino-blackhand-edition-recensione.html", "text": "Hold back your anger! This is the advice that Don Vito Corleone, masterfully interpreted on the screen and also in the video game (in fact the dubbing is his, the last artistic act before his death) by a superb Marlon Brando, bestows on a boy in the opening cut scene, a boy who has had just seen his father, a faithful and loyal member of the Corleones, die under the gunshots of a rival family. Hold back your anger and one day, when you're old enough, you'll have your revenge; as you will have understood, the little boy will be, nine years later, the novice little boy that we will guide towards the conquest of New York, and the Godfather's advice to the protagonist should also be taken into serious consideration by the player, given that the game we have opposite, although it can be fully classified in the category of Actions open to the GTA, Sandbox Games to quote the English, tends much more to reward mafiosi with a sneaky and strategic intellect than those ready to pull the trigger at the first opportunity . the Wii version adds a large number of missions, new weapons, new vehicles to drive. But above all, a new way to play! Hold back your anger! The Godfather takes up the plot and setting of the film saga, obviously through the unraveling of a story, ours, parallel to the one described by Coppola and which will have the opportunity to intertwine with this more than once; in the role of the aforementioned boy, now grown up, you will have to make your way into the ranks of the Corleone family and you will be able to do so, as in all self-respecting Sandboxes, both by following the main plot, linear and obligatory if you want to see the ending, and the numerous secondary missions that will be entrusted to you from time to time, or simply acting on your own, walking around the city, attacking this or that business in the hands of a rival family even when this has not been requested of you at all. In its structure, Blackhand Edition does not differ at all from the original title, so it is advisable that you read the review written a year ago on these same pages for all the details; the Wii version adds a large number of missions, new weapons, new vehicles to drive. But above all, a new way to play! Does crime pay? We do not know. What we can tell you for sure is that it definitely makes you sweat! The control system devised by EA for this very special version of the game is in fact, as to be expected, considerably more physical and lively than previously seen on a very normal joypad: if many things, above all moving the character and camera, are still responsible for keys, practically all melee moves can be performed with skilful remote control and nunchuck movements, which reproduce with a good approximation what each of us normally does in real life when he finds himself carrying out some mission on behalf of his own mafia family of reference ( who doesn't have one?). Normal slashing, hooks and powerful blows, as well as slamming the unfortunate opponent once taken by the collar against the walls or corners of a bar counter, everything is to be done by imitating real movements with one's own body; not to mention when you have a weapon in your hand, whether it is a white one (we don't have to explain to you what you have to do to hit an unfortunate person with a baseball bat, right?) or a firearm: in the latter case, the Wiimote transforms into the real-world avatar of the game's weapon, and you'll be aiming at the TV, whether it's lock-on to the enemy or in a completely free aiming mode, then pull the trigger when you think you're sure-fire. The result? Surprising, and on two fronts. The first related to the control system itself, which is intelligent and well implemented, leaving room for very few criticisms: in fact, only on very few occasions has it happened that the game did not interpret well what we wanted it to do, and sensitivity problems that might come across the first few times that you need to aim at someone or something, they can easily be solved by recalibrating the sensitivity itself from the options. But above all such a control system makes the game immensely more intuitive and immediate by not making it lose anything in depth, bringing The Godfather  Blackhand Edition, a step higher than the original and, in the very humble opinion of the writer, of all the competition, which often and willingly presents control systems necessarily, given the amount of things to do, abstruse and not at all immediate, which represent a significant barrier to entry into a genre that should make immediacy its flagship. Incredible, the new Nintendo console also fixeshe problem of a kind that is only now peeping timidly between one Mario and another such a control system makes the game immensely more intuitive and immediate by not making it lose anything in depth Does crime pay? Closing as it should, that is with the technical-artistic department, it should be noted first of all that the game's graphics engine is clearly old-gen, completely based, if not exactly taken verbatim, on the Xbox version. Not that it's a bad sight, for heaven's sake: the polygons on the screen are many allowing a detailed reproduction of New York in the 1940s, which is also quite lively with numerous passers-by and cars going back and forth on the streets; and if you have to make the best of the bad game of a few pop ups (which, however, almost never concern the polygonal models but often the textures) and textures in general dirty and dull, the almost always impeccable fluidity and the camera that gives very few problems. But above all the flagship is the creation, from the model to the animations, of some of the characters: Don Vito and Luca Brasi, for example, literally come to life on your TV screen with superb and extremely realistic animations, especially the facial ones sometimes impressive. To make everything even better there is the dubbing, also splendid in the Italian version because, as in the English one, made by the original voice actors, and the music, which when it is not that of the films, is very spot on rearrangements. Undoubtedly, the atmosphere is all there. The supporting structure of Blackhand Edition is exactly the same as the original Godfather, with the same strengths and the same defects, and if you didn't appreciate it a year ago, it will certainly not be the numerous missions, weapons, various additional material that will make you change your mind . However, a control system could succeed which, although it does not shine for originality and inventiveness, or for intensive exploitation of the Wiimote, is capable of giving moments of great fun and of making the experience much more intuitive and immediate than any other exponent of the genre, for a seamless immersion in the game. How much of this is due to the Wii and how much to EA could be discussed for weeks; the fact remains that EA confirms itself as the independent publisher most at ease on Wii, paving the way with its Godfather for a genre, that of Sandbox Games, and for a target, that of the so-called mature public, who could find a second home on Nintendo consoles after having them, the past generation, beautifully snubbed. Back to us and concluding, maybe in the future not much will be remembered, but in the current situation The Godfather for Wii is highly recommended unless you already know for sure, because you've tried it before, that it's not for you.Pro All already known strengths plus many additions Very valid, intuitive and fun control system Exceptionally rendered atmosphere Cons All the already known defects Old-gen graphics engine It is useless to try to deny it, this Blackhand Edition of the game released last year for all the main platforms (GameCube excluded ...), did not appear at the time of the announcement under the best auspices. First of all, it was a tie-in, a game that, although presenting itself as it should, hadn't impressed that much on its first release, and then it could have seemed like yet another classic move by a hungry publisher who sees the great, unexpected success of Wii and tries to get on the bandwagon by throwing a hasty and sketchy port, just like that, just to ~test the market~. On the other hand, there were also reasons for strong curiosity, starting with the fact that it is a game dedicated to a target traditionally very little associated with Nintendo consoles (and in fact, as we said, The Godfather had skipped last year the Cubetto), but above all it was a new testing ground for Electronic Arts, a software house that seems to really believe in the Wii project and that now, after three perhaps not exactly perfect but still remarkable centers (Madden, Tiger Woods and SSX Blur), has the definitive opportunity to clear customs, in the opinion of the most demanding and ~elitist~ players, from that idea of an enormous soulless and passionless ~thing~ interested only in business which often, thanks to lords like FIFA and its two or three annual incarnations, accompanies it. It's a problem for EA, and to solve the problems, we all know, there's nothing better than turning to the Corleone family...", "date": "2007-04-13", "grade": null}
