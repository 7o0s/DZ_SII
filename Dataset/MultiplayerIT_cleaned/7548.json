Beautiful bat One of the major criticisms directed at Batman: Arkham City Lockdown concerned an absolutely disproportionate release price (5 Euros) for the modest amount of content that the product was able to offer: for this reason, NetherRealm Studios has decided not only to increase the amount of meat to fire, but also to radically change the sales method, transforming the title into a free to play. The application can therefore be downloaded and played for free, and the cash outlay is directly proportional to how much desire and haste one has to continue with the adventure. The game is in fact divided into missions that consume part of Batman's stamina, once which is exhausted you have to wait for it to recharge or spend the so-called Waynetech points to be able to leave immediately. These are given extremely sparingly by the software, and you necessarily have to put your hand in your wallet if you want to have a nice nest egg. This currency then fulfills numerous other attractive purposes in the playful economy: in fact, it serves to resurrect immediately in the event of a game over but also to unlock skills and gadgets for Batman's suit which otherwise would require much higher quantities of experience points obtainable by carrying complete the missions. We are therefore in the parts of the most classic free to play mechanics, with long grinding phases foreseen for those who do not want to spend even a cent: on the other hand, it must be said Batman: Arkham Origins does not force the hand too much in pushing the user to purchases in-app, also considering how the resistance indicator recharges in more than acceptable times. Coming to the actual play sector, the title does not deviate too much from the setting of the previous one, always focusing on the bat man's bare-handed fights against a series of enemies in sequence: this is the foundation of the vast majority of the scenarios, which from time to time they have some variables such as time limits or malus inflicted on the protagonist that enliven things a bit. Batman: Arkham Origins improves on what the previous one has done, but without completely convincing yet However, good progress has been made on the dynamics of the clashes themselves, now decidedly more satisfying. We are always on the side of Infinity Blade in terms of mechanics (or Injustice: Gods Among Us, just to stay within the NetherRealm Studios productions), but with some peculiar touch that gives Batman: Arkham Origins its own personality. You therefore attack by tapping the screen, while a special icon allows you to parry, with another virtual key that allows you to switch from an offensive to a defensive position, with differences that are not limited to the amount of damage that can be suffered and inflict, but which also involve the skills that can be activated during the battle. Each of the two postures is in fact combined with special blows that are recharged during the fight and which guarantee Batman various beneficial effects: it is therefore a good and right thing to alternate the two modes depending on the progress of the punch, an aspect that gives a good depth to gameplay. The part relating to the enhancement of the bat man is also very appreciable, with experience points that can be spent to improve a considerable number of physical characteristics, skills and gadgets: in these phases, however, the free to play nature of the product emerges, with the most areas that require insane numbers to be unlocked without going through the use of a credit card. However, the overall valid structure of Batman: Arkham Origins ends up clashing with a substantial and evident basic repetitiveness: the missions are all alike, and even the types of enemies and their attack patterns are rather limited, leaving the entire weight of the gameplay on the shoulders of a combat system that is not exciting enough to be able to bear this burden. Nothing to say instead on the excellent graphics developed by the developers, which stands out above all in solid polygonal models, defined down to the smallest detail and very well animated.", "date": "2013-10-23", "grade": "6.9"}
