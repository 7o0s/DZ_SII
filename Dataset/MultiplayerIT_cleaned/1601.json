If you have played the ~large~ version of this game on one of the home platforms, you already know what awaits you: in fact, the story retraces in a very faithful way, both in the locations and in the tasks to be carried out, everything that the agent Sam Fisher will face. A very complex story, which winds between Georgia and the United States, made up of unscrupulous terrorists, moles infiltrated the CIA, corrupt politicians and enormous power plays on both sides. Only Sam Fisher is able to thwart these plans, an expert in carrying out high-risk missions without attracting too much attention, always remaining in the shadows and thus avoiding involving the upper echelons of the American government: it will not only be a matter of intercepting top secret documents or bring to justice dangerous criminals of the former Soviet bloc, but also unmask those who risk causing dangerous international conflicts with a clever double game. Linkin Pak It was well known that the GC version of Splinter Cell exploited the link to the GBA very well, allowing us to use a comfortable radar and some specific weapons. But communication in the opposite direction is equally important, because it will allow you to unlock some extra levels on the Nintendo portable cartridge. Then turn on the GameCube and GameBoy, connect them and wait for the respective versions of Splinter Cell to recognize each other: if you have successfully completed the missions on the GC, up to five new levels will become available on the GBA: it is not real additional scenarios, but with particular tests, such as a race against time to catch a terrorist or a shooting section that will put your sniper skills to the test. To these must be added another five extra levels, obtainable by completing each mission on the GBA with high percentages, from 60% to 100%. It will be necessary to sweat a lot to have all this, but longevity will benefit a lot, and once again you will be able to appreciate the excellent degree of interaction between the two Nintendo consoles. Ssssttttt... As a technical realization, the porting of the UbiSoft game to the Nintendo portable is likely to leave the player quite perplexed, in more than one respect. Graphically, for example, it is impossible not to notice a great deal of care in the creation of Sam Fisher's sprite: well drawn, with excellent movements and a decent range of available actions, well recreated in the transition to two dimensions. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of what surrounds it instead: the enemies are almost dummies, with fairly approximate and little varied movements. As far as the backdrops are concerned, however, the outdoor sections that are very well made and decidedly similar to the GameCube counterpart are contrasted by very flat and repetitive interiors, with locations that are really too closely modeled on each other and with a very similar arrangement of ~traps~. A not very different speech must also be made for the sound sector of Splinter Cell, given that the composers have created excellently made music, capable of making the most of Sam Fisher's stealthy actions, but which do not seem to have devoted too much attention to the effects sonorous, few and not always spot on: think of Sam who, in order not to make noise, advances quietly but at the moment of the jump he yells the most classic of ~uuhhh~ and you will understand what I mean. But the strength of this game lies mainly in the game setting, which takes SC from a simple action to a real ~stealth game~. First of all, the forced transition to two-dimensional has changed the way of tackling the adventure a lot, but the fact remains that the stealth action remains a cornerstone of the whole game. However, the matter is quite complex: Splinter Cell can also be played as a normal scrolling action in most of the situations that arise gradually, but wisely using the hiding places or sneaking under the cameras in some cases will be essential to continue: without alerting the guards, it will be possible to take them by surprise and stun them, thus avoiding consuming the precious and very limited ammunition available. Even the use of the Sticky Cam, capable of detecting the presence of surveillance means such as cameras and photocells, but also of showing Fisher what is happening a few meters further on, allows you to plan the actions to be performed and the right timing so as not to be discovered by the guards. The game would therefore have the potential to succeed in removing a dimension from stealth while keeping its strategic component intact, but the final result disappoints expectations a bit: the gameco in fact flows in an all too linear way, arriving each time only at the bottom of the level, except for sporadic detours of the path to look for a magnetic card or a safe to break into, with only a gun and stun smoke bombs available as weapons. And advancing in the game is not a difficult undertaking in any case: it is no coincidence that the first half of Splinter Cell can be completed in an afternoon, while advancing it will be essential to master the techniques for hiding very well in order to advance. The only variant to the gameplay is represented by a couple of first-person shooting sections, in sniper mode, but which don't help much to raise the overall opinion. In general, the impression is that the porting to the Nintendo console is more than good, but above all in terms of playability too many cuts have been made, making it easier at the same time for those who are beginners with this genre of game, but also very short. Longevity which in any case can be increased thanks to the numerous extras contained in the cartridge and obtainable by connecting the GBA to the GameCube, but for more info, I refer you to the appropriate box. Comment UbiSoft certainly deserves credit for having re-proposed and adapted a game as thick as Splinter Cell, removing a dimension but trying to keep the characteristics of the organ as much as possible. The result is certainly not at the level of the GameCube counterpart, but far from contemptible even if strongly limited by the lack of many weapons and objects that should not be missing in the backpack of the true secret agent. It also risks being finished a little too quickly, but the best will have plenty to enjoy the many extras that this cartridge hides. Pros: Stealth action rendered quite well Good technical realization Lots of extras to unlock Cons: Too linear Very limited arsenal Too easy, especially the first half The ghost cell becomes even more invisible, and lands on GameBoy Advance with an ambitious intention: to bring ~stealth~ into a portable game dimension. Cuts and setting changes have become practically mandatory in the passage of the system, but the result is now there for all to see.", "date": "2003-07-02", "grade": null}
