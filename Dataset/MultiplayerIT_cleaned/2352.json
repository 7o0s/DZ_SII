On the contrary!. Sure, if we really have to be picky the audience is a bit flat, but considering everything else this is just a small sour note. The shadows, the textures and the polygonal models are state of the art and there are even those little touches of class that give that extra edge, such as the footprints that remain after the exchanges on the clay or the ringing of the mobile phone that can be heard after an exchange and which is immediately taken back by the judge! And what about the animations during the game phases or in the cutscenes? Well I can assure you that they are light years away from those seen in Roland Garros. I love when in doubles the two partners exchange opinions on the shot just made. Well as you have understood and from the images it transpires, Masterseries ATP 2001 is a little jewel, a real cameo from a visual point of view. I was saying that a lot of care has been dedicated to players who can change the color and texture of the suit and racket. What you can't do is create a player from scratch by choosing his parameters. Well I don't think it would take long. Patience. What a beautiful racket in graphite and polygons! Our player is controlled in an easy and intuitive way, as usual the graphics help the control system with its very fluid and detailed animations. I love the small steps or the slight imbalances due to a shot made in recovery. Unlike its competitor, there are four keys and they are used to make shots: flat, cut, top spin and lob. Furthermore, there is no viewfinder, but you only have to rely on your sensitivity. Personally, I prefer the presence of a viewfinder, but this solution also has its advantages. Among the various parameters of each player, which serve to define his potential, resistance stands out, which proves to be particularly important in matches played on clay, where we can make this important characteristic weigh in our favor. The behavior of the AI, from a first approach, seems very valid and I happened to see different game behaviors depending on the situation or the tiredness of our opponent. Obviously, as I said before, since we can't create our own player, our performance will be directly influenced by the skills of the chosen player. It should be emphasized that each player has a style to which he adapts, so we will find champions in the game under the net or skilled setters. Very good. I want to play on the net (or network?) The game modes are the usual, and therefore we can play an entire season, or a friendly even in doubles. Unfortunately, there is a lack of a training modality that would be used to become familiar with the control system. Sin. Another small drawback concerns the lack of players. Are the developers a bit misogynistic? The game includes games for up to 4 players (you don't need more in tennis!) via Lan, but TCP/IP is supported and therefore it is possible to play over the Internet. I could not try the game over the Internet due to lack of opponents! I remind you that we are trying the preview game! In any case, the prerequisites for enjoying an excellent online experience are all there. Conclusions Let's sum up! 71 players with their own characteristics and good AI, 10 stadiums where you can play at three different times of the day, 3 game modes, as well as stunning graphics and a good control system. This is what Tennis Masters Series ATP 2001 promises and keeps. Since the end of October ATP 2001 has been available in all videogame stores ready to be purchased by tennis lovers or those who like to play it on a PC (a version for PlayStation2). Clay or synthetic? We had just put on our virtual tennis shoes and challenged our faithful polygonal rackets to go down on the playing fields offered by Roland Garros 2001 that Microids, with excellent timing, offers us a very valid alternative. I must say that this circumstance left me pleasantly surprised considering that until recently there was no real choice and therefore the almost simultaneous publication of two important titles is at least significant. Well, have some software houses realized the incredible void in this sector? To ogso it is with pleasure that I quickly change my virtual shoes (in perfect Formula 1 style) to wear those offered by Tennis Masters Series ATP 2001.", "date": "2001-11-22", "grade": null}
