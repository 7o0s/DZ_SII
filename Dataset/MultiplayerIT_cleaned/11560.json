{"name": "NBA 08 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nba-08-recensione.html", "text": "Additions and shortcomings The first discordant note is the absence of the franchise mode, or a championship to be experienced in all its nuances, worthy of the name. Obviously it is possible to play an entire season with all the playoffs of the case, but incredibly the whole technical and administrative management part is missing, an option that is now indispensable given the presence of the same on competing titles. Not that the simulation depth of a Championship Manager is always required in a sports title, but that it is even completely missing is frankly inconceivable. We can carry out a shopping campaign, but this happens automatically as if we were making substitutions, with the result of creating a Dream Team team without problems, practically cheating. This solution is immediately gratifying for those who may not be accustomed to basketball, but it is little more than a meager consolation prize for those who wanted to waste hours amidst statistics, offers, salary caps and so on. While NBA 08 takes away, on the one hand it gives us an interesting character development mode, which can be accessed at any time of the game. In the game (and in all other game modes) you acquire points that can be used to improve the statistics of your initially created ad hoc player, to buy clothing or to unlock new playing fields. Additions and shortcomings It is a very interesting modality, it is possible to indulge ourselves on the physical editor or choose the many objects available, each with peculiar characteristics, but the simple repetition of the games and the most ~valuable~ actions is enough to earn many points, and therefore drastically limit the sense of challenge inherent in such a system. Other novelties of this new release is the addition of the mode called NBA Replay, which is a series of mini events in which the player must relive some real topical moments of the past NBA season. A real scenario mode, 68 ~hot moments~ immediately available and constant support from Sony to update them weekly with events taken from the current season. Without particular changes worthy of note, the 3 mini-games already present in the past edition return, a short pastime, useful just for accumulating points, between one game and another. Of particular interest among these is the 3-point challenge, which allows us to become familiar with the excellent shooting system regulated by a circular bar very similar to the one present in many golf titles. In short, the bar is much more practical, and above all immediate, compared to other games that prefer the use of the Sixaxis capabilities. The peculiar capabilities of the new Sony pad are then fully exploited by the renewed system called Free6, which allows, both in phase offensive, both in the defensive one, to shoot for a basket, mark, jump and dribble simply by moving the Sixaxis. For example, simply moving the pad forwards or backwards allows you to raise and lower your hands, blocking a line of shot or pass. Nothing transcendental, indeed, nothing that cannot be replicated using the front keys. From this point of view, the ~normal~ control method is quite easy, you learn immediately to control your alter ego without particular worries. Hands up and grim defenses After this excursus on what is new and what is inexplicably missing in NBA 08, it's time to talk about the actual game mechanics. The extreme defensive setting of the opposing team is immediately noticeable: very tight and suffocating markings force us to engage in airy maneuvers and frequent changes of play, which requires a good eye and timing, given that long passes are almost always prey to the defenders opponents. To overcome this difficulty in setting up the game, NBA 08 allows us to designate a player on our team as a ~favorite teammate~, with whom it is possible to perform spectacular moves such as alley hoops, but above all useful for avoiding blockages under the basket. Despite this extreme defensive shrewdness, the SCEA title can be played quite well, and contrary to similar titles, even those who are not very familiar with basketball titles will be able to immediately strike up good deeds, steal the ball and perform numbers under the basket. Hands up and grim defenses In addition to the aforementioned shooting bar, as in the previous episode, the ~hot spots~ under the basket for rebounds are back to facilitate newbies, which is very useful in the middle of traffic, to start with a quick counterattack. The inclusion of the new hands up - hands down system also seems to work well, just a shame that many contact fouls are called without doing anything, ifsimply by making a close marking. Still in the marking phase, it is possible to notice a problem of a graphic nature which unfortunately afflicts, sometimes heavily, the game mechanics. Seeing a good defensive application thwarted because the opposing player passes through one's own is decidedly frustrating and annoying, but to be honest it must be said that it is possible to benefit from this criticality in reverse. Unfortunately, such a problem has a lot of weight in the economy of the game if seen from the perspective of the other previously exposed critical issues. It's a real shame that there is this clipping problem because the general cosmetics are of excellent workmanship, and quite rare, NBA 08 can run smoothly at 1080p. The stadiums, the public, and more generally all the surrounding elements are well done, giving a good feeling of realism, also thanks to the chants of the fans. The players are well built and detailed, and have finally lost that ~plasticky~ look of the previous edition. Here too, however, there are some flaws, with unrelated vault animations and the previously mentioned clipping, which affect the good work done by the SCEA graphics. Comment NBA 08 is a very strange title: good ideas, some intriguing mechanics, serious shortcomings and serious technical gaps coexist in its code. This is a pity because the development of the character and the constantly updated scenario mode are very appreciable and well implemented novelties. Likewise the absence of the franchise mode and the simplistic player trading system deeply undermine the longevity and appeal of this game. In summary, the SCEA title gives the impression of being incomplete, and more generally rather superficial, undecided as it is between extreme usability and simulation. However, those looking for a simple and immediate basketball title will have a blast, provided however that they manage to come to terms with the surly opposing defenses and their tendency to dematerialize when they are in the attack phase. Pros Quite immediate Progression of one's persistent alter ego NBA Replay mode Cons Lacks a franchise mode Clipping issues Poor transfer management", "date": "2008-03-17", "grade": null}
