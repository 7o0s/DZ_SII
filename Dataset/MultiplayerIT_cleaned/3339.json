The arrival of the Life is Strange 2: Episode 5 review is accompanied by the end of a beautiful story. Dontnod has accompanied us on a new journey, full of interesting characters and deep themes, of adventures, of action, finally of reflections. A journey that lasted more than a year due to the publication for single episodes, whose perhaps only major flaw was precisely the time that elapsed between one chapter and another of an all too diluted narrative. Anyway, it's done now: Sean and Daniel have arrived. Where? But above all, how? This article does not contain spoilers on the narrative, and we would never dream of letting you know about the ending of the second chapter of the series. However, reading is recommended for those who have already completed the first four episodes. Plot: in the heart of the desert We all know that episode four of Life is Strange 2 didn't feature a big final twist: rather the entire chapter revolved around an already important revelation relating to the mother of the two protagonists. Karen, after so many years, has reappeared: she wants to help Sean and Daniel with the threats of the moment to their ultimate goal of reaching Mexico. What happens in Heaven Point church happens, and then the curtain comes down. From here the plot of Life is Strange 2: Episode 5 starts again, whose main title Wolves already highlights in itself how we have finally arrived, in a circular way, at the closure of the entire narrative arc. The narrative continues quickly, intensely, divided into two precise and well-differentiated moments: one with the mother of the protagonists in her peaceful community in the desert, and a second moment in which Sean and Daniel once and for all try to reach this blessed Mexico, leaving from the nearby Arizona desert. We won't tell you if they make it or not. However, we advise you to once again pay close attention to the choices along the way, for here the knots are now coming home to roost: both those of the previous episodes and those of the chapter in question. More generally, the fate of the two brothers and their future relationship will depend exactly on the player's choices: act with caution. The management of the characters in this last episode of Life is Strange 2 is interesting but partially controversial, mainly because the introduction of new faces worthy of attention had to collide with the possibility of dedicating the right space to each of them in the approximately two hours needed to get to the end credits. Steps to the mother of the protagonists, which the player has already had a chance to get acquainted with in the previous chapter - all other newcomers of the desert camp would have deserved much more attention. The only one who got it is... we can't tell you, because it's a very welcome return from the first Life is Strange, a bridge between Max and Chloe's story and that of Sean and Daniel. The Gameplay: Choices have consequences The Dontnod franchise has already taught us how every choice has its consequences: in Life is Strange 2: Episode 5 it's finally time to understand what all the decisions made since the first episode of September 2018 have led to. dense system of relationships and effects also linked to remote causes finds its climax in the last minutes of the game: based on how we have educated Daniel, the latter will consent, refuse and act towards his brother Sean. The outcomes of their adventures will be mainly two, with some small nuances inside: however more varied and projected in the years to come, compared to the ending of the first Life is Strange. So the system of choices, now that it's time to take stock, has convinced us. Once again, however, the balance between the exploration phases in a limited environment and the narration as an end in itself seems a little more uncertain. Apart from the first half of the episode in which the player can actually explore the surroundings and act on the surrounding environment (but not with too much freedom), the rest of the chapter relies on cutscenes in which from time to time you go back to choosing Sean's lines of dialogue. We are far from the pathos, frenzied racing and action of the last chapter of the first Life is Strange: Life is Strange 2: Episode 5 has its own way of saying things and presenting events, more reflective and closer to others media such as actual television series. That's not necessarily a bad thing: it was clear from the outset that Life is Strange and Life is Strange 2 would be complementary but different sides of the same coin. Trophand the PlayStation 4s Life is Strange 2: Episode 5 brings its small number of trophies with it to the PlayStation 4; with the publication of the last episode, among other things, it is finally possible to obtain the Platinum Trophy for the second season. Nothing too complex: just pay attention to the collectibles, and if necessary replay some ad hoc moments of certain chapters. Final thoughts on the entire season If you have read the reviews of the previous episodes of Life is Strange 2, you will have already understood how in general the second season of the Dontnod franchise has fully convinced us, apart from some small defects of the individual episodes which in any case never seriously affect the high quality of the entire production. When we speak of ~high quality~ we naturally refer to the narrative sector, the management of choices, the charisma of the protagonists, the artistic direction, the audio, technical and graphic sector. Life is Strange 2 is fully capable of keeping up with the general quality of its predecessor, indeed perhaps it even surpasses it in the presentation and reflection relating to some specific themes: diversity, growth, inclusion, the world of drugs, homosexuality and so on. In some passages, but fortunately only momentarily, there is a risk of touching even the clich and the forcing of stereotypes: fortunately they are only moments. Overall, however, Life is Strange 2, and Life is Strange 2: Episode 5 has confirmed it, tells a story that hardly fails to grip the player. Never as in this case has the episodic publication undermined the solidity of the narration, but in the end many have waited for the last release to play them all in succession: especially in this second case, one will easily remain glued to the monitor/television for a couple of days, with a beautiful smile (and a few too many tears) on her face. We particularly appreciated the development of a story ~on the road~, with always new characters available, situations impossible to replicate in a closed environment like that of Arcadia Bay, so many different places to explore. Even the idea of focusing on the relationship between two brothers, which grows and develops during their journey, finally convinced us fully, although we initially gave it more than a few skeptical glances. In short, Dontnod has hit the mark once again. Let's hope it's not the last.", "date": "2019-12-05", "grade": "8.5"}
