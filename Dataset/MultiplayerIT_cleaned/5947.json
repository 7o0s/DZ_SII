{"name": "Guitar Hero Live", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/158015-guitar-hero-live-dal-vivo.html", "text": "It may be paradoxical to stop and reflect on the recent recovery of the musical genre: after five years of absolute silence we had seriously begun to believe that our homes should no longer have to accommodate the mythological plastic instruments. And instead, after months of growing hype, small reveals, announcements and in-depth demonstrations, we found ourselves having the two main exponents of the genre in our hands ready to be distributed less than two weeks apart from each other. Apparently without worrying in the least about saturating the market again due to an offer that is perhaps disproportionate to the real needs of the players. And if Rock Band 4, as clearly highlighted by our review, has focused heavily on the nostalgia effect and continuity with the past by proposing ~only~ refined gameplay, Guitar Hero Live, the protagonist of this article, bets all its cards on a definite attempt to innovate the genre and how it is played. Also introducing breaking news as regards the gameplay and the song distribution system. So let's try to analyze whether Activision's bet was smart. Guitar Hero Live aims for innovation with a new guitar and some new gameplay solutions The plasticone Let's start with the most evident and cumbersome novelty of this new chapter of Guitar Hero: the guitar. The change of developer from the now defunct Neversoft to the guys from FreeStyleGames, the same ones to whom we owe the two brilliant DJ Hero, has brought with it the total reinterpretation of the musical instrument that has accompanied and distinguished the series for years. The new guitar abandons the structure with five linear buttons to offer six divided into two rows of three frets each, the upper ones black and the lower ones white. It is a design change that may seem trivial but which significantly alters the gaming experience at any difficulty level, especially for those who have spent several hours with Guitar Hero or Rock Band in the past. Not having to use the little finger in a desperate attempt to reach the evil fifth button allows after a few minutes of apprenticeship to never take your eyes off the TV again to place your hand correctly on the handle. Furthermore, having to rely only on a precise arrangement of the index, middle and ring fingers has allowed the developer to make the most of the likelihood of some agreements proposed by the game with real counterparts and so, alongside the various hammer-ons and pull-offs that also return with this chapter with the possibility of playing notes in sequence without pushing the pick again, we find the introduction of the barr now allowed by the simultaneous pressure of the two buttons of the same column. More generally, having to alternate upper and lower frets allows very believable finger movements and certainly more adherent to the idea that we all have of how to play a guitar. A handful of videos are enough, and in this regard we refer you to our Games Room or Live, to quickly understand how playing in Guitar Hero Live is decidedly more satisfying than in the past and we were truly amazed to realize that such a trivial modification, has significantly altered the gameplay of the game by offering greater immediacy and simplicity at the lowest difficulty levels, the first three, and a much more stimulating and fun complexity at the two most advanced settings. In terms of simple gameplay obviously we could not expect big news since it is still a question of playing the right note at the right time, paying close attention to the ~sea~ of icons that cross the lane on the screen which, thanks to the reduction of the keys per line, is now much more airy and, except for an initial learning period in which we will have to digest very similar symbols distinguished only by black and white coloring (when before we were used to much stronger and different colors), it is certainly easier to follow with the eyes. The hero power also remains unchanged, which is charged by playing specific sequences of notes without errors and which can be used by tilting the guitar neck upwards or by pressing the button immediately below the picking. By doing so, you will be able to gain favor with the public more quickly and increase your score. Where instead there is innovation again is in the game modes given that the offer of Guitar Hero Live is divided into two precise sections: a real single player campaign and a streaming service with virtually infinite longevity, which seems to mimic the heyday of MTV. The superstar of the stage Let's start from Guitar Hero Live, the probabilm modemost heralded in the various making of and promotional trailers distributed in recent weeks. It is to all intents and purposes the game component that can be faced in single player, without any need to be connected and which relies entirely on the contents on the disc. Through two distinct concerts, one with a more rock theme and the other decidedly more varied in the proposed musical offer, we will have to play groups of three or five songs in a row, attending a real live event told through a long series of filmed sequences live in first person wanting to simulate our presence on stage as a guitarist. These non-interactive cutscenes have the express purpose of making us experience the emotion of a concert by showing our interaction with the band but above all with the audience by offering a constant change of scenery, band members and environment to ensure maximum variety and make sense of campaign progression as well. The peculiarity of this side element to the actual gameplay is that based on our performance on stage we will be able to witness two different ~states~ of the environment that surrounds us: one in which the public and the band are full and show their appreciation towards us and one in which the bystanders and the rest of the group will do everything to make us understand that we are doing something wrong. We cannot hide that the result sometimes appears a little grotesque or parodistic and the effect that hides the passage between the two possible sequences appears a little too ~fairytale~ but the sensation experienced, especially the first few times and with the volume adequately pushed upwards is particularly engaging and believable as such a ~virtual~ situation can be. The audience who sings the chorus or gets excited during our solo, the exchanges of glances with the bassist or the singer, the rhythm marked by the drummer before the start of the song, are all elements that forcefully show a certain attention to detail from part of FreeStyleGames in trying to recreate the stage experience. Indeed it is a pity that often you will not have time to look around because of course all your attention will be on the lane and on the notes to be played. And although probably once both scenarios are completed, you will hardly want to repeat them, even just that single experience will still remain well engraved in your head. In total there are 42 different songs which, once unlocked by completing the various concerts, you can play freely as many times as you want, even in the company of a second player equipped with a guitar or armed with a microphone to sing, taking advantage of the quick game. There is also a very basic small tutorial that must be completed forcibly when you first start the game. Too bad only for the absence of the practice mode which in the previous episodes of Guitar Hero allowed you to tackle specific parts of the songs, acting on the speed of execution and the difficulty and which allowed those who really wanted to level up to focus on specific passages without having to play the entire song each time. Playstation 4 trophies The game offers the usual 50 trophies which, by the way, are not shown while playing the game. Outside of the inevitable Platinum, we find two gold trophies that will force you to play for hundreds of hours, ten silver trophies of medium difficulty and which concern specific goals to be achieved during the exhibitions. As for the bronze trophies, there really is something for all tastes: with a minimum of effort, most of them can be unlocked. For MTV nostalgics The other game mode is instead the Guitar Hero TV: without a doubt the one with the greatest potential but at the same time also the most criticizable and difficult to digest. First of all, it requires you to be constantly connected online and develops through a system of coins and levels to be earned and unlocked in ways that are completely unrelated to the Live adventure. The player has two possibilities before him. On the one hand there is a very substantial catalog that Activision has promised to update on a weekly basis, currently made up of 240 different songs that cannot, however, be played freely. On the other, a sort of streaming service that seems to represent the ideal compromise between the MTV of the golden age and the various Spotify and Deezer. Specifically, to play one of the songs available in on-demand mode, by selecting it specifically, we will necessarily have to spend Tokens that can be obtained by paying real money (about 1.50 for a package of 10) or the coins collected with the performanceof streaming songs. Let's say that, apart from the first levels in which the game is particularly generous, we will be able to earn a Token for every seven or eight songs performed with a good score. In actual terms what we will be able to do once the TV is activated is to select one of the two available streaming channels (a third will arrive very soon) and enter the flow of songs performed automatically by the system according to a thematic timetable. All we have to do is play following our lane and watching the original music video of the song in the background. It takes a moment to get ~entangled~ in the system by playing one song after another without stopping, because at the moment the channels are able to offer the right mix of well-known songs and other much less but equally catchy ones, apart from some hard rock or heavily electronic. By doing so, you continue to level up by unlocking aesthetic elements for the lanes or business cards that represent us in the rankings, but also by unlocking new Hero Powers that you can ~assemble~ immediately before starting a new song. And of course you earn the coins needed to buy the aforementioned Tokens. Everything flows very smoothly and from this point of view the real-time ranking system also helps, which will compare us with nine other players while playing the song. A good palliative to the absence of a real competitive multiplayer that we will probably see implemented in a future iteration of the game. It will not happen infrequently, perhaps in an evening with friends, to keep the game open in the background with the various songs playing one after the other, aided by the impossibility of losing, occasionally picking up the guitar to ~strum~ some song that awakens our passion. So where is the problem? It all lies in Activision's precise decision not to provide any possibility of definitively buying a song. In fact, the tokens are used to perform a single song on demand once and only once and if we would like to even repeat the execution we will have to spend another one. We repeat that those we earned during the normal gaming experience were enough to take away the whim of playing specific songs every now and then, but there is no doubt that for a slice of players the absence of classic DLC could annoy. It is possible that over time the publisher and developer will adjust the shot by distributing specific sets of paid songs that can be purchased permanently but for the moment we have to be satisfied, at most, with the so-called Premium concerts that allow us, after overcoming three challenges related to specific songs, from repeatedly playing some live performances of famous artists but also new songs that have just arrived in the catalog. It should be noted that Guitar Hero Live also offers a pass that allows you to have access to the entire on-demand catalog for 24 hours for just under 6, but there is no doubt that this is an option that you will hardly find yourself buying .", "date": "2015-10-23", "grade": "8.2"}
