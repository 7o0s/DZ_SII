{"name": "Invasione aerea", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/125742-world-of-warplanes-invasione-aerea.html", "text": "After a long beta phase involving nearly five million players, World of Warplanes has officially launched. For those unfamiliar with the brand, it is a free to play game with microtransactions developed by Wargaming.net, a Belarusian software house that rose to prominence two years ago thanks to the extraordinary success of World of Tanks, a tank fighting game armed which has attracted nearly fifty million players worldwide. As it is easy to deduce from the title, however, the focus this time is on team aerial combat, with a large number of WWII aircraft ready to do battle, from the classic propellers to the first experiments with the reaction. In the plans of Wargaming.net, a company that has experienced an exceptional expansion in terms of earnings and workforce in recent years, Warplanes represents a fundamental piece of a much larger puzzle. On the one hand, there is the need to continue supporting Tanks, which has recently made its way successfully into the e-sports field and is about to be launched on Xbox 360, on the other a third title, dedicated to naval battles, still in full development, aka World of Warships. It is therefore easy to understand how the success of Warplanes represents a very important condition for the future development of the company, perhaps in order to develop, in the future, a platform capable of hosting the three experiences simultaneously. World of Warplanes finds a good middle ground between simulation and total accessibility Inheritance Anyone with the slightest familiarity with World of Tanks will have no trouble recognizing some of its key features even in Warplanes, simply by navigating the menus. In fact, we find the division of the approximately one hundred historic aircraft into ten tiers of increasing quality, and a homogeneous distribution of classes, including light, medium and flying fortress aircraft. At the moment there are five countries involved (USA, England, Soviet Union, Japan and Germany), but future expansions are undoubtedly destined to expand this aspect. Even the upgrade system, which allows you to improve the endowment and equipment of each aircraft before aiming for the next tier, is the same used in Tanks, as well as the economic system, divided between the points that can be accumulated in battle and the tokens that can be purchased with real money. For those wondering, playing Warplanes without spending a cent is possible, although, in the long run, the long times required to get to the highest tiers and the huge repair costs of the best planes could make you strongly desire some facilitation against an economic outlay. In this sense, the good news for World of Tanks players is that the introduction of the single account for Wargaming.net games, dating back to a few months ago, allows you to take advantage of any boosts already unlocked on Warplanes as well. From a gameplay point of view, for the moment the game mode sector represents the leanest aspect of World of Warplanes, given that only one game stipulation is available. The latter puts 15 players on each side to fight each other in the skies of generously sized maps, complete with good vertical elevation and rich in detail on the ground. The winner will be the team that manages to eliminate the entire opposing team first, or, after the time limit of fifteen minutes, the one that has obtained the highest number of points, both with the kills of opposing planes and through the destruction of targets on the ground. This is where the need to best balance the team comes into play, both through a balanced ratio between heavy aircraft and light fighters, and by trying to always have a good number of bombers available, which can quickly eliminate enemy bases on the ground. The overall balance of the clashes is remarkable, both thanks to the good matchmaking, which exploits the division into Tiers to avoid unequal clashes, and thanks to the control system. In fact, the latter, although it may be limited due to the impossibility of setting it according to more or less simulative methods, causes all the virtual pilots to collide under the same conditions. Aces of Heaven As with World of Tanks, the first feature that World of Warplanes focuses on is immediacy. Without wasting time on take-offs and landings, the match begins immediately in the skies, with the two teams strategically placed in the two corners of the vast map. Already after a few seconds, the two opposite flocks of planes collide and the bullets begin to fly (since the scope is that of the Second World War, the use of missiles is not to be expected). According to the advice given during the short tutOriginally, the more agile aircraft tend to initially gain as much altitude as possible, then dive down and attack, while the flying fortresses maintain a slightly lower altitude, possibly well defended by small teams equipped with light aircraft. The controls, as you can easily guess, were a crucial factor in the success of the game, and in this sense Wargaming.net has done a great job, finding the right balance between accessibility and depth. Even controlled with mouse and keyboard, Warplanes returns pleasant sensations and gives good possibilities for evolution, even if the best performance is naturally entrusted to the joysticks designed for flight. For the moment, curiously, the least recommended solution is the pad, given that, despite full support for the Xbox 360 one, the responsiveness of the planes is far more woody and slow, testifying to the need for further balancing in this sense. In any case, becoming familiar with the controls, even for the complete neophyte, will not require more than a dozen fights, also thanks to the aiming system equipped with visual assistance, with a second dynamic viewfinder that calculates the necessary compensation in real time based on to the speed and vector of the enemy. Overall, the Warplanes gaming experience represents a balanced mix between simulation and accessibility. Clearly, the audience of more experienced aviation enthusiasts will have a lot to say about the control system and the rigor of the flight model, but it is clear that Wargaming.net is targeting a slightly less savvy audience, and with little time available to devote to learning the controls. If referred to the right audience, therefore, Warplanes represents precisely the middle ground, and a possible future success on a large scale will have to build on this. From a technical point of view, the experience accumulated with World of Tanks is immediately visible in Warplanes, which, while weighing very little on the hardware, manages to stage a more than discreet show, complete with credible ballistics, damage to well reproduced aircraft and a good horizon line. Even the variety of environments, although not influential from the point of view of pure gameplay, benefits the visual impact as a whole, and makes the clashes more varied. The audio sector is also excellent, with a qualitatively high reproduction of the various effects, from the roar of the engines to the crackling of the machine guns. Despite the load of these first days of the official launch, the netcode side also appears excellent, with our tests which ended without particular problems with disconnections or lag. The matchmaking is also already working at full capacity, with Tier pairings that do not threaten to ruin the balance of the clashes.", "date": "2013-11-21", "grade": "8.0"}
