Many mistake it for an extreme form of sadness, the ancients did not know it with the name that psychoanalysis gave it, but they did not ignore it and, indeed, they treated it several times, even in different forms. Catholic doctrine has transfigured it into one of the seven deadly sins, making it, in a very broad form, a flywheel to hell. In short, the moderns have only given another name and have better defined the boundaries of an evil that exists and has always been known, probably since the existence of the human being understood in its historical form. Its vast diffusion, especially in the middle-high social classes, has made it an object of study and reflection and, why not, of representation. Video games have repeatedly tried to make depression playful, addressing it and arguing it in various ways. Disorder tries to be as direct as possible, right from the initial warning that is thrown at us by the developers, evidently very frightened by the possibility that someone could buy it as a platform and then find themselves in their hands a title that only shares with Mario and associates the whole ~genre~, but which wants to be anything but. Swagabyte Games takes us on a short journey into the protagonist's mind and his struggle to process a trauma from his childhood that torments him relentlessly. At first what happened is not clear, but encountering fragments of the life of what is now a man, set in a surreal world with many faces, one easily gets to understand the nature of the trauma. In short, by now you too will have understood that Disorder tries to offer itself first of all for its main theme, which crosses the entire videogame fabric, therefore as a platform game, halfway between a Super Mario and a Super Meat Boy, with a heavy dressing conceptual based on Ikaruga. Disorder is a pixel art platform game about depression and trauma processing What is the reality? Disorder's mechanics are harder to describe than to use. The entire gameplay revolves around the protagonist's power to jump between two layers of reality, consequently changing some elements of the scenario. For example, it will be possible to have walls where before there was a vacuum, some fixed platforms will come to life, others will change the direction of their motion, monsters will become buffers, lethal obstacles will become harmless, energy flows will overturn and more. Just press a button to gracefully jump between the two layers and try to figure out how to overcome the obstacles. There is no shortage of secret objects to collect to fill a library of memories, placed in the protagonist's hub house next to empty paintings, which color as the levels progress. Wandering through the maps, largely linear, except for a few crossroads, one comes across dialogues and reflections that can easily be guessed to come from the protagonist's mind. Here, perhaps the problem of Disorder is all here: it does nothing to hide and it is enough to complete a couple of levels to understand where it is going with this. The fight against guilt and its harmful effects is immediately explicit, condensed in the texts and pixel art graphics, evocative but static in adding nothing to the overall discourse. In short, everything proceeds as it is expected to proceed, in the most obvious way possible and with the most obvious possible ending, which seems to come out of a psychology school textbook. More than the exploration of the human psyche, it seems to be faced with a mathematical model disguised as a path of faith for the atonement of sin and the final liberation / redemption. Despite the presence of some strong scenes, the tragic greatness of the man who digs inside himself is completely missing, reduced in this case to dialogue with his repressed in order to win the game. Warning, we are not saying that Disorder is bad. We're just trying to make you understand that simply addressing a theme, as deep and interesting as you like, is not enough to make a game and what it tells about become deep and interesting in turn. Otherwise Disorder is a good platformer, with some very difficult moments and playfully interesting passages, but it's clear that it didn't want to be just that.", "date": "2015-01-22", "grade": "6.5"}
