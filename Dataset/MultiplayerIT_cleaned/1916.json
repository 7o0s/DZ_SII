Before going into the details of the story, I want to give some news that will surely please those of you (ie most) who don't like playing in English: NOLF2 is totally localized in Italian, including the dialogues. But that's not all: it is well dubbed and does not lose any of the polish present in the original language version. Excellent news, no doubt about it. Too bad, however, that in the localization operation some sentences of the Indian guards have escaped, which are still in English. Sure, hearing an untranslated sentence in the midst of so many sentences in Italian is a bit out of place, but it's nothing tragic. But let's get to the facts... Agent Cate Archer is an operative of the UNITY agency, which deals with fighting terrorism and hindering the criminal plans of associations such as the H.A.R.M. of which it is the bitter enemy. During a terrorist summit in a highly armored Japanese village, Agent Archer will have to find his way to reach and photograph the characters involved. But during the mission two events will happen. First, a mysterious OMEGA plan will come to light, which should even undermine the very pillars of world balance. Secondly, H.A.R.M. he will decide to permanently eliminate Cate Archer, as it is too dangerous an enemy. At this point, the real story begins and you can immediately notice the particular cinematic cut that is given to the whole story, since after these events a theme song in full 60s style starts which projects us directly into the UNITY headquarters . From here, however, I leave the pleasure of discovering the rest to you. However, know that, in the course of her adventures, Cate Archer will have to cross half the world and even become part of H.A.R.M. to spy on the organization from the inside. Without a doubt, therefore, the plot is rich and engaging. Serious things: do you shoot? Like other first-person shooters, NOLF2 also provides us with an arsenal of weapons with which to fight enemy agents. Also in this case, as we could expect, the action is present in a conspicuous way. What makes this game different from many others is the mix of different genres and modes. The elements are those already seen elsewhere, action, stealth, tactics and exploration, but they are mixed in different doses from time to time, so as to always keep the structure of the matches varied. But we'll talk about this later, for now let's see more precisely how the game is made. The missions are articulated through multiple maps and we will have to complete the primary objectives, after which the mission is considered a success. We will have weapons and gadgets available that will allow us both to save our lives in the most dangerous situations and to reach otherwise inaccessible places. Leading us by the hand during our adventures and providing us with the necessary equipment from time to time will be Santa Claus himself who, in the guise of a mechanical crow, will provide us with directions and useful material whenever we need it. Behind the figure of Santa Claus hides the director of the Devices Department (Toys Division), who will be the one to whom we will refer to get our equipment and information relating to the operation in progress. In addition to the classic war arsenal, therefore automatic weapons, shotguns, pistols with silencers and sniper weapons, we will be able to rely on more sophisticated tools that will allow us to decode messages, pick locks, stun and deceive. Like any self-respecting spy, therefore, our Cate will be equipped with a micro camera well hidden in the lipstick case and in addition she will be able to rely on a stunner disguised as an eye shadow and a very particular powder compact, capable of decoding encrypted messages and even locks electronic. For conventional locks, on the other hand, the nail clipper with a special built-in file will be very useful. One tool that is somewhere between a weapon and a gadget is the shooter pistol, which can be loaded with different types of ammunition: tranquilizer rounds, radar beacons, and even camera jammers. But Cate will also be able to use the weapons found on her enemies, such as the katana of the very first levels or the assault rifles of the Soviet troops in Siberia. In short, as you can see Cate Archer is anything but a naive and resourceless girl. We have said that some weapons are found on enemies and this is because one of the main features of the game is the constant search for information and objects in the variousareas that we will explore. We will be able to rummage through drawers, archives and even the bodies of our opponents and we will often find resources that will come in very handy later. The plot develops both through the interlude sequences, made strictly with the Jupiter Engine, and through the information that we will find scattered in the various areas. As also happened in the previous chapter, the game will be pervaded almost entirely by a strong irony and we will often find ourselves in the presence of amusing characters and situations (listen to the discussion between the two ninjas: ~NINJAS DON'T WEAR WATCHES!~; or collect Tom Goodman's diary tapes). Little spies grow up... Unlike other similar titles, where there's a strong sthealth element and where the action isn't always frenetic but frequently veers into infiltration territory, here we're dealing with a spy who grows throughout his life. history, changing its characteristics in a radical and customizable way. Growth is well managed through a system of skill points (or skill points) borrowed, to a certain extent, from the basic scheme of the main RPGs. In essence, every action that Cate will perform successfully will guarantee her an amount of points that can be spent to improve the characteristics that have been assigned to her. Cate's characteristics are as follows: - INVISIBILITY: the higher its value, the more easily and quickly we will be able to blend in with the shadows; - RESISTANCE : indicates the ability to resist damage and efficiency in healing; -AIM : by increasing this value, Cate will be able to aim with greater precision and stabilize aiming in less time; -LOAD : indicates the speed with which Cate can move a heavy load, such as an inert body for example; - ARMOR : represents the efficiency with which we will be able to wear armor and take advantage of its protection; - WEAPONS : this skill affects the reload speed of weapons and the time taken to switch from one to another; -GADGETS: using the thousands of spy tools is not easy and so, by increasing this skill, Cate will be able to use her gadgets more efficiently and in less time; - SEARCH : its value directly affects the time it will take us to finish our searches and the probability that something useful will come up. It must be said immediately that the comparison with role-playing games only served to introduce the points system abilities and that there are no other similarities to them. Completing an objective will provide the player with a good amount of points, but alongside the primary, mandatory objectives, it is possible to solve optional secondary objectives, which will reward us further. Searching for and discovering important clues and documents is the best way to allow Agent Archer to accumulate experience which he can then transform into very useful improvements at the right time. Naturally, it is strongly recommended to spend these points only when you REALLY need to improve some feature and not before. Undoubtedly, the most important of the skills to be developed is invisibility, without which it will be very difficult to complete the infiltration missions. This does not mean, however, that in a self-respecting fps the right dose of action cannot be missing and so it is good to give some points also to the Weapons and Armor skills. But, in the end, each player will surely distribute the points in the way that is most congenial to him. Gameplay. The innovations introduced and the amount of gadgets present can be an obstacle to the novice player, making the learning curve too high. Fortunately, however, the designers were able to calibrate the initial difficulties well, gradually introducing the various elements without making the approach too complicated. The lack of a tutorial is not felt, as everything we need to know we will learn quickly at the beginning and in a decidedly painless way. The first missions will immediately project us into a typical game situation: we will have to infiltrate, investigate and certainly face fights. All this while we get to grips with our new role as a spy. The heart of the whole game is represented by a combination of action and research and based on the results obtained we will receive useful rewards, whether they are skill points, new objects or secondary objectives. As we proceed in our adventure, we will learn to better manage the resources and situations that will become available, so ifat first it will be difficult to approach a desk protected by a guard, later we will be able to cross an illuminated courtyard without raising (too many) alarms and not only by virtue of the skill points earned. The stealth approach is key in almost all of the game, but in some missions more so. The first real challenge we'll find ourselves facing is the operation in Siberia, where we'll be called upon to bring out the best in ourselves to penetrate a Soviet base and sabotage it happily, under the noses of the astonished and even a little tipsy guards. drinking too much vodka. Naturally, not everything will go as planned and therefore more than once we will be forced to get rid of someone who just doesn't want to move from that accursed passage... During our mission in Siberia, we will come into contact with the Soviet army and we will immediately notice the strong (and acid) irony present in the game, which will illustrate in detail the decay produced by the elephantine and emaciated bureaucratic structure of that period. Naturally, the guards are not all the same and if on the one hand we will find puppets half stunned by alcohol and cold, easy to evade and almost too defenseless to pose a threat, on the other we will find more efficient and curious soldiers who, often, they will get suspicious over a trifle. Just think of the footprints we will leave as we walk and which can be easily identified before they disappear into the snow. We should never be too sure of ourselves, therefore, because it doesn't take much to put the guards on alert, but we don't even have to force ourselves into forced silence, as in some situations it will be mandatory to celebrate an early New Year's Eve based on lead and dynamite. Such an action will certainly trigger alarms, but, after fighting, if we manage to hide in time, the situation will gradually calm down. In this way, not only is the player allowed to make mistakes that are not fatally compromising, but he is also provided with the possibility of interrupting a phase that is sometimes too exhausting in stealth, in favor of a good dose of action, which serves to refresh the souls and strengthen the spirit. Gameplay. On this point it must be said that one of the major criticisms leveled at the game is the excessive emphasis that has been placed on the stealth aspect, forcing the players to endless stalking sessions and furtive movements, up to bordering on certain points real exasperation. In reality, I feel like defending the work done by the Monoliths precisely by virtue of what was said just before, given that taking out your weapons and having a little revelry is not at all prejudicial and, on the contrary, sometimes it can prove to be a winning tactic. But then it's enough to know how to distribute the skill points earned well, and without too much haste, to transform a difficult mission into a peaceful walk. In short, just don't be too hasty and don't expect the usual shoot-to-shoot game to be able to enjoy this title 100%. As far as the sound aspect is concerned, NOLF2 reserves us nice surprises, alternating brilliant and amusing dialogues with theme music with the operation we are carrying out, but always in a 60s key. Even the spatial audio does its duty, as it allows you to get an idea of the position of enemies and the direction they are taking. Stopping for a moment and listening is one of the best ways to be able to get the most profitable advantage from a strategic position, not to mention that listening to the speeches of non-player characters often proves to be an exhilarating experience, which also manages to fill those moments of rest forced between one stakeout and another. Every noise has been reproduced perfectly, so we will hear the guards lighting a cigarette, through the unmistakable snap of the lighter, we will hear them puffing on smoke, coughing and humming to themselves, or we will be able to tell from their footsteps if they are moving on a stone floor rather than a carpet. The rich variety of sounds produced certainly makes the behavior of the various characters more likely and helps to create a living and autonomous world, where we are not the essential element at all and indeed, at times, we are just the disturbance. We could watch from afar the guards moving inside a base camp, for example, and be pleasantly surprised by how many circumstantial situations and attitudes have been recreated, to the point of giving the good illusion that they are really minding their own business. So, sneaking around, moving from one location to another, gaining a good hiding place, being able to get your hands on those important documents hidden in the e", "date": "2002-11-25", "grade": null}
