We'll talk more about it later: for now, it's enough to know that Justice for All begins about nine months after the conclusion of the fourth Ace Attorney case. Yes, of the fourth, not of the fifth: by now it is known that the latest case of the Phoenix Wright for DS was a fake applied on the occasion of the re-release to test the potential of the stylus and touch screen, and therefore could not be considered at the time which Gyakuten Saiban 2 was released in Japan for the first time. Justice for All follows it faithfully without changing anything of the original title and without adding another extra case, ardently desired by many, but this is not to be considered a defect as changing the texts would have resulted in a discrepancy with the story itself. And the story is very important in this case. Someone will laugh when reading the pretext, in reality ingenious precisely because of its alleged ingenuity, used by the writer to ensure that Phoenix, in the first case, is forced to relearn his trade and therefore provide the indispensable tutorial to the novice player . In fact, a mysterious figure hits him on the head with a fire extinguisher in the first seconds of the game, causing him an almost total memory lapse that will throw him into the blackest confusion as soon as he is urged to enter the courtroom to defend his client, accused needless to say of homocide. So let's start over too, so as to briefly explain the gist of the game to the most forgetful or to those who have just tuned in now. Phoenix Wright is a text-heavy point-and-click adventure, and it's all seen through the eyes of the defense attorney of the same name, a guy with a knack for getting himself out of trouble even when his client's situation seems hopeless . Except for the first case, anchored in the procedural phase, all the chapters take place through the alternation of two distinct sections: the investigative one, the classic adventure, in which one dialogues with the characters linked to the story to gather information and collect useful evidence in the different settings by examining them with the help of the stylus, and the one in the court, that is the fulcrum of the game, in which all the material previously found must be used. It is at this moment that all the most sensational twists take place, marked by an almost perfect rhythm: the witnesses are called to testify by the prosecution, and since they usually all lie, some in good faith and some (more often) because Phoenix, that is, we, has something to hide, we will have to contradict them using the right proof at the right time (~Objection!~) or stop their speech to request more clarifications (~One moment!~), while sometimes the judge will demand that prove a statement or hypothesis with an object (~Here!~). Of course, it's not always that simple, but we'll leave it up to you to find out what we mean. To these proven mechanics, JFA adds another one that makes the investigation sections, if not less linear, much more compelling than they were in the past: Psyche-Locks (Psychic Padlocks) are allegorical representations of the lies hidden in the hearts of characters who come to the surface once they come into possession of the Magatama, a traditional Japanese jewel which in the world of PW is used by the families of mediums to communicate with the spirit world. In dialogue with future witnesses it may happen that they are reluctant to answer a given question: in this case the interlocutor will be enveloped in a negative effect and as many Psyche-Locks will appear as serious and important as his (or her) secret is. hidden. To attempt to break the padlocks and access the truth, it is necessary to show the required tests gradually, but if something is wrong, a penalty will be inflicted in the form of subtraction from the vital energy bar (the one that replaces the penalties of the previous episode and which is also affected when a mistake should be made in court) and it will be necessary to try again or give up; in the second case, when you decide to try again, you will have to start from scratch. Attention: the vital energy is regenerated only and only when an unlocking procedure is successful, because otherwise it is considered as such for the entire duration of the case. Don't worry, however, that you may overlook some shred of fundamental information and therefore not have enough material to solve a case: as in the previous PW:AA, you don't go on until all the actions required by the game have been completed . Justice will be done Mind you: a small change in the game system does not make JFA diverknow itself from the original product. All the strengths and weaknesses of AA are maintained: the development is extremely linear, the interactivity is reduced (forget the free roaming from one area to another: you move by clicking on the name of the locations) and, well, even if it is properly a defect it must be specified that it is not at all a serious and realistic title and that therefore it should not be approached for any reason as such. Not only are the judicial procedures the most deliciously improbable in the world, but the whole setting is dotted with continuous and playful winks at the paranormal, and one could certainly not otherwise define a girl who manages to channel her sister's spirit into her body dead major temporarily assuming its connotations (and forms). This is accompanied by one of the greatest and most surprising qualities of the script, a very rare quality to be found not only in video games, but even in works belonging to much more respected media: the perfect balance between farce and drama, comedy and sadness, emotion and exaltation . During the game, a tragic event that cost someone's life or sanity is never belittled, and their often lightning-fast alternation with hilarious and demented jokes and masterfully constructed climaxes of tension never gives the impression of being made fun of: indeed , helps to create an air of familiarity with the characters that is difficult to reproduce otherwise. Compared to AA, however, the tones have become slightly more mature: another great value of the scripts of these games lies in their non-immobility, in the fact that with each episode they manage to evolve by tackling increasingly difficult themes without repeating themselves too much. And this is how Phoenix, after being introduced to the profession, will have to really learn what it means to be a defense attorney and understand whether it is more right to fight for your client to be acquitted at all costs or to fight for justice and truth. He will understand that an innocent, however bloated and arrogant, is still innocent, that rationality is not of this world and that one must be able to move forward even when the fixed points are lacking and it seems that everyone is against him: the old friend-rival Edgeworth has disappeared giving himself up for dead, and the prosecutor who will oppose our rampant lawyer, the very presumptuous Franziska von Karma, will do everything to ruin him driven by a futile reason such as revenge. Nonetheless, the game finds the time and the way to insert even more hilarious and crazy gags than before, also indulging in a number of quotes from American pop culture. Obviously in the English version of the game. The Italian one, we regret to say, is little more than functional for understanding what is happening, and flattens all the puns, the particular accents of the characters, the jokes and the quotations without even bothering to try to adapt the names in one of the few instances where this process would have been justified by the nature of the game. Even so, though, it's hard not to get hooked, and at the end of it all there's only one conviction left, not without a tinge of sadness: that if real-life lawyers were like Phoenix Wright, the world might be a little better place. Tsuzuku (continued) Tsuzuku (continued) The three released titles (not counting the fourth, which has a completely different protagonist) can be played independently of each other, but it is advisable to play them in order to fully understand the reminders and winks. In this sense, they can be considered as many seasons of a hypothetical television series: in the next section of episodes, the one contained in Gyakuten Saiban 3, we will dig deeper into the past of Phoenix, Edgeworth and numerous other important characters, new even more difficult and exciting cases will require our attention and a new representative of the public prosecution will enter the scene, the mysterious and bionic Godot, who has a great passion for caffeine and derivatives. Coming soon to these screens. Obviously, Capcom permitting. Justice for All is played, or rather, read by playing, practically never stopping until it is finished. It is very difficult to break away from the colorful courtroom where the personal dramas of witnesses, defendants and magistrates are played out, and usually it is done reluctantly only for truly pressing external needs. It's just one of the qualities it shares with its predecessor, and in fact it's one of the few sequels that truly lives up to the product that spawned it. If Ace Attorney, Justice for All and their younger brother, Gyakuten Saiban 3 were novels, manga or ahe animated series for TV, would be considered excellent products (if not masterpieces) by practically everyone; but since they are videogames, we expect someone to frown at their predominantly textual nature, objecting (!) that in a videogame one must first of all have control over the environment and what happens. We agree, but not completely: if a work is captivating, if the time we spend in its company seems to pass by in an instant, if when we have seen the final word we feel that there is something left inside, then perhaps it shouldn't make too much difference whether it was a film, a comic or a video game that gave us those emotions. Approach Ace Attorney and Justice for All with this thought in mind and you too will be hooked: we are sure of it. Pros Psyche-Locks add interest to the investigative phases Even more complex and mature storylines Has exactly all the qualities of the first one... Cons ... as well as all its defects Music slightly undertone compared to the previous episode Flat and anonymous Italian translation Capcom is the queen of franchises. Even from a game that can be easily classified as ~niche~ he manages to get you a series of one episode a year, or almost. And so, as soon as a game like Gyakuten Saiban, made with very little funds and a very small staff, proved to be a sleeper hit in Japan, the home of Street Fighter (precisely) and Resident Evil (precisely) immediately enslaved the writer of the plot as well as game designer, Shu Takumi, forcing him to write continuously for a saga that now, after the nervous collapse of Takumi himself, has passed into the hands of others and will see in days the publication of the fourth chapter only on Nintendo DS. On the DS, on the other hand, the cunning producers had decided to make the updated conversion of the first Gyakuten Saiban, originally released on the Game Boy Advance, then bringing it to America to experiment with new market areas and being pleased with the excellent sales results obtained from the magnetic formula of the game. This was the story so far: now the public and critical consensus has been rewarded with a new conversion, this time of the second episode of the narrative arc starring the young lawyer Phoenix Wright.", "date": "2007-04-02", "grade": null}
