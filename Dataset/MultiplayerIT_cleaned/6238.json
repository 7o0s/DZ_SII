That is, four maps for multiplayer, a new scenario for Exo Zombie and a new weapon with a dual fire mode. Ban the speeches on the cost of the DLC, now hackneyed. The only thing we are interested in knowing is whether the package is worth the ticket price. So let's start with an examination of the new battlefields, trying to understand if the grappling hook is an interesting and truly effective feature during the frenetic firefights, capable of enhancing the vertical component of the Advanced Warfare gameplay. Ascendance is a good DLC, more for the new Exo Zombies than for the maps Long jump Site 244 is set on the slopes of the iconic Mount Rushmore in the United States. Instead of hopping between noses of the four American presidents carved into the mountain's granite rock, it all revolves around the wreck of an alien ship at the foot of the colossal sculpture. Site 244 is a medium-sized map, undoubtedly fascinating given its setting, but not particularly inspired in terms of map design, decidedly normal, which does not enhance the verticality given by the players' Exo abilities, nor the extra mobility (in all the directions then) of the grappling hook. Both visually beautiful and poor in ~contents~, we could say. Still on the subject of postcard places, with Perplex we move to Sydney, in front of the Opera House. Small map full of detailed environments: undoubtedly the best of the lot. A modular housing complex under construction of four to five floors with its verticality puts both the grappling hook and Exo abilities to the whip, practically the opposite of Site 244. Needless to say, such a map, with its narrow spaces, seems perfect for objective game modes. However, there is the possibility of entering some apartments, nor are there any alternative passages to get to the hot areas from the outside. Climate is a good map, full of ideas and many varieties of approach. Circularity is its strong point, bridges and platforms surround the hot spots, and most importantly it's made especially for the grappling hook. In short, marked verticality, but there are also underground parts and outdoor areas that widen and lengthen the firing lines. Also interesting is the fact that what were passable ditches full of water become full of acid later in the game. Staying away from it becomes fundamental: the grappling hook is therefore an effective resource for moving quickly within the map, flying over the lethal greenish rivers. Chop Shop, on the other hand, is the least attractive battlefield in the package. Medium size for a map whose setting is that of a clandestine Exo factory, with a specular layout with two enclosed areas on the sides and a courtyard in the middle. Much of the shooting takes place indoors, the opening in the center also allows for good lines of fire. A forgettable map ultimately. The winning paw of the DLC obviously comes with the cooperative mode dedicated to the Exo Zombies. With Infection we are near a Burger Town, the fast food chain we know from the days of Modern Warfare 2. The gameplay is the usual one, enriched this time by spaces that seem wider than those seen in the first chapter. There are two new types of zombies. The Oozer is the classic acid spitter, the devastating Goliath Exo Zombie, capable of knocking us out with two shots of missiles and EMP. Then there is also the Spiker, but it is a simple Charger with spikes. This mode works in all its variants, both declined in Treayarch - Infinity Ward sauce and in Sledgehammer Games: it's really fun and is undoubtedly the strong point of this package, obviously thanks to its high replayability and variety of approaches. Then there is the OHM rifle: in assault or pump mode, this ~dual use~ weapon is therefore perfect both for long lines of fire and for close quarter combat. Obviously this double possibility is paid for with a longer reload time, so as not to run into balancing problems.", "date": "2015-06-30", "grade": null}
