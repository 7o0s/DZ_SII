The developers have taken the basic mechanics of any stealth game and applied them to a perfectly fitting minimalist graphic style that looks like something out of a Visio project. Each environment is described in its essential features by luminous lines, while human beings are represented by small rotating squares, colored differently according to the type. Thus armed guards are red, the protagonist is blue, special characters are purple, and innocent citizens are purple. The whole gameplay is about avoiding being seen by guards and surveillance cameras. Each opponent has a visual cone that must be avoided like the plague by hiding behind the various objects in the scenario. The guards are able to immediately recognize the protagonist as dangerous, shooting at him to celebrate the discovery, while the cameras have a greater margin of tolerance and when activated they simply alarm the entire army present in a map. Once discovered, or once a guard is killed, a two-minute timer will start announcing the arrival of reinforcements, which is also a tip to hurry up and finish the mission. Once all the prescribed objectives have been achieved (find documents, kill someone, hack servers and so on), you can head towards the exit. At the end of each mission, points are awarded based on how well you performed. High scores are given for not killing anyone other than targets (when there are targets to kill), or for finishing the mission within a set time. As we will see, the score is the only motive that can make some of the maps replay. The only other interactions available are hacking doors and cameras through the terminals and being able to change clothes in order to trick guards and cameras into reducing their attention span, which in the game translates into diminishing the visual cone. A few additional notes The first prototype of Light was intended to raise funds from a Kickstarter campaign. It was there that Team17 noticed him and decided to publish Just a Pixel, the developer, returning to work with third parties after twenty years. Light tells the story of the classic character with no memory who must recover it throughout the game. We don't tell you much because it is one of the most interesting elements to discover, even if it is not very original The game texts are translated into many languages, including Italian. Light is a game with potential, too bad it wastes it on questionable execution A walk Light really got us involved. We know that you have already seen the vote at the end of the review and therefore this statement will be strange to you, but what it offers is done quite well. Too bad it offers very little. During the first few minutes of the game it's easy to fall in love with mechanics that are so essential yet so functional for the game economy. The first levels go away like a pleasure, between daring escapes, bodies hidden in strategically placed furniture, hacked terminals, corridors scanned in search of guards and cameras and so on. Playing you don't even notice Light's biggest flaw, which is also the one that sinks him: it's really easy and short. How many times do you tolerate the first hour of any video game thinking that it has been made particularly simple just to be an introduction to the challenge that awaits us in the advanced levels? Well, Light, after the first hour... it's over. If you are particularly good, you don't even get to see the fateful sixty minutes tick. At that point one is forced to open the eye that was closed and to evaluate some aspects with less benevolence than one would have liked to do. Let's take the already described two-minute countdown mechanic for the arrival of the guards: theoretically they should serve to make us anxious and make us act faster, increasing the difficulty. In fact they have the exact opposite effect, if you know what to do. So, if you want to finish a map quickly, just put on the clothes of the first guard that comes within range, hide his corpse and go around randomly in search of our objectives. Apart from the penultimate map, the two minutes we are given are always more than enough to do everything. Sometimes even time goes by. Why it is possible to play in this way is easy to understand: the maps are very small and it is difficult not to know what to do for more than a few seconds of random exploration, also because the objectives flash and are visible behind the walls. In short, the disguise makes enemies less aggressive at the cost of a timer that gives us enough time to doand what we want. Someone at this point will say that there's no fun like this and, since it's a stealth game, the beauty is not to be seen and not to kill anyone. Obviously yes, as long as you love to hunt for the best score, because the extra points are the only motive that can push you to choose the hardest path in Light, since killing doesn't give a penalty in terms of story development. How much did it take in a linear game like this to include multiple endings? We are talking about twelve missions, the first two of which without enemies. Sure, sometimes you die, especially in the final maps, but it's more about mishaps than incentives to change the style of gameplay. Let's also assume that the guards have rather simple movement patterns and that already on the second attempt in each advanced map, if the situation has been observed, it is obvious to understand where to hide so as not to be seen. Just to say, the ease of Light is underlined by the same objectives as Steam: after the game we had unlocked twelve out of thirteen, with the only one still to be achieved linked to the number of times we disguised ourselves. In short, we have not even been given the pleasure of suffering by repeating useless actions.", "date": "2014-07-15", "grade": "5.0"}
