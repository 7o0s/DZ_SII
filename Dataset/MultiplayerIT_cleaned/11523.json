{"name": "Song of Iron", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/song-of-iron-recensione.html", "text": "Game development is a complex process, requiring time, dedication, skill, and maybe even a little madness. Above all, it is a process that can rarely be carried out in complete solitude. But sometimes, like Song of Iron, it happens. The Resting Relic development ~team~ is in fact composed solely of Joe Winter who, over the course of two years, has developed a horizontal scrolling action adventure inspired by Limbo and INSIDE. This time, however, everything is set in the Norse world. Let's find out in our Song of Iron review whether Winter's efforts have paid off. An open plot Song of Iron takes us to the Norse territories Song of Iron is a tale of vengeance and justice in the Norse world, amid misty woods and damp caves. As a warrior (we can choose the gender, but the appearance is fixed), we must avenge our people who perished under the attack of a rival tribe. Only we have survived and, following the will of a loved one, we travel to the top of a mountain to gain the favor of the gods and their strength in battle. Impossible to tell you more than that, also because Song of Iron, in its three hours of adventure, aims to tell us an apparently very simple and linear story, made up of only a handful of dialogues, in the middle of a long sequence of gameplay without breaks. We say ~apparently~ because, in the final phase, the adventure subverts everything and reserves a rather unexpected surprise. We don't want to give spoilers and it is therefore difficult to discuss Winter's idea: we are sure that for some it will be too random and sudden, while others will be happy to discover that there is something more in Song of Iron than it initially seemed. From our point of view, the idea is well executed (there's a bit of foreshadowing, which will make you say ~ah, that's what that was!~) and it's quite interesting. The truth, however, is that we are more intrigued by what could happen in a sequel than by what we discover in Song of Iron. In fact, the game ends with a ~To be continued~. The strong impression that both has at the end of the title is that Song of Iron is only a ~part 1~ of a story that we still don't know: positive for the future of this potential saga, but negative for the player who risks living the whole adventure as a simple appetizer. At the price of 19.99 euros and for only three hours of gameplay (which as we will see do not allow particular replayability), many may want to wait for a discount or even the arrival of the sequel. Side scrolling action Song of Iron offers a series of upgrades for our offensive capabilities Obviously Song of Iron is not just a plot, on the contrary, it is above all gameplay. Winter has crafted a very straightforward side-scrolling action game based on combat and a bit of platforming. Our character is equipped with a weapon - such as an ax or a sword - a shield and a bow and arrow. The move park includes a combo of quick shots, a charged shot, a kick to knock enemies over, throwing the weapon with which to kill most of the opponents in one shot, directional arrow shots, a parry, a shield down and one rolled over, able to pass through enemies. Opponents range from humans to goblins, with a few other monstrosities in between. The main differences are the size and power of the blows, but overall the tactic to defeat them is more or less always the same: initially it is better to dodge the enemies with a roll and eliminate them with a throw of the weapon, to then recover it and relaunch it against another enemy. Opponents are quite aggressive, but they often use charged shots or freeze in one spot to perform a combo, so dodging them and catching them with their shield down isn't difficult. In the advanced stages, however, we simply find ourselves attacking head on, especially against groups of enemies (just keep them all to one side and they will block each other by creating a row in front of us). The difference is dictated by the upgrades we will get. Song of Iron, from phase to phase, makes us recover a series of pieces of armor infused with the power of the gods. For example, we will be able to set fire to our weapon, to inflict more damage, or run faster and perform longer jumps. Thanks to the upgrades and a little attention it is very difficult to be defeated in battle, also because the life points are constantly recharged (even during battles). You need to pay more attention to stamina, especially if you tend to dodge a lot. The real problem of the combat system, however, is that it lacks a twist that makes it particular or even just a technical minimum: the addition of ana parry, for example, could have made the melee more relevant and would have created a classic risk / reward mechanic that, however, is missing. Most of the time we won't care what the enemy is about to do, we'll simply charge head on enough to defeat them by sheer brute force, repeating attacks, or throw the weapon for instant victory. Platforming and exploration Song of Iron proposes visually striking areas Song of Iron, as mentioned, also offers a bit of platforming, and it is here that you will notice the influence from Limbo. In addition to having to move some boxes to create a passage and be able to climb to a new area, we will often have to overcome sections full of swinging traps that will eliminate us in one fell swoop. These are platform phases in which we will have to find the right rhythm and the correct movement in order not to be torn apart, with even a little trial & error. Some traps are deliberately hidden and we won't notice them until the last second: luckily the checkpoints are well placed in these stages, so you never have to repeat long sections. The pure platform phases tend to concentrate in specific areas, which break the rhythm between one combat section and another. The initial stages are very linear, a corridor that goes from left to right, with no distractions or secondary paths. As you progress, however, the game also offers open areas, with multiple paths - all mandatory - to be explored to activate runestones that act as a ~key~ for the next step, which protects a new piece of armor and its relative upgrade. Song of Iron tries to vary its structure as much as possible, in order not to bore the player: it also helps that the longevity is not high. To keep us glued to the screen, however, will above all be the atmosphere of the Norse world created by Winter. While a far cry from the mythic and lavish imagery created by Santa Monica with God of War, Song of Iron's forests, caves and mountain passages are impactful, with highly detailed backgrounds and close-ups. Considering that this is the work of only one person, there is a remarkable care and attention to detail: we suggest to all players who will undertake this journey to look often at the landscapes and not just think about running towards the next enemy. The sound component also helps make our journey epic, with a high quality OST.", "date": "2021-08-30", "grade": "7.5"}
