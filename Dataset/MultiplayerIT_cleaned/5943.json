Initially a man with no face and no past, John 117 has evolved through events, choices and flashbacks that have seen him even die, or almost. In the meantime, a universe has opened up around the legendary Spartan made up of cosmic mysteries, alliances deemed impossible, decisive choices and immense responsibilities that have somehow humanized the inscrutable Chief, always barricaded in his Mjollnir armor. But it is still not the case to speak of a neutral character. His role is that of the film noir cop, the hulking one with a dark past who has a heavy hand and pushes boundaries to set things right. A role that this time fully identifies him as he sets off straight towards his destination, regardless of commands and rules. And without too many surprises he succeeds, because he is not only the most powerful of the Spartans but, as Cortana once said, he can count on one thing that others don't have: luck. Meanwhile, the protectors move in the background, huge instruments of destruction that have devastated several colonies in a few hours and apparently an old acquaintance of ours, the scientist Elizabeth Halsey, knows something about it. The Osiris team led by the new protagonist is sent to investigate, who shows himself in the long and spectacular introduction. We are thus introduced to Locke, a former ONI agent used to working in the shadows who is given the thankless and difficult task of chasing down the Master Chief. Master Chief storms into the new generation with the ambitious Halo 5: Guardians Unjustified absence Before talking about any chapter of this series it is necessary to put some premises on paper. Halo doesn't aim for realism, it uses physics to create spectacular situations and is designed to adapt to the Xbox pad, giving a lot of importance to close-quarters battles. With Halo 5: Guardians all this does not change with the smartscope and the new abilities, focused on some thrusters placed on the back of the Spartans, which do not distort the gameplay but, perfectly integrated, make it more frenetic and increase the chances of dodging, penetrating between enemy lines and attack in close combat. Having clarified this, let's change the subject and risk talking about the plot, without however revealing anything that has not already been revealed by what has been officially shown so far. The open secret emerges almost immediately and concerns the apparent survival of Cortana to the dramatic conclusion of the fourth Halo, but the revelation does not lead to any celebration. The fascinating holographic damsel is immediately depicted as a disruptive being who will forever change everyone's existence, so much so that the UNSC itself considers her a threat. Master Chief disobeys to chase her bringing with him the most faithful companions while Locke, helped by his team, is the one in charge of chasing him. At this point there are eight Spartans at stake and with such a cast, which includes a digitally emaciated version of the likeable Nathan Fillion, expectations are definitely high. The introduction occasionally gives in to exaggeration but immediately makes clear the commitment made by 343 Industries in the narrative sector Halo 5: Guardians. The only drawback is the specific accusation leveled by the UNSC against the Master Chief, which cuts off pathos a bit. In fact, John's crime is that of being an unjustified absentee and the accusation inevitably takes us back to school, even if it is obvious that this definition is adopted not to mention treason when the symbol of humanity is at stake . The tone of the narrative, however, soon becomes tougher and it is clear that at some point there will be the expected confrontation between Spartans, but here we shut our mouths so as not to spoil any surprises. However, we can go back to talking about the quality of a narrative constantly supported by the arrival of new and old glories in a continuous opening of a massive and engaging plot that takes us from an old Oni base to the home planet of the Elites. All embellished by more mature dialogues, constant changes of front, genuinely dramatic moments and thick supporting actors that help strengthen the role of the protagonists. And the protagonists in Halo 5: Guardians, as the title explicitly suggests, are all Guardians in some way. There are those who move in defense of the law, those who act out of pride, those who are driven by the idea of peace, those who have a feeling. Four motivations for four entities that all have an enormous weight on the events of a decidedly compelling plot that largely revolves, as always, around the Master Chief. Yet most of the countryside la is played with Locke: Team Osiris missions which are twelve out of fifteen. Master Chief is always there in front, he is present, his actions are at the center of the plot but he is not the absolute protagonist. Nothing suggests that Locke can replace the Master Chief as a symbol of the series but in this chapter signed by 343 Industries it is the Osiris team that is in the spotlight, with much of the story being told from the point of view of its commander. John-117 fanatics might turn up their noses at this choice, yet the recipe works. On the other hand, as shown by ODST and Reach, by books and by strategies, the Halo universe does not stop at Master Chief who, we repeat, still has a key role in this chapter. Memories, emotions, past choices and the figure of the hero are the main elements in an intense campaign, full of high-impact moments that culminate in a long and moving finale. An ending that is a fairly clear conclusion for this chapter but is also an explicit opening towards the future that already makes you want to play the next Halo. Weapons, many weapons As in any Halo, there are many situations designed to enhance the cooperative, including large environments, tunnels and secondary passages. Even in the maps developed in length it is not difficult to find multiple paths which, in addition to diversifying the action and making the cooperative more articulated, allow us to choose the equipment more freely. Among other things, the coop has dedicated servers that remove the specter of problems from the Master Chief Collection and the difficulty varies dynamically every time a player enters or leaves the campaign, guaranteeing a minimum balance in the face of the obvious advantage of being able count on a coordinated team. The use of the minimum word is obviously not accidental since the difficulty of Halo 5: Guardians depends, as in all titles of the series, on the player's ability to find and use the best weapon in the most suitable situation. Halo after Halo, the arsenal available to the Spartans has grown by fielding a very large number of guns well differentiated from each other. The weapons of the Prometheans, for example, are very powerful but force us to face important penalties. The incineration cannon is devastating but it discharges even just loading the shot. The suppressor is powerful but has a high recoil that must be counterbalanced with the stick. The beam rifle does massive damage at great distances, as long as you hit with the full beam. The discharge pistol is very powerful but the shots are not very fast and they follow the target they want. The Pulse Rifle doesn't have a particularly high rate of fire. The grenade leaves suspended charges that cause massive damage but remain stationary in an area and can be avoided. To all this must be added the classic covenant arsenal, partially redesigned, and the UNSC weapons which, made more dangerous by the possibility of using the sniper scope even with the basic ones, is the backbone of the arena mode. But humans in the countryside and in Warzone can count on a much wider arsenal that includes the Hydra repeating rocket launcher and the powerful SAW heavy machine gun which, while not accurate over very long range, can count on a considerable volume of fire. And that's still nothing compared to the Response which not only has an incredible rate of fire, but also fires explosive rounds, wiping out very robust enemies in moments. If we add vehicles and turrets to all this, we cannot fail to be impressed by an arsenal that is confirmed to be among the most varied and well-kept around. The same goes for the vehicles, even if the only real novelty is the Phaeton, the Promethean ship which, although not as agile as the Banshee, has the ability to teleport instantly dodging incoming shots. For the rest, there are all the classic means that in Warzone lead to a total of thirty variants for the vehicles. All for one To control your squad, simply press the d-pad up while aiming at an object, enemy, turret, vehicle, or weapon. Once the order has been given, the team acts consistently with the indicated objective and, in the absence of a specific object, a pointer appears which indicates to the teammates the place where we want them to position themselves. The healing mechanics make life easier but they do it up to a certain point, without betraying the spirit of Halo who, also thanks to the rapid regeneration of shield and life, admits heroic actions but is ready to severely punish in case of error. Enemies hurt, Prometheans approach in the blink of an eye, and several maps are literally filled with turrets and vehicles. In short, the situations in whichit is necessary to work hard to proceed, especially when the difficulty rises, there is no shortage. But the refined gameplay of Halo, here enhanced by the new Spartan abilities, is an asset to be reckoned with. The first real boss is a Guardian, the first of a series of massive, sword-wielding and very robust creatures. The weak point is on the back and using the team to hit him from behind is very important, also because this formidable opponent can knock us down with one blow and usually doesn't forget to finish us off, precluding any possibility of healing. As if that weren't enough, he runs, can launch a devastating energy shot and has a dark matter projectile that can chase us and our companions. Just to understand each other, on heroic difficulty with three of these in front of us, despite the many weapons available, we found ourselves kissing the floor dozens of times cursing 343 Industries for not allowing us to issue orders to the team when injured; which is instead possible, as it is obvious that it is, in a cooperative. In these cases the only solution is to move with caution or to exploit inelegantly the fact that sometimes enemies are confused when attacked from long range. But even in this way there is still the risk of running out of ammunition and there is no lack of pursuers, including Promethean aircraft, to put fire in the buttocks. Too bad, however, for the small shadow on the otherwise excellent artificial intelligence: small and inevitable flaws for such a complex thing that occasionally gets stuck on itself. Overall, the campaign offers a good level of challenge, exciting situations, the inevitable possibility of stealing vehicles or aircraft on the fly and the freedom to approach the action in different ways, a fundamental setting given the differences between the enemies. The Promethean soldiers abuse their teleportation, the knights are extremely robust, the turrets are lethal, the snipers rarely miss and in the chaos it is not worth underestimating the aim of the grunts, especially with energy grenades. Each enemy is more or less robust depending on the weapons we turn against them but the armor of high-level Prometheans almost always makes them dangerous, until it breaks and allows us to finish off even a knight with a well-placed ~headshot~ . But it's not always easy to hit the target. In Halo 5: Guardians the enemies, at least on heroic difficulty, are even more lively than in the past by launching themselves on abandoned vehicles, diving into millimeter dodges and jumping from rock to rock to hit us from different angles. In practice, the challenge is not lacking even if, as in any Halo, it depends a lot on the conditions in which a battle is faced and longevity is closely linked to the level of difficulty. We playing heroic, a highly recommended level of difficulty to fully enjoy the experience, took us a dozen hours to get to the conclusion, wasting a few minutes here and there exploring the game areas. Legendary, on the other hand, we can estimate about fifteen for an intense campaign whose value, in addition to its spectacularity, is the almost total absence of downtime. There are some junctures in which we wander among civilians, ruins and soldiers, but it is a matter of a handful of minutes, functional among other things to give a sense of credibility to the universe between alliances, scientists, characters who argue with each other, artificial intelligences in comparison and the fate of the entire universe at stake. Xbox One goals Completing the legendary campaign in solo and in cooperative gives a total of 410 points, to which are added others that are rather easy to obtain by personalizing our Spartan and tackling the missions respecting specific conditions. Some tasks are more complex, such as having to keep the miners alive in Evacuation on heroic difficulty or passing the thirteenth mission without losing the Scorpion on legendary difficulty, but there is nothing impossible just like there is nothing impossible in multiplayer. Thankfully Halo 5: Guardians doesn't include goals that ask you to play thousands of games but is content with five per mode, explore the multiplayer possibilities and complete the ten competitive games necessary to obtain a rank. Finally, as in all the last chapters of the series, the secrets of the game play an important role between revealing diaries and skulls that allow you to apply specific modifiers to the games. It is no coincidence, therefore, that the combination of these two elements guarantees 100 of the thousand points up for grabs.
