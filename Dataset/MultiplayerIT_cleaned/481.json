The story of Trunks in Akira Toriyama's manga is told within a few pages, but the authors of the anime sensed that the origins of the futuristic version of Vegeta and Bulma's son had great potential, deciding to dedicate an entire feature film to them in 1993, which in fact had great success and earned the appreciation of the fans. The Story of Trunks Trunks: The Warrior of Hope, Gohan and Trunks around a fire. The plot of Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot - Trunks: The Warrior of Hope resumes, as mentioned, that of the animated film The Story of Trunks, albeit with a couple of important additions: a training sequence between Trunks and Vegeta is shown in a flashback in the Room of Spirit and Time, but above all a proper ending is given to the story showing the return of the character in the future and the showdown with the cyborgs and with Cell. Let's go in order, though: the Trunks who appears in Dragon Ball Z comes from a world where Goku died of a lethal heart virus and the super-powerful cyborgs C17 and C18 killed all the Z warriors, setting cities on fire and massacring countless people for the sheer fun of it. Trunks: The Warrior of Hope, Gohan dealing with the cyborgs C17 and C18. The young Trunks doesn't have the strength to fight them and asks his master Gohan, the last survivor of the original group of heroes, to teach him to become a Super Saiyan. Training proceeds, but the threat of the cyborgs becomes more and more pressing and soon the results of the battle become dramatic, leaving Vegeta and Bulma's son alone to face the situation. However, the journey into the past allows Trunks to get to know his father, Goku and their friends, learning new fighting techniques and transformations that will allow him, once back in his time, to finally free the world from the terrible threat created in the Red Ribbon laboratories , including the mysterious green creature that lurks in wait for the right opportunity. Structure Trunks: The Warrior of Hope, one of the dramatic sequences of the DLC. Characterized by a duration of about three hours where one proceeds without wasting too much time, a value frankly lower than expectations for a DLC that is sold at a price of 19.99 euros, Trunks: The Warrior of Hope takes up the structure seen in Dragon Ball Z : Kakarot, characterized by a sort of partial open world that on the one hand tries to give life to the world created by Akira Toriyama but never described in detail, on the other it gives us landscapes and cities spoiled by a decidedly old-fashioned concept and construction gen. In short, this aspect does not change, and indeed is emphasized by the need of the package to entertain us with trivial fetch quests between one main mission and another, given the small number of available clashes and their clear lack of variety. Exploring the scenario we will have to deal with anonymous Red Ribbon androids, which we will be able to defeat to try to level up before facing C17 and C18 several times, strictly in pairs. Trunks: The Warrior of Hope, Trunks is preparing to face the cyborgs. There are the same activities as in the base game, see fishing and the possibility of contacting resellers for the purchase of raw materials useful for the creation of recipes for permanent character enhancement, or the very fact of being able to fly around and use the world map to reach locations such as West City, Ginger Town, Orange City, Goku's house or the Kame House, but the game world is confirmed empty and ugly. Gameplay Trunks: The Warrior of Hope, Gohan is preparing to face his destiny. A very similar speech can be made with regard to the gameplay, in the sense that the very clear limits of Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot are somehow reaffirmed and emphasized in the context of a three-hour DLC, in which, moreover, you can only control two characters (Trunks and Gohan) and often find yourself fighting alone, without being able to take advantage of the assists. As mentioned, there are some fetch quests and semi-random fights that it is possible to complete during the Trunks: The mini-campaign Warrior of Hope, but in the end they are simple fillers without charm, inserted for the sole purpose of stretching the broth and allowing us to make somei grinding so as not to make too much effort during the boss fights. Trunks: The Warrior of Hope, some supporting characters pop up in a secondary assignment. However, it is enough to fill your pockets with health potions to be able to proceed head-on, always repeating the same combinations of attacks to slowly empty the opponents' health bar and paying attention to their countermeasures. The fights from this point of view are undoubtedly spectacular, but also very chaotic and frustrating since we will always be outnumbered, attacked from behind by the second enemy when we are hitting the first. The problems with the camera are therefore reiterated, which often tends to go crazy in vertical movements when an opponent is hooked, and the lack of a proper balance, which can transform the unpretentious brawler mechanics of Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot into something a little more sophisticated. Technical realization It is a pity that Trunks' Story has not been exploited better, but it is also true that the defects of the title developed by CyberConnect2 were already known and one could certainly not expect a simple DLC to revolutionize the experience. Even on the graphics front, which as usual gives its best in the cutscenes and in general with the cel-shaded characters, but as mentioned, it puts us in front of a really modest setting. We played Trunks: The Warrior of Hope on PC, taking advantage of the fact that the package is immediately accessible, regardless of progress in the main campaign, and we have not encountered performance problems: net of the very few graphics options available (among which, however, a useful scaler stands out), the DLC runs at 4K and 60 fps at max settings using an RTX 3070.", "date": "2021-06-11", "grade": "6.5"}
