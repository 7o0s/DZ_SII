{"name": "Line of Sight: Vietnam", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/line-of-sight-vietnam_a.html", "text": "A bit of history Line of Sight: Vietnam is inspired by the genre more oriented towards pure action and allows us to put ourselves in the shoes of the very aggressive members of the ~green berets~ who took part in the first expeditions to Vietnam at the end of the sixties. I assume that you all know the story better or worse, and for those of you who may not boast of so much historical knowledge, it is enough to know that Vietnam will be remembered by the USA as the most gigantic and painful war flop in recent history. Thousands of American boys, following a massive recruitment campaign, were transported to the tropical jungles of North Vietnam, to counter the dangerous ally of the former USSR. It was the war of capitalism against communism and ideally the war of all Western philosophy against the Soviet one. If the Second World War was in many senses a revolution in the field of conflicts between nations, both for the armaments used and for the methods of attack (see bombing of cities and so on), that of Vietnam was the revolution of war as an event media. However, the introduction of new war machines brought a series of innumerable innovations to the battlefield. The first novelty, above all, was the establishment of the first flocks of helicopters which soon became the absolute protagonists of the conflict. Military research did not focus solely on the improvements made to the equipment of simple soldiers, but the beginning of a real evolution in the field of special armaments dedicated to the development of small and selected bodies intended for delicate field actions and often too difficult to be carried out by the first come. It is precisely in this scenario of a conflict made up not only of reconnaissance platoons, but also of war professionals, a ferocious cross between Rambo's Stallion and Schwarzenegger's blind fury in Commando (as it happens, both protagonists of the aforementioned films were Vietnam Veterans), which opens the curtain LOS: Vietnam. At glance Now I want to dedicate a few lines to the first impression made during the first few minutes of the game. The action opens on a glimpse of the jungle wrapped in a very spectral mist. The map (which I can access at any time), somewhat sterile and devoid of significant reference points, makes me realize immediately how desperate my situation is. The danger is imminent and from a distance I can already hear the moans of my enemies who, attracted by the explosion of the helicopter that transported me up there, are looking for any survivors. I carefully crouch down until my knees touch the ground. I immediately start a quick reconnaissance in the surroundings with the dual purpose of orienting the map and looking for some useful object that survived the crash of the steel grasshopper. The heavy breathing of my virtual alter ego helps to increase the obvious state of anxiety that already pervades me. Suddenly, having climbed to the top of the bank of the gorge in which, alas, I was in, I emerge from a bush and find myself a stone's throw from the head of a Vietcong, all intent on rummaging among the fronds in search, perhaps, of some piece of flesh that proves my death. I don't hesitate, a resounding shot comes from the barrel of my rifle, the soldier falls lifeless to the ground, when, trying to recover the precious weapons and ammunition that the bastard has left on the ground, I am greeted by a joyful RPD barrage: I'm really in trouble... This is in a nutshell what awaits you inside the jungle. A breathtaking scenery made of action and patience. Hide & Seek is the keyword to survive in this hell. Technical features Ok, but what about the realization? What are the innovations brought to the genre, in terms of comparison with the most famous titles, and above all on which points does a title that ultimately boasts so many competitors that it can only seem a clone capable of exploiting the usual wave effect produced by the mainstays of the genre? Let's start with the technical analysis of the product. nFusion Interactive would like to point out that the graphics engine used is not a clone of some better known engine; in fact, it often happens that software houses pay the rights for the exploitation of particularly valid graphic engines, obtaining the double advantage of making use of an already consolidated technology and not having to waste precious time in drafting, completely, such a complex code. In this regard, however, the house does not release particular information and technical details that can allow un in-depth analysis; all we can confirm is that the engine, certainly not presenting mind-boggling performance, nevertheless boasts an excellent ability to reproduce complex environments such as those of a thick tropical jungle, which constitute the bulk of the setting of this title. Moving on to the audio field, LOS:Vietnam does not betray expectations at all and provides nothing more and nothing less than what is needed to create the right panic atmosphere that must be recreated in such a scenario. It's a pity that, although the sound of approaching footsteps and the rustle of lianas is realistic, sometimes the direction of the sound is not so precise as to provide us with the right help in terms of identifying the source of the noise, an essential aspect in a game in which game actions very often are reduced to patient waiting in silence so that the enemy can be taken off guard. Game Opportunities The structure of the game is inspired in many ways by the best known titles of the genre. We will be entrusted with the control of a very fierce handful of war heroes, with the sole purpose of completing the mission and making sure that no comrade kicks the bucket under enemy fire. The control we will have over the individual members of the platoon will always take place in first person, but it will be possible (and indispensable) to switch from one man to another with extreme ease. Nonetheless, if the action required the control and coordination of several characters at the same time, a series of simple orders to be given to the troop will come to meet us, thus helping us to overcome the danger with the combined effort of the entire team. While our attentive gaze is focused on the movements of the selected character, the AI of the allied soldiers manages dangerous actions with sufficient skill, for example choosing the most appropriate weapon for the occasion, perhaps setting aside the one we had designated a few minutes before. This system obviously does not exclude last-minute drawbacks as the men will always tend to follow the orders given by the commander in terms of tactics to use, although this may also prove to be unwise (or downright stupid!). An obligatory note should be dedicated to the versatility of the game difficulty which, through simple menu settings, can pass from the most severe simulation to a purely arcade game where the character can stay alive despite the hits received far exceeding the real limit human resistance to blood lead level. The multiplayer is flawless, which gets along with the most classic of the Deathmatch, Cooperative (Team Deathmatch), Capture the Flag modes; the only novelty in this sense lies in the ~Mission Mode~ which will see two opposing teams face each other in a clash between sappers intent on putting a spoke in the wheels of the competition engaged in completing the mission assigned to them. Summing up Although it is a valid title from many points of view LOS: Vietnam has significant weaknesses, which I will try to list briefly. First of all, the current state of things hardly allows a game that wants to establish itself on the market in a genre that is already so dense with competition to be able to afford the luxury of not letting the player take possession of vehicles for his own purposes. The latter at most make some appearance in the game as simple props. Furthermore, it is not possible to control more than two soldiers at a time, which is almost unacceptable given that even the Deadly Dozen allowed the control of teams consisting of four characters. We could also somehow mention the monotony of the landscape, but being a game set in the heart of Vietnam it would hardly have been possible to show anything other than the jungle. Despite this, for example, some action set in the city would not have spoiled, perhaps recreating scenarios similar to those proposed by films such as Full Metal Jacket (in parentheses, a must and a reflection essay on the horrors of war and everything that revolves around it around). But at least it will be possible (for those who have the desire and the time) to create their own scenarios with the appropriate editor, even if unbridled modding will not be possible (read no new weapons or substantial changes to the game's AI). Finally, the last sore point goes to the AI of the enemies which sometimes produces situations bordering on the bizarre and the absurd. To be more precise, it seems possible that a greedy filthy miserable dirt and armed to the teethVietcong doesn't notice our presence after we have just killed his companion a stone's throw from him and despite the fact that we are ten centimeters from his muzzle? The answer is no, of course; no, it's not possible, yet it happened to me, and more than once! Let's hope that the patch (and here it is really a patch, the remnant of code put there to plug the flaw), already announced, which will take the game from version 1.1 to 1.3, will put an end to this flaw. I would conclude by saying that although LOS: Vietnam is able to offer pleasant moments of gameplay, through its 12 long missions and the fountain of eternal youth that is multiplayer for each game, this title does not leave a particularly impressive impression and gets along with a judgment without infamy, but above all without praise. Pros: 12 long missions Multiplayer mode interesting ~mission mode~ the tension produced by some game situations is notable graphic engine developed ~in-house~ not bad Cons: not very original there are no usable vehicles it is possible to use only teams of two characters nFusion Interactive: the cue for war nFusion Interactive returns to the fray with a new title, the ideal sequel to Deadly Dozen and Deadly Dozen Pacific Theater. It is therefore now certain that the dot of this software house is the ~tactical shooter~, a genre which in this precise case lends itself very easily to the transposition into videogames of an event such as that of the war in Vietnam. The Stealth FPS genre has been enjoying great success among the general public for some years. Despite being a rather nerve-wracking and somewhat demanding type of game, it has not failed to attract hundreds of thousands of followers. We are talking about First Person Shooters set mostly in war scenarios where the fundamental prerogative of each action is to hide very well and strike effectively (and which scenario is more suitable than Vietnam, with its rain forests dense with lianas and gnarled trees). We can count numerous titles, proud exponents of the genre, which have dominated the shelves of the most popular video game stores for years. In an explosive mixture of first-person action, strategy and tension we have encountered titles such as Hidden & Dangerous, Medal of Honor, Battlefield along our way. All these titles are linked together by the common theme of war and the simulation of everything that surrounds the war landscape. From the same vein comes a parallel genre, which devotes more space to mission strategy and accurate planning of attack plans; just to name one (or rather an entire, very lucky saga) I would bear the name of Rainbow Six (inspired by the homonymous series of novels signed by Tom Clancy), an extremely tactical SWAT-like FPS in which the player controls the most famous anti-terrorist team of the planet (a pity that it exists only in the author's imagination); but that's another story.", "date": "2003-06-20", "grade": null}
