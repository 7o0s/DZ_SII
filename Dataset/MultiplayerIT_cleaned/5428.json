It matters little if the gameplay isn't perfect, when fans can bask in a riot of quotes and references. JoJo's Bizarre Adventure received the same treatment a couple of years ago, when Hirohiko Araki's long-running generational series ended up on everyone's lips thanks to the new television transposition: We liked All-Star Battle with reservations, and for how difficult it was to translate the absurd super powers of the manga into a video game, the title signed CyberConnect2 had shown potential that some filing could have expressed in a possible sequel. Strangely, however, the Japanese developer has opted for an almost completely different strategy, transforming the game into a brawler that is reminiscent of Spike Chunsoft's recent J-Stars Victory VS on several occasions. How will it end? Eyes of Heaven transforms the absurd universe of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure into a brawler Playstation 4 trophies To unlock the 46 Eyes of Heaven trophies you must complete the story mode, fulfilling the requirements of the secondary objectives called JoJoliti and beating each main or secondary battle. Not only that: it is also necessary to perform specific actions during the clashes that mimic the situations that occurred in the original series, as well as empty the shop of each collectible. The watchword is FABULOUS! What CyberConnect2 did, in essence, was to recycle a good 90% of the assets of All-Star Battle, changing the gameplay structure and drawing a dozen more wrestlers in the over one hundred volumes that make up the long-lived The Bizarre Adventures saga by JoJo (JoJo no Kimy na Bken at home). It might seem like child's play, but in reality the developer's effort was not exactly minimal: the idea behind this renewal was in fact to better adapt the spirit and philosophy of Araki's work to the possibilities offered by a fighting game. Anyone who has read at least one volume of the manga or seen an episode of the cartoon will know that the protagonists rarely solve problems with fists; usually the beating of the villain occurs at the end of a clash of brains in which the strategy and the alternative use of super powers involve the reader / spectator leaving him truly speechless. JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is the only manga to make a simple Chinese paper challenge addictive, so to speak, but let's not digress. So CyberConnect2 has decided to abandon the ~two-dimensional~ structure of All-Star Battle to embrace that of free-motion brawlers, so as to also integrate the geometry and characteristics of the various arenas into the gameplay. The latter obviously represent some of the most famous scenarios of the series: there are the alleys of Morio Cho, the penitentiary of Green Dolphin Street, the Naples station and the Joestar house on fire, to name just a few. Each map is full of ~gimmicks~ and points of interaction, including boxes that contain objects, light poles that you can uproot and throw at enemies, chasms in which to fall between the buildings of Cairo, and so on. All-Star Battle's ~danger zones~ make a comeback, inspiring players to ensnare their opponents using positional strategies, or simply get ahead of them for a restorative coffee at the corner caf. In fact, the characters can explore the battlefields at will, jumping and climbing freely while exchanging blows with their opponents: in Eyes of Heaven, in fact, the clashes take place between teams made up of two characters each. The idea is nice, but it stumbles over the multiplayer component since up to four can play online at the same time, but it is not possible to face a friend physically sitting next to us because the CyberConnect2 title does not offer any type of offline or local co-op . To be honest, in terms of game modes Eyes of Heaven leaves something to be desired: in addition to the story mode which we will talk about in a bit, it is only possible to play online or face a mediocre CPU in two-on-two battles. The fact that there is no training mode is not a small problem, since the combat system devised by CyberConnect2 is not exactly among the most accessible. Actually, the controls are quite simple: with one key you jump, with one you dodge, with gthe other two he attacks and by combining the backbones with the other buttons the special techniques of the wrestler on duty are used. The complexity of the gameplay lies entirely in the powers of the characters who, at times, recall the skills of an RPG rather than the special shots of a fighting game. Let's take the legendary Rohan Kishibe for example: his attacks do little damage and he's also quite slow, but his Heaven's Door stand power allows him to literally disable an opponent's attacks for a limited amount of time. The same power can be used on the interaction points of the map, for example the chests that players can collect: touching a chest branded by Rohan, one suffers the paralyzing effect of its stand. Father Pucci, on the other hand, can generate a force field that constantly repels enemies that approach him, while Fugo Pannacotta is able to poison them, periodically reducing their energy. Between anomalous states, modifiers and absurd power-ups, the Eyes of Heaven combat system is reminiscent of the battles fought by the characters in the original series, and this is certainly the strong point of the game. Yare yare daze! Eyes of Heaven has fifty-two characters: in fact, some characters highly requested by fans such as Rudol von Stroheim, Yukako Yamagishi, Trish Una and Weather Report are added to the All-Star Battle roster. With such a roster it is difficult to expect a reasoned balance, also because the powers make each wrestler unique in his own way, perhaps more devoted to support than direct attack. Despite this, once you go into battle without a shred of tutorials to explain the basic mechanics, absolute confusion immediately sets in. Between gigantic onomatopoeias, special effects, ink splashes and cartoons that open and close intermittently, the clashes of Eyes of Heaven immediately plunge into chaos: after a few hours of play you get carried away and begin to understand how to exploit tactically the internships and abilities of the selected characters, but in reality we realize that it is a fairly superficial entertainment, in which it is difficult to coordinate moves and combos by virtue of a visual spectacularity that deeply limits any claim to technicality. The problem is also exacerbated by a lumbering and not too responsive control system, especially when going down - and getting back up too slowly, just like in All-Star Battle - or employing any counterattacks like the stone shield of Josuke Higashikata, useful more as a checkpoint for an instant shot than as an easily circumventable instant barrier. However, CyberConnect2 has spiced up the gameplay with cancels, aerial combos and combined attacks, the latter in the form of coordinated combos or real cinematic super moves which, if specific characters have been chosen, give life to fun fanservice scenes. However, there is no shortage of variety, and the Japanese developer deserves a little applause for having tried to translate the characteristics of certain characters to the detriment of their actual usefulness: the general impression is that the gameplay has been designed for a highly cooperative scenario or to satisfy the palate of the most demanding fans at the expense of its practicality. The blind N'doul, for example, must be periodically repositioned on the battlefield because the character in and of itself is too slow and practically useless: we can control his very strong Geb aquatic stand from a distance, hoping that our opponents do not spot the its owner and interrupt our actions, which of course gives the CPU a distinct advantage over human players. Better to have someone like Joshu as a partner, capable of diverting the attention of enemies to himself. For some reason, however, the debilitating powers almost never have an effect on opponents controlled by artificial intelligence, and when they do, you find yourself fighting real dummies. Considering that the gist of the game is all about the story mode, it's not hard to imagine how frustrating some situations can be. The Bizarre Adventure of Speedwagon As we have said, Eyes of Heaven offers very few game modes, in addition to the virtual shop in which to spend the points earned in combat to unlock a ton of extras and collectibles such as alternative costumes and colors, victory poses, additional animations and so on. The story mode, however, turned out to be quite a surprise, especially when compared to that joke played in All-Star Battle. The very first minutes give a completely wrong idea, as they re-propose the final showdown between Jotaro Kujo and DioBrando in Egypt: told through the original color comic plates and cinematics that use the game engine - the skimpy texts of the previous fighting game are a distant memory - and the Japanese dubbing with Italian subtitles, the finale of the third series Stardust Crusaders it turns upside down in a twist when Jotaro, Joseph and Jean Pierre find themselves facing the revived and strangely hostile Avdol, Kakyoin and Iggy. Something or someone maneuvers the friends they buried only a few hours earlier: the Robert E. O. Speedwagon from the first series, Phantom Blood, takes care of explaining the catch: ours is traveling through time in search of the pieces of the relic that appeared in Steel Ball Run to oppose the Supreme, a shady figure willing to change history in order to put the sacred mummy back together and conquer divine power. The narrative device only serves to stage a whole series of temporal paradoxes and ~what if~ battles in which the JoJos and their allies and adversaries from different eras beat each other out for good. Although absolutely transversal, the story told in Eyes of Heaven is very pleasant and full of quotes and small touches of class such as the sequences in which you can explore the maps like an RPG or the poker games against D'Arby . The various characters also level up with each encounter and earn skill points to spend to customize their initially limited moveset and expand their offensive and defensive capabilities, allowing you to build them more or less at will. It is clear that who knows what visual prodigies should not be expected from this Story mode: those who think they are faced with the superlative animations of the latest Ultimate Ninja Storm signed CyberConnect2 will be burned as Eyes of Heaven was born mainly as a PlayStation 3 title, even if in the West only the next-gen counterpart has arrived which, in reality, has very little next. Nonetheless, fans of JoJo will find the style and exaggerated poses that made the series popular, as well as a Japanese-language voice acting that does justice to the eccentric personalities portrayed on screen.", "date": "2016-07-06", "grade": "6.9"}
