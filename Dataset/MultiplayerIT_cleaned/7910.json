Even with some design flaws also found on the occasion of our review, the game was appreciated in its entirety, offering a fun experience. In fact, we found ourselves facing a main campaign in which there were real cities of the twentieth century, with their public transport needs constantly evolving over the years. Considering the following obtained by the game, it was easy to imagine the creation of Cities in Motion 2 already two years ago, for which the development team based in Finland has shown that it also cares about the feedback of its fans, focusing precisely on improving the aspects criticized in the first chapter. However, the work carried out was not limited to a single tuning work, but also brings with it some innovations that are worth analyzing after installing this Cities in Motion 2 on your PC. Wake up and coffee, beard and bidet Among the new elements introduced by Colossal Order in Cities in Motion 2 we find the implementation of the alternation between day and night within the life of the city, with a consequent impact on the habits of the citizens who populate it. A new section of the transport lines management menu makes it possible to decide the frequency of trips based on the days and hours, allowing for example to concentrate the number of buses that take people to work in the morning, or that take them back to home in the afternoon. In the same way, on the weekend it is instead possible to reduce the passage of vehicles in the absence of citizens traveling to the office or factory. A useful feature to balance your efforts, but which naturally has an impact on the way our company's customers will relate to us: never angering a commuter going to work is the main rule, ring Trenord for information. But the developers' additions don't stop there: compared to the cities seen in the first episode, Colossal Order has in fact implemented a system of dynamic evolution for the urban agglomerations, in which it will be possible to find a different expansion of the population depending on the transport network that it is going to be created, with the birth of new neighborhoods and consequent habits on the part of citizens also thanks to the possibility that we are granted to create roads. The downside is the loss of the ~historical~ context in Cities in Motion 2, which unlike its predecessor cannot count on the presence of real cities within the campaign mode: an almost obligatory choice to give life to what we have just described, but which perhaps ends up taking away a bit of the charm of the countryside. Even the setting abandons the past decades, to place itself directly in the present day, taking advantage of the maps designed from scratch by the developers, for which in reality the guys from Colossal Order have revealed that they were inspired by real cities. The last of the main innovations introduced in the game mechanics sees a new management of ticket prices, for which it becomes possible to define colored zones, thus making those intending to make a journey that extends from one part of the city, optimizing the way the company recovers its expenses. As regards the means available, the categories see the classic bus accompanied by trolleybuses, trams, metro and marine buses, each of which is characterized by the presence of a series of types with different peculiarities, able for example to guarantee a better travel time with limited capacity. The remaining components of Cities in Motion 2 remain almost identical to the first chapter: however, a tutorial is available (perhaps a little less intuitive than in the past) to start building your own transport lines and learn the basic concepts for keep an eye on the level of satisfaction of its customers. Is Unity cool? The sandbox mode of Cities in Motion 2 looks like the traditional free games, in which you can freely indulge in the construction of new transport lines. For obvious reasons, the addition of the multiplayer mode is more interesting, with which Colossal Order has tried to give the game that social component that was previously missing: through the Steam servers you will have toit became possible to organize online matches, both cooperative and competitive, between teams composed of a different number of players, who challenge each other to achieve the goal set by the one who started the game. The conditional in this case is a must, not having had the opportunity to fully test the multiplayer component due to the low frequency on the servers and what were some bugs in the matchmaking solved only in the last few days by Colossal Order. The hope is that after completing the campaign, people decide to jump into online play to increase the longevity of this title. From a technical point of view, Cities in Motion 2 saw the developers make the important decision to replace the proprietary engine of the first chapter with the Unity Engine 3, used according to them to implement the dynamic management of the cities we have already talked about , along with the ability to offer more ~consistent~ game maps than in the past. However, those who are not satisfied with these maps are offered the possibility of creating new ones directly through the game editor, possibly sharing them with others for multiplayer mode. Returning to the graphic aspect, the game menus are quite essential, while the engine change does not change the excellent zoom level also found on the occasion of the first Cities in Motion. The sound is composed of some music, which in the long run we imagine can easily be replaced by some MP3 present in the player's PC.", "date": "2013-04-08", "grade": "8.0"}
