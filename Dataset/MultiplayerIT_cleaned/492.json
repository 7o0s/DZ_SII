{"name": "Chicory: A Colorful Tale", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/chicory-a-colorful-tale-recensione.html", "text": "Arrives today, June 10, 2021, Chicory: A Colorful Tale, new game by Greg Lobanov, who rose to prominence in the world of indie video games a couple of years ago thanks to Wandersong, a wonderful singing-based puzzle platform adventure. Now Lobanov, with the support of a small team, offers us a new journey, this time based on colors (as you already guessed from the name of the game). Were we impressed by Lobanov's game again this time? Find out in our review of Chicory: A Colorful Tale. A great picnic Chicory A Colorful Tale: The World is Your Canvas Chicory: A Colorful Tale immerses us in the world of Picnic, a kingdom populated by anthropomorphic animals. In this world there is a great instrument of power, the Brush, through which it is possible to give color to everything, alive or inanimate. The Brush passes from hand to hand, from Pittor to Pittor, who is in charge of maintaining order. This task now falls to Chicoria (Chicory). However, our adventure begins when everything falls apart. Suddenly the world goes black and white and it's up to us to find out why and stop this menace. But who are we? Chicoria the Painter, holder of the Brush? Absolutely not. Like Wandersong, Lobanov overturns the classic structure and gives the role of the protagonist to a character who should be completely secondary: l sguatter di Cicoria (Pizza, this is the name we chose), an ordinary tip who only deals with cleaning and tidy up the Torre della Pittrice. Pizza (which as you may have guessed can be male, female or non-binary at our choice), similarly to the protagonist of Wandersong, shouldn't be the hero, shouldn't be anyone. Still like the protagonist of Wandersong, however, he does just what he should: he takes matters into his own hands. Pizza is there Pittric Pizza is childish, nave, certainly not the smartest in the room and absolutely not gifted in pictorial art, but that doesn't stop her. When she realizes that the colors are gone and finds the Brush abandoned in the Tower of the Chicory Painter, Pizza doesn't hesitate to grab it and set off on an adventure to recolor the world. Soon, however, he realizes that something dark is corrupting reality and must therefore ask Cicoria for help. The Painter, however, doesn't want to know anything more about the Brush, about art, about the whole world. At that moment it becomes clear what the main theme of the adventure is: the fight against depression, insecurity, the fear of failure, but also the fear of being judged, looked at, of disregarding the expectations of everyone around us. Lobanov, once again, outlines a sweet and seemingly simple story which however hides a very important message inside. Pizza e Cicoria is a journey dedicated to understanding oneself, one's own limits and those of others. Without spoilers, we can say that it teaches us to ask for help, not to expect too much of ourselves and to really understand what's good for us. It does so by creating a world filled with magnificent characters, small anthropomorphic animals with culinary names (Cuscus, Gooseberry, Basil, Macaron, Paprika, Pandisegale...) who will ask for our help as we explore every corner of Picnic. Each character has its own language (and often its own font and cartoon) which makes it unique: in this sense, applause to the Italian translation, of very high quality also considering the need to opt sometimes for slang terminologies that cannot simply be translated 1:1. Chicory A Colorful Tale will take us to various areas In support of the writing there is also the artistic direction. Every character and environment is beautifully drawn, but it's up to us to color it. It doesn't take a big brush In fact, color is not only a plot element, but it is the core of the gameplay. In Chicory A Colorful Tale we will have to use the Brush to explore and solve small tasks. The game is part of a platform and puzzle game structure. The world reacts to colors in various ways: for example, there are plants that grow only if they are black and white, while there are mushrooms that allow us to jump only if they are coloured; in each area we will have to find the right path to the exit, passing from screen to screen. During the adventure, new elements are gradually proposed that enrich the gameplay and make it more varied. Furthermore, it is possible to play cooperatively, so as to have a second person with a second brush, which helps us to color. You jump and color often in Chicory A Colorful Tale There is also a series of boss fight action which, in addition to being intriguing in terms of design (the gameplay itself becomes a narrativesometimes, we can't say more without making huge spoilers) allow you to change the pace of the adventure a bit. Furthermore, with each victory, our bond with the Brush improves, we will obtain new abilities to explore the environments. We will be able to jump, swim in paint and much more. Chicory is basically a metroidvania: the new abilities allow you to unlock shortcuts and reach previously unreachable places. Overall, however, the adventure is quite linear, so don't expect a Hollow Knight map (to use an illustrious example). The return to old areas is mostly linked to the desire to find all the collectibles, ranging from clothes to customize Pizza, up to lost cats and garbage that we can respectively exchange for furniture and plants, or useful elements for furnishing the game environments in total freedom. Personalization is a big part of Chicory A Colorful Tale. It'll be needed to complete some side events (like creating the perfect beach party, for example), but it's also important to what the feel of most of the game is. Lobanov's work prompts us to approach each area calmly, without haste. It being understood that every gamer approaches his passion in the way he prefers, we would like to advise you to immerse yourself in the adventures of Pizza with the aim of taking your time and not finishing the game and then moving on to the next one as quickly as possible. In nine hours we have reached the end of the adventure, with a completion percentage of 79%, but we hope that many players will spend even more time in the game, taking a few minutes from screen to screen to leave their touch by recoloring the environments or taking care of recreate the works of art lost when the world returned to black and white. Chicory is not only a game to win, but it is also a huge sketchbook and a yoga class, all in one go. Don't worry if you're not born artists like us, we have a unique touch, we know it The soundtrack, created by Celeste's composer, also invites you to take your time. Each play area is perfectly characterized from a musical point of view and it is beautiful just to stay there, listening. We also close by pointing out that the game offers various customization options, such as the possibility of eliminating the clack-clack sounds of the painting (which can be annoying to some people), remove the dazzling effects (for those suffering from epilepsy), change the font of the written to help those with vision or reading problems, to be notified of the presence of sensitive topics, but also to act on the gameplay by increasing or decreasing the lives of the character during the boss fights (still quite permissive even in the basic format) and even decreasing the speed of reaction required for the clashes. In other words, Chicory A Colorful Tale strives to be as inclusive as possible, and we can't say enough about the choice.", "date": "2021-06-11", "grade": "9.5"}
