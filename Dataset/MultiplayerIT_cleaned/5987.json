The ideas expressed in recent years have allowed him to become a highly appreciated designer in independent development circles and to gather much acclaim among those players who are still very fond of the traditional video game concept, shaped on skills such as skill and patience. It should not be forgotten that we are talking about a young author, who could still have many ideas in store to feed his reference niche. Of course, compared to the beginning - which took place with the publication of Flash titles on the Newgrounds portal - many things have changed, the independent market has grown both in size and in interest in the eyes of the most attentive public, but the substance is always the same: to appreciate these masterpieces you need to have the right spirit. In fact, we owe McMillen to indie products that have enjoyed such success as Spelunky, The Binding of Isaac and, coming to what interests us most in this piece, Super Meat Boy. After the beginnings as a Flash game with the name Meat Boy, the Super edition was launched for the first time on the market exactly five years ago, in October 2010, first on Xbox Live Arcade and a few weeks later also on PC. Following the cancellation of an edition intended for Nintendo's WiiWare platform, the title then also landed on Mac and Linux systems between 2011 and 2013. The last piece of our history leads us to current events, since Super Meat Boy is now also available for download on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita and, throughout the month of October, it can be downloaded free of charge by users who subscribe to the Instant Gaming Collection of PlayStation Plus. Super Meat Boy is punishing but, once mastered, it gives a lot of satisfaction Playstation 4 trophies Could Super Meat Boy's trophies be within the reach of the common man? Of course not, as it happens we have in our hands a title that only a select few (or a few madmen) will be able to platinum. The most complex tasks are undoubtedly those that require you to complete entire areas, both in the dark world and in the world of light, without ever dying once. We're not sure if you really want to try... but if in doubt, let's get a psychiatrist! AAA skill wanted The premises from which the crazy and frenetic experience of Super Meat Boy springs are those that one might expect from any self-respecting ~old school~ platformer. The player plays the role of little Meat Boy, a stubborn and very fast cube of meat intent on rescuing his beloved Bandage Girl from the clutches of the evil and unlikely Dr. Fetus. To succeed in his suicide mission he will have to cross five game worlds, made up of a myriad of very small levels full of lethal obstacles, traps that do not admit any mistake, steep walls and fierce end-of-level bosses. The structure of watertight compartments of each single stage makes the presence of checkpoints in the maps superfluous, consequently it is essential to get from point A to point B without making mistakes, so as to be able to take a further step towards the boss which completes every single area. While the light levels are those that can be experienced immediately and are visible, there are also dark levels, unlockable only in specific points of the maps and characteristic due to the presence of some extra characters who will later be unlocked and selectable even during the main experience. The replay mode also makes its return, which is activated automatically at the end of each completed level and with which it is possible to enjoy in a single solution the myriad of attempts that were necessary to get the better of every adversity. Moreover, it could be said that Super Meat Boy is a tough but fair game, in the sense that the progression to which one is subjected is in any case quite gradual and only translates into obvious difficulties in the second half of the experience. Nonetheless, you need stubbornness, you need to be able to get passionate and take the ~trial and error~ mechanism with the right philosophy, which is also one of the flagships of the work. Learning is very intuitive, in a short time you can grasp the nuances and the best tactics to bring home the skin and at that point it becomes solely and exclusively a question of skill. Furthermore, the control system seemed efficient on both reference platforms, performing its duty very well on PlayStation 4 but defending itself quite well alsoin the portable field. Beyond the information regarding the gameplay, the main difference between the previous versions concerns the soundtrack. The original music had in fact been signed by Danny Baranowski, an author who in recent years has collaborated on several leading indie projects, including The Binding of Isaac himself, Crypt of the NecroDancer and Canabalt. As Team Meat co-founder Tommy Refenes explained, those same tracks could not be included in this conversion due to copyright issues. After acknowledging the situation, McMillen and his companions had to make a virtue of necessity and made use of the collaboration of some leading personalities of the independent scene, who would have given guarantees of quality and competence precisely by virtue of their consolidated background in the field. First of all Matthias Boss and Jon Evans, also known as the duo Ridiculon and in turn already engaged in the past on other highly appreciated productions, including The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth. They were given the level tracks The Forest, Hell, The Rapture and The End, as well as the introductory theme featured in the title screen and the background of the cutscenes. David Scatliffe, known in particular for the pressing soundtrack of Hotline Miami, has instead contributed to the levels that are part of The Hospital and Salt Factory; finally the music of The Cotton Alley was edited by Laura Shigihara, the same author who worked on the soundtrack of the first Plants Vs. Zombies. The decision to resort to a roster of artists with experience and talent has made it possible to maintain the quality level of the sound sector in line with the excellent levels of the original score, while the presence of several heads has benefited the variations in tonality and style that accompany each area.", "date": "2015-10-09", "grade": "9.0"}
