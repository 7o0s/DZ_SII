Beyond the event in its entirety and the coveted delivery of the final code, the most significant moment occurred during the interview granted to us by Nolan North, an actor who has given his voice to Nathan Drake since the first chapter. Specifically, when asked about his state of mind after having played the protagonist of Uncharted for the last time, he replied that ~All the good things must come to an end~, that is, that all good things must end, in a sort of inception with Nathan Drake himself who aroused many emotions in us. Better to stop at the top than develop Uncharted 7: Nathan Drake on the Moon, a joke that however hides an important reflection: some brands suffer more than others in proposing new exponents for years if not decades, and you need to have the courage to go further and jump on new ideas, instead of squeezing the product until there is a decent profit. In relation to the Uncharted series it is said that this does not happen in the form of spin-offs, prequels or games inserted into the narrative path already traced, but it is clear that for Naughty Dog Uncharted 4: A Thief's End represents the conclusion of the saga, and we are ready to share our deepest impressions with you. We have completed our journey with Uncharted 4: A Thief's End, here is our review The journey begins Almost nine years have passed since the first Uncharted, worth three chapters and a collection in a revised and corrected version. In all likelihood, therefore, you have somehow had to deal with Nathan Drake and his adventures, also because even if Uncharted 4: A Thief's End can be enjoyed easily by those who have never touched a chapter of the saga, it reaches its sublimation when one is already aware of the narrative traits of its main protagonists. Starting from Nathan himself up to Victor Sullivan, Elena Fisher and the supporting actors of a videogame series repeatedly compared to Indiana Jones for that light-hearted, adventurous and fun tone that immediately became a trademark. A Thief's End covers a rather long narrative arc, delving into the relationship between Nate and his brother Sam, the first steps as rogue explorers, the immediate and distant future; taking due breaks from the action and going through exploration, puzzles, dialogues. A Nathan intending to hang up his diary, until the (re)appearance of his brother and the will to follow the paths of Henry Avery change the cards on the table: it is said that the famous pirate had founded a secret city together with other ~colleagues~, hiding priceless loot. We stop here, to avoid spoilers, but we can tell you that in Uncharted 4: A Thief's End each aspect mentioned above has been treated with extreme dedication - without leaving narrative holes or treating important passages superficially - at the cost of appearing a bit ~slow~ in the first few chapters. In any case, this beginning is supported by a nothing short of masterful acting, airy platform/exploration sections and some fisticuffs, up to a rather full-bodied first fight at night, between jumping walls, explosions and an exceptional use of lights to make it spectacular. Hence the departure around the world, not only through Madagascar and the Amalfi Coast - the settings that have been officially revealed by Naughty Dog - but also in others naturalistically different from each other and truly capable of giving that sense of adventure and trip has always been the flagship of the series. If we want even more pronounced thanks to the greater amount of content than in the past, and to an incredible technical sector on which we will return later in the article. If Uncharted 3 has been pointed out as being too unbalanced on the part of the fights, often staged in static sections with a constant flow of enemies, this is not the case of the fourth chapter, which denotes a certain attention on the part of the developer in ensuring greater variety of situations , avoid the preponderance of one component over the other and thus restore greater dynamism to the foundations that make up the production: exploration, puzzles and combat. In the first case we have two important introductions into the game economy, namely the rope and a nailfrom rock necessary to hook the porous walls. Additions clearly inspired by other exponents of the genre - see Tomb Raider - but here used as mentioned in a more dynamic way. The use of the first, in fact, has made exploration more developed, allowing you to descend cliffs located at a considerable height, attack in flight or reach opposite ends in a spectacular way. Thanks to an even more refined control system in the basics and a difficulty that is never too high as per the tradition of the series, the result is absolutely pleasant, with the exciting moments derived from the concatenation of different platform phases, together with events such as collapses and explosions. The exploration phase sees the return of puzzles linked to Nathan's notes and logical sequences that are never too difficult, but fully in line with the spirit of the game and the best cinematic productions of the genre; for example, it is necessary to study the setting in order not to fall down on some platforms, to correctly position paintings before opening a door and to avoid having the hand cut off, to take pictures with the protagonist's mobile phone to associate faces with the names of the pirates, solving the riddle proposed. In an attempt to put together the pieces of a larger puzzle and gradually discover the story linked to Avery and the other pirates, up to the location of their fortunes. A constant progression that is reflected, if you will, also in the fighting part: the foundations of Uncharted 4: A Thief's End are those to which we are now accustomed, but except in rare cases, the clashes develop in decidedly more articulated maps than in the past , with an unprecedented verticality for the series and, more often than not, continuing forward or up, instead of remaining static as in the previous chapters. The rope becomes a tool to attack from above or move between the banks, the enemies often appear from several sides and do not spare the use of grenades or movement to get closer to one's position; consequently remaining fixed in a given point means certain death especially at the higher difficulty levels, also due to the presence of cover that can often be destroyed by enemy blows. The artificial intelligence remains rather standard, but as mentioned the verticality of the scenario, the large number of enemies and the location on several points manages to mitigate this sensation, together with the introduction of further stealth mechanics. Often and willingly, in fact, you arrive at points where you are not immediately identified, and it is possible to clean up the area by stealthily killing enemies, camouflaging in plants, bypassing them by climbing the walls, hitting them when their view is directed elsewhere. In this regard, by zooming the view with L2, and then with L3, it is possible to ~mark~ them with a triangle in a very similar way to the various Far Cry and Metal Gear Solid V. They will not be seen through walls, but the triangle above becomes useful to understand the general location and try to get the better of it without engaging in a direct firefight. Which is always possible although fun to deal with, either for the variety returned by the level design, or for a greater physicality of shots and weapons. Equally once identified it is possible to try to lose track of one's tracks, moving away from the last known position: the result is valid because it is not a mechanic on which the game is based to the point of representing cross and delight (Assassin's Creed, we are talking about you!), but rather fits perfectly into a variety that leads to try numerous solutions during the course of the adventure, always available to the player. In this scenario, the Challenge level can calibrate the gameplay based on one's aptitudes with the genre: from Explorer to Devastating - available immediately - which scale according to different parameters capable of adapting to all needs. Any examples? As you level up, the accuracy and frequency of enemy grenades increase, snipers kill with one shot, opponents wait less time before going around you, automatic save points are more sparse; Devastation prevents the ability to activate the enemy marking and the sighting indicator. Playstation 4 trophies Uncharted 4: End of a thief offers 34 trophies, many of which are similar to those of the previous chapters. We have the completion of various difficulty levels, the recovery of all treasures, notes and documents, killing 50 enemies with headshots and so on. The most interesting and difficult are the one called Speedrun, which requires the game to be completed within six hours, and the Sniper one, which always requires awith accuracy of shots equal to at least 70% of those fired. Good luck. The journey ends The greater care taken by Naughty Dog, but also the increased computing power compared to PlayStation 3, has allowed the Californian developer to implement much larger maps and settings than in the past. That of Madagascar, for example, can be freely explored by Jeep with several outposts that perhaps hide a treasure or a clue to continue. In between, streams, different roads to reach the same point, winding ups and downs that require the Jeep's winch to be overcome: imagine the consequences on the most extreme slopes. In Metal Gear Solid V, for comparison, the game started in a striking way and then ~opened up~ and remained anonymous in relation to the first component for several hours. In Uncharted 4 all this does not happen: the alternation between spectacular and channeled sections with wider ones (not only Madagascar!) is expertly orchestrated in a plot decided at the table by the developers, in which the (few) multiple choices are a simple habit to quibble or answer in one way rather than another, without altering anything of the main plot. What is surprising is the extreme attention paid to every smallest detail, synonymous with the fact that the extra time spent on development is undoubtedly useful. Here too we go for examples of things already known: the tracks of the jeep on the muddy asphalt that remain and make the best Motorstorm pale, Nathan Drake's different ways of getting into the jeep according to his position when pressing the triangle, the use of a simple case (almost) never the same as the one done previously... the production value of the Naughty Dog title is far superior to the vast majority of video games in circulation. Satisfying freedom and variety which are then slapped in the face in the most engaging moments and inevitably guided, but which equally represent a strength: playing the Jeep chase sequence shown several times live is exhilarating, also because one is constantly surprised by how the developers have managed to insert if we want pre-calculated sequences in a context completely in the hands of the player, a whirlwind of emotions and events that is simply indescribable and absolutely to be experienced. Similar moments also occur in other situations, which make Uncharted 4 like a long interactive film that has all the ingredients to decree its success: introspection and dialogues, passing through moments of calm and exploration up to firefights, not forgetting environmental destruction and visual twists. With this last word we connect to the technological sector of the title, starting from a simple adjective: incredible. Naughty Dog has once again managed to raise the bar on consoles, in some respects ever, with a graphically exceptional title, in which all the elements contribute to having a memorable impact. Starting with the rendering of the soft, clean and colorful image, capable of rivaling, for example, that of The Order but within decidedly more extensive scenarios. Then the attention to detail, the elements that make up the background, the quality lighting system and the extremely different colors depending on the setting, but also interiors and exteriors detailed beyond measure, together with thick textures and an artistic level that adds that brushstroke of aesthetic pleasure capable of giving glimpses of the most beautiful ever seen in a video game. All good things go hand in hand with even more refined and varied animations, together with a skilful use of camera, photography and photographic techniques such as depth of field, specific blur on objects and always perfect shots to enhance the scenario that arises before to Nathan Drake. We used the DualShock button to take snapshots, repeatedly called the photographic mode to manage the camera and apply some filters: Uncharted 4: A Thief's End is a feast for the eyes precisely because all the highlighted qualities contribute to generating a graphic impact devastating. Wanting to make a purely technical analysis, some small critical annotations are due, starting from 30 frames per second (the trilogy on PlayStation 4 had accustomed us to double) and a perceptible motion blur when the camera is rotated quickly. The frame rate remains stable the vast majority of the time, but after a few explosions or under a waterfall - apparently a sort of Achilles heel of videogame development - we saw perceptible drops in fluidity.", "date": "2016-05-05", "grade": "9.7"}
