But the Spanish team's hard work doesn't stop there: in fact, someone will remember, before the advent of Brian and Gina on our screens, the release of Hollywood Monsters, another graphic adventure with the same unmistakable style, a sort of factory of the Iberian boys. Having concluded the Runaway cycle, Pendulo Studios has thus decided to go back to its origins, giving life to Hollywood Monsters 2, even if in this regard a clarification is necessary: the new game is more a spiritual sequel than a real sequel, since although largely inspired by its predecessor, it changes its elements and protagonists to the point of having arrived in other countries under the name The Next Big Thing. More monsters for everyone Hollywood Monsters 2 sees the couple made up of entertainment journalist Liz Allaire and her colleague Dan Murray, a sports reporter reluctantly relegated by the newspaper to Liz's area of expertise, at the center of its story. The two initially seem to barely stand each other, starting to bicker from the very early stages of the game, when our heroes are called to participate in a party organized by the film production company MKO Pictures, known for employing the most disparate monsters as actors (in true sense of the word) present on the face of the Earth. During the party, Liz discovers that something shady is afoot, but ends up mysteriously disappearing forcing Dan to embark on a desperate search for his colleague. The care placed by Pendulo on the creation of the characters is evident: the cynical dude Dan holds his role perfectly, resulting as caustic as it is funny at the right point in his comments, while Liz's character is simply all to be discovered, making the reporter what it's probably the best characterization element of the game. As you may have guessed, the duo is joined by a series of monsters, also conceived by Pendulo in a most often successful way: above all probably the Poet of Pain, a big man who finds inspiration to compose his own poems only by hurting himself and that elicits more than a single laugh during the adventure. Point and click The game mechanics of Hollywood Monsters 2 adhere perfectly to the classic canon of graphic adventures, providing the player with an inventory, a series of dialogues and a screen with which to interact to move forward: nothing new under the sun then. As far as the difficulty of the game is concerned, the developers have well thought of inserting a hint system: they range from the easy level with all the active aids to the difficult one, in which instead we can only count on ourselves. It would probably have been appropriate to give the possibility of activating the aids when necessary during the course of the game, above all in light of the fact that some puzzles go beyond the limit of irrationality: this is perhaps the main flaw of Pendulo Studios' effort, in capable of blocking (with consequent frustration) even the most savvy graphic adventure player, with a series of steps to be performed that no one would think of but which above all, once completed, do not give the right gratification. Someone will say that to overcome this problem, especially in the age of the Internet, there is the possibility of resorting to solutions. True, but still undoubtedly stuff to make those who grew up on bread and Monkey Island turn up their noses. For the rest, as we said, Hollywood Monsters 2 does not differ from the genre to which it belongs. Animated monsters The style of Hollywood Monsters 2 is, as previously mentioned, the cartoony one of Runaway, which has become a trademark of Pendulo Studios. Even compared to the previous adventures of the Spanish team, the game still takes decisive steps forward, resulting technically impeccable both in the care of every single detail present in the settings, and in the creation of the animations and expressions of the characters. Making a joke that comes easy, from this point of view we can really consider this title as The Next Big Thing. The same goes for the audio sector, fortunately composed of excellent voices also in the Italian dubbing and a soundtrack that fully does its duty. Speaking of dialogues, after talking to another character, returning to him can happen to findthe same options: greater control over the sentences already said would have been appreciable.", "date": "2011-07-18", "grade": "7.5"}
