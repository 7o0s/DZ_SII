Admittedly, such a product needed a very extensive and thorough testing phase before launch, hence the long wait; but the concept behind the experience has been able to keep the interest of MOBA enthusiasts high for all this time. In fact, we are not talking about a traditional multiplayer online battle arena, but a Paragon-style action variant, in which the control of the characters is direct and therefore does not follow the dynamics of the strategic ones in real time, as some of the best known do exponents of the genre. Secondly, the matches see three different factions on the field: two teams each made up of four human mercenaries and a third team which initially has two mutants, but which can be enriched with further members. How? When a human player is killed, he drags himself along the ground for a few moments before the respawn countdown: if a mutant manages to grab him in this moment and drag him into a contaminated area of the map, the mercenary will also transform into a mutant and his goals will suddenly change. In short, a fairly original formula, but how is this Kill Strain tested? Kill Strain is an immediate and fun action MOBA, but with some structural and content limitations Mutant apocalypse The introductory sequence briefly explains how we ended up in the situation we find in the game, with a deadly mutation that has invaded the planet and that some squads of soldiers are desperately trying to stem. However, it is only a gimmick compared to what is the in-game action, full of facets but also of gray areas as regards the balance and the conditions of victory and defeat, indeed rather curious. In fact, our objective during a match in Kill Strain is not to destroy the enemy base or the origin of the mutation (both factors that determine the end of the game, as well as the end of the twenty minute time limit), but simply to total the greater number of points, which are awarded according to the kills made, the elimination of the mutant ~plants~ (which practically replace the minions, but remain a static element of the scenario) and the completion of achievements that change cyclically. Considering the presence of the transformations and the possible sudden team change, it was an inevitable solution, but which in any case leaves a bitter taste in the mouth compared to what is the MOBA tradition, in which the fulcrum of the gameplay lies in team coordination to pursue a common goal, which is the destruction of enemy towers and base. Many users are complaining about this aspect of Kill Strain, so it is possible that the developers will introduce a standard mode in the future in which, perhaps, the mutants are controlled only by artificial intelligence. For now, however, the formula is this: the game ends when one team destroys the enemy base and/or the origin of the Strain, or when time runs out and/or the mutation covers most of the map, with the inevitable reversals of the front and the emphasis on group actions, but the final leaderboard is determined by the score of individual users. So close, so far Beyond the concept, which as mentioned includes some original elements compared to the classic MOBAs, the gameplay of Kill Strain in many ways takes up that of the excellent Alienation, given that all the mercenaries move and attack as in a twin stick shooter, moreover in the context of a three-quarter view from above which immediately reveals itself to be particularly suitable for this type of approach. Of course, things change when you control the mutants, equipped with exclusively melee attacks but substantially benefiting from the possibility of hiding in the infected areas of the map, of creating new ones and thus recharging their vital energy within moments, preparing for a new sortie. But let's go back to the mercenaries, who each have different weapons and unique skills. For example, we have Diesel, a sort of tank equipped with a devastating flamethrower, which can charge enemies with a powerful ~fiery~ shoulder, throw a pair of grenades and use an energy shield when opponents become insidious. Or Vincent, an armored soldier who uses a rather accurate and high-rate-of-fire laser rifle, who can carry out a ~radial~ attack to stun nearby enemies and quickly project himself into adirection to escape an ambush. Or Siphon, a mercenary that can be downloaded for free by PlayStation Plus subscribers, who uses a cryogenic gun and can trap opponents in a sort of electric cage to prevent them from escaping when they have little vital energy. In all cases, the progression system is that of MOBAs, with a level up that is obtained over time, with killings and by transporting certain objects from one area of the map to another. And if our character's abilities aren't enough to destroy an enemy tower or advance in the Strain, we can resort to the MEC, an armor that recharges over time and is projected directly onto our mercenary from the satellite, providing him with a devastating power for a few seconds. The roster currently has a total of ten mercenaries and three mutants, numbers decidedly distant from those of other MOBAs but which will be fleshed out in the coming months with many new entries. Free-to-play but not pay-to-win? The solutions adopted by San Diego Studios for the management of the free-to-play aspects of Kill Strain appear sensible and far from limiting. Firstly, the definitive purchase of the characters requires from 4000 to 6000 credits, a not very high figure if we consider that each match allows you to collect an average of 500 credits. However, it is possible to ~rent~ a mercenary or a mutant by paying about a tenth of this sum, so as to evaluate its characteristics before completely unlocking it; or cut the bull's head off and spend 29.99 euros for the Corporation Pack, which includes all present and future characters in the game. In any case, the packs of gold, the precious currency, are present on the PlayStation Store (with 200 pieces of gold you buy a character permanently): they start from 4.99 euros for a pack of 500 pieces and you get to 49 .99 euros for a pack of 7500 pieces. In short, it is possible to play completely free, simply collecting credits match after match, or put your wallet in order to quickly unlock the characters, but this does not imply an advantage over your opponents, at least until you use these credits for Augmentation and Masteries, upgrades that allow you to improve the skills of a mercenary or a mutant regardless of the leveling that takes place during a game. During our tests we did not come across situations in which this aspect was evident, but it is also true that these are still the first days and we will have to evaluate this in the coming weeks, when the game will also be free for non-PlayStation Plus subscribers and the audience will expand. Kill Strain should therefore be taken for what it is, an open construction site that will be updated over time and will lead to the introduction of new characters and, hopefully, new maps. In fact, the only currently available scenario did not seem irresistible in terms of design, given the possibility of easily bypassing the turrets that can be activated and reaching the enemy base quickly, even alone, possibly using the MEC to destroy towers and the central location . There is also an optimization work to be done for the graphics which, perhaps thanks to a less robust than expected netcode, often shows the side to evident drops in the frame rate. Finally, we have recorded frequent server malfunctions that force you to restart the application, as well as episodes of lag certainly due to the quality of the connection of some users. Strange that with all the tests conducted so far these flaws have not been resolved.", "date": "2016-07-18", "grade": "7.0"}
