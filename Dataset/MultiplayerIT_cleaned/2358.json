{"name": "F1 2001", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/f1-2001_a.html", "text": "I'll do the World Cup! The game includes numerous modes including the Quick Race which allows you to race directly on one of the seventeen circuits of the game or the championship mode which tests you over the entire F1 season: all the modes present are however the same seen in the editions past of the game, without any news worthy of note. Where F1 2001 differs from its predecessors is in the possibility to choose between different game options in multiplayer mode: in the split screen mode you can race against a friend and there is also a mode where during the race the last of each lap is automatically eliminated until the overall winner of the race remains and also the last survivor! As we wanted to demonstrate, the fundamental nucleus of F1 2001 is in the Grand Prix mode which is complete and full of innovative elements especially as regards the multiplayer game. The Grand Prix mode consists of five distinct modes including the one in which you can experience the excitement of a single weekend or the mode in which to win you will have to complete the season by dominating from the first to the last grand prix with first places. The Grand Prix mode is not selectable from the start: to unlock it you must first face and pass 25 tests similar to those for driving licenses in Gran Turismo. Among the tests there will also be those for driving on wet asphalt or tests with limited fuel supplies. The intention of inserting tests was not bad at all, but their execution does not give many positive profits. First of all, while they are a great exercise for anyone who is new to a driving game, all other players will be bored to complete all these exercises before starting to play for real. Furthermore, the game does not give a real indication of what you will have to do in the test and the signals on the track will create more confusion than help. The guidelines, speed indicators and map of the test area could have been done with more care to make the tests really worthwhile. After at least an hour spent completing the tests, you can finally switch to the Grand Prix mode. The tracks, the cars, the billboards, the trees and the grandstands that form the background to the tracks are so well done that everything seems to have been filmed by a camera as it happens in reality. The replays settle on the levels of detail of those seen in great titles such as MotoGP or Gran Turismo 3. However, the view and the scenes do not seem to scroll at 60 fps as in the two aforementioned titles. the sound of F1 2001 is a mix of impressive and futuristic effects. The sound effects of the cars, the roar of the engines which changes according to the engagement of gears and acceleration, the roar of the crowd, everything is mixed with great precision in order to recreate the acoustic environment that frames a truly great prize. Even the voice of the commentary as well as that of the radio in the car is well reproduced and is very clear in imparting the suggestions and directives coming from the Box department. In conclusion EA has thrilled and at the same time satisfied the group of gamers who have approached its F1 car series, and this F1 2001 is the confirmation of the desire of the house of FIFA to continue its commitment in the creation of driving games of excellent workmanship in this case for Sony's fantastic 128-bit console. In conclusion Pros: Very precise control Many game modes All the tracks and the drivers of the 2001 season Graphically spectacular Very rich audio package especially regarding the comments and the radio sector of the cars The presence of different elements that enhance the multiplayer game is appreciated Cons: Very boring it will be for the more experienced, complete the 25 tests to unlock the mode Few innovations compared to the previous chapters Let's start from 2001 Although the F1 world championship has already abundantly ended with the second consecutive victory by the Ferrari team on both the driver and constructor fronts, with F1 2001 each of you can rewrite the course of the history of this year's world championship to your liking: just insert the game on the trusty PS2, choose a car, put on the helmet and set off at full speed. In F1 2001 you will find all 17 circuits where the championship races take place as well as the 22 drivers of the eleven F1 teams, includingi the veteran Michael Shumacher and the young promise Juan Pablo Montoya.", "date": "2001-11-16", "grade": null}
