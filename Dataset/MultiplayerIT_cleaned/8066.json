There are those who create clones, those who make a fortune by offering them on platforms that are not officially supported, such as Survivalcraft on Windows Phone, and those who are inspired to create new games. This is the case of Ace of Spades, which tries to combine the mechanics of a shooter with those of the famous game signed Mojang. Experiment successful only to a limited extent, unfortunately, as the mechanics are still woody and full of bugs and, apart from five modes, nothing else is present. We can call it a pastime, if you want something to have fun, but if you are looking for a title where you can collect experience, level up and customize your alter ego... well then no, this is not for you. Instead, the idea of the Zombie mode, which we will discuss in more detail later, is appreciable. And what a blocky war it is! The game is inspired by Minecraft as regards the technical-visual component. The world is made entirely of blocks and has advanced physics. The bases and maps are pre-built, but you can freely modify them... it's a pity that often you don't have the time. The only choice that can be made is that relating to the class to be used: Commando, Sharpshooter, Miner and Pilot. The Commando is the one with heavy weapons: we can choose between a rocket launcher and a 50-round minigun. It also comes with a basic shovel for digging, a pistol and grenades. The Sharpshooter is the classic Sniper and is equipped with a Sniper Rifle, a Pickaxe, mines and a pistol. The Pilot is a particular class, as instead of the secondary weapon he has a jetpack that allows him to make short flights. However, if you hit the jetpack, it will explode. It is equipped with an SMG, shovel and rocket turret. Finally we have the Miner: he has a shotgun, a piercing cannon capable of digging tunnels and dynamite. Its reason for being is twofold: digging tunnels to the enemy base thanks to its extremely powerful shovel, capable of removing 27 blocks at a time, and then building the base's defenses. The miner is the only class with an enormous capacity in the block purse, the container in which to accumulate the excavated ones, and for this reason he is entrusted with the task of builder. The classes are poorly optimized, unbalanced in favor of the Sharpshooter and the Miner, while the construction phase is impractical. And that's without counting the many bugs present. Finally, the few customizations are limited to the Commando's weapon and the Shooter's accessory. You don't collect experience points or coins, so you don't feel the same sense of growth as other shooters today. In short, there is the strong risk that after a few games the experience will become boring. The game modes Upon entering the game we will not be able to help but look for a game: in fact we will not have other options available. There are six modes: Capture the Case (a.k.a Capture the Flag), Team Deathmach, Smash, More Hills, Diamond Mine, and Zombies. The game does not have any form of tutorial to teach us the rules of the game, which is short-sighted given the confusion that is generated during the matches. Sometimes you find players who enjoy destroying levels in a Deathmatch or wandering around the map to observe the cubed graphics; In short, a system that would better direct the use of the contents would be welcome. The first five game options are pretty standard and repeat what has already been experienced elsewhere. Zombie mode, on the other hand, is more complex but also the fastest, probably the only really fun and well-structured one. There are two factions, Zombies and Survivors. The game begins with two randomly chosen Zombies, while all other players are assigned Survivors. While the latter have the task of surviving, the Zombies will have to transmit the virus to all the others. Survivors, once infected, will become Zombies themselves. The graphics engine of the game, developed by the guys from Jagex, is good despite the bugs. The graphics are neat and the physics of destroying the environment is remarkable. If we try to cut down a tree at the base or blow up an entire house, they will fall in on themselves and destroy themselves. The audio is okay, nothing special, but sufficient for an indie game. On the other hand, the music of the main menu, of the loads and of the background is excellent, created in a retro style, which almost seems to come from the times of the NES. Very negative point for level loads that last even several minutes, even on mid-range PCs.", "date": "2013-01-07", "grade": "6.0"}
