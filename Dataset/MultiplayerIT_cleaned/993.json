{"name": "WarioWare: Touched!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/warioware-touched.html", "text": "Touch Wario As is evident, WarioWare: Touched! features a variety of new mini-games played through interaction with the touchscreen that occupies the bottom of the Nintendo console. Just as on GBA the foundation of the gameplay was the exploitation of only the directional cross and the A key, on DS everything revolves around the use of the stylus and, in some cases, the player's breath. Following an already known formula, the various minigames are divided among the bizarre protagonists of the game based on the type of their own (mini) play structure: therefore, depending on the selected stage, you will find yourself having to use the stylus in slightly different ways. And so with Wario you will find yourself tapping on the screen, for example in an attempt to pop balloons or swat flies; with Dr. Crygor it will be necessary to make rotations with the stylus to roll snowballs or turn cranks; and again with Mona the user will be able to draw fast cutting-like lines on the touchscreen, in order to slice vegetables or throw shurikens. There is also a level entirely dedicated to the exploitation of the microphone implemented inside the DS, in which it is necessary to blow towards the console to extinguish candles, cool cups of coffee or dissipate fog. And this is just to mention a few examples: although fundamentally anchored to a single, simple element such as the use of the stylus as the only game tool (the ~blown~ part is extremely marginal), WarioWare: Touched! still manages to present a certain variety within its minigames, a symptom of undoubted creativity and inventiveness on the part of the developers. Which manifests itself in a striking way in the concept of the vast majority of minigames available, often demented to the point of literally making the player laugh. In fact, it is impossible to remain impassive in the face of internships that require you to milk cows, to pluck hair or even to wave an arm in greeting to ward off annoying relatives... Laugh, laugh and laugh some more However, much of WarioWare's hilarious appeal derives from the unmistakable audiovisual style of Nintendo production. Also in this Touched!, the developers have been very skilled in providing the already deviated game concepts with an adequate graphic and sound correspondent. On the cosmetic front, the trash-minimalism that had already received so much approval at the release of the first WarioWare makes a triumphant return: highly stylized drawings, retro graphic styles, parodies of various kinds and deliberately digitized images in a primitive way are the masters in Touched! , repeating the success of its predecessor in this area. Also from the sound point of view we can speak of an evolution matured on the same style traced from the first episode of the series: obsessive and pounding music, susceptible to sudden accelerations and slowdowns of the rhythm, are perfectly combined with perfectly timed sound effects and the convulsive vocalizations of the game characters. Analyzed in its various parts, WarioWare: Touched! demonstrates exactly what was expected from the arrival of the series on the double screen of the DS: a fun and frenetic title, able to exploit well the characteristics of the Nintendo handheld and infallible in attracting the user thanks to the exhilarating intelligence of its minigames. If you really want to nitpick, you could blame Touched! to present fewer stages than the original WarioWare, as well as to offer a series of extra games (unlockable by reaching certain scores in the various levels) which appear more as simple fillers or as mere demonstrations of the DS's peculiarities. But like the best champions, WarioWare: Touched! it's a bit genius and wildness. Laugh, laugh and laugh some more Click to read the guide to Wario Ware: Touched! Comment Crazy, funny and demented as expected, WarioWare: Touched! represents a new confirmation of the goodness of the minigame-oriented game structure and stands as one of the best products so far available on Nintendo DS. Applied in exploiting the potential offered by the touchscreen and able to re-propose a vast series of hilarious mini-games, Touched! it cannot and does not want to represent for DS the revolution that the original was for GBA, to which it appears slightly indebted in terms of quantity and quality; but other than that, the tactile version of Wario's minigames convinces in every respect, making WarioWare: Touched! a purchase strongly recommended to all owners of the Nintendo dual-screen platform. Pro Immediate and hilarious gameplay Graphically and conceptually hilarious mini-games Intelligent sfrUse of the touch screen Cons Reduced number of mini-games compared to the original Some rather weak extras Unlocking everything takes little time Rightly acclaimed as one of the most original and entertaining titles ever to appear on the screen of a portable console, WarioWare on GBA was destined not to remain an isolated case within the videogame landscape: the minigames of Mario's moustached antagonist were therefore first transferred to party version on Gamecube, to then return to its native land with the new WarioWare: Twisted! and finally landing on the newborn Nintendo DS with all the intention of exploiting the peculiarities of the new platform in the best possible way. Renewed in form, the umpteenth pills of Wario's madness can now literally be touched by hand. Or rather, with the stylus", "date": "2005-03-23", "grade": null}
