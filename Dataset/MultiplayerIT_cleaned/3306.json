We are therefore talking about a long-running role-playing game, an old glory published in 1984 by Greg Costikyan, Dan Gelber and Eric Goldberg and which has become a video game thanks to the efforts of the Black Shamrock guys, probably impressed by the work of three fervent dystopian enthusiasts who they have created one of a certain thickness by exploiting black humor, psychology and bogeymen of sure effect such as mutants, secret organizations, communists and, in general, everything that is found outside the known world. The protagonist humanity of the setting is in fact closed in a huge underground city called Complesso Alpha, where survival is ensured by cloning and by the benevolent absolute domination of the Friend Computer, an artificial intelligence armed with cameras who has no qualms about adopting drastic measures, including the employment of squads of fixers, one of which is commanded by the player, to counter what he deems threats to his perfect society. A vintage RPG becomes a video game with a touch of roguelike A short initial tutorial allows us to familiarize ourselves with the point and click system of a classic PC role-playing game with a three-quarter view, real-time combat with tactical pause, multiple-choice dialogues, grenades, healing and sales or crafting stations which can be hacked with a simple mini-game. All around, however, there is a distressing world made of clones, of slogans that remind us of the obligation to be happy and of tasks to be performed to stay in good graces Friendly Computer, whose missions, before which we can choose three solvers to compose a team of four, punctuate the days of the Alfa complex. And it is good to take care of the tasks with a certain attention, on pain of an increase in the level of betrayal which in any case is destined to rise with every doubt, suspicion or error, traveling at full speed towards the threshold of 100% whose consequences include voluntary suicide, a fight with the guards destined to end badly or a brainwashing in extremis. However, there is the fateful restart button, even if this often means having to do a lot of redoing, forcing us to resort to the clone system which allows us to come back to life, up to a maximum of five times, keeping progress, maintaining that little equipment that the Friend Computer leaves us and being able to spend the experience points earned with the missions. Dying basically makes things easier and the broader concept works, but in a game like this it fails to incentivize the player to give their best. Maintaining the challenge thus becomes a personal matter which for some players could have a masochistic aftertaste, thanks to some ingenuity such as a single button to act and to shoot, which is also possible outside of the missions. Hence the possibility that a wrong click causes damage by increasing our level of treason, which also happens when pathfinding ends up with our character on the yellow areas. But these are certainly not Paranoia's biggest problems, and it's a shame given the potential of a setting in which a computer demands happiness while exterminating its offspring, thus forcing men to rebel, to betray, to experience the abyss of paranoia to the point of going insane accepting secret societies that pretend to live in Dungeons & Dragons, population experiments and whatnot. From here, missions with an interesting incipit are born which, however, are not kept alive by a game structure that turns out to be much simpler than it appears at first sight, also reducing valid ideas such as areas divided by color rather bland outlines. Instead, it is noted the moment in which, after each mission, the computer asks the four of the team to reveal if there have been any betrayals from outsiders or from the team members themselves. The problem is that if in the first missions it strikes and the humor is spot on, going forward this fades and both the relative weight of the choices on the story and a lack of narrative depth emerge. There are good level quotes and there are also moments of not bad humor, but overall the experience is flat and the gameplay does not help to revive it. Assorted gameplay, graphics and ingenuity During the tutorial we are asked to spend the first points in skills than in part reflect the unique nature of Paranoia. Alongside classic skills such as hand-to-hand combat, the ability to use firearms and hacking, we find in fact skills such as bureaucracy and psychology, quite relevant in a universe where making a wrong answer can lead to serious consequences and every companion is a possible source of betrayal. In fact, the Friend Computer does not scruple to get rid of any suspicion that makes every possible answer trivial. But the multiple-choice dialogue isn't that of an RPG: it's rather that of an adventure, with a number of options to be exhausted as quickly as possible, except where the dialogue is interesting. Instead, we can choose how to deal with certain situations and the level reached in some skills determines the possibility of unlocking doors or convincing someone to reveal information to us, but if some consequences are fun and reflect on the game, in most cases the experience is not changes, both by aiming to obey the Friend Computer and by choosing to support those who want to subvert power. But from this point of view a minimal feeling of freedom remains. On the other hand, one often feels trapped in a gameplay that from the point of view of the action even makes the tactical pause almost superfluous. On the other hand, except for a few grenades, the gameplay is a succession of automatic attacks where the variety of equipment is almost nil and where the only real perceptible difference between the weapons, despite the presence of colors and magazines to differentiate the arsenal, concerns modifiers such as stun. All without consultable percentages, without a real choice between the main equipment and without any trace of stealth dynamics, although there are two or three game moments based precisely on stealth, while crafting is limited almost exclusively to consumables and the minigames are to say the least laughable. Therefore, the action remains which in different situations revolves almost entirely around moving team members from one barrier to another to escape from the destroyed barriers and avoid area attacks such as grenades. Not exactly exciting, accomplices uninspired enemies and some pathfinding problems that make any defeats rather frustrating. We then cling to black humor and the few successful things such as portraits, animations and different colors, undoubtedly effective in highlighting the happy desperation that hovers in the Alpha Complex but unfortunately only apparently integrated into the game dynamics, given that they only determine the combination of magazines and weapons, while the clothes with which you gain access to areas of a certain color are automatically supplied before being shipped to the aforementioned by rail transport. All guided, between enemies of little variety and environments that are too similar to each other even considering the extenuating circumstance of the anonymous setting of the futuristic complex. On the other hand, the English dubbing is good, but it belongs only to the brainiac, an obvious saving even if it fits into the perspective of the only leader who evokes science fiction atmospheres. However, the atmosphere, thanks to a basic but spot-on soundtrack, emerges here and there as the basis for the dialogues that are sometimes a bit boring, but when they are inspired they bring out a humor that works, the only pillar of Cyanide production.", "date": "2020-01-04", "grade": "5.5"}
