{"name": "Digital Chocolate Caf: Solitaire", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/digital-chocolate-cafe-solitaire.html", "text": "Digital Chocolate has set itself the goal of heavily innovating gaming on mobile phones, not so much in terms of the type of games presented as in the system around which they revolve. We're talking about the DChoc Caf, a sort of ~Virtual Caf~ that we can customize in multiple ways and in which not only our character but also the various avatars created by community users will move. In this sort of chat with isometric graphics, which are also very accurate, we will be able to invite our friends and challenge them to the different games created and made available by Digital Chocolate. The more we play, the more we'll get bonuses and prizes that will allow us to customize our avatar with new types of clothing, hats, t-shirts and increasingly fashionable pants. The more users who enter our Caf, the more points and prestige we will earn and this will allow us to enlarge our virtual room more and more. Once logged in to the Caf we will also be able to try demos of the new games before choosing whether to buy them. The titles available are certainly traditional but no less interesting for this, starting from the ~Hangman~, passing from ~Solitaire~ to Hold'em Poker and Sudoku. Simple games, known and certainly perfect for challenges with friends. We cannot hide that the structure designed by Digital Chocolate works perfectly, the Caf is structured in different areas dedicated to friends, the trophies won, the cloakroom, the counter which allows users to access the Cafs and obviously the section dedicated to games. In addition to the downloadable and available titles, we will be able to participate in a sort of quiz on our preferences in terms of actors / actresses and films, a nice diversion. The game we tested in our first entry into the world of Virtual Cafs was Solitaire, which immediately proved to be an exceptional product, the top on the market in terms of the methods and possibilities offered. For the record, we remind you of all the games present: Klondike, Freecell, Pyramid, Poker, Spiderette, Giardino Fiorito, Scorpion, Yukon, Golf, Calculus, Seven Sisters and Castle Siege. The more knowledgeable on the subject will recognize the different variations of solitaire, for the less savvy instead there is no need to worry, an excellent tutorial and the instructions explain everything in detail, just know that solitaire as we know it is generally the Klondike. We can only be satisfied, not only with the game but above all with the virtual structure that underlies it. The virtual caf works very well and will soon captivate you non-stop, obviously the price to pay is the cost of the connection, but it is certainly worth the sorry. PRO Online community that works very well The best Solitaire out there AGAINST The cost of the connection", "date": "2008-04-02", "grade": "S.V."}
