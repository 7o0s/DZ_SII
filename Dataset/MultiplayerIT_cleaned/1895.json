{"name": "Legaia 2: Duel Saga", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/legaia-2-duel-saga.html", "text": "Black hole sun One of the main defects of Legend of Legaia was certainly given by the fact that the plot was obvious and linear, in this respect it unfortunately seems that the developers have not learned from past mistakes. The most attentive will remember the lackluster plot that characterized the first episode, in which a mysterious fog descended on the world of Legaia bringing with it terror and unbalance among the peoples and where the weight of the destiny of the world was supported by three enterprising youngsters. Duel Saga follows the same narrative approach, in which the only tangible difference lies in the replacement of the impending danger, which has now become a solar eclipse. But let's go step by step. It all begins in the quiet and charming town of Nohl, where our protagonist lives. One day, on an excursion in the wood located near the village, the indomitable hero of the moment, Lang, runs into a mysterious presence, a man with golden eyes who, after defeating him in combat, steals the very precious crystal Aqualith, vital to the survival of the village. From here begins the spasmodic search for Lang who, in the course of his wanderings, finds two trusted friends, Maya and Kazan, with whom to share dangers and difficult situations. But the advent of a solar eclipse of such a magnitude as to kill all life forms is the pivot of the plot, the instigator of this spell is currently unknown... Tactical arts system Legaia2: Duel Saga is the classic RPG based on turn-based combat in which each character grows by gaining experience. Certainly appealing is the combat system characterized by the TAS (Tactical Arts System), or a sequence of attacks which, with the right combinations, can cause a lot of damage to the enemy with decidedly effective moves also on an aesthetic level; Normal Arts, Super Arts, Hyper Arts, Variable Arts and Mystic Art are the five categories into which the TAS is divided. These arts can be found through scrolls, following the succession of events or simply through combinations and vary according to the character being used. For example Lang will employ the various arts following the path of the sword, Maya will use the voice of magic and Kazan the philosophy of martial arts. So far so good, except that, in the long run, the fights lose their dynamism precisely due to the fact that, once certain inputs have been commanded to the characters, the latter will complete all the attacks regardless of the defeat of the enemy. In some ways this combat system resembles that of its predecessor, with the addition of a more complex mechanism of moves and two more characters to use (5 instead of 3). During the clashes it will also be possible to summon elemental spirits defined as Origin, a sort of second soul supplied to each character of the Mystic race, also provided with status and levels that grow in parallel with their masters. These Origins are also the fulcrum of solving puzzles and obstacles present in the well-structured dungeons, a real challenge even for the most expert players. In fact, it will be possible to select the desired character in real time according to the spirit he possesses and according to the needs. Graphic & Sound The graphic aspect of this title is decidedly below the standards we are used to lately, failing to keep up with other productions for 128-bit systems. The polygonal models are lacking both in terms of polygons and as a variety of animations, some of which are made very badly. Faded textures make up a background devoid of detail, where not even the camera gives any sign of life, limiting itself to following the action with a subspecies of vertical scrolling. There is some significant improvement within the fights, where each of the aforementioned particularities gains. The sound sector can easily be placed on the same level, which does not affect under any circumstances and, above all, does not give emotions in the key moments of the game, such as important events or fights to the death. Conclusion As happened in the previous chapter of the saga, this too Legaia2: Duel Saga has little to tell. Penalized not only by the plot but also by a low-level technical realization, however it offers good ideas in terms of gameplay, a real strength of the game. If you love narratives made in Square this title could make you turn up your nose precisely because of the flatness that distinguishes it, but if you love atypical and original combat systems you should give this a chance ifthat of an unrepresentative series. Pros Original combat system Subgames for all tastes Challenging and varied dungeons Cons Localization in our beautiful absent language Linear and predictable plot Technically mediocre It was 1999, the year in which Legend of Legaia was released for PSX, a role-playing game without infamy and without praise that was going to exploit the magical moment of this genre also in the West. It's been three years now and here's the sequel, not too acclaimed to tell the truth...", "date": "2002-12-03", "grade": null}
