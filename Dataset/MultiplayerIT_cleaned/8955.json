{"name": "The Messenger", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-messenger-recensione.html", "text": "Article resurrected by Simone Tagliaferri. A crossing of destinies in a strange story, of which memory has been lost in our days, a story from other times, from before ray tracing, when people played out of anger or passion, but between anger and passion the detachment is already growing and who will be the winner is already clear. It was August of the now distant 2018 and a serious, even tragic event happened in the editorial office: the disappearance of an article. Of course, the editor who wrote it had also vanished into thin air, but that didn't strike us very much (oh, one also has other things to do than give importance to the inhuman screams that come from the warehouse). I mean, it was its first rehearsal and we barely remembered its name, so why bother? Actually... what was it called? Forensics will tell us in the next few hours. While we wait for the outcome of the investigations and try to remember what we did that day, just to have an alibi, let's re-read your review of The Messenger, one of the great absentees from these pages (now you know why). Time jumps The Messenger also owes you in genres other than Metroidvania The Messenger of Sabotage is the maximum expression of videogame nostalgia declined to the future, able as it is to tell the evolution of a genre through its mechanics, slowly transforming what seems like a very banal story of ninjas who fight against demons into a compelling meta narrative full of unexpected twists. But we talked about history. The game starts in the ninja village where the protagonist trains who is shocked by the attack of a gigantic demon. A predestined hero arrives to stop him who, after making him flee, gives us a parchment that we must carry to the top of a snowy peak. We have become the messengers and we have a mission to accomplish, without taking it too seriously (the tones of the game are very ironic, aware of its nature as it is). The Messenger in the early hours is proposed as a simple platformer with 8-bit-like graphics, inspired by some NES classics such as Ninja Gaiden and Castlevania. It is very well made, but it is also very linear, at least in appearance. Along the way that you have to go to the first destination, there are inaccessible areas and hints of secret areas that make it clear that the gameplay hides much more than what appears. The same shop, accessible through strange portals, shows the presence of initially mysterious elements, which will reveal their function only with the passing of the hours and the achievement of certain objectives. But let's get back to us. The acquisition of the first powers begins to break the linearity, giving us more control over the movements of the character. Arrived at our first key destination, after passing platforms and enemies in large numbers, taking advantage of the ninja's powers such as wall climbing, the grappling hook or the possibility of making another jump after hitting an enemy or some interactable object ( for example of the lamps), the game opens by transforming itself into a real metroidvania, complete with a map that can be freely explored in a non-linear way, to go in search of powers and secrets. The platforming mechanics are excellent Even the plot becomes more intricate, with the inclusion of a second timeline, which is represented through a simple but effective ploy: an evolution of the graphic style that looks to the Super Nintendo. Then the ninja gets the ability to jump between eras, one 8-bit and one 16-bit. The effect is fabulous, also thanks to the ability of the developers to exploit the possibilities given by the time jumps (the details of the levels change with the passing of the ages) which create very elaborate game moments, with puzzles that are not very difficult to solve, but are not trivial either . Meta video game The shop has several functions, some of which you discover much later in the adventure It is precisely in this continuous look to the past that The Messenger reveals its modern nature: it is as if the developers invited us to play with the history of video games (mostly with a fragment of it), reworking it in a creative way, moreover without making it heavy. Precisely this awareness of being a video game gives an unexpected strength to his narration, which paradoxically takes on increasingly lyrical tones from level to level, up to a profound and truly excellent ending for dramatic construction and narrative deconstruction. Of course, it must be said that it is not very difficult, in the sense that the high number of checkpoints makes progression quite easy. There are some more challenging bosses, but nothing that can block an average expert player for more than a few attempts. Quantityor are you big? You will go down the same! Let's say that it's not a real defect, given that it still takes many hours to finish it (it took us more than twelve, but we found all the secrets). It must also be said that once finished it is possible to replay it in New Game+ mode (are you sure it was already available at launch? Ah true, you're dead and you can't answer Ed), so those looking for a more difficult challenge will find bread for his teeth. Finally, the excellent soundtrack is worth mentioning, really beautiful and full of pleasant songs to listen to, always in line with the general style of the game.", "date": "2022-02-04", "grade": "8.8"}
