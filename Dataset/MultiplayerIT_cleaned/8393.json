Among these sporting-videogame appointments we also find the cycling season, which has become a tradition for some time now also on the monitors of our PCs (and not only): thanks to Cyanide Studio and its Pro Cycling Manager, even fans of Lance Armstrong and company can in fact have fun managing a team by taking it to the top of the world. A naturally not easy task, enriched every year by further elements from the Paris-based team, also strengthened by the support of a community of enthusiasts who continue to actively contribute to the project as well as playing. From zero to myth The different game modes in Pro Cycling Manager 2012 range from a single race to what is obviously the most popular type of game: Career. To make things even more grand, the developers have increased the number of selectable teams to a total of 81, this time divided into three categories: World Tour, Continental Pro and Continental, complete with promotions and relegations based on scores obtained. In this expansion operation, the number of races has also been increased to reach 180 selectable competitions, among which we naturally find the best known in the world such as the Tour de France. But also others that are little known in some cases, given that as usual some licenses continue to be in hiding. For this reason, if for the Tour and for certain teams we can count on real names, for other competitions and teams we have to resign ourselves to seeing old-style distortions of various kinds. Not bad though, because as we said there are both the tools and a willing community to remedy the gaps with its modding work. After briefly analyzing the new issues of the series, let's see what Pro Cycling Manager 2012 has in store for us in terms of raw gameplay: the sensation, for those who have already had the opportunity to try the old titles in the series, is that of already knowing what you encounter from the first moments in the menus, while vice versa for newbies (both of the series and of the sport itself) there is still a tutorial that allows you to immerse yourself with the right comfort in the role of guide of the chosen team. However, Cyanide has decided to meet the players, in a way identifiable this year in the introduction of the new planning tool, with which it is possible to view all the appointments of one's team in the calendar, defining training sessions or, further news, reconnaissance sessions on the course with which to improve preparation for the races. The whole management phase is obviously addressed to a single moment: the race. Also in this case, Cyanide has preferred to limit himself to some refinements, without adding striking elements to the simulation: certainly among the appreciable things right from the first races there is the renewed artificial intelligence of the cyclists not controlled by the player, which leads the CPU to create finally more aggressive tactics, responding in kind to both our moves and those made by the other teams, thus engaging in exciting duels between different teams as in reality. For the rest, we continue to find more analogies with the past than real novelties. We point out the improved possibility of giving the various commands to the individual riders more quickly (and in cycling, timing is everything) thanks to the new control interface. Ride in 3D Even if in the managerial sector the technical sector is traditionally placed in the background compared to the rest, in the specific case of the Pro Cycling Manager series, for several editions now, we have been able to count on a 3D engine for carrying out the races. Engine that has evolved over time, to arrive at worthily representing the extraordinary landscape show that only a cycle race can offer: at the risk of repeating ourselves to exhaustion, also in this case Cyanide has made little more than a few retouches, as demonstrated by the fact that the hardware requirements are practically identical to those of 2011. If for the most famous cyclists we have in fact appearances rather similar to reality, for others the models still leave a little to be desired, just as there are no improvements in the management of the race, which still suffers the absence of a director capable of following the evolution of the race as it should. The sound is not particularly remembered, even if the trackside effects are more catchy than the series of music that make up the soundtrack. The invincibleArmada The online mode of Pro Cycling Manager 2012 has been enriched with the new typology entitled Armada, freely inspired by Ultimate Team from the FIFA series. The game system therefore provides for the use of a series of cards representing the cyclists, with which to compose one's own team with the possibility of exchanges with the other players. The cards can be purchased with the virtual currency, the Cyans, which can be earned both through the hours spent playing and through the development team's web platform, paying with real euros. A choice that opens up possible imbalances between those who sweat their money by staying within the confines of the game and those who instead choose to have an easy life by buying them online, thus exposing the side of the multiplayer mode to more than justified bad feelings. Anyone who does not want to enter this mechanism can still choose to carry out their online tender as in the past, in a simple and painless way for the wallet.", "date": "2012-07-31", "grade": "7.0"}
