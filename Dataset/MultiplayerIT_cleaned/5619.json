In fact, the release of the first chapter of The Walking Dead dates back to about a month ago: Michonne, a miniseries with which the development team specializing in episodic adventures has decided to give us an appetizer while waiting for its Season 3 dedicated to the walking dead. After having advised you to be a little cautious in evaluating the purchase on the occasion of the considerations made on the prologue, let's go back to dealing with Michonne thanks to the release of the second chapter of the three that Telltale Games has prepared for us. We return in the company of Michonne in the second chapter of the miniseries dedicated to The Walking Dead Where did we leave off? Give No Shelter is the title of the second installment of The Walking Dead: Michonne, in which the story obviously resumes from the exact point where we left off previously. For the benefit of those who are reading this game only now, we remind you that its plot is closely linked to that of The Walking Dead comic, presenting us the figure of the protagonist with some differences from the television series. The Michonne seen on the small screen appears in fact much less tormented by her inner demons than that of the books and this miniseries, in which the past incessantly returns to recur in the form of distressing visions. Without unbuttoning too much on the story of this second episode, we limit ourselves to saying that after the introductory function of its predecessor the story continues to continue on two tracks. We therefore find Michonne in the company of a different group from that of Rick Grimes, in the period between the numbers 126 and 139 of the American comics, before her reunion with the most famous characters of The Walking Dead takes place. The continuous struggle for survival in the world now dominated by zombies alternates with the story of Michonne's past, in which the woman is once again shown in her apartment in the first moments of the epidemic, desperately looking for her two daughters. Due to the aforementioned hallucinations, and not only that, the present and the past manage to merge several times during the adventure, thus allowing us to continue in both directions in a similar way to what has already been seen in In Too Deep. A Season Pass to rule them all While released in episode form, The Walking Dead: Michonne is currently only purchasable via a Season Pass bundle. It is therefore obligatory to purchase all three episodes at the price of 14.99 euros: for this reason you will also find it reported for this second chapter, but in reality it concerns the complete trio. Better the second Even if the first chapter of The Walking Dead: Michonne had the task of paving the way for the other two that were then due to arrive, the previous encounter with this miniseries had not particularly impressed us. In addition to a slow take-off, justified precisely by its introductory role, the experience offered by In Too Deep seemed to us to be undermined above all by an abuse of extremely simplified quick time events, which fueled the initial sense of boredom before the story fueled . Fortunately, Give No Shelter takes a few steps forward from this point of view, while continuing to resort to quick time events: in this case, however, we don't want to talk about abuse, thanks to a better alternation between dialogues and other types of ~ gameplay~. The quotation marks are not used at random, since we are still talking about fictitious choices and other small devices to make the player interact: this is now the trademark of Telltale Games, so there is nothing to be surprised about. Returning to talk about this second episode in detail, we can say that it slips away quite pleasantly from start to finish, without any particular dead ends. However, it must be said that the duration is really reduced to the bone, given that at the end of the game the Steam counter measured 72 minutes of play, including a break to go to the bathroom in the total. Overall for the moment we are therefore below three hours as a total duration, waiting to see what the third episode will offer us. Continuing to talk about Give No Shelter, as before we particularly liked the machete action phases, while instead one of the weaknesses continues to be the affection towards the characters: Telltale's efforts to make us bond with the other people who appear in The Walking Dead: Michonne are evident and in some cases even manage to hit the target, but knowing that Michonne can't die certainly takes away a good chunk of pathos to the actions that see her as the protagonist. Summing up, we reiterate that Give No Shelter convinced us more than In Too Deep for the reasons just listed, but not enough to recommend its immediate purchase: considering that the third and final episode should be around the corner, better to wait overall assessment before proceeding. Unless, as previously mentioned, you are a huge fan of Michonne and The Walking Dead.", "date": "2016-03-30", "grade": null}
