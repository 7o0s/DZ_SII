{"name": "Babylons Fall", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/babylons-fall-recensione.html", "text": "The myth of the Tower of Babel can be read and interpreted in various ways: it makes you smile as from today it will also be associated with a very unmemorable project carried out by Square Enix in the company of Platinum Games. In fact, if God punished men for their arrogance, given that they wanted to rise up to heaven (it is a possible interpretation, at least), this time there was not even a need for divine intervention: the blessed tower, videogame speaking, collapsed on itself by itself. It couldn't stand up, a metaphor for a ~live service~ project that can be completely criticized today, not so much because it was wrong a priori, but because it was achieved by sacrificing any sensible aspect in the gameplay, in the progression, in the technical sector. In short, in our review of Babylon's Fall, you will find more confirmations than surprises, as well as the reasons for a missed opportunity. And you will also understand why your fears - from the first announcement to that insipid beta - have proved sadly well founded. The plot, so to speak The heroes of Babylon's Fall ready for action Let's overlook Babylon's Fall's narrative modes for a moment, to focus instead on the content itself. There is a plot, and it concerns the fate of the ancient Babylonian kingdom. In fact, once upon a time Babylon dominated the whole world; today the memory and above all the treasures remain, hidden among the ruins of the enormous Ziggurat. However, seizing that ancient power is far from simple, since the tower is defended by the Gallu, monstrous creatures and warriors ready to tear apart the unwary newcomers. Even the Domitian Empire manages to contain them with extreme difficulty... so much so that they need a constant influx of enslaved ~heroes~ to deal with them. Here's the rub: the player, in Babylon's Fall, follows the story of any one of these warriors, called Sentinels. First of all, the editor, after accepting a thousand warnings, messages and consents, allows you to choose between three different ethnic groups, Agavian, Huysian and Galeilion, each with a specific ~lore~. Ideally, the subdivision is somewhat reminiscent of the classic tripartite scheme: versatile warrior, tank and ranged attacker; in reality this choice turns out to be completely irrelevant for the vast majority of the adventure, since when it begins to show its effects from a gameplay point of view (in the specific customization of Gideon Coffin, which will be discussed later) we have already reached the endgame. Returning to the story: the protagonist is one of the many slaves who arrived in Neo Babylon. Like all the other unfortunates, the Gideon Coffin is installed on his back, both an instrument of control by the Empire, which is impossible to get rid of, and a useful weapon to use in battle. Start the tutorial mission: free a certain area from the Gallu present, and it's OK. The supporting actors are presented (all identical, all anonymous), while a real bad guy on duty is completely absent, and that's fine. After the first hour or so, the player keeps repeating to himself ~okay, once that's done the real story will finally start, I'll finally see something interesting~. Another handful of hours go by, only the moment in question never comes. The plot of Babylon's Fall is all here: you continue to complete one mission after another, without ever really changing anything in particular, in an exasperating, predictable and boring linearity. It almost would have been better if there was no plot at all, with simply an anonymous hub from which to launch equally anonymous missions. The scenario that in Babylon's Fall will host most of your raids From time to time it is possible to witness cutscenes created with the game engine, or static images accompanied by texts: both intend to explain certain aspects of the context, or simply report an exchange of jokes between characters. But the contents, in addition to being ends in themselves, don't even seem to be linked together in a particularly intelligent way: it is truly impossible to become attached to a given character, to empathize with what is and remains to all intents and purposes a condition of slavery, to feel interested for the events at the center of the narrative. Sure - you say - in the end the plot is only important up to a certain point. Let's see how the rest fares then. Gameplay with enormous (wasted) potential Don't be scared, Babylon's Fall's enemies are rarely scary in groups Two ideas behind Babylon's Fall had convinced us, net of doubts about their actual achievements. First of all, the proposal for a new live service game intrigued us: history teaches that, if well studied, titles of this type can ~kidnap~ the players even for years. However, the involvement of Platinum Games had been the most tempting, alone guarantee of the goodness of the gameplay. And here's the problem: the gameplay in question continues to show, even when we write, an enormous potential. However, we should intervene as soon as possible, where possible, on some balances, because this potential has been sadly wasted. The Babylon's Fall combat system has tried to modernize some mechanics: the light and heavy attacks remain, to be alternated in powerful combinations.The tool supplied to the heroes, the Gideon Coffin, takes care of the rest: through the rear triggers of the controller (even with the implementation of a discreet haptic feedback) it is possible to release two more attacks, offensive if necessary or defensive. At least in the attack sequences, Babylon's Fall is fulfilling The beauty is that these actions are not alternatives to standard attacks, but complementary; a bit of a sort of revised and simplified version of the Astral Chain combat system. If you're already carrying out a heavy attack but have seen the enemy offensive coming, for example, you can limit the damage or even zero it with Gideon Coffin's instant defense, which will erect a blue shield around the hero. It goes without saying that this ingenious tool consumes energy, to be exact the one indicated by the second bar on the screen immediately below that of health. It is not clear why it is that same energy bar, however, that allows you to perform the dodges. Gideon Coffin's projections of Babylon's Fall are somewhat reminiscent of Astral Chain It happens all too often, in the middle of the action, to find yourself dry, thus forced to fall back on simple basic attacks: this may not be a problem against simpler enemies (unless you aim for the platinum medal for each section of a given level, in pure Platinum Games style) but can lead to collapse in the presence of bosses, with impressive health and offensive capacity. Also, while overlooking the general confusion of each battle, it must be said that Babylon's Fall soon becomes almost inaccessible for solo players, as too many sections, too many enemies are clearly designed for group action. In short, something went wrong during the design phase. Fighting armed with Gideon Coffin, as an alternative to traditional weapons, is in theory a lot of fun; in practice everything becomes much more unbalanced, confusing and poorly optimized from level to level, especially if you are alone. Experience and technical sector Be careful what you wish for: far too many items in Babylon's Fall have to be paid for What has been said so far can easily be extended to the entire Babylon's Fall experience. The general impression is of finding in your hands a product designed for the market of at least ten years, with all the problems that follow. The main hub, anonymous and complicated, seems to want to disperse all newcomers in minutes; the missions all appear the same, alternating areas full of enemies (the same) to be reached by passing long and empty corridors (the same); the rewards of each quest look more like alms than real prizes; even more serious and unjustifiable how pieces of equipment and useful material have been hidden behind paid purchases, or in any case linked to the season pass, in turn very hostile to non-paying players. All this in a title offered at the price of a Triple A, certainly not in a free-to-play (even if, in our opinion, it will become one by the end of 2022, in order to save itself). On the technical sector we would prefer to defer. In fact, the artistic direction passes, which could still have its own meaning. From a graphic point of view, however, Babylon's Fall is really ugly. Such a glance would have been justifiable a couple of generations ago, indeed perhaps then we would have even appreciated it, but in 2022 absolutely not; really we could name quite a few free-to-play able to stand up to it and surpass it without any effort. Nothing to object, at least, for the soundtrack and for the fluidity on PlayStation 5: both consoled us a bit, grappling as we were already with everything else.", "date": "2022-03-11", "grade": "5.5"}
