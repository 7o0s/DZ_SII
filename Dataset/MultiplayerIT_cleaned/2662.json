Iwao, with little strength left after the fight, tells him he will never have it. But Lan Di knows how to get it and threatens to kill Ryo. Iwao doesn't want to lose his only son and finally reveals the location of the mirror to the mysterious man. Shenmue Lan's henchmen run to get the item. Once obtained, the man who so longed for that strange mirror says a sentence that reveals the murderous past of Ryo's father: ~Remember Zhao Sun Ming~. Iwao and Lan Di fight for the last time. The last one for Iwao who, telling his son to always keep close to the friends he loves, dies. And Ryo shouts to the sky: ~Padreeeee!!~. A game? F.R.E.E.. This is the name adopted by the great Yu Suzuki to describe this wonderful game. It stands for Full Reactive Eyes Entertainment, a code name that speaks for itself. Translated, it means that in this ~game~ you will have the opportunity to do anything. And for once the promises are kept. In Shenmue you will not only have the opportunity to go around the neighborhoods of Yokosuka, or to converse with anyone you happen to meet along the streets of the city. A game? No, you can also observe anything, buy perfectly useless objects, play video games in a bar, listen to music, eat and drink any product sold in any Yokosuka club or shop. You can call a whole series of numbers that you will gradually add to your address book. All thanks to a game system based on four modes: Free Adventure, Quick Time Event, Free Combat and Visualization mode. These options, mind you, are not separated from each other: all are a fundamental part of the game and each will have its moments. Free Adventure consists of simply wandering around the city streets (since during the course of the adventure you will also be transported to other locations), conversing with anyone, buying objects and doing a whole series of actions that create an incredibly realistic setting. In the Quick Time Event you will have to be able to press the right key (suggested for a very short time from the game) at the right time. Instead, you will fight if you find yourself facing some enemy that cannot be avoided simply with the use of the word. By facing the opponent you will have the opportunity to show off a large number of shots and combinations worthy of the best fighting games and which make the game more and more engaging. Finally we have the View mode: by pressing the Zoom button you can observe every detail of anything that happens to you in your visual range. It must also be said that the genius of Yu Suzuki was able to make this title an experience thanks also to the introduction of a new concept of game time: every second of Shenmue corresponds to a real minute. Therefore you will see the sunrise, the day, the sunset and the night alternating in a perfectly believable way. The characters will roam the streets during the day while at night you will not find anyone in the streets of the city. Furthermore, if you have an appointment with someone at a certain time, you will have to be found at that moment in the established place, otherwise you risk losing the meeting by changing the course of events. At the limits of the Dreamcast Shenmue was developed and conceived for the Dreamcast. And you already know this. But what you still don't know is that every single chip in this machine has been squeezed out to the last drop of horsepower. Perhaps in some time future products will prove me wrong, but at the moment I can tell you that on this platform you cannot go further. Technically it is therefore the best product ever to land on the latest Sega console. At the limits of the Dreamcast The graphics are just real. Every element of this title has been reproduced so faithfully to reality that it seems more than realistic. Starting with the protagonist, Ryo, everything is perfect: the 3D model used for this character is ultra-detailed. The face is perfect, as are the clothes and everything. The thing that most amazed me is the level of perfection reached by the hands: they have veins, nails and joints. Something incredible. But not only Ryo, the other characters are also worthy of all my praise and you won't seeone individual in the entire game who isn't great. The animations make every single movement of the ~actors~ a feast for the eyes and everything seems truly real. The setting is up to the rest. Everything you will find during your adventure is a faithful reproduction of reality. The textures applied to the polygonal models of the buildings, plants, vehicles and everything else have been chosen with maniacal care. Not to mention the shadows that change depending on the time and the position you are in. We are truly excellent. Conclusions As you can tell from what I've written so far, I've been incredibly impressed with this title. It will be because it is one of those few titles that manage to awaken in me an irrepressible desire to play it all day long. It will be because it is one of those few titles that has not disappointed expectations and that can boast of a screenplay worthy of a Hollywood blockbuster. Conclusions It will be because it is one of those few titles that will go down in history. It will be because it is the best game you can find for the Dreamcast. It will be because it is the game that most of all demonstrates what the Sega console is capable of. $44 million well spent, Yu. Shenmue We are in Yokosuka, Japan. It is an October day and it is raining outside. Ryo Hazuki, the protagonist of the game, arrives at his house on a motorcycle that skids on the wet asphalt of the road. He enters his residence and heads to his personal Dojo, the training room. And there he finds his father Iwao Hazuki fighting with a man with a staid but menacing appearance. He is intent on taking an object that is very close to his heart. Lan Di, this is the man's name, is dressed in a suit that bears the large design of a dragon.", "date": "2000-12-18", "grade": null}
