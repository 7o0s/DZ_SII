It wasn't just cell phones and social networks, with their users who really wanted to play but who were decidedly unaccustomed to the refinements of the most beautiful PC and console titles, that spread the fashion (some would say ~the disease~, but this is a another story), but also an unsuspected Nintendo, which with its two flagships, Nintendo DS and Wii, and their innovative control systems, gave rise to a whole series of intriguing experiments. The first waves of games for Nintendo DS, if you remember, saw the presence of a whole series of ~collections of minigames~ (the example was given by Grande Enne herself with the hilarious minigames of the re-release of Super Mario 64), some presented just like that, sic et simpliciter, others that were given a sort of dress, a setting, a pretext to be able to move nibs, tilt consoles and blow microphones into them. Among the latter, Cooking Mama, with a culinary setting: from the first release in 2006, Japan's most powerful housewife has cut onions, reaching easily, and not counting conversions and forays into other domestic activities, to the fifth episode. The fifth episode of Cooking Mama: a recipe that is definitely starting to taste like you've already seen it? Wow! Even better than Mama! Let's immediately clarify the title of the paragraph, then we will come back to it better: you will hear the above sentence so many times from Mama's clear and crystalline voice, that you will soon replace the name of the protagonist with a Neapolitan epithet or so, whose hidden meaning is however easily understandable even in Bergamo Alta. Among the different options that the game will present to you immediately after the title screen, the main one is Mama's Challenges, from which you will then have access to a series of modes. The gist of the matter is ~Let's cook!~: you have a series of recipes available, sixty in all but obviously not all available from the beginning, each of which is divided into phases, more or less a dozen for the initial dishes and so on the increase in complexity. There is something for all tastes, even if the Japanese origin weighs heavily, from first courses to second courses to desserts, all with a rather succulent appearance. Each phase of the recipe is practically a mini-game, most of which simply require you to move the stylus on the touch screen in the direction indicated on the screen: cutting foods, mixing, kneading, opening cans, all of this is quite intuitive. But various other typologies await you: you will have to deal with strangely functioning appliances, you will have to evaluate the right cooking time for an ingredient, face some sort of rhythm game which, however, has very little rhythmic, since the indications are only graphic and not already musical, and occasionally even doing things that have nothing to do with actual cooking, like preventing the dog from stealing the chicken you've put out to dry. A great variety, it would seem, only that within the first ten recipes you will have practically already faced, and several times, all the types of minigames that the developers have foreseen; later the surface could change, perhaps you are kneading puff pastry instead of minced meat, but the mechanics will always be the same. Furthermore, and we come to the introductory speech, the level of challenge is generally practically nil, not only due to an intrinsic ease, but because Mama is still very generous and in order not to get full marks in each phase you will have to really try hard, and even by doing so, our ~teacher~ will still be ready to remedy the damage, allowing us to go on peacefully. Choice made in view of the public, essentially infantile, to which the product is aimed, you will say. Fine, but then how to explain that minigame that pops up every now and then, for no apparent reason (it would make sense, for example, if it were a sort of ~end-of-level boss~), and which is difficult and frustrating not so much in itself, but because Are the indications vague and insufficient? It often happens, for example, with the ~rhythm games~ we have mentioned. And, although it is possible to practice each phase individually, in the main game mode the recipe must be faced whole and in sequence: therefore, if among so many gold medals you have taken a bronze one and want to fix it, you have to put up with all the other sections as well, perhaps trivial and devoid of bite. The 3D effect Present, but totally useless, as all game action takes place on the lower screen. It just detaches Mama and some interface elements from the background, but at least the programmersi have had the foresight to calibrate it very low, so that it cannot distract from the gameplay. If it's not soup, it's wet bread In a game system which, all in all, flows away pleasantly and which consciously adopts extreme simplicity and even a certain amount of banality, in order to meet the public it is aimed at, the lack that is most felt is, in short, that of a sense of progression and of coherence altogether. We launched from recipe to recipe without the challenge level rising in a congruous way, except perhaps for the number of phases that each preparation requires, without adding different gameplay elements, and without a clear goal to achieve, apart from the still very weak and generous system of points and medals. All of this cannot be justified with the market segment argument: because, we ask ourselves, a child or a casual gamer doesn't have the right, for example, to some managerial element which could easily be inserted in a similar context, to a sketch of history, in short, to something that links all the culinary adventures together and gives a basic structure to the whole? The point is that the previous episodes also had the same lackluster coherence, and therefore the doubt arises that the programmers have done nothing but reiterate in a slightly different way what has already been seen in the past. It is true that there are four other modes full of mini-games to be unlocked gradually: it is a question of helping Mama in various activities, domestic, in the garden, and in the shop, but even here, where even more difficulty is recognized, they are not many leaps forward in variety and gameplay. Slightly different is ~Let's study!~, this too a collection of minigames but more tending towards Nintendo's Brain Training, and to remember the presence of the Dojo, which only offers us some phases of the recipes but with a very strict time limit, and a challenge mode in local multiplayer for two players with a single card: although they are also limited, they certainly present a greater interest for the more experienced users. Completing the various recipes also gives us the possibility to customize Mama's kitchen, which we see constantly on the upper screen, with different furnishings, furnishing elements, colors and so on. This brings us directly to the graphics issue: nothing that could not have been done on Nintendo DS too, confirming the suspicion of a not excessive effort in renewing the series, but the ingredients and dishes on the lower screen are well rendered, while on the other screen dominates as we said Mama always happy (in 3D, but with very few animations) in her glittering and cheerful work environment. The sound is good, with nice well-composed jingles, discreet effects and a spoken word, in Italian, which is not very rich but ringing and crystalline.", "date": "2015-03-09", "grade": "6.0"}
