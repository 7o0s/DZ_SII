{"name": "Facciamo la conta", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/92679-bodycount-facciamo-la-conta.html", "text": "Tested version: Xbox 360Black arrived on the market when the old generation of consoles was by then quite mature, yet it was able to distinguish itself for numerous characteristics, starting from the technical realization to get to the particular interaction with the scenarios that allowed to destroy (albeit in very selectively) elements of the setting in a blaze of bullets and explosions. It was 2006 and Half-Life 2 had already shifted attention to undoubtedly superior physics management, but everyone liked the combination of arcade elements, varied scenery and assorted destruction and Black won his place of honor between Xbox and PlayStation 2 games at the end of the race, continuing to sell copies on the latter console with a truly impressive longevity. Strange therefore - considering the typical mechanics of this industry - that no one has bothered to develop a sequel. Personnel changes, licensing issues and years away have hidden such a sequel in this Codemasters Bodycount, conceived by the very Stuart Black who had created the video game - strange case - of its namesake, a legacy that has made it particularly attractive to eyes of many, together with the promises of action and innovation that he has brought with him since his first appearances. If it is true that people apparently continue to have a desire for FPS, it is equally known how the field has become increasingly selective, rallying around those two or three franchises that have millionaire budgets and move impressive numbers, therefore the challenge for Bodycount is double, having to prove to be a good game and possibly a valid alternative to the war shooters that are raging. One thing cannot be disputed: the Codemasters game has its own specific character, which responds with the original arcade spirit of the FPS to the often pompous, rampant realism of many current productions. Powerful guns and easy explosions, this is the ancient recipe that the developers wanted to recover to give a particular cut to the game in question. Certainly the scarcity that characterizes the playful offer, in terms of hours of play and ways in which to try their hand, however represent hardly forgivable weak points. The body count The story is almost absurd but in its simplicity it helps to recall the freshness of the action games of the past, which in defiance of the claims of realism sought pretexts to justify epic actions to say the least. So here we are in the role of a sort of special agent sent alone around the world against entire armies, armed with 2 guns (one primary and one secondary chosen from a not too extensive collection of rifles, machine guns and pistols, as well as to hand grenades and mines) as simple as they are functional and with special abilities to be used at the right moments. The story is a bizarre construction of science fiction, espionage and assorted conspiracies involving strange paramilitary groups with rather naive names such as ~Network~, ~Militia~ and ~Target~, but what matters on the other hand is the pretext for being launched in a particular territory to sow bullets and destruction at 360 degrees. In practice, from an infiltration within an African area ravaged by internal warfare, in search of clues about what the local warlords are plotting, the existence of a mysterious corporation emerges engaged in scientific and military research with obscure purposes and from there starts a crescendo of the plot which is actually not too exciting, but certainly enjoyable with a light heart. The structure of the game goes back to the roots of the genre, essentially proposing a continuous series of furious fights in which the speed of pulling the trigger and the ability to fire are fundamental to advance. It's a constant feast of explosions, fragments of scenery blowing up and glowing globes (the intel bonuses) spreading around, something you don't often see in today's FPSs and which in its crashing simplicity manages to entertain immediately even those who are not really fond of the genre. Selective destruction Bodycount bases the peculiarities of its combat system on two main characteristics: the use of special abilities and the possibility of destroying part of the scenario. There are four skills, all subject to further evolution which also determines some important variations, continuing in the game. The ~adrenaline~ is able to increase the resistance of the protagonist, the ~piercing shots~ increase the damage caused by the bullets, a particular radar allows us to detect enemies and subsequently evolves into a ~zone~ weapon and finally the air strike, call backbile on areas of the battlefield of your choice. The use of the skills depends on the loading of a special bar placed at the corner of the screen, which is filled by collecting the colored ~intel~ bonuses that the killed enemies scatter on the scenario, which also determines a further stylistic feature peculiar to the game , in stark contrast to the more realistic FPS. The bar runs out quickly and requires several eliminations to be able to recharge, therefore it is advisable to carefully dose the use of special skills, whose support however becomes indispensable as the levels progress. The other particular element of the Codemasters title is the interaction with the scenarios, a direct legacy of the old Black who made this his great strength. To tell the truth, as well as at the time, it is still a rather limited interaction, but still well integrated into the fabric of the game. The principle is very simple: it is possible to destroy a large number of elements on the screen with the exception of some resistant materials that are immune to bullets and explosions, such as metals and reinforced concrete, which only splinter without destroying themselves. This expedient determines a change in the cover system, as many elements can be easily destroyed, thus forcing both the player and the enemies to often change their position and defensive attitude, as well as possibly opening passages or ~windows~ from which hit, but does not arrive at a substantial modification of the scenarios at the player's will. A demolition therefore a bit of a facade, but which certainly contributes to expanding the destructive sensation during the fight. Few possibilities It is clear how the game is structured by taking the Campaign as the fulcrum of the action, this being certainly the most structured and deepest mode among those available, which however are not many. It is a pity, therefore, that this Campaign cannot be tackled in cooperative multiplayer (neither online nor offline with split screen), and that it does not last long either, being completed in about 6 hours of play. Another problem is the lack of variety of situations in which we find ourselves during the game: faithful here too to the arcade tradition of the FPS, there are no digressions on the subject and we will always and in any case find ourselves engaged in firing on enemies using two sidearms chosen from the arsenal available, never committing to anything other than the need to press buttons to activate doors or blow up certain devices to continue. It is probable that the somewhat complex genesis of the Codemasters title, which evidently went through various planning phases including the abandonment of a couple of leading figures from the responsible team, has left aside various boundary elements as well as reduced the construction of the story and consequently of the game-experience. In addition to the Campaign, the other options are somewhat limited and include multiplayer, including free-for-all or team deathmatches and a cooperative mode that essentially follows the Gears of War Horde applicable to 4 different scenarios and finally the ~Bodycount~ mode, in which we find ourselves facing the various levels that make up the story in a detached way, trying to set new records in terms of bodycount, in fact, or in the amount of killings. Xbox 360 goals Bodycount contains 41 targets for a total of 1000 points. Most of these are scattered throughout the Campaign and are obtained by progressing through the levels or by achieving certain performances such as killing a certain amount of enemies with a particular type of special shot or something like that. The game is not sparing in the distribution of achievements and even a first quick pass through the entire Campaign can lead to the collection of well over half of the available objectives, even non-perfectionists will be satisfied. Strange places The appearance of Bodycount helps to characterize it as a particular game, in part different from many competitors as it is linked to an aesthetic less bent on realism and more imaginative. Wandering through the colorful African slums, in the dark and tangled Chinese alleys or inside the shiny and alien structures of the Nexus bases, rather distant games such as Perfect Dark or GoldenEye come to mind, although the action here is more linked to the current FPS standard. The decision to take the most imaginative route has freed the developers from the need to propose necessarily realistic scenarios, presenting instead a particularly colorful and almost caricatured alternative reality in some cases, a middle ground that is somewhat reminiscent ofthe settlement undertaken by Splash Damage with Brink. The graphics engine is the famous Codemasters Ego Engine, which so far has performed very well on the British company's racing games but which has had little opportunity to indulge itself in other genres, still managing to show itself solid and reliable amidst the chaos of explosions and destruction which in many cases fills the screen in a truly spectacular way between shattering glass and (partially) collapsing walls. The construction of the levels, which the developers have presented as carefully planned, has led to somewhat discontinuous results, alternating some truly remarkable situations in terms of quantity of enemies and scenario structures, with wide-ranging field of vision and particular scenography with others levels in which the repetition of the background elements is evident, with some sections that almost seem to represent a sort of unwanted backtracking. In general, however, the construction of the ~sandbox~-style game zones is appreciable, with the possibility of following different paths to reach the objective, thus developing different approaches to the battle, even if it will be difficult for the game to be able to arouse some feeling of wonder or visual satisfaction in keeping with the times. The audio accompaniment is completely localized in good Italian (dialogues and texts), characterized by ~007~ style music and sound effects that seem designed to increase the sense of satisfaction in fanning bullets and triggering explosions, typical of the arcade shooter.", "date": "2011-08-31", "grade": "6.0"}
