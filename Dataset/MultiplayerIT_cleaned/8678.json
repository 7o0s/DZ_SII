{"name": "Lost Ark", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lost-ark-recensione.html", "text": "Long awaited in its western version, Lost Ark is the hit of the moment. Perhaps even too much: following the release on Steam in free-to-play format, the servers recorded kilometric queues, fomented by an advertising hype that was entrusted above all to the most popular streamers of Twitch and company. Hard to believe that Amazon Game Studios, which distributed the game, didn't know the risks of this word of mouth, especially after what happened with New World and, more recently, with the Shadowbringers expansion of Final Fantasy XIV. The crisis, especially on the European side, continues to raise enormous controversies, but it is important to clarify that we have not taken these inefficiencies into account in our evaluation of Lost Ark. Mind you, we have a lot to say about the whole thing, and also about the simple fact that you have to queue for hours to play a video game, but it would be unfair to penalize Smilegate's work in this sense. Also because, once connected, everything runs smoothly and the servers hold up the massive load of players quite well. In the more than one hundred hours that we have dedicated to Lost Ark, in these two weeks, we have only encountered some sporadic problems with the matchmaking and with the shop, but we have ignored the latter, to say the least, precisely to understand if the new MMO manages to stand on his feet without forcing players to swipe their credit card. You just have to read our review of Lost Ark to find out if it deserves all the success it is having these days. A single player MMO Lost Ark, some views are truly breathtaking Lost Ark is a multiplayer RPG, yet we played almost everything as a single player. Although it is possible to group easily, complete missions even at a great distance on the same map and enter the various dungeons together with three players at a time, the Smilegate title lends itself perfectly to solitary progression thanks to an ingenious calibration of the difficulty. The important thing is to better frame the genre it belongs to. Often mistaken for a Diablo or a Path of Exile, with which it essentially shares the isometric view and the default point and click control system, Lost Ark is unsuspectingly closer to both Final Fantasy XIV in philosophy than in progression. The very long main story, divided into primary and secondary missions, is punctuated through dialogues and cinematics that tell very well an all in all trivial story that sees us looking for seven legendary artifacts to seal a demon and his posse. The narrative of Lost Ark tries to have the same ambitions as the fourteenth Final Fantasy, surrounding our alter ego with discreetly characterized supporting actors - such as Father Armen, Prince Thirain or the mysterious Beatrice - who are the real protagonists of the most important turning points in the plot, often told through cinematics fully dubbed and subtitled in English. All in all, the story works and is sufficiently intriguing, but it rarely takes off - even if there are some genuinely unexpected moments - and it certainly does not represent the strong point of Lost Ark. At times, however, it manages to be truly engaging thanks to a skilful play of choreography and dynamic shots that mark the most exciting moments of the adventure. Continuing towards the maximum level and even beyond - the campaign is truly very long! - however, a kind of dissonance is found in the narrative. The search for the seven Arks will take us around the world of Arkesia, opening storylines that are completely different from each other, in tones and atmospheres, which don't always work and sometimes last even longer than necessary. Lost Ark, Arthetine's storyline feels like a bizarre cross between Fallout and Xenoblade Between quotes from The Legend of Zelda, ~tournament arc~ worthy of a shonen manga and cyberpunk excursions, Lost Ark may not be a triumph of originality - let's say that in some circumstances it verges on plagiarism - but it is certainly one of the most varied titles in circulation. The merit is also of a generally commendable artistic direction, if we exclude the androgynous character design so dear to Koreans. The care that Smilegate has placed in the processing of scenarios, animations, costumes and 3D models does not make you regret the most performing graphics engines. Lost Ark is a technically old game, but it does its job well and in certain moments it really leaves you speechless. It is above all an immense title, so much as to be excessive. The campaign gradually unlocks more and more features, and up to a certain point it does so gradually, explaining to the player, through special tutorial missions, how to useof the most disparate mechanics, from the collection of natural resources to the customization of the Stronghold - a kind of ~housing~ - passing through a real navigation system that opens the door to the second part of the campaign and to an ocean, literally, of content. Lost Ark, the Stronghold is our customizable island Smilegate has perhaps put too much meat on the fire, but we must always remember that Lost Ark is not a ~new~ game: it was released in Korea more than two years ago, and our version already includes several updates that the original client has seen over the course of several months. For example, we still lack several classes such as the Arcana or the Destroyer, but already Lost Ark guarantees an avalanche of content and possibilities to a very wide audience, ranging from the casual player to the most tenacious completionist. Only the collectibles, between panoramas to discover, hundreds of Mokoko Seed to collect, illustrated cards, secret storylines and so on, can fill a player's days without forcing him to group up or depend on others to see most of the contents. The pleasure of combat Lost Ark, there are tons of boss fights inside and outside the dungeons The default control system - mouse plus keyboard, but a normal controller can be configured - isn't exactly the most immediate in the world, but after a few hours you get used to it and you end up appreciating the precision that the ~point and click~ formula guarantees during fights, especially when facing bosses who project the range of their attacks before executing them (a system commonly referred to as a ~telegraph~). In reality, Lost Ark is not a particularly demanding game on this front, and the campaign can be tackled with serenity: players can enter the mandatory dungeons alone - or in a group, up to four members - and choose between two difficulties that change the quality of the rewards, but the difference in terms of complexity is marginal and most of the enemies are defeated with a few hits. As you reach the higher levels, you also face more complex battles that require more careful management of movements and skills, but it is only in the endgame - which we will return to later - that the combat system really explodes. Lost Ark, Tripod System allows for a huge variety of builds The campaign is accessible and intuitive precisely because it wants to give the player the freedom to experiment with different builds, using the so-called Tripod system that allows you to assign the Skill Points earned at each level up to change the skills learned at any time. It is only surprising that it is not very combat-oriented, but a value of Lost Ark lies precisely in the immediacy of the main and secondary missions, which certainly do not revolutionize the genre - they are even simple fetch quests: talk, collect, kill - but they weigh zero on progression and they complete very quickly. Smilegate has cleverly and thoughtfully distributed them across the maps, moving the player from one objective to another as it leads them to the next scenario. The enemies that block our way go down in a few seconds and therefore guarantee that feeling of power which, coupled with the visual spectacularity of attacks and spells, satisfies not only the eye, but also the ego. The various classes are all different but manage to be perfectly autonomous in the economy of solo and group gameplay. Some builds lend themselves better to team play - in particular those of the Paladin, the Bard and the Gunlancer - but in general Lost Ark, which again distances itself from Diablo also in terms of gameplay, is more reminiscent of Guild Wars 2 than the other MMOs out there. Healing depends almost entirely on passive and consumable bonuses, so the combat system shifts the balance on autonomy, reactivity and improvisation. Each class returns a unique feeling thanks to a skilful diversification of skillsets, but if in PvE everything works almost perfectly, in PvP we must report a clear imbalance in favor of crowd control which makes the experience quite frustrating. However, the clashes between the players remain a secondary activity, and although there is a lot of content in this sense even for lovers of competition, Lost Ark is still a mainly PvE game. Lost Ark, Engravings are reminiscent of Monster Hunter abilities Things get complicated when you approach the level cap and multiple features begin to intertwine which initially do not seem to affect progression too much, but which in the end guarantee great freedom of experimentation and gameplay. Engravings, for example, are bopassive nus that recall those in Monster Hunter armor and orient the specializations of individual builds towards more aggressive or defensive performances. In the long run, the player finds himself navigating among many statistics and dynamics: the bonuses offered by the combinations of the illustrated cards, the aforementioned Engravings, gems and stones, Awakening skills and so on. It's nice that Lost Ark allows for all this scope for experimentation, but sadly the 'Korean' nature of the game comes through in the less-than-intuitive way in which Smilegate has actually mixed these systems together. Each of them carries a rather cumbersome baggage of menus, prerequisites and interactions that require a lot of attention, and perhaps a dive into the web in search of guides and advice that help save time and resources, especially once the endgame is reached. The test bed of the endgame Lost Ark, some dungeons are truly spectacular It is generally said that an MMO really begins only after reaching the maximum level because, being games in the making, it is at that point that the developer concentrates all his creative force to hook the players. In the case of Lost Ark this happens even before time, because the so-called endgame really begins after reaching the city of Vern, i.e. shortly after having discarded level 50 and long before having delivered the last mission of the campaign. At that moment the game fills us with tutorials, presenting us with a load of content to be faced daily to improve the character and his equipment. By doing so, new content and new increasingly difficult challenges are progressively unlocked which can impose the formation of teams - through automatic and non-automatic matchmaking - and guarantee the best loots in the game. It's a smart system that apparently respects the player's time with cooldown mechanics and good initial autonomy. Lost Ark, upgrading equipment unlocks new endgame content The progression revolves around the so-called ~honing~, that is, the improvement of the class equipment that is easily recovered in the Chaos Dungeons, practically the starting point of the climb. Once this content has been unlocked, within literally five minutes you will find yourself with a complete set that we will be able to upgrade from a special blacksmith by consuming various resources. Once you reach a new threshold in the average level of equipment, you unlock new content and difficulty levels where you can find new resources. It's a loop that works, even if to reach the higher levels, and therefore unlock the more daring content, you need a bit of luck and an ounce of patience. The progression system, appropriately divided into Tiers, is not particularly punitive because the game offers a plethora of contents, challenges and activities with which it is possible to recover resources, currencies and materials without falling into the inherent repetitiveness of the genre. Lost Ark, Guardian Raids are fun mythological bosses to fight alone or in groups The only problem is, once again, the free to play nature that pushes the spasmodic micromanagement of an infinite number of different currencies. If during the progression this weight is only partially felt, when it reaches the endgame it becomes overwhelming, not to say unmanageable. There are way too many resources and currencies that need to be accounted for in order to enjoy everything Lost Ark has to offer. In the long run, the different features tend to intertwine deeply, and players who intend to see everything, absolutely everything, will have to arm themselves with a lot of patience and plan their days accordingly: in these circumstances, Lost Ark becomes an MMO capable of engaging practically every minute of free time. In this sense, the shop meets us with the advantages it offers for a fee. Let us be very clear: nothing the Smilegate shop sells in the game grants you a clear privilege over other players. Lost Ark is not a ~pay to win~ title, in short. In addition to mounts, pets and various cosmetic items, the shop offers more or less shortcuts that save time, for example by instantly completing daily missions. The so-called Crystalline Aura, considered ~essential~ on the appropriate shop page, is not really essential: we have reached the endgame and progressed without feeling the slightest need.", "date": "2022-02-25", "grade": "8.5"}
