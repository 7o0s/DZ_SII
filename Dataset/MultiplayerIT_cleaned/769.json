Hero 2 shows how all these basic features have remained perfectly intact even in the new chapter. All too much, considering that there are very few real novelties in this second chapter, beyond a clear technical evolution and some content additions. As in the first chapter, also in this case it is essentially a question of drawing trajectories with the finger on the touch screen to carry out actions or execute set pieces, to then see the situation unfold on the playing field based on the precision with which we have built the path of the ball. It is a fascinating solution because on the one hand it gives considerable elegance to the use of the tactile display, normally considered above all a ball and chain in sports games of this type, while on the other it presents a gameplay that is truly different from the usual and built specifically for mobile devices . Score! Hero 2 features the progression of a footballer from youth academy to professional football The main problem is that, in fact, it presents practically nothing new compared to the previous chapter, and to be honest, few new ones even compared to the old Score! Classic Goals, which came out about ten years ago now, but having now established its legacy in the mobile sector, it is also right that it continues on that path. In fact, the main innovations concern a new aspect in terms of graphics, particularly well done for this round and in step with the times, and a new structure that also includes elements that we could define as ~narrative~, given that it follows the evolution of a footballer from his first professional experiences to international successes. All by exploiting certain licenses of European football and always focusing the action on the principle of ~brush strokes~ with which to baste the actions on the field, in a free-to-play dynamic that provides for a certain amount of attempts to score before imposing the classic forced breaks given by the exhaustion of energy between one game and another. Brushstroke football In case you haven't tried the previous ones, here's how Score gameplay works! Hero 2: A soccer match is staged in which events are largely pre-set, save for a few specific situations where the action stops and it's player's time. With the view behind the ball carrier's back, we have to draw the trajectory for the ball to follow with our finger, so that it somehow reaches the goal. In some cases it is simply a question of shooting on goal, obviously trying to execute ballistic shots that are as difficult as possible to intercept and parry, while in other cases it is necessary to set up an action starting from the previous steps. What's particularly interesting about Score! Hero 2, as well as in the previous chapter, is that there is a minimum degree of freedom left to the player's initiative: obviously the situation is pre-set in terms of the position of opponents, teammates and goalkeeper, which greatly restricts the possibilities for development of the action, but it is possible to reach slightly different conditions in terms of assists and finishing on goal. Score! Hero 2 presents various game actions to be ~completed~ best by drawing the trajectories The conclusion must still be the goal and the failure of the goal requires the repetition of the action until this condition is met, which represents the most challenging element in the game. It is necessary to have a good sensitivity and draw the trajectories to the millimeter, because arriving at the shot from an unbalanced position can make it impossible to score, also given the impressive reactivity of the goalkeepers. Having to repeat all the actions of a game from the beginning to each mistake also increases the level of challenge but also a certain frustration that can emerge due to the energy system. The amount of attempts is in fact represented by an energy bar that runs out with each test and recharges over time, so once the hearts available have been used up, it is necessary to interrupt the game or pay for the classic micro-transaction to start again immediately. Obviously the longer you wait, the more you refill the bar, which favors a use in small doses, to tell the truth rather congruous with the type of game in question. In-app purchases and advertising are obviously well present as this is a free-to-play game, but to tell the truth they don't unbalance the experience: you need to pay the in-game currency (possibly purchasable withreal money) to customize the protagonist and to be able to continue between one attempt and another, but never bumps into real insurmountable paywalls. The game mode is a sort of story that leads us to progress between different games ( living only a few clips), following the evolution of the protagonist and his club from the youth team to the first team and beyond. It is a structure made up of real levels, given that the matches are only contexts in which the various tests to be faced are inserted, each with secondary objectives whose achievement determines an overall score different from one to three stars.", "date": "2021-05-26", "grade": "7.0"}
