Driving Emotion Type-S is the new driving simulation produced by Squaresoft, which hasn't dedicated itself to this genre since the days of Super Nintendo. A game capable of making us feel the emotions, the pleasure that only driving a real racing car can give us, hence the idea that led to the creation of this interesting title. If these are the premises, why not launch a grand challenge to Gran Turismo 3? 44 luxurious and very sporty cars, 10 tracks around the world, a very simulative driving style... it seems that there is everything needed to make Driving Emotion Type-S a great title. It's serious Driving Emotion Type-S initially may seem like a title that is difficult for everyone to access, due to the considerable difficulty. But believe me, it's the most rewarding driving simulation I've experienced since GT2. You will have to face the game as a challenge to your abilities, interpret every single curve, predict the reaction of the vehicle to your commands. The spectacular views, especially the one from the cockpit, will enhance your performance making you savor that sense of satisfaction I mentioned earlier. It's serious Before starting, we will have to pay a visit to our large race that hosts, at least initially 4 car models including Honda Civic and Toyota Celica prove to be the best solutions to start the game. We just have to adjust the fundamental settings such as gears, shock absorbers, brakes and choose the color of the bodywork and the type of rims to mount, being able to scroll through numerous variations. Having done this, it is essential to apply a substantial correction of the adjustment of the analog commands in such a way as to be able to obtain a worthy control of the vehicle. Finally we can jump on the track, being able to choose between 4 circuits at the beginning: West Coast, very fast city course; Provence, characterized by very challenging curves; Suzuka, the famous formula one circuit; Urban Highway, a spectacular nocturnal setting between skyscrapers and dazzling lights. By winning the numerous races scheduled, divided into 4 different categories, we will be able to unlock all the remaining tracks and the numerous super cars in the game. Ferrari, Porsche, BMW, Alfa Romeo, Toyota, Subaru, Nissan, Honda, Mazda, Acura, Mitsubishi... nobody is missing. Whoever lasts it, wins it Having chosen our favorite car, we can finally demonstrate our skills. Control of the vehicle is immediately very difficult, and especially at the start it will often happen to skid left and right without being able to keep up with your opponents. The less experienced will feel frustrated by the considerable difficulty of the game and could make the decision to abandon Driving Emotion to switch to a less demanding game like Ridge Racer V. The diehards, the real drivers, will instead take up the challenge and after the first disappointing races will be able gradually achieve satisfactory results, thanks to the greater confidence with the driving system that they will gradually obtain. You will then realize that the control of the vehicle does not differ much from that of Gran Turismo 2. Damn aliasing... The car models are very detailed and realistic, thanks also to the 2000-3000 polygons used to make each of them. Had it not been for the persistent problems related to aliasing we would have been faced with one of the best implementations of the emotion engine. To mitigate the famous jaggies, extensive use has been made of an annoying blur effect which ~gives~ a foggy appearance to all the elements that appear on the horizon. However, the details of the landscape are remarkable. Trees, buildings and bridges do their part well while not excelling in terms of image sharpness. The music of the game does not stand out particularly for its originality and variety but one cannot fail to give credit to the realistic noise of the engines. A choice of the heart In conclusion I believe that Driving Emotion Type-S is the best you can find while waiting for Gran Turismo 3. Almost 50 car models, 10 tracks and a complex but rewarding driving system cannot go unnoticed in the eyes of those who live on bread and engines. Also, by not placing too much emphasis on the jaggies, one can be more than satisfied with the look of the game as well. But if you're looking for immediate fun, I suggest you aim for less demanding titles. Ridge Racer V, Midnight Club, Top Gear Dare Devil.... you'll be spoiled for choicechoice. pros: Good graphics Real Ferrari, Porsche simulation... cons: Not for everyone Aliasing Not exciting music An important page in the history of video games is certainly the one written by Squaresoft. How many emotions, how many wonderful adventures we have experienced thanks to the heroes of Final Fantasy, the legendary role-playing game that has kept us company for over a decade. In a competitive and ruthless world like that of videogames, however, you need to know how to evolve and undertake new businesses, leaving aside any sentimentality. Squaresoft, not satisfied with past successes, has understood the lesson by producing two completely new titles, completely detached from tradition and able to challenge the giants of the sector. The first, as you all know, is The Bouncer, while the review you are reading is dedicated to the second.", "date": "2001-02-19", "grade": null}
