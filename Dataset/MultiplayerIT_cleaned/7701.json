The game from Curve Studios actually came out in 2011, it's called Stealth Bastard and it's a free downloadable game for Windows that immediately met with some success thanks to the macabre humor of its clever puzzles. It then returned as Stealth Bastard Deluxe: Tactical Espionage Arsehole and a whole bunch more levels on Steam a year later. In early 2013, the software was ported to Linux and OS X complete with The Teleporter Chambers expansion, and then integrated into Humble Bundle 6 for Android. Finally, it lands on PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 3 with a new title, which you can read further on. A decidedly hectic path, and the question at this point is only one: how are these poor clones doing on Sony consoles? One, none and one hundred thousand It could have been worse, thanks. Clone number two hundred and fifty-seven said so, but we had asked clone number two hundred and fifty-six the question before he turned into a clot of blood on the wall. Luckily, we only had to wait half a second or so for the dead clone to be replaced by a live one. After that, that too died. And then the next one, and then another and another. Then we finished that bloody level too. In short, welcome to PTi Industries, where the efficiency of the security systems is tested directly in the field, by sending clones to slaughter: all the same, short and with a paunch, armed only with a pair of goggles that mimic those of Sam Fisher. You, the players, control one of the clones, and your goal is to get out of the mortal room on duty. To do this, you have to act on a terminal and then reach the door that has opened: easier said than done, of course, given that the path is littered with obstacles, traps and heavily armed defense drones. Stealth Inc is a platformer that is also a puzzle-game with a splash of stealth mechanics that are so reminiscent of Metal Gear Solid, and after all the subtitle of its previous incarnation - Tactical Espionage Arsehole - leaves no doubt about the source of inspiration . Yet it is a title with great personality, immediate and simple to play: there is a key to crouch, one to jump and one to interact with the environment, and on these three simple mechanics Curve Studios has designed around eighty levels more complicated and ingenious. You can almost breathe the air of an old-fashioned arcade, also because the regeneration of our just slain clone is truly instantaneous: each level is full of checkpoints positioned with a fair amount of attention. Curve Studios wants to bend you, not force you to surrender. There's no shortage of moments of frustration, indeed Stealth Inc is full of them: you need to have nerves of steel to pass the more advanced levels, and the tutorial is also quite short since each level is often a separate tutorial. PSVita trophies There are two sets of Trophies, one for the standard game and the other for the DLC pack: thirteen and four trophies respectively, for a total of thirteen bronze, four silver and two gold. Most are unlocked by completing the various levels, but there are some that are really tough, such as the one that requires you to complete an entire level without ever skipping. Jigsaw is an amateur Stealth Inc is a small triumph of level design because each level has something new to say, a new trap or a combination of pitfalls that we will have to overcome using all the techniques learned previously or discovering brand new ones. This feature is not always an advantage, however, because often the solution to the current puzzle is one and only one, and this means that until you understand what the developers had in mind, you continue to die and die, try and try again, until you don't get the right combination of interactions or movements right. This in a certain sense reduces the significance of the score obtained at the end of each level, and which could be flaunted on the appropriate leaderboard, were it not that once the solution to the puzzle has been learned - perhaps by reading some guides - all it takes is a little practice to break records. Very little helps us in the game, on the other hand, apart from the writings of a mysterious observer who appear regularly on the walls, often mocking us for our disastrous performances and more rarely giving us some clues on how to deal with the current puzzle. Our clone's glasses also come in handy, which provide a very important visual clue: the color of the lenses, in fact, indicates how hidden we are from the eyes of the enemies. Our level of ~furivity~ is based on your position within the shadows in the room, because you only need to expose the tip of your nose while a drone flies nearby to be reduced to a pulp. As a result, in many puzzles you need very precise movements and possible movement of blocks and platforms to modify the cones of shadow in our favor.Things get even more complicated when the special equipment that gives our clone particular ~powers~ comes into play, such as the one that allows you to temporarily generate an extra shadow in a point From this point of view, Stealth Inc certainly does not lack variety, which is why we would have been much happier if the level editor had allowed us to share our creations with other players: as it is, it is an exercise in sadism a bit an end in itself. Stealth Inc. puts a strain on the player's nerves, but this makes every win more satisfying", "date": "2013-07-29", "grade": "8.0"}
