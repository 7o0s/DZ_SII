If you remember, last November the French house had published on the App Store a product very similar to this, also based on a license, or The Oregon Trail: Pioneers of America. The differences between the two games are actually minimal: in both our goal is to create and manage a village, collect what is produced by its inhabitants in terms of food and money, then expand the territory and so on, up to build a large and rich community. In the case of Ice Age, the standard action is interspersed with some nice minigames and the possibility of watching short films with the adventures of the unfortunate squirrel Scrat, always intent on conquering and protecting his beloved acorn, despite the adversities. From this point of view, the value of the license is certainly high and the videos are enjoyed with pleasure, so the hope is that they will be renewed often. In terms of pure gameplay, the approach to the genre is classic: the various Sid, Manny, Diego and Ellie move around the village and offer us new tasks to complete from time to time, without ever leaving us with hands in hand. The variety of missions, however, is unfortunately scarce, and in most cases our task simply consists in opening the inventory and spending part of our virtual money to buy a specific animal species, place its home on the map and then provide upon completion of the family. Create family, collect coin Carrying out an operation like the one just described turns out to be quite simple and involves a few taps on the touch screen: touch the character who entrusts us with the mission to check the details of the assignment, then open the inventory and buy the necessary . The positioning of each new animal species on the map is done by dragging, after which you have to touch the screen in the same point for further interactions: provide the animal with a mate and crown their dream of love with one or more puppies, whose eggs go moreover hatched ~by hand~, through a short minigame. Each family contributes to the village economy through the automatic production of food and coins; and as in any title belonging to the genre of casual management for iPhone and iPad, we must collect these objects to replenish the coffers and be able to continue with new tasks, as well as with the expansion of the territory. At certain times it is possible to take a break from this routine and watch a video in the local ~cinema~, or access some nice minigames starring the squirrel Scrat, or even compare your city with that of our friends on Facebook. Beyond the first minutes, in which you become familiar with the mechanics and the interface, the action proposed by Ice Age: The Village therefore turns out to be quite repetitive, the missions that the characters propose to us must be completed following similar dynamics between them and at a certain point the stocks of money will run out, forcing us to be patient to continue the game or to put our hands on our wallets. The technical sector appears very well done, even if the touch controls on the iPhone often don't work as they should and force us to multiple touches to select the desired unit, especially if it is in the immediate vicinity of another interactable point.", "date": "2012-05-07", "grade": "6.5"}
