{"name": "Samurai Warriors 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/samurai-warriors-2-recensione.html", "text": "The East is in fashion. It is useless to deny it. By now, if you don't love something oriental you are almost outcasts. You have to read Japanese comics, strictly backwards. You have to love the katana and the Japanese fighting style, as if 1200 years of European fencing had never existed. Likewise, it must absolutely be stated that Eastern philosophy is much superior to Western philosophy and that the Japanese are the ones who have truly understood how the world works. A fine hypocrisy, considering that for centuries we have exploited the East, from India onwards, like any portion of the colonial empires of the European powers. But after all the Romans did the same with the Greeks, first they conquered them, then they loved them. And it is only in this Japanese mania that we find the reason why a product from two years ago, which was considered at times sufficient and at times openly disappointing already on its original console, PlayStation 2, is so belatedly transported to PC, because frankly such a product was not felt the need at all. Samurai Warriors 2 will transport the player to late medieval Japan, taking into consideration that historical period marked by bloody civil wars which eventually brought stability to the empire and a certain reconciliation between the lords of the various provinces. Putting yourself in the shoes of eight characters (but there are 16 others that can be unlocked) on whose historical fidelity all sorts of doubts can be revealed, you will go through the most important battles (that actually occurred) of this delicate phase of Japanese history, leading each leader to conquer of his own slice of the pages in the history books, developing a different set of missions for each one. Others are added to the ~historical~ mode, such as the ~survive mode~, in which, as you can imagine from the name, you have to survive to the death to the assaults of the enemy (style Thermopylae), the cooperative and the direct confrontation between the characters, in the style of console fighting games. Before even starting the analysis of the product it is necessary to launch a first note on the conversion itself: the source code has simply been changed to adapt it to the PC; probably with an emulator many users could play the original console and would not find any difference with the ~official~ version for the Windows platform. The commands therefore turn out to be complex and almost unmanageable on a keyboard from the first approach, and the use of a good gamepad is recommended, if not mandatory. With that said, let's proceed. Among the flowers the cherry tree, among the men the warrior Do you remember a title from a few years ago called Joan Of Arc, Wars and Warriors? In this good title you took command of the maiden of Orlean and other famous French generals and guided them in large battlefields to massacre hordes of poor English and Burgundian soldiers, and at each level the character used gained experience points, combos and armaments. Samurai Warriors 2 is conceptually identical: the player will move his alter ego in immense valleys complete with castles, walls, tents and forests, surrounded by dozens of allied soldiers and hundreds of enemies, often reaching a rather high number of models on the screen by the standards PC gamers are used to. In the midst of all this, pressing a single key will generate the only basic attack available to the character who, massacring poor infantrymen with simple blows, will charge an energy bar which will allow, through the random repetition of certain key combinations, the execution of combos that can cause area damage, multiple attacks against multiple opponents, a single particularly powerful shot and last but not least a sort of bullet time during which it will be possible to direct attacks against different enemies. These will range from simple soldiers to spearmen, troops with shields, halberdiers, archers and the inevitable commanding officers, a sort of end-of-level boss with whom to launch into terrible duels to the death. The basic idea would seem fun, but it's a pity that it has to collide with one of the worst artificial intelligences in videogame history. The enemies are there, but they don't fight. They appear on the screen... dozens, hundreds of soldiers, but then they stand still. They are waiting to be killed. They don't attack, they don't parry, they don't circle, they don't do anything. They look at the player and get slaughtered like calves, giving no real sense of challenge. What's worse, allies do the same too, and often the battle that should theoretically take place around the main character results in dozens of men staring at each other blankly, some (the enemies) waiting to be told.ere reached by some blow. Every now and then the boss appears in the midst of this very high number of mannequins. Simply, a model with a larger health bar. He will try some sporadic attacks that could affect the hitherto ignored vital energy bar, but he will never be able to parry a blow that is one, easily becoming history. Therefore, the enormous variety of scenarios, battles and characters is of little use, if the whole game turns into a frenetic pressing of the ~A~ key of the pad until nothing animated remains around us, and being often the objective is to eliminate all enemy officers, you will happen to see your character reach the incredible number of 1200, even 2000 kills per level, without ever having really risked dying (increasing the difficulty level does not make the enemies more aggressive, it simply takes away more energy to their sporadic attacks). Of course, the combos are visually interesting and the feeling of omnipotence is almost total, however these two small qualities are not enough to raise the fate of a gameplay that turns out to be boring and not very involving, thus obtaining the result of making the enormous work useless for give variety to characters and battles, since already in the third fight you risk being caught by the repetitiveness of the action. I will die killed by the sword. Mine, or that of the enemies. Speaking of a product not only from two years ago, but also developed on an older generation platform, one certainly cannot expect great graphic results. Furthermore, if the transition between one console and another does not go through some revisions, one cannot even hope for some improvement. Samurai Warriors 2 arrived identical to how it was born, with its flat and repetitive battlefields, the bare and grainy internal environments, the three-dimensional models differentiated only by the skins, however ugly and with approximate textures: the characters are simply all the same, same uniform, same face, so much so that sometimes it seems to be in the middle of the attack of the clones rather than in medieval Japan. Of course, the generals each have a distinct physical and somatic characterization, but they are also based on identical three-dimensional models to which the skin is then applied. Details such as lip movement are missing and the animations are quite wooden. The soundtrack, based on the screams of the enemies, on a few (also evocative) endlessly repeated musical themes and on a recitation of the dialogues ~with the tone of someone ordering a pizza~ as John McClane (Bruce Willis in Die Hard) would say, therefore absolutely insufficient, it is a tasteless salt on a dish that would need much more than the seasoning to be digestible. Comment Samurai Warriors 2 on paper offers 8 basic characters, each with their own combos, their own history, their own battles, and 16 other samurai to unlock. In addition to this, there is no shortage of alternative ways to take advantage of the 24 heroes. Too bad that a poor conversion, repetitive gameplay overshadowed by an unworthy artificial intelligence, graphics that are not in step with the times and a disappointing sound sector erase all the good that it could give. If we then include the selling price of the game in the evaluation, it becomes immediate to understand the reasons for our vote.
