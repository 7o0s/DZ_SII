Swarm doesn't care a little about this rule and for this reason it is one of the most bizarre products on the market. The developers of Hothead Games must have been definitely inspired by Lemmings when they conceived Swarm as there are many points in common between the two games: increasingly complex levels, a bunch of funny unfortunate creatures and a sad fate for many of them. This last feature is exaggerated in Swarm and if in the dear old Lemmings the departure of the little animals was rather playful, in this sort of puzzle-platform the little alien creatures face truly gruesome deaths. Ironically, killing the ~swarmites~ is pretty much the point of the game, so much so that you are rewarded for doing so in ever more elaborate and spectacular ways. Confused? Read on. Unity is strength, almost The premise is quite simple and original: an alien organism is forced to ~land~ on a hostile planet and the only way to regain strength is to find the five fragments of DNA scattered throughout each level. The player controls a swarm, as per the title, of fifty swarmites emitted by the alien organism at the beginning of each stage: the control over the little creatures is direct and the player moves them and makes them act as if they were a single entity, exactly as in any platformer. The group of swarmites can jump and perform two main actions: holding down L2 the group will scatter while holding down R2 the swarmites will approach each other. The combination of these simple configurations produces a multitude of different actions, it is possible for example to make the swarmites climb on top of each other to reach heights seemingly out of reach, to crash the little creatures into destructible objects or take advantage of a sort of dash that allows the creatures to move faster and therefore jump farther. The player learns the various possibilities of the swarmiti in the very first levels of the game and must immediately master them to overcome the already many obstacles present in the initial level, destined to become increasingly complex and abundant from stage to stage. The game levels are particularly intricate, full of self-propelled platforms, traps, enemies and explosives that threaten to wipe out the Swarmites before they manage to reach the end of the course. The point is that the game requires the Swarmites to be sacrificed and killed along the way: this element makes Swarm a sort of cross between a puzzle-game and a platformer that forces the player to think very quickly since each stage is also a race against time. Playstation 3 trophies Swarm offers seven Bronze Trophies, four Silver Trophies and one Gold Trophy. Most of these Trophies are not particularly difficult to obtain and many are acquired automatically by meeting certain requirements such as, for example, reaching certain multipliers or a certain number of Medals. Others, especially the Gold Trophy, require a little more effort and perseverance. How do I slaughter you E.T. The strangest feature of Swarm is precisely the fact that to unlock each level it is necessary to collect a certain amount of points in the previous one. The idea is as simple as it is bizarre: the player collects luminous globes scattered around the level, increasing his score, and so far nothing strange; at this point a multiplier comes into play that increases based on how many swarmites are killed and how the slaughter occurs. Obviously the player must lead at least one little creature to the end of the level and dead that starts again from a checkpoint, consequently in some strategic positions of the stage you will find regeneration points where the swarmiti will return to fifty. The concept is therefore this: the player must ensure that his swarmites are really killed by the traps, possibly in large numbers and very quickly, trying to preserve at least one of them to be taken to the next regeneration point to resume the massacre before it expires the multiplier time. However absurd, this is the only way to collect the points necessary to unlock each new level and the player is practically forced to repeat the stages over and over again in order to develop the best suicide strategy: Swarm is mainly based on this mechanic and as funny as it may be initially, considering soabove all the online leaderboard to climb with your own top scores, the high complexity and difficulty of the advanced stages forces you to frustrating and often unsuccessful repetitions of the levels already covered. Hothead Games stumbles precisely on this feature of the game: although it remains quite fun, Swarm soon manages to be very repetitive and above all incredibly confusing, given that in certain moments the complexity of the stages and the chaos that arises from the death of multiple Swarmites make it difficult to understand what's going on and you feel like you're proceeding almost at random, hoping that the damned multiplier doesn't run out.", "date": "2011-06-30", "grade": "7.0"}
