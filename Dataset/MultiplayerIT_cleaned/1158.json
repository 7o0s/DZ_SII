Management systems, you know, have always been a bit indigestible to the majority of gamers. Motivation which, except in sporadic cases, has often relegated them to a corner of electronic entertainment, from which, however, they are almost always saved by large circles of true enthusiasts. The Sims, the latest hit in chronological order, is a prime example of this. On the other hand, raising and raising a child in the best possible way or settling furious family quarrels can not be so fascinating and fun for everyone, or at least this is what the brainiacs of Empire Interactive must have thought. Much better, they must have said to themselves, to lock up people of all ages in houses and condominiums and, just so they don't get bored, terrorize them to death thanks to large groups of pissed off ghosts. This, in a few lines, is the idea behind Ghost Master. The real news, however, lies in the fact that you won't have to run away with your legs up and your mouth wide open from your ectoplasmic pursuers, because it so happens that, this time, you yourself will become the ethereal and incorporeal protagonists. You got it right: you and only you, in ghostly clothes, with cunning and sagacity, will have to do your best to quickly get rid of noisy and boring human beings and to fully enjoy every room of your home. Simple, don't you think? Ehmin reality, things are not exactly in these terms. In fact, if you think that a simple howl will be enough to achieve the desired effect, you are way off track. In its conceptual simplicity, Ghost Master fully respects the key elements of management, i.e. strategy and reasoning. To ward off young maidens or freckled brats, you'll have to plan every move, often cooperating with the other ghosts nearby and thus prevent them, the living, from recovering from the fright and regrouping. To complicate things more, however, there will be certain factors, such as for example the temporal one, which will force you to complete some missions in a certain amount of minutes, or the intellectual one, which will test the freshness of your neurons by offering you various riddles and puzzles to solve. In any case, fear not too much: the Spiral House programmers have done an excellent job, distributing the game commands on the Sony controller in a simple and intuitive way at the same time. So forget cumbersome operations with mouse and keyboard, since there will be no need: one button to select the desired ghost, another to move it in the play area, yet another to make it execute the order given to it. What more do you want from life? No, don't tell. That would be covert advertising More low than high If from the point of view of gameplay Ghost Master turned out to be a pleasant surprise, it was not the same in terms of technical implementation. Today's consoles have accustomed us to amazing quality standards and the difference between a masterpiece and a so-so production can be seen instantly. Unfortunately, the game in question falls into the second category and the graphics are its Achilles heel. Elementary, bare, poor in details. This is the visual impact and as if that weren't enough, a horrendous and depressing aliasing effect constantly permeates the different levels, peppering them with flickering jaggies. In the 128-bit era it is difficult to see similar things... The chromatic range chosen to color the textures takes care of rectifying the situation: fresh, lively, full of pastel colors, it gives kitchens, bedrooms and living rooms a very comic and cartoonish look. Our illusions, however, will soon be thwarted thanks to the coarse animations of the characters, especially the human ones, with stiff and awkward movements. The thing is less accentuated with regard to the ghosts, but it is only due to the fact that these, except in the moments in which they will travel from one room to another, will remain totally static for long periods of time. Note of merit, however, to the audio sector: the music that accompanies the initial theme song and the selection menus are really pleasant and catchy, in keeping with the prankster spirit of the game. On the other hand, the sound effects can be criticized, especially the frightened cries of the fairer sex, very similar to those given off by a piglet about to be slaughtered. In short, it's a shame to admit it, but if the same care given to the game mechanics had also been placed for graphics and audio, Ghost Master would certainly have had a better chance of success. In any case, we sincerely wish him. Ultimately, despite the denoted graphic defects, Ghost Master brings unexpected and appropriate gusts of innovation to the field of managementand originality, giving a jolt to the monotony and complexity of far more authoritative productions. Furthermore, the large number of missions to be completed and their relative difficulty will be able to keep us busy for several hours, increasing the longevity of a title which, once understood and metabolized, will be able to give pleasant, witty (and spiritic) evenings with friends or family . Rental, at least, is recommended. Pros: Some varied and innovative elements Fun and long-lived Cons: Graphically not up to par Not for everyone The ghosts are back... Raise your hand if you have never seen a movie or read a book featuring ghosts. Or ghosts, if you prefer. Or ectoplasm, if that sounds better to you. In short, those invisible entities who, according to rumors, usually choose to dwell in old castles of ancient splendor or within the walls of now abandoned cemeteries. There are those who swear they have seen them go through doors and walls, elusive and silent like cats, and there are those who, to celebrate the carnival revelry, try to imitate them by slipping a white sheet with holes on their heads One thing is certain: spirits and goblins they have always been part of the collective imagination and have often made the economic fortune of particularly creative and talented writers and directors who have been able to make them excellent protagonists both on paper and on celluloid. Since videogame entertainment has become a mass phenomenon (i.e. for a few years now), even software houses have well thought of exploiting the world of the underworld, and its relative inhabitants, to create that Survival/Horror genre that it has been so successful and which sees the most representative models in productions such as Resident Evil or Silent Hill. Not always, however, the ghosts want to see us dead or decide to kidnap our three-year-old daughter blissfully sitting in front of the TV. There are times when, more simply, they want to be quiet about their own business, take a nap on the sofa in the living room or sprawl carefree on the porch swing. Yes, but how to reconcile these beautiful resolutions with the annoying, unpleasant, irritating presence of those killjoys of human beings? A dilemma to which the British Empire Interactive has decided to give a solution by creating Ghost Master, one of the most out of line management systems of recent times.
