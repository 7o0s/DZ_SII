{"name": "Socom 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/socom-3.html", "text": "Teamwork The special unit you control in Socom 3 is sent to where a terrorist action is taking place. In the game, this translates into three settings (North Africa, South Asia and Poland, in order) divided into a total of fifteen levels, in each of which it will be necessary to complete primary and secondary missions, different depending on the context but which they typically involve searching for a particular object and/or person, or eliminating any threat in the area. The game structure is terribly similar to that of Rainbow Six, so you impersonate the leader of the team and you can give orders to your three companions without directly controlling them (as happened in Ghost Recon, that is). The similarities are also marked in some impartable orders (~come in and clean up~ anyone?), but in reality the use of team actions in Socom 3 is severely limited: on the one hand, game situations, even in the advanced phase, do not they never turn out to be so complex as to require a particular strategy to be solved; on the other, the modest AI of companions and opponents (especially the latter) often suggests that we deal with it alone. This does not mean that the team is a useless ballast (since orders like ~cover the target~ are carried out effectively and that teammates usually spot an enemy in the distance before us), just that the developers have not managed to make it work well like in Rainbow Six or Ghost Recon. All this by completing the game with a normal difficulty level, however: maybe at the ~hard~ level things change a bit. Mechanics and details Cutscene, briefing and execution of the actual mission: this is how you proceed in Socom 3. Naturally, depending on the situation (described verbatim, but also with a good spoken Italian) it is possible to equip your team in different ways, with the only limitation is to stay within a certain ~load~ threshold. In this sense, the system is full of advice: the characters start by default with the ~recommended~ equipment, which is accompanied by the ~mandatory~ one in order not to run into embarrassing situations (in a mission is it necessary to blow up tanks with a missile launcher? Then you MUST take it with you). However, it is possible to vary, so stealth action maniacs will be able to equip themselves with a long-range rifle and a 12X scope if they have no intention of getting close to the enemy; otherwise, in urban contexts it is good practice to have a light machine gun. In any case, weapons with a low degree of accuracy are not recommended, because there is the risk of shooting an opponent at point-blank range three times andmissing him. The speech made previously, and relating to the uselessness of team actions, also applies to grenades, whether they are standard, smoke or luminous: you will hardly use them, so it is better to leave room for extra ammunition, when possible. That said, Socom 3 proves to be quite good at its job: the missions are very linear and don't hold any surprises, but the combat system is precise and doesn't seem marred by any anomaly. Our character can stand upright, crouched or stretched out, rummage through his arsenal at will and collect, if necessary, the weapons and ammunition left by killed enemies. This practice proves to be essential when the main weapon is unloaded and you don't want to spend the rest of the mission firing a simple pistol. In several cases it is also possible to drive vehicles (jeeps, vans, trucks, armored vehicles and even motor boats): a pleasant extra, capable of adding substance to a gameplay that was already rich. Technical front Socom 3 boasts a sound of great, great quality: the music is worthy of a film production, the effects stand out for their realism and everything is topped off with excellent speech in Italian. It is a pity that the graphics sector suffers from the typical evils of some Sony productions (Syphon Filter, for example), or an engine that is unable to efficiently manage the environments, with drastic and repeated drops in the frame rate. And to say that the scenarios, by their very nature, are almost never rich in elements or details. So we have normal animations, a good realism in the reaction to blows (enemies get injured when we hit them, behaving accordingly), medium-level textures and cutscenes that don't hold a candle to what has already been seen on PS2. The control system is practical, even if in some cases it turns out to be a bit cumbersome and some choices are at least questionable. However, you can customize all controls. The online mode, as far as tested, works properly and nthere are no lag problems or anything else. Comment While not shining from a purely aesthetic point of view, Socom 3 represents a good step forward for the Sony series: rich in substance not so much for the fifteen levels (which are completed in a short time, thanks to the low difficulty) but for the rich multiplayer online, immersive in the soundtrack and solid in the gameplay. It is a pity that the developers have not yet managed to effectively implement group actions and make more skilled and cunning enemies, but it is still those shortcomings that distinguish good video games from masterpieces, right? Pros: Solid and thick game structure High quality sound Excellent online mode Cons: Graphics engine often in difficulty Many good ideas exploited little or badly Mediocre artificial intelligence Rainbow Six first, then Ghost Recon and finally Socom made us appreciate the trend that mixes action and strategy within credible scenarios, inspired by real international crises or invented from scratch. These are games in which you control not just one character but a team, finding yourself on a map in search of objectives to complete. Socom, in particular, immediately enjoyed some popularity for its online modes and use of the PS2 headset. This third episode stands as a confirmation of the good things that have been done so far, certainly an excellent starting point when the series continues on PS3.", "date": "2006-07-21", "grade": null}
