The ancient Viking legends tell that Odin, the God of all Gods, protects the populations who live in justice and wisdom thanks to some magical Runes (hence the title of the game) which give their villages protection from evil and a power almost infinite. Ragnar, this is the name of the protagonist we will check, is a young Viking who is not yet an expert in the use of weapons, who is called by his father to defend his village against the attack of a group of Vikings who aim to take possession of the runes, to take control of it and use its power to your liking. However, things don't go exactly as they should immediately, and after guiding Ragnar through his peaceful village on a pleasant sunny day, in a very short tutorial, we are immediately immersed in the thick of the action. In fact, the first of the (fairly numerous and well done, albeit perhaps too short) cutscenes created with the same game engine that we will encounter during the adventure, shows us how, through a magical device of unknown origin, our ship is sunk and the our comrades all killed. And we with them. But what seems to be the early end of our adventure is just the beginning: in fact Odin, who seems to have particular interests in us and in the importance that we can assume in the rune protection quest that he offers us, brings us back alive and opens up an escape route from the depths of the sea that seems to have trapped us. But who attacked our village and neighboring ones? Who was able to summon so much magic without the help of some supernatural entity? How will we be able to defend our friends without the help of someone more powerful than us? Why does Odin seem to be so interested in our help? These are just some of the questions we will have to find answers to during the course of our adventure... An ~unreal~ graphic, suitable for those with a little patience... Once the splendid introductory film (perhaps one of the best and most evocative seen to date - the names of the programmers scroll in superimposition thus giving us the effect similar to that of an epic film) ends, the real adventure begins. What immediately catches our attention (and it will do so especially after the third-fourth hour of play, when we begin to glimpse the external environments) is undoubtedly the quality of the graphics and textures in general, certainly very accurate and beautifully made: like mentioned the first levels, which take place completely underground between caves and the depths of the sea, absolutely do not do justice to the graphic capabilities of the engine used (which is in this case that of Unreal, slightly reworked for the occasion), which only after a few hour of play suggests a decidedly extraordinary general quality. So those of you who will decide, I hope also on the basis of this review, to approach the game, be patient for a few hours, and bear the flatness of the environments that present themselves before you with absurd repetitiveness in the first seven-eight levels, because the mediocre quality graphics, combined with a boring structural realization will soon leave room for an overflowing fullness and texture definition never seen in a game of the genre. > Among other things, the light effects of the game have been really well designed, and in this regard it is enough to see the care with which the shadow of the characters has been created, which wobbles and moves according to the various light sources present in the 'environment, to understand that the quality of the graphics is well above average. Luckily for us, all this abundance doesn't seem to weigh too much on the game engine, because even with a good old Celeron 400, accompanied by 128 Mega of Ram and a Voodoo3, the game is more than enjoyable and maintains its own Frame Rate on high levels and always constant (side note for the fast saving and loading, also favored by the fact that the levels are divided into many small parts). Also on the side of the sound effects the speech previously referred to the graphics and the general appearance of the game can be applied: if the first levels offer nothing but repetitive sounds and flatness in general, later on the speech changes rather radically, and will even be possible to be able to hear the enemies talking to each other (on too rare occasions, to tell the truth), but above all to emit their war cries and their angry panting (and among all effects we must remember the screams of the tortured who are in the deep underground). Forget about being able to use Eax support as vented in options di game: if this option is activated, a bug (it almost seems like the Achilles heel of all programmers, since the debut of this technology in Jedi Knight) will cause the sound to be out of phase with the action, making it also crackly and badly made . But don't worry: if the sound aspect of the game can already be enjoyed in this way, that is, only with two active speakers, we can only wait for a corrective patch to be able to enjoy it even more. However, this rather negative side is accompanied by one that definitely improves the situation: the accompanying music is very atmospheric and quite numerous in the course of the action (there is a battle, about halfway through the game, in a Viking village which is truly exceptional), and really do justice to the epicness of the theme. Furthermore, the quality of the voices of the characters encountered during the adventure are extraordinary, and above all the dubbing of the very bad and crazy **** (allow me a censorship so as not to spoil the pleasure of the story, pleasant and well told from the numerous cutscenes present in the game), which will elicit a smile of admiration from you... and maybe a little emotion. Exploration or combat? Passed off at the very beginning of programming as a third-person Rpg, Rune betrays its nature as a purely Hack'n Slash third-person Action from the very first lines of the game, when stupid beings similar to turtles equipped with sharp claws, plants capable of trapping us with their prominences, and rather helpless leaping beings, they soon become, and without much resistance, real cannon fodder for our weapons. Weapons that can be found scattered throughout the levels, or used by the strongest enemies (just kill them to take possession of them), and which are divided into three categories: swords, clubs and axes. To each of these three groups belong five different weapons, for a total of fifteen, usable throughout the game: however their diversity, within the group, varies only according to their speed and their power. In fact, the bigger the swords (for the axes and maces the same goes) the more Ragnar will deliver powerful but slower blows, and this in the long run has a rather decisive influence on the fighting style that one intends to follow during the numerous clashes with the enemies. Furthermore, the use of the most powerful weapons of each category, found in the last part of the game, requires the use of both hands, which makes it impossible for Ragnar to defend himself in those cases with the shields that instead it will be used at other times to defend against the joint attack of several enemies. Each weapon has a particular magical power, which can be activated through evocation once the necessary ~mana~ level has been reached: in this case the mana is represented by the ~Rune Power~, which increases every time you manage to collect the precious little runes hidden in the levels. As it is easy to understand, therefore the diversity of action is guaranteed not only by the presence of fifteen different weapons, but also by their magical use: hammers that generate a shock and that repel enemies or that launch real fireballs, swords that steal vital energy of those who are hit or that turn into fire by burning anyone who comes into contact with them, others that make one invisible for a certain period of time or others that launch lightning generated from the sky ... Exploration or combat? However, during the game the possibility of using these magical powers is far too limited, since the presence of mana runes is scarce, and this, if on the one hand adds a tactical taste to the use of the weapon's powers, on the other it certainly limits its spectacularity and power: to this it must be added that, once the most powerful weapon has been found, one will almost always switch to it, forgetting about the previous one, in fact favoring brute force and destructive power over speed. The only real and effective choice is ultimately to use one category (the sword was my favorite throughout the game) over another. Among other things, and this is certainly a pity, no Rpg element has been included in the game, and it is not even possible to read the characteristics of one weapon compared to another, removing a pinch of depth that certainly would not have hurt. If you want to make a comparison, and in the world of video games comparisons are always wasted, even Drakan, released more than a year and a half ago, was better from this point of view, as each weapon possessed precise characteristics detectable within the 'inventory. Speaking of inventory, it was not even conceived in Rune: the weapons that we will collect nin the course of the adventure, in fact, they will be ~attached~ to our belt, with the result that Ragnar will go around like a real itinerant salesman, and every time he changes his weapon we will see him pick it up from his side: even if the effect graphically it's really well done, it's limited to the smallest weapons, also because the most powerful ones are almost as big as the squat viking... Cut and slice As for the actual clashes, the game control method does not differ much from the other 3D action: the left button will be used to deliver blows, while the right button will raise the shield that you will carry around: however it must be said how the shield is used (up to destruction, since it has a structural level that drops very quickly under the blows of enemies) partly automatically by the game, and this is fortunate, since the protection movement takes Ragnar far too much time to be effective, and therefore you will soon tend to forget about it during the game. If the enemies, like the scenarios and the general setting of the game, are rather dull and not very combative in the first hours (just click quickly with the left button to be right), as soon as you find yourself fighting with the other Vikings the first ones will start headaches: in fact, the use of the shield on their part is well calibrated, and it will be necessary to seize the moment in which one of their shots misses, perhaps by turning around suddenly and with a thread of tactical sense, to launch our attack. Unfortunately, while things improve significantly as the game progresses, making the fights very fun and combative, the variety of the fights could certainly have been far better. It is in fact quite inexplicable how the programmers have decided to populate the levels, when the clashes are actually the fulcrum of the game itself, with a scarce variety of enemies, a variety that is even zero within them: if you are in a village, keep your peace of mind, because for the next five levels you will meet only Vikings, Vikings and, of course, Vikings (and the same can be applied to skeletons, whose heads must be cut off to get them out of the way, to dwarves and annoying and uninspired creatures of the first levels). A choice of this type is absolutely unacceptable, especially as the levels are quite large and a certain variety would certainly not be spoiled: the tactical approach is also always limited to close combat, and never, as there are no throwing weapons (bows or crossbows), to the one at a distance: yes, it is true that there is the possibility of throwing the weapon at the enemy, but I assure you that you will use it very rarely (if not ever), at least in singleplayer, because throwing it would mean staying out of it unprovided and face the enemy horde with a weapon of lesser power than the one you were holding until a moment before. As for the AI of the enemies, the impression one gets is rather positive, with fast and fairly coordinated attacks of the group against which we are fighting: however sometimes, especially when we hide for a certain period of time , the enemies will be rather disoriented by our move, remaining motionless at our mercy. What makes Rune truly unique is the real cruelty of the clashes, as our beloved character is capable of cutting the various parts of the enemies' bodies with rather surgical precision, and it is not difficult to glimpse limbs or heads flying by spraying blood everywhere: of course cut off a limb from an enemy, and he will continue to chase you, but cut off his head and he will be one less problem. Even if this last aspect makes a game more realistic which, all in all (perhaps due to the use of ~real~ and not fantasy weapons, and of settings, albeit epic but rather related to Viking legends) is basically realistic (it suffices a couple of well-aimed blows to return to Odin's lands...) the clashes are always fun and represent the real fulcrum of the game, even if their repetitiveness could tire the most demanding players. It almost seems, and this is perhaps the biggest criticism that can be made of the game, that the programmers have found a way to amuse the player (make him fight a group of enemies by slashing and killing them), and have repeated it throughout the game hundreds of times, but without really looking for something new: to make the situation worse (which, it must be said in all honesty, however maintains playability and fun for the duration of the game), the chronic lack of variety of enemies present in", "date": "2001-04-30", "grade": null}
