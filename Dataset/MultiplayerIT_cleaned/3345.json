The plans in this sense were in fact announced several years ago, but the projects promised by Sony have not yet materialised. In this case, the flagship character of the famous LittleBigPlanet series, the protagonist of recent of a traditional solo adventure (indeed, a great adventure), without editors and various side dishes. The developers of Exient, however, haven't found anything better for it to do than... run. We tell you how it went in the Ultimate Sackboy review. Gameplay: Like Subway Surfers, but with more patchwork Ultimate Sackboy, a stage of the race and the balls to collect to score points It only takes a few seconds to realize that in terms of gameplay Ultimate Sackboy stands as a real clone of the classic Subway Surfers, although in this case the structure is not actually that of an endless runner, given that the goal is to score the most points within a time limit trying not to crash, rather than get as far as possible. That said, the management of the character, who moves between three different lanes as well as jumping and sliding, is completely identical to the system developed by Kiloo in the now distant 2012 and uses swipes on the touch screen to perform the various maneuvers, without however ever exaggerating the rhythms and indeed proceeding at a moderate speed, so as to give us an all in all relaxing experience. Of course, after a few games it also becomes clear that enhancing our Sackboy through the use of coins and the opening of the boxes (arranged on four slots with timed release, as established some time ago by another blockbuster, Clash Royale), as well as obviously any microtransactions are a fundamental requirement in order to win the challenges, which take place in the context of a sort of asynchronous multiplayer. The more you grow, the more you upgrade your character's accessories and the higher you climb in the rankings, unlocking new scenarios and special events through which to once again feed the rewards mechanism, which is therefore confirmed as central although ~masked~ by the numerous aesthetic customizations for the rag doll created by Media Molecule, whose appearance we will be able to modify in various ways through this system . Technical realization: like Subway Surfers, but with more details Ultimate Sackboy, one of the special stages Although the Ultimate Sackboy system does not make one cry for a miracle, proposing as mentioned a formula that by now appears rather inflated on mobile, albeit with a remodulated structure in order to entertain us with short challenges, it is clear that in terms of technical realization the situation is very different from the title that this experience is so clearly inspired by, the aforementioned Subway Surfers. In fact, there is very little to complain about: characters and settings are colorful, detailed and cartoonish enough, and splash at 60 frames per second once the graphic options are set to maximum, while we are accompanied in our runs by revisited versions of the original LittleBigPlanet music.", "date": "2023-03-03", "grade": "7.0"}
