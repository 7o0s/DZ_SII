{"name": "Operation Flashpoint", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/operation-flashpoint_a.html", "text": "A few features here and there From a technical point of view, I'll let the specifications on the home page speak for themselves: proprietary 3D graphics engine, scalable graphics detail system (in the options you can choose the ~degree~ of scalability), real-time simulation of weather conditions (wind, rain, fog , clouds, light and sky: all elements that change dynamically over time), animations created with the support of motion capture, voice communication system inserted into the game engine that uses the new Direct Play instruction set of the Dx8, mission editor included (very nice and complete, even if intended for the more experienced due to the complexity of the tool). Multiplayer game supported through the ~Codemaster's Multiplayer Network~ and possibility to play on dedicated servers in the internet and local network. A perplexity that caught me playing O.F. is the graphics engine: really heavy in terms of hardware requirements (the minimum requirements speak of ~Pentium II 266 MHz, 64 MB RAM, 8 MB 3D Accelerated Video Card~, but they are insufficient: with a Celeron 900, GeForce MX400 and with 400 mega of ram the game at 1024 is never fluid enough and in moments of greatest confusion it snaps conspicuously). Accompanied to the exe of the game there is a utility that allows you to set different graphic parameters in a personalized way: with little effort you should be able to lower the graphic quality and improve the framerate. This does not mean that the hardware requests are really expensive. On the other hand, it cannot be denied that the Operation Flashpoint engine has some really exciting features, being able to render huge environments and with a good texture quality (only the Delta Force engine was able to render such vast spaces, but in terms of quality the comparison does not hold: in O.F. the graphic realism has no comparison). However, to check if your system will be able to run the game decently, I suggest you download the full-bodied demo of the game (thanks to which you can try a taste). One shot, one kill The missions will take place in four islands, really huge. Within these there will be very diversified scenarios: hills, woods, paved and dirt roads, abandoned cities, small or large military camps (and other truly unique structures, scroll through the screenshots to see some of them). The vastness of the maps shouldn't scare you: at our disposal, in fact, we will have a series of means of ground transport that will allow us to move between one point and another quickly (there are cars, trucks, jeeps...). In addition to these, the game also confronts us with means of war: tanks, helicopters, aircraft. To practice with these powerful tools of war, during the course of the game in Campaign mode we will be given precise tasks with progressive difficulty, as in a kind of tutorial (transporting the team through checkpoints driving a truck, or attacking enemy positions with a tank). The presence of these vehicles is decidedly innovative for an FPS game and in addition to giving a great depth to the singleplayer game, it makes the multiplayer mode a unique experience (imagine the two teams using vehicles to move or/and to attack!). We may have already seen something similar in Tribes or Codename Eagle, but in Operation Flashpoint the focus is on realism, which, also thanks to these gems, reaches truly sublime levels. Another list to make is that of the available classes: soldier, anti-tank soldier, doctor, officer, grenadier, sniper, civilian, saboteur, machine gunner and so on, for a total of 11 ~characters~. The difference is both in terms of models and textures, and in terms of armament and freedom of action. The officer will in fact be able to give orders to his inferiors, while the simple soldier will be able to report the positions of the enemies and shoot left and right at the most. As you approach a corpse, a menu will appear that will allow you to take additional ammunition, change weapons or take bombs. The same when you approach the weapons collection ~warehouses~. Realism dictates that you can only carry a limited number of magazines and bombs and only one weapon (apart from rare cases). A war simulation cannot do without the use of weapons and Operation Flashpoint does NOT leave a bad taste in the mouth even in this field. Since I'm not an expert, I list the weapons that are available in the game: M16A2 Assault Rifle, CAR-15 Carbine, M21 Sniper Rifle, M60 Machine Gun, FIM92A ~Stinger~ AA Missile, M136 AT4 Anti-Tank Gun, LAW 80 Light Anti -Tank Weapon (these for NATO forces) AK74, AK47 Assault Rifles, Dragunov Sniper Rifle, PK 7.62 Machine Gun, RPG - 7 Rocket Propelled Grenade (for SOVIET counterpart). All weapons have three different views: the classic one, the zoomed one, the characteristic one. The first is the classic FPS one, while the third makes the weapon appear as if we were really looking with one eye inside the scope (it's essential for the sniper rifle and rocket launchers, but only scene for normal rifles). In addition to the actual weapons, you will also have other armaments and/or aids at your disposal such as a telescope, throwing bombs, anti-tank mines and an infrared ray viewer. Lots of work to do The number of missions is decidedly high, fifteen for the single player, thirty for the ~campaign~ mode, which can be tackled in two difficulty levels. The missions of the campaign are not linear, we could in fact fail in some points of the mission, but without compromising the overall outcome of the mission, which dynamically evolves based on our actions. The missions are perfectly connected to each other by means of cinematics that use the game's engine and make us participate in the unfolding of the plot (yes, there is a plot, a story). Counting the singleplayer game, the multiplayer game and the custom missions that enthusiasts will build and make available via the internet, Operation Flashpoint offers a very large number of hours of gameplay (not to mention the fact that the missions can be replayed following strategies and tactics every several times). Definitely Operation Flashpoint is a beautiful Tactical Squad-Based Military FPS, that is a first-person military game in which teamwork is essential. Said like this, it's still really reductive. O.F. it can be safely called an experience. Something so complete and innovative that it escapes a rigid classification (a bit like what happened with Deus Ex). Action online strategy with Operation Flashpoint reaches perfection. It is true that the target is an expert player eager to learn how to play in a team, but given the success of counter strikes and the proliferation of clans, I believe that a good portion of the public is ready to venture into this game, characterized by a 'incredible realism and gameplay of the highest level. More screenshots 13 I know that this is a title that many fans have been waiting for a long time, but which I believe will appeal to a large number of gamers. So I will make sure to list all the good things that the game offers, emphasizing from time to time the strengths (many) and the defects (very few) of this masterpiece.", "date": "2001-06-19", "grade": null}
