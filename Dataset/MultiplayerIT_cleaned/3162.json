Announced during the last Nintendo Direct Mini and immediately available for download on the eShop, Capcom's underwater metroidvania is a title that draws strength from a strong survival component and a particularly accurate setting, and which already on iOS platforms had given display of a depth worthy of a video game with a capital V: it would therefore seem that everything is perfectly set for an ideal transition, let's see if things actually went like this. Switchsekai In this article we will mainly focus on the features of this conversion of Shinsekai Into the Depths for Nintendo Switch, while for our opinion on the game itself we refer you to the review of the original iOS format. To those who don't even know what we're talking about, let's say briefly that the game is set in an apocalyptic scenario in which the world has been submerged by water, and the protagonist is an anonymous diver forced to leave his refuge in a hurry, destroyed by a sudden ice wave. In terms of gameplay, this translates into a metroidvania that favors the exploratory component, inviting the user to collect resources to expand and upgrade their equipment rather than launch into furious fights with enemies who can jeopardize the precious oxygen supplies. Although it would be reasonable to believe that the first aspect to benefit from this conversion is the control system, in reality Shinsekai Into the Depths already on iOS boasted native support for Bluetooth controllers, so the developers didn't have to make great maneuvers to adapt the commands to the Joy-cons. Unfortunately, the original interface also remains, which did not shine in terms of aesthetic beauty and ease of reading and which has not undergone any retouching here, remaining one of the weak points of the Capcom product. In technical terms, the fact that the graphics have remained substantially unchanged is not a bad thing in itself (the visual system remains pleasant especially in portable mode), but that even the frame rate drops have been transferred to Switch is a sign of a pretty lazy conversion on that front. Even the sound is always the same, but fortunately this is a positive fact: already on iOS Shinsekai Into the Depths boasted an amazing sound design combined with very evocative music, which we find here in all their beauty and with a brand new Jukebox section to listen to them, preferably with headphones. Still speaking of the (few) new entries of this Switch version, the introduction of the Another Dive mode is decidedly more interesting in playful terms, a sort of time attack set in a new setting complete with a final boss created specifically for the occasion and playable in two distinct levels of difficulty. All content that even Apple Arcade subscribers will be able to obtain through an update of the application, making this Switch version advisable only if you do not have the possibility to access the service on iOS, even for a trivial question of price: Shinsekai Into the Depths on eShop costs 19.99 (a bit too much) compared to the 4.99 monthly subscription to Apple Arcade.", "date": "2020-03-30", "grade": "7.7"}
