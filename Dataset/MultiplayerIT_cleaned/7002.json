Just three years ago we greeted with joy the arrival of Eric Chahi's masterpiece on iOS while today is the time to dedicate ourselves to the umpteenth conversion which, suddenly, has arrived on every console market with the exception of Xbox 360 (for reasons which unfortunately escape us). Years have passed we said, the developer who took care of carrying out the re-adaptation has changed, first DotEmu, today Digital Lounge, but the edition of the game has always remained the same and, also for this reason, we will try to dwell on the indispensable minimum on the mechanics and history of the game, referring you to the article written at the time and focusing instead on the quality of the conversion carried out on the Nintendo platforms, the only ones we have tested. And unfortunately, we already tell you, there is very little to celebrate. Another World arrives on consoles thanks to the little homework done by Digital Lounge If we do not remember we cannot understand Another World is a decidedly atypical adventure with numerous puzzle elements, a noticeable action tendency and a pinch of platform situations. Made in the distant 1991 by the visionary genius of Eric Chahi accompanied by his musician friend Jean-Franois Freitas, the title was an incredible generational leap forward for the era in which it came out and not only from a graphic point of view, but also in terms of gameplay and narrative. On the one hand it was one of the very first videogames completely devoid of an on-screen interface, a goal that few have managed to achieve even today, and at the same time the subtle plot lines that accompanied the adventures of Lester Chaykin, the lead scientist , were told without the use of on-screen text or dubbed dialogue. The player simply has to understand what is happening on the screen by following the action, picking up the clues from the scenario and appreciating the strange bond that is created with the alien friend released at the beginning of the adventure. More concretely, the gameplay takes place on the basis of fixed screens where the character is free to move on a two-dimensional plane full of polygons but with hand-drawn backgrounds. The action is strongly focused on ~trial and error~ and in some situations it is necessary to explore the length and breadth of the game area to be able to understand how to interact with the scenario and be able to move forward in the game. It is very complex to be able to describe such a visionary, attractive and meaningful game, after all these years that have partly made us unaccustomed to an often frustrating and complex gameplay. And even trying to leave aside the wonder felt at the time of the game's release, it's easy to be amazed in front of such a small but at the same time so powerful product. Another World can be completed in less than two hours if you don't get stuck in some difficult passage, but once you've finished it the first time, it takes just over half an hour to complete it again and the two additional difficulty levels implemented are of little use with this reissue. On the one hand we have a simpler one that reduces the difficulties associated with the few but crucial shootings to zero and on the other we have the maximum one which instead forces maximum reactivity and perhaps a little too much pixel perfection in the movements. In fact, apart from running and jumping, Lester will soon have to use a gun to pulverize the enemies, create shields so as to shelter from the blows of the opponents and, at the right moment, shoot plasma balls to destroy the enemy shelters or some elements of the scenario . The difficulty is all inherent in understanding the scenario, in knowing how to move carefully on pain of sudden death from a wrong jump or an uncalculated obstacle and in shooting at the right moment so as not to be electrocuted first by the enemy. Trial and error as we said above but of a type that still knows how to fascinate and offer the right level of difficulty. But at some point, trouble sets in. The 3D effect The game does not implement any 3D effects. In memory lies human knowledge The first big problem with this new conversion of Another World is the amount of money you have to pay to take it home. Those eight euros for the same Anniversary Edition released three years ago on iOS (and two on Android), among other things at half the price, are difficult to swallow especially when you are faced with the porting work carried out by the Digital guys Lounges that, without beating about the bush, limited themselves to doing their homework. Let's start from the Wii U version which can be played only via the GamePad but, for example, does not implement everythingi the touch controls that can be found on the iPad and iPhone instead. Even the initial menu, which consists of three individual options, can be navigated only and exclusively with the classic physical controls. As far as the Nintendo 3DS version is concerned, as you have probably already noticed in the side box, it is absurd to note how not only has 3D not been implemented in any way but even the lower screen of the laptop remains completely unused, turned off, given that all the The action takes place in the upper one. Maybe if the developer had applied himself a little more, he could have come up with some ideas to use the peculiarities of the Nintendo consoles properly (and we feel confident that the same, minimal work has also been done with all the other console versions). At the same time, the contents have remained perfectly identical and frozen to those of three years ago, with the difficulty levels already mentioned, the possibility of accessing the original or remastered music, the command to switch on the fly from the time to the current one of the remake and a whole series of checkpoints to lighten the flow of the action and stimulate a minimum of replay value. Finally, we point out that the localization errors that afflicted the iOS and Android editions are still present, despite the fact that the amount of texts included in the game is reduced to the bone.", "date": "2014-07-18", "grade": "8.0"}
