As we said in the review written at the time, the number of titles dedicated to overgrown lizards is historically not that consistent, which is why fans of Jurassic Park and company have eagerly welcomed each new production featuring these cute creatures. Almost three years later, the same brand is back on our screens thanks to Primal Carnage: Extinction, which has already landed on PC for a few months before also appearing on the American PlayStation Store in the PlayStation 4 version. Waiting for its release in Europe, we took advantage of the event to take our rifle again and go hunting for dinosaurs: let's see how it went. Hunters and prey collide in Primal Carnage: Extinction, the ~dinosaur~ title for PlayStation 4! From Genesis to Extinction Those who were passionate about this title and its team, Lukewarm Media at the time of Primal Carnage, will perhaps know that the second game in the series should not have been the one that then hit the market. In fact, we recall that the original was a strictly online multiplayer shooter, after which Primal Carnage: Genesis, a single-player prequel developed with the Unreal Engine 4, was in the pipeline: in reality this was never made, even in due to some vicissitudes that changed the fate of the Primal Carnage series. The brand ended up in the hands of Circle 5 Studios, a distributed network of designers and other insiders who came out of the modder community of the first title. Following these reversals, the Genesis-related project was scaled down, to make it more similar to that of the game seen in 2012. In this way Primal Carnage: Extinction was born, which retains several similarities with its predecessor. It is also a shooter that can only be played in multiplayer mode, enriched by the developers with additional elements compared to the original version. If in the game seen three years ago a single classic deathmatch mode appeared, now we also find the same in Primal Carnage: Extinction, together with three other alternatives. The first is the so-called Get to the Chopper, within which the team made up of humans must control a series of points on the map, up to unlocking a rescue helicopter with which to leave the place and win the game; in defense we naturally find the dinosaur team, committed to preventing the opponents from achieving their goal. Then there is a Survival mode, where you can face growing hordes of dinosaurs, and the Free Roam mode, which allows you to wander around the map without a particular objective. An idea that had quite unexpected implications on PC, thanks to the people who populated the servers dedicated to this mode to start making ~dinosaur-like~ RPGs. Number and type of classes have remained unchanged at five per deployment, which is why we refer you to the old review to find out more, limiting ourselves only to highlighting that on the side of the dinosaurs we can find some subclasses that increase the number of creatures available in Primal Carnage : extinction. Playstation 4 trophies Primal Carnage: Extinction offers a total of 32 trophies, of which 16 are bronze, 9 silver, 6 gold and 1 platinum. The objectives to be achieved cover the different types of game, rewarding us for example when we reach a certain wave in Survival mode or after having scored a series of kills with a certain class. Quantity or quality? If in quantitative terms Primal Carnage: Extinction gives its predecessor that little bit more that we expected, unfortunately the same cannot be said of the qualitative aspect, where we indeed find some rather significant problems. In fact, the PlayStation 4 version suffers from unexpected crashes on the console dashboard, while the absence of dedicated servers sometimes makes it a mirage to find a stable host that hosts a game for its entire duration. The artificial intelligence of the new Survival game option is also lacking, which allows players to take refuge in places on the map where the dinosaurs don't seem to want to attack them, limiting themselves to looking at them in a bizarre way: it's a shame because while not inventing anything, the mode ~ horde~ by Primal Carnage: Extinction contains some interesting ideas, such as the one that in one of the waves has us face large invisible lizards. Moving on to the gameplay in the strict sense, Primal Carnage: Extinction retains the characteristics of its predecessor: by playing a human we find ourselves with the classic controls and interface of first-person shootersna, with primary and secondary weapons and the ability to take aim to increase the success rate of the shot. When we impersonate the dinosaurs, the shot switches to third person instead, allowing the player to control the larger dinosaurs more effectively. As many will expect, the greatest amount of fun comes when controlling the lizards: the experience of wandering around with a T-Rex in search of prey is quite rewarding, but we must say that even in a well-organized team of humans to have a good time. The problem, in this case, is that some classes show slightly lower effectiveness than others, thus pushing players to almost always select the same ones in less organized teams. A similar situation among dinosaurs concerns flying creatures, but in this case due to a console control system that makes their effective use very difficult. The version of Primal Carnage: Extinction for PlayStation 4 was built on a modified version of Unreal Engine 3, a graphics engine that does not natively support the Sony-branded console. While appreciating the effort made in technical terms to make this possible, we recall that already in 2012 the first Primal Carnage showed the aging of this technology. In 2015 there are therefore no tricks and improvements that can hold. The only really convincing aspect from a technical point of view concerns the models of the dinosaurs. Given and considering the mediocre detail, however, the 1080p resolution at 60 frames per second are only a small consolation. The audio sector is sufficiency, composed of an acceptable soundtrack and various effects during the game, among which we find the dinosaurs' verses in the front row.", "date": "2015-11-03", "grade": "5.0"}
