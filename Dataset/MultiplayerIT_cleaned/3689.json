{"name": "My Brother Rabbit", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/my-brother-rabbit-recensione.html", "text": "In recent years the panorama of video games from Poland has grown exponentially. The movement is obviously led by CD Projekt RED, but behind the Warsaw studio we also find many other interesting realities, among which Techland, People Can Fly, Bloober Team and The Farmi 51 stand out. Artifex Mundi has also arisen, a young reality to which we owe the creation of My Brother Rabbit, a nice point and click puzzle game that in all its simplicity manages to amuse the user with simple but effective gimmicks. The title had already appeared last year on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch, but has recently also landed on Android and iOS devices. So let's try to better understand what it is through our review. Sharpen your sight! The story of My Brother Rabbit is set in a surreal context generated by the fervent imagination of a sick little girl. With the support of her brother, the little girl tries to escape from the serious problems that real life has put her in front of, creating a pleasant game universe in which the protagonist is her stuffed animal in the shape of a rabbit. In the five chapters that make up the story, they take on the role of the bizarre puppet, in charge of bringing a small sprout back to health within an extravagant and super colorful context. To succeed in his intent, the player will have to sharpen his eyesight and solve puzzles that involve identifying a series of objects hidden in the settings. Each level is in fact made up of a series of fixed but rather dense screens of articles; some of these materials must be identified and collected in order to activate mechanisms, doors, and other very specific portions of the scenario, in an attempt to reach the conclusion of the path and continue beyond. Using the touch screen, the user is able to click anywhere on the level in search of materials useful for continuing the adventure, including balloons, wires, electric cables, butterflies and other assorted objects which in many cases are so camouflaged well in the environment to make it necessary to zoom the screen to enjoy a better view of the details. The sensitive objects are indicated by some boxes located in the upper right corner of the screen, where the necessary quantity and their location within the various sectors that make up each level are also shown. Although the activity to be carried out is always the same from the beginning to the end of the adventure, the puzzles are quite pleasant to complete and also quite diversified in terms of appearance and structure. In some phases you will also come across some small puzzles to solve, which require for example to compose a domino, put the hydraulic pipes in order, find a combination using the weight of some objects to be introduced on a scale and so on. In these phases it is possible to limit oneself to sharpening one's ingenuity to untangle the skein, but for the less patient it is still allowed to access practical illustrations which substantially facilitate the resolution of the catch. The duration of the game varies according to one's ability to quickly find hidden objects without proceeding by trial and error, but on average the longevity of the work is in the order of three or four hours overall. The imaginary world shaped by the fervent imagination of the little girl is full of details, sparkling shades and bizarre creatures, in clear contrast with the interlude sequences that alternate between one puzzle and another, where a series of hand-drawn cartoons, accompanied by a melancholic background music, they tell in short but effective passages the ordeal experienced by the little girl and her parents in a desperate attempt to find a cure.", "date": "2019-04-29", "grade": "7.5"}
