{"name": "LEGO DC Super-Villains", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lego-dc-super-villains-recensione.html", "text": "Not even six months have passed since the release of the latest LEGO video game signed by TT Games - LEGO The Incredibles - yet here we are again destroying scenarios, collecting bricks and solving puzzles as in every other appointment with the series born in 2005 thanks to the transposition in a LEGO key of Star Wars. The formula is starting to age, and we've known this for years now, but there is already an important difference between this new proposal and the previous one: LEGO DC Super-Villains is not a real tie-in and is not inspired by any film . This condition has granted the guys from TT Games unprecedented creative freedom, since this time they didn't even have to focus on the most loved and famous heroes, but on their nemeses. It's almost a suicide squad It all starts, however, in a more original way than usual. In the prison where Lex Luthor and other well-known super criminals are incarcerated, the Gotham City police have also hidden a metahuman with the ability to absorb other people's powers: it's you, a customizable protagonist through a nice interface that allows you to change almost entirely the his appearance. After choosing any cloaks, hats, tights and other colored clothing, you can also choose the name and at that point the adventure will begin with Lex Luthor's escape. The latter, helped by Livewire, will involve you in his escape, which will culminate in the acquisition of your first power, which is also customizable: for example, you can choose whether to project rays from your eyes or from your hands, the intensity and color of visual effect, as well as other small details that make your alter ego more and more unique throughout the game, especially once you unlock the additional options. The story focuses relatively on your super villain, jumping from one villain to another to tell it through different and crazier points of view, but there is a backbone that justifies the various stages that will follow in the main campaign. Indeed, the arrival of the Justice Syndicate from Earth-3 disrupts the status quo in Metropolis and Gotham City as these self-styled heroes trap the Justice League and pose as the new force for good in the city. Thanks to a tip from Harley Quinn, the Joker and the other bad guys decide to intervene first to take advantage of the imbalance that has arisen, and then to fix things when the counterparts of the heroes begin to become a real nuisance. In short, the plot of LEGO DC Super-Villains is decidedly crazy, and the guys from TT Games tell it through cinematics entirely dubbed in Italian that do justice to the characters portrayed, while ridiculing them several times. Fortunately, not having to follow a pre-set narrative, the British developer's latest effort manages to be much more genuine than in the past and elicits quite a few laughs, especially when it plays with the idiosyncrasies of the heroes, reversing the perspective since it will be us, in the shoes of criminals, having to win to continue. It must be said that, in this respect, TT Games has done an excellent job, focusing especially on the villains made famous by films and TV series such as Malcolm Merlyn, the Anti Flash, Captain Cold and the entire ~rogue gallery~ of the TV Arrowverse. Although the Joker, Lex and other super villains often have the spotlight on them, it is clear that TT Games was inspired above all by productions such as Suicide Squad also from a technical point of view. LEGO DC Super-Villains is in fact a very colorful title full of details, gaudy effects and decidedly peculiar visual and musical choices for the LEGO series: just think of the track that accompanies the main menu, Joker & the Thief by Wolfmother. Playstation 4 trophies There are 3 gold, 10 silver and 32 bronze trophies to unlock in order to get the final platinum trophy. Even LEGO DC Super-Villains, like the other games in the LEGO series, is not a particularly demanding title, and the requirements are all quite intuitive: despite this, it will take several hours to complete it 100% after finishing the campaign. The usual LEGO or almost If it is true that the premises of LEGO DC Super-Villains are decidedly original by the standards of TT Games, it is equally true that the game structure takes on much more familiar tones within a few minutes. Once again the game is divided into mandatory stages that mark the story and a multitude of optional missions and secondary objectives scattered throughout the cities, which can be explored far and wide like a miniature open world. Each stage, once completed, can be replayed in free mode, that is, choosing the characters you prefer most: in this modo, previously hidden collectibles can be collected in areas that can only open certain powers instead of others. LEGO DC Super-Villains reproposes most of the powers already seen in the previous titles of the series and, therefore, for better or worse, the same environmental puzzles: to destroy certain obstacles you need incendiary rays, only characters capable of miniaturizing or breaking down can travel the air ducts, certain walls can only be destroyed by villains like Harly Quinn or the Riddler and so on. Here and there, however, some unpublished powers also make their appearance, such as the ability of some villains to recruit henchmen and then use them in different circumstances, or the Joker or Catwoman's power to control a kind of drone - a set of dentures for him, a kitten for her - to solve some remote puzzles. Some others also have interchangeable powers or different abilities that manifest themselves according to the puzzle in turn: in this way, the level design guarantees a significantly greater variety than in the past, perhaps also because the developer was able to indulge himself without having to stick to the film script on duty, but how to achieve certain goals is sometimes rather nebulous. However, the gameplay remains predictable in most cases, despite the small innovations introduced, and in this sense we continue to feel the need for a renewal especially in the combat system, still tied to a collision system that defining incomplete is an understatement, especially when facing the end-of-level bosses, and in the guide system, mostly isolated to exploration in open world mode, but truly terrible and frustrating.", "date": "2018-10-16", "grade": "7.7"}
