Well I don't want to disappoint you, but we won't find much, in fact I think this is the bare essentials to make an Add-On and publish it. Let's see together what we are talking about. Meanwhile there are only 9 levels in Single Player, exactly 3 for each species and which somehow relate to the story told in AvP2, furthermore the plot, also given the smallness of the levels, is only hinted at and does not prove to be particularly interesting. Among other things, I can only tell you that there is an Alien artifact involved and the theater of events is the ~usual~ planet LV1201, now famous theater of clashes between races. The same levels are poorly designed and are extremely linear (defect that AvP2 also had), moreover, as in the case of the first mission of the Predalien, the feeling of Dej-Vu, is really there, given that it must be faced exactly like that of the original game (I wonder what's the point of that). Speaking of the Predalien, this represents the real novelty of the game, given that it is the new character present, the corporate is always the same (even if we play the role of the beautiful and resolute Dunya) and we have two more weapons, the double pistol and the automatic turret, which can be positioned and armed at will. As for the Predator, we must say that in Primal Hunt we will find ourselves impersonating a proto-Predator imprisoned in the ice of LV1201 for 500 years and which possesses energy bolts that the ~normal~ Predator does not possess. This tension is unbearable. Let's hope it lasts! Paraphrasing Allan Poe, I remember that the greatest value of AvP2 was precisely the atmosphere that the game managed to give us and which unfortunately is not present in Primal Hunt. Meanwhile we are warned of the arrival of the Aliens by the change of music (I recommend deactivating it) and this makes the motion sensor almost useless, but above all the levels are poorly designed and worse balanced. Already at a normal level, we find ourselves forced to repeat a mission several times and this is because we are attacked by a ravenous horde of enemies. The problem is that these pop up suddenly and from everywhere, making the outcome of the clash random, like the very difficult last mission of the Corporate that.. well you will see. The situation is different with the Predator and Aliens episodes, but in both cases the pathos that made the game famous is missing, among other things there is a new presence on the planet, represented by some exotic animals that in my opinion warning, they have nothing to do with the rest and prove to be an unfortunate choice. The introduction of teammates in the Corporate episode was positive, who accompany us in the clashes against the Aliens, a pity that their artificial intelligence is not record-breaking. The graphics engine is the ~usual~ Lithtech which has the demerit of requiring large hardware resources and if this may be acceptable with other titles that adopt it as NOLF (by the way, there is a nice NOLF2 trailer on the CD), it cannot be with AvP, due to the frenzy of the clashes. If there are several Aliens on the screen it becomes worrying and in the end you succumb more to the clicks of the graphics engine than to your own deficiencies in the fights. Conclusions I remind you that the game is sold at a ~political~ price of about uro 30.00, that the localization in Italian is free from defects (indeed I liked it a lot) and that the Multiplayer modes have remained practically unchanged (there are also the old maps of AvP2). Drawing conclusions is never easy and this time more than ever. For some time now, excellent professional-level Add-ons and Mods have been available on the Internet and absolutely free, so the manufacturers have to make an effort to do something valid and worth the money spent, in this regard I remember the beautiful Add-Ons by Half Life, Blue Shift and Counterstrike and I really don't feel like comparing Primal Hunt to either of these two. Well, if you are a lover of the series then the matter changes. Terror is among us again Aliens Vs Predator 2 (here our review) was one of the best games of last season to such an extent that during the voting of our ~Game of the Year~ it earned, deservedly, the title of ~game with the best Atmosphere published in 2001 and therefore we can only greet with great joy the release of an official Add-On with the evocative title of Primal Hunt. Well, at this point we just have to take the nice DVD package, unleash our retractable claw and after cutting the cellophane and being careful not to leave traces of our foul-smelling slime on the precious CD, we start installing the game and here it is we have a first, unpleasant surprise. Primal Hunt, to run on our machines, requires the original game to be installed, but it also requires a different directory than the one where the original AvP2 is located and requires at least 600 Mbytes of space, the amazing thing is that within this directory we find everything you need to run the game, even what was already available with AvP2. I honestly don't understand the reason for this choice, but it must also be said that our Hard Disks have become very large and therefore it is also possible to overlook something like this. Sure and that this shows rough care in packaging the product.", "date": "2002-09-23", "grade": null}
