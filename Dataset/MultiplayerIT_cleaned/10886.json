Holy Massacre Developed by Rebellion and based on a famous (at least in its native land) British comic book, Rogue Trooper was received rather lukewarmly by both the public and critics in its original triple incarnation: passing over the questionable operation that led to the decision of this conversion for Wii, let's see what are the characteristics that distinguish it from the dated 2006 product. Not many, to tell the truth: the title has basically remained the same, that is an action game that puts the user in the shoes of a genetically modified soldier to survive a hostile environment - the planet Nu Earth - torn apart by a war between two rival factions. In this context, 13 missions filled with many firefights, some stealth elements and a splash of tactics, daughter of the only truly innovative element of the entire Rebellion production, have to be faced. In the early stages of the adventure, the protagonist Rogue will find himself collecting the chips containing the personalities of three of his fallen comrades, to immediately implant them in as many components of his equipment: Gunner, the weapons expert, is able to upgrade the rifle as well as to act as a mobile turret; Bagman allows you to transform your backpack into a production center for upgrades, new items of equipment or even just ammunition for your weapons; Finally, Helm takes up residence inside the helmet, and is useful for circumventing electronic devices, as well as for confusing enemies by producing holograms. Although appreciable, this gameplay element fails to impose itself in a particularly strong way, and it is therefore easily possible to complete the adventure almost never using the help of one's companions: in this eventuality, Rogue Trooper is reduced to a shooter in third barely discreet person, with his nice cover system, a fairly well-stocked arsenal and a vast array of enemies with not too developed artificial intelligence. In short, we are not talking about a bad title, but simply an average action game, which certainly was not at the top of the wish list of Wii users for a possible conversion on their console. You are not what you used to be As it is reasonable to expect, however, the control system has been largely rewritten in order to adapt to the Remote + Nunchuck combo, with results that in truth sometimes make us regret a classic controller. You move using the analog stick, while the viewfinder and camera management is completely entrusted to the movements of the Remote, which obviously do not offer the same precision and speed as a ~physical~ device. It must be said that the developers have tried to overcome these problems both through a lock-on (activated with the Z key) which blocks the camera on an enemy, allowing you to aim more accurately, and by equipping the standard rifle with a sort of auto-aim which corrects the shots fired by the user just enough: both appreciable solutions, but which cannot make us forget how much more comfortable a normal controller would be. Even secondary actions (such as adjusting the zoom of the sniper rifle or throwing grenades) have been delegated to movements to be performed by tilting the Remote and Nunchuck, with all in all acceptable results but which - again - absolutely cannot compete with conventional systems. This Wii conversion of Rogue Trooper could have enjoyed more depth if the developers had inserted some more relevant content, but this was not the case: an aspect that immediately emerges from the graphics sector, which remained stuck in 2006 with its nice load of models rough polygonal, far from complex scenarios and textures that appear poorly defined even by the modest standards of the Nintendo console. And nothing has been done even with regard to the playful contents: the single player campaign is therefore short as in the previous incarnations, and the multiplayer is even penalized, given that support for online play has inevitably been excluded from this Wii version. leaving only a frankly useless split-screen section in the field. Comment Rogue Trooper has certainly not been converted to Wii due to its intrinsic qualities, on the contrary: the impression is that onewanted to revive an objectively old game on the best-selling console in the world, in the hope of obtaining appreciable success with minimal effort. It is unlikely that the Rebellion title will achieve this goal, given the limited appeal it will have on the casual public and the indifference it will inevitably generate on hardcore gamers, accustomed to products of a completely different thickness: short, graphically dated and with little personality from a playful point of view , Rogue Trooper is a game that, for the second time around, will most likely be forgotten very soon. On the Nintendo console, the initial enthusiasm has long since passed, it's time to demand something more ...
