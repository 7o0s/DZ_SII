Alone against everyone. It's the hard work of sharpshooters like Jonathan North, a Marine entered into the Joint Special Operations Command, trained to strike accurately in quick and ~silent~ missions. Just like the one he's been assigned: to sabotage separatist operations and neutralize their leaders who destabilize the Republic of Georgia, a region of critical strategic importance that is slipping into the chaos of civil war. Jon, codenamed Lodestar, actually has a second, more personal purpose: to save his brother Robert, who has been missing for two years and who appears to be a prisoner in an area controlled by separatists. A ~secondary~ objective for the USA but primary for the military, torn between his sense of duty and his love for his relative. To try to end both operations in the best possible way, North can count on the support of Lydia Jorjadze, a mercenary who in the past fought alongside him in Afghanistan and with whom he had a relationship, and on a member of MOSSAD, the secret service Israeli. The story of Sniper: Ghost Warrior 3 starts and evolves around this incipit, divided into four acts, a tactical shooter that emphasizes the role of the sniper, and which passes from a particular and contained formula to an open world structure with broader and commercial multiple approaches, somewhat reminiscent of the latest Far Cry. Sniper: Ghost Warrior 3, an open world with snipers with a lot of potential not all expressed properly Behind enemy lines As we wrote on the occasion of some previews, the possibility of moving freely, the use of vehicles, the huge map with various points of interest to visit or enemy outposts to liberate, the large valleys where you can look around, actually give feeling of being faced with something very similar to the aforementioned Ubisoft title, only with more accurate ballistics and an emphasis placed on long-range assaults. Sniper: Ghost Warrior 3, as it should be, focuses on a different playability than a Call of Duty, even if even here there are some more ~dynamic~ and somewhat linear sessions. From this point of view, in fact, the title offers a series of quite varied main and secondary missions with three different types of free approach to each of them (except some where you have to follow a certain line dictated by the story), so as to still have a good alternation between the phases of pure sniping and moments in which, for example, one is also called upon to recover documents, to hack alarm systems and cameras with a drone, to have to infiltrate inside outposts to free prisoners or to investigate and get on the trail of some mysterious killer. Given the nature of the production, but also for the convenience of the player as we will see later, the slower and more reasoned action of the sniper therefore predominates, where strategy, tactics and patience play a role in 90% of cases fundamental, together with ballistics. It is in fact one of the strengths of the game, and apart from some glitches every now and then, it generally works well: shooting in a hurry, perhaps using a heavy 50-caliber shotgun while sitting, or worse still, standing, means, for example, missing the target . In short, it is better to do things properly, losing in mobility, but gaining in accuracy. Therefore, on the one hand, it becomes essential to exploit the wide arsenal available to equip oneself with the model of rifle and the most suitable projectiles for the type of mission, obviously without forgetting to carry along a handgun, a dagger and other support objects such as explosives to use to cover the escape or undermine possible vulnerable points from where some enemy could surprise North. On the other hand, making good use of the crafting system, which allows you to intervene on some fundamental components of the character's arsenal in special shelters where it is also possible to just rest, pass the time or select missions. For example, with the necessary materials in your pocket, you can repair objects, or configure an assault rifle as a medium-range sniper rifle complete with silencer, or as a light machine gun. And again, build different types of bullets: the standard ones, those suitable for piercing the armor of the vehicles or those made on purpose to knock men out, perhaps from a very long distance.za. There are also DARPA ones that correct the trajectory of the shot in flight. In short, non-trivial choices that have an important impact on the continuation of the missions and on the life or death of the gamer, especially in the advanced stages of the story. Many of these components are to be found within the areas in which the protagonist finds himself acting, therefore the exploratory phase is not to be underestimated at all, also because it can lead to truly important discoveries, even useful for deepening the plot. In this sense there is a particular function that is activated via the L1 backbone, a sort of Batman-style detective view that is very useful for highlighting traces on the ground, on doors, spikes to cling to, points to lurk and other clues or otherwise invisible elements. Playstation 4 trophies Sniper: Ghost Warrior 3 offers 48 Trophies of which 36 Bronze, 8 Silver, 3 Gold and Platinum. To unlock them you have to meet some specific requests of the game, which in ascending order can be those of neutralizing 50% of the targets from the most wanted list in a game, hunting a certain number of animals or eliminating some snipers, just to name a few. In the center of the viewfinder Once you have entered into action, you need to choose the best position to lie in, carefully study the area in which you have to operate and collect as much information as possible, identifying and marking at the same time the individual targets through the work of the drone or binoculars, to have always keep an eye on their position. Time and weather conditions should not be underestimated, given that the latter sometimes limit visibility and noise, but can also create problems in identifying targets or using certain weapons correctly. Once in possession of the necessary indications and having planned the best tactic to avoid being discovered, one is ready to shoot, paying however attention to the direction of the wind, the distance of the victim, the oscillation of the weapon and the temperature: all factors that could in turn affect the success of successful shots and the mission. Hitting a sentinel too visible or making a mistake, the alarm immediately goes off among the ranks of the separatists, with the risk of unleashing a real manhunt, a very dangerous situation, at least for a few minutes. In fact, the enemies they seem to shine with logic, and often exhibit limited artificial intelligence. If they manage to close every escape route for the protagonist, they are capable of implementing good outflanking tactics or some combined attacks, but in fact it is enough to move away from one's position towards the bush or slip into a building to become almost completely invisible to the group of ~hunters~ who, confused, ends up wondering where the infiltrator is and then calms down. The same also happens when it comes to fighting from a distance, with enemy soldiers who are more likely to hide than to react adequately to the threat with combined actions. This at least at the Normal game level (basically there are three, the others are Difficult and Extreme), where things get a little more complicated later in the adventure, when snipers, mortars, armored and reinforcements called in by radio, which quickly bring small groups of extra opponents onto the field. Obviously, as written before, the game does not forbid you to approach the objectives to kill or destroy them by looking at them more closely. Sniper: Ghost Warrior 3, in fact, offers two other types of approach to missions, in addition to the sniper approach we have talked about: one, Ghost, is of the stealth type, and involves having to move in the shadows taking into account different factors to not to be discovered, such as light, noise, surveillance cameras, and so on. Interesting scenario in which to operate but not very varied overall and to be balanced in certain mechanics, especially in the behavioral routines of the sentinels in terms of attention (it is not uncommon to kill a guard in broad daylight while his colleague is a few tens of meters away even if realizes it), and alert (it fades quickly, as in many other stealth titles to be honest). The second method, on the other hand, is to act lance in rest, attacking and shooting like a madman at everything that moves, but with the real risk of coming to a bad end after a few steps in a ~mode~, Warrior, rather crude from the point of gunplay view. In short, you will have understood that regardless of the three options available, the title seems to favor and mainly reward the sniper approach, relegating the other two to the role of supporting actors to be used only for the curiousty or to complete the work, but rarely as a main option, except in some more linear mission specifically designed for them by the developers. And it is precisely this aspect, probably, one of the limits of a production which, according to the developers, aimed at diversifying the offer, because in fact a sort of rather repetitive game scheme is created which leads the user to almost always act at the same same way: to mark all the enemies in place, to take them out for the most part from a distance and then complete it all with some close-up action. Someone could argue that being a title focused on snipers it makes sense, but then why talk about ~freedom of approach~ if this is granted up to a certain point? In any case, returning to the missions themselves, upon completion of each of them, based on the actions performed, experience points are earned and Skill points are obtained which can be spent in each of the corresponding specialization paths, i.e. Sniper, Ghost or Warrior. It is also possible to unlock new features always linked to the three available branches and therefore to the combat, concealment and gadget management skills, to make the old North more and more competitive. Operation Georgia We obviously cannot conclude our review without first analyzing the technological part. In this sense, from a visual point of view, Sniper: Ghost Warrior 3 offers truly suggestive glimpses, thanks to the CryEngine and a good level design, which proves to be varied enough to offer fairly diversified areas, ranging from wooded areas to others flatter, up to urban agglomerations and military bases. But above all to the good implementation of particle, atmospheric and light and shadow effects, which by acting in combination with each other and with the dynamic weather and the day and night cycle, give users a good overview helping to give them a greater sense of identification. Where, however, the engine limps is in the architecture of the buildings, which appear rough and quite flat-looking, as well as in some textures. The latter are generally well made, especially as regards those related to natural elements such as rocks, land and flora, but they disappoint on the characters, protagonists and supporting actors. In this sense there are inexplicable contrasts for example between those that cover certain faces compared to others that are used for clothes, which are less defined if not flat. Even a large part of the polygonal models of the characters did not convince us, since they seem to come from at least a generation of consoles ago. To complete the picture of the defects there are also some movements, which sometimes appear stiff, as if there were no connection points between one action and another, and the long loading screens that can last up to four or five minutes per times. Also worth noting are some graphical glitches, such as for example a sniper's rifle that we had eliminated which hovered in the air with the marker indicating, among other things, the active presence of its owner, even though he was already dead, and a couple of freezes during the adventure that forced us to restart from the last check point. As far as the audio part is concerned, the dubbing in English is good, with an all in all decent acting taking into account some truly B-Movie lines of dialogue, with incoherent jokes that often clash with the drama of certain topics, and the effects ambient sounds, from the typical sounds of the night in wild areas to the loudest ones in the morning near inhabited places. The soundtrack is average, which however does not fail to offer some good ideas in terms of songs, especially when there is some situations to ~underline~ in the most dramatic phases of the story.", "date": "2017-04-26", "grade": "7.0"}
