WRC 6 is proposed as an evolved version compared to the last chapter, which certainly denounced various uncertainties, despite an encouraging first attempt all in all. The expectations for this second appointment were therefore quite high, considering that the excellent DiRT Rally has dramatically raised the qualitative bar in the genre, we were therefore very interested in discovering the improvements made to this episode and how much it could represent an alternative to the splendid work of Codemasters. Read on to find out how it went. WRC 6 manages to entertain thanks to its hybrid driving system A bunch of content Once we launched the game we were somewhat surprised by the chronic lack of novelty in the presentation of the menus, almost indistinguishable from last year. Everything remained unchanged, including the choice of colors and the depressing symphonic music relegated to the background. It must be said that the menus are quite functional, but as a first approach it denotes a certain laziness on the part of Kylotonn Games, even considering the fact that the combination of acid green and white, not exactly ideal, could have been changed at least. The game options are the same as we already know, including the quick race and the career, which however benefits from some significant changes: we are still a long way from more refined products such as the Codemasters ones, but at least there is a certain commitment in proposing a single player mode more complex than the previous one. In addition to the entire WRC championship and associated categories, it is also possible to customize your rally by choosing the desired stage. The choice is vast and it is also the most important advantage on DiRT Rally, 14 stages that include different circuits, in total more than 60. We find the inevitable rally of Sardinia, the German one and even the Chinese one, the Beijing Rally 2016. news to highlight is the presence of super special stages, absent in the previous chapter, which further increase the number of circuits and which bring, as in the case of the Spanish rally, the city tracks. Each stage can be covered, in the case of the free game, at different times of the day and weather conditions, but the rain remains confined to specific locations. At this point only the Rally Cross races are missing from a truly satisfying package, which includes the entire 2017 eSports WRC season as standard. The contents are many and guarantee a high longevity. Hybrid mud The driving system used for WRC 6 does not differ from the previous one and still consists of a hybrid between simulation and arcade simplicity, and is a reasonable choice so as not to collide directly with the simulation rigor of the competition. It only takes a few minutes to become familiar with braking and drifting, aided by a deliberately approximate interpretation of the terrain to ensure considerable stability of the vehicle. The same circuit design adapts to this unambitious but practical system, giving less realism and enriching the races with some more articulated and rather amusing passages, even if sometimes not always legible. This does not mean that WRC 6 is an easy title, on the contrary, the curves must be interpreted correctly to avoid unpleasant exits from the road or impacts on the track, furthermore a new, very severe penalty system has been implemented: even just a reset of the position of the car, often necessary after serious accidents, is paid for by the addition of precious seconds. This is a novelty that we did not fully appreciate, since the error itself already costs an often fatal loss of time in terms of records, this system makes it more difficult to reach the top positions in the rankings. The rewind option to recover wrong maneuvers has also been completely eliminated, a courageous and consistent choice with the penalties, but which ends up exacerbating the consequences of the above. Another novelty of the career, which includes stables and names faithful to reality, is represented by the setting of the car, much more elaborate than in the previous chapter but which does not influence race performance all that much. Of note is the commendable inclusion of split-screen for multiplayer games. Playstation 4 trophies WRC 6 presents a fair number of trophies to conquer, considering the amount of content present it will take some time to reach the coveted Platinum, but at least you are certain that by finishing all the stages, therefore facing the game normally, you will immediately win 14 bronze medals. In search of fluidity Technically Kylotonn Games has worked hard to improve its title, if the menus do not testify to big news and rather suggest an update, once you get on track the differences compared to last year are immediately evident. The Xbox One version of WRC 5 ran at 30 frames per second and many uncertainties, the PlayStation 4 version of WRC 6 used for the review is more ambitious and aims at sixty frames, although more or less abrupt drops remain, especially when cornering and based to the complexity of the scenario or the effects. The result is an inconsistent rendering that does not benefit much from the fluidity, burdened among other things by an invasive screen tearing. Essentially, in an attempt to keep the frame rate stable, the graphics engine is forced to split the screen in two, with severe deterioration of the image. The compromises are not limited to this, but also involve the same details of the settings, which are more simplified as a polygonal load and have numerous pop-in effects. Textures in the distance lose detail considerably. The cars, on the other hand, are very well made, detailed and full of effects on the bodywork. Another step forward is recorded in terms of lighting and effects, clearly superior to last year and which can be best expressed in dawn races, with a truly pleasant rendering. The audio, on the other hand, fluctuates: some bugs of the previous chapter have not been resolved, such as a sporadic echo effect on the engines that should only occur in the galleries, but the general quality has fortunately increased. The audio accompaniment - completely in Italian - has results that are not always appreciable, WRC 6 is characterized by a decidedly talkative commentator, who accompanies us by explaining the menus but also commenting on the races and previews of our opponents, with a pleasant television presentation style effect . Once in the race, however, the same voice assumes the role of navigator, with sometimes hilarious effects: the speed with which the curves are read and the difference in tonality used during the recording phase, with vigorous exclamations out of place, makes the interpretation of the tracks very chaotic.", "date": "2016-11-01", "grade": "7.2"}
