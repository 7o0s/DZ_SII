The long-awaited Switch version of the title, contrary to the initial promises, instead took several months to wait. Officially postponed pending a specific Unity update, it is certainly strange to believe that this detail alone could have led to more than six months of delay; whatever the reason, Battle Chasers is now available to all Nintendo users. We played it again and want to talk specifically about what works and doesn't work in this version. In the light of everything, an obviously worthy title is confirmed and which, despite its simplicity, tries to give new breath to the genre of classic JRPGs. One glove to rule them all The story of Battle Chasers: Nightwar is based on a comic series from the 90s of the Madureira state: closed after a small number of releases, over time it has accumulated a large number of fans, as well as the adoration of the same author. These two factors convinced the cartoonist's newborn studio to launch a crowdfunding campaign for the creation of an isometric view JRPG, set in the world of Battle Chasers. This is the background; in practice, however, it is also the only possible introduction to be made. The game starts right in the middle of the action, with the protagonists being attacked on their airship and falling on an unknown island. From here they embark on a journey that leads them to more or less deepen the relationships between them, and to get to know a series of non-player characters with fluctuating charisma. The first ten hours, precisely because of this substantial lack of background, is difficult to digest and struggles to create the right empathy in the player which is the basis of this type of experience. Certainly those who know the comic series have an advantage and will be able to enjoy detailed knowledge that all the other players can just guess through some dialogues, often relegated to the scenes between one night and another in an inn. As the hours go by, however, the narrative takes flight and also offers some moments of high entertainment, between a dungeon and a tour of the lands of the island. Nothing particular as regards the secondary quests, few and which aim to deepen some aspect related to the culture of the place and the races that populate it. Old and new habits As far as the gameplay side is concerned, Battle Chasers never hides its desire to recall history. All combat is managed via an extremely old-fashioned turn-based system, complete with a sidebar to indicate the action queue of heroes and opponents. Of the six protagonists that can be recruited during the adventure, three will always be deployable, with the unfortunate design choice of not being able to change the party except inside the inn or before accessing a dungeon. As if that weren't enough, all the characters not called to fight will be exempt from the growth and accumulation of experience, leading you soon to choose a party which, barring particular surprises or extreme grinding, will turn into your group for almost entirety of the adventure. To spice up such standard fights there are a couple of mechanics that play on the depth of tactical choices that are interesting, especially for tackling dungeons at higher difficulty levels. Each basic attack among those available for each character (as you level up you always unlock new ones, with different damage and effects) will lead to an increase in the mana bar (called overload) which will allow you to take advantage of special abilities, without the need to spend points. The use and management of this mechanic will often make the difference between life and death and will result in the best opportunity in terms of resource exploitation. Furthermore, each attack carried out or immediately will allow you to load an additional bar intended for the Ultra. In this case it is an element common to all the party and which can therefore be exploited by a single character at a time. To fill the time between one fight and another, navigation on the world map takes care of it, indeed extremely basic and perhaps the worst element of the title, linked to a movement on tracks that allows you nothing more than to follow the few roads present. Different speech regarding the dungeons, well made and full of crossroads and traps, as well as resources to collect and fishing areas, to be exploited to accumulate some precious objects and materials. Do not miss all the management of the loot, broadly taken from titles such as Diablo: this is divided by categoryrie and rarities, linked to the usual colors. Each weapon, armor or accessory you collect will have unique stats and perks and it's up to you to find the right combination to become true killing machines. Out of tune note regarding alchemy and crafting in general, an element entered by achieving a goal during the Kickstarter campaign, of which we note the addition made later. It is useful for the creation of some basic elements, or particular consumables, but nothing that cannot be done without to continue and reach the conclusion of the adventure. A ride on the train We come to the crux of this piece: how does Battle Chasers: Nightwar look like on Nintendo Switch? It is useless to utter the usual pleasantries and various banalities on the taste that one feels in playing a title of this genre on the move: Battle Chasers seems to be designed exactly for use with the Nintendo flagship. Colorful and inspired, with a high-class character design and animations, unfortunately it still fails to hold a candle to the other versions. Undermined by really too long uploads and a dancer frame rate (especially when exploring dungeons), the Switch version is essential for all players who love portability, while it is still light years away from the usability that the equivalent on can boast pc. Furthermore, if you add to the package a cost increased by ten euros compared to the other versions (often even at a discount), it is obvious that Battle Chasers is not advisable for a living room player, while those who usually use Switch on the move, inside and outside the home , will find a faithful travel companion in Madureira's title, embellished with an exorbitant attention to detail and a desire to surprise old-school players.", "date": "2018-06-08", "grade": "7.5"}
