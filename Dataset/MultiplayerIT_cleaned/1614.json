The medieval-themed party game has expanded on the good things proposed in the first game, but will have been able to solve the problems with the previous title? Let's find out together in our review. To the fight Knight Squad 2: Fight! Knight Squad 2 is, through and through, Knight Squad. This is what fans of the first chapter will notice immediately. Chainsawesome Games has staked everything on changing the original structure as little as possible and simply expanding the amount of content available and updating the graphics. We will be able to play locally, either alone against bots or against a series of friends, or online. Just like in the first chapter, each mode requires eight players. Many modes can be played in different formats, i.e. in a free-for-all, in pairs or in two teams of four players. The strength of Knight Squad 2 is certainly the amount of modes available, each of which has various maps that change the cards on the table. Knight Squad 2: Grailsteal Knight Squad 2 offers some already known modes, plus some interesting new features. We will have Rubagraal at our disposal, which asks us to obtain the well-known mythological cup and bring it back to our base to earn points. Then there is a similar mode, but only for teams, Rubabandiera. Football is also back, with its huge ball. Then we have Gladiator, which requires you to stay as long as possible within a designated area, eliminating your opponents and trying not to be destroyed in turn. Also inevitable is a Battle Royale mode, which gives us only one life and asks us to win a certain number of rounds by remaining the last knight standing. Then Mastodon returns, a mode where there is a huge machine gun that gives us great power and allows us to easily obtain points, but at the same time makes us the target of all seven other players. Knight Squad 2 also offers Domination, a classic mode in which we have to walk over points on the map to conquer them and get points over time. Knight Squad 2: Football It continues with Crystal Rush, where two teams face each other trying to destroy the three opposing crystals, while trying to defend their own. Soul-catcher asks us to eliminate the enemies to get their soul, to then be transported to our base to get points: if we are eliminated before putting the souls in our pockets, they are stolen from us. Race, on the other hand, offers us a route and asks us to arrive first: killing an opponent allows you to get a speed bonus, so it's difficult to stay in first position. Servants of the master allows us to create a minion every time we eliminate our opponents: the minions must then be freed and will attack the enemy castle. It doesn't end there, because then there is Explosive Cargo: a trolley on a track to be pushed towards the enemy area. Finally, we have Painter, a sort of Splatoon in which we have to color the ground to get more points: creating a closed outline allows us to capture all the internal squares, so every movement must be carefully calibrated! The list of modes is therefore considerable and all of them work quite well, especially since they have various maps, which change the cards on the table. You can also set various modifiers to customize the experience. Let's not forget that Knight Squad 2, like the first chapter, provides us with multiple weapons with which to battle our opponents. The easiest to find are the power sword or bow, but there are also wands that fire electric homing shots, fireballs that create fiery death zones, rocket launchers, boomerangs (deadlier than you think), war horses , laser guns, as well as lifesaving shields and movement speed boosts. Intense but chaotic Knight Squad 2 Despite being a very fast party game (usually three minutes, but you can also decrease if you want lightning games), Knight Squad 2 manages to create very intense and eventful clashes. The original mix still works, and the new content only adds to the fun and variety. The real problem of Knight Squad 2 is that together with the merits it also brings with it the defects from the first chapter, above all an all too confusing structure. The review was done with the Nintendo Switch version of the game and we played in both handheld and TV versions. While using a 50-inch screen at a distance we don't want to share with our eye doctor, we haveoften struggled to understand what was happening on screen during crowds of enemies. The top view pays the price for the size of the maps: the characters are small and the visual effects of the attacks sometimes drown out the action. If you are looking for a chaotic party game, it will not be a problem, if you are super competitive and want a title in which to become champions, you might be annoyed. That said, Knight Squad 2 is a fun title locally and even online if you can play with a friend on headphones. There's no need to adopt complex strategies, but in squad or duo modes a little coordination can certainly help. Finally, the developers have excellently refreshed the visual side of the title. While retaining the same original style, the game is a little more three-dimensional and pleasing to the eye.", "date": "2021-04-13", "grade": "7.8"}
