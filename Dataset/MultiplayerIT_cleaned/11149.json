{"name": "Wonder Blocks", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wonder-blocks_a.html", "text": "The mobile video game market is growing, there's no doubt about it, and within it Gameloft plays a leading role. Founded in 1999, the French software house over the years has multiplied the number of its employees (they are now more than four thousand) as well as its turnover, already making profits since 2003. Its catalog now boasts many titles, many of which represent the best of their respective genres: original productions such as Soul of Darkness, Real Football: Manager Edition 2009, NBA Smash!, Midnight Bowling 2, but also important tie-ins such as The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, Assassin's Creed (also in for Nintendo DS), Heroes, CSI, Grey's Anatomy and so on. The list is really long and varied, but not at the expense of quality: in this sense, Gameloft has accustomed us to really high standards, and Wonder Blocks is just one more example. It is a puzzle game characterized by an original, varied and rich gameplay. From the start screen we can access the ~quick play~, ~story~ and ~challenge~ modes. In the first case it is a quick game, with random parameters, while it is clear that we will find greater depth in the other two options: the first will see seven locations divided into various stages, complete with boss fights; the second to participate only in single challenges, at least in those unlocked up to that moment. As mentioned above, in Wonder Blocks we will have the usual blocks that fall from above and that must be placed at the bottom of the level, but you don't have to fit them together or pair them for a possible elimination. The aim of the game, in fact, is to create a tower of stacked blocks that reaches a certain height. This is not a very simple matter, as we will often have completely different blocks, some triangular or hollowed out, and we will have to put them on top of each other, always keeping an eye on the bar that indicates the balance of the structure. Having a tower that dangles left and right may not be the best, but it can work if it is close to reaching the height necessary to complete the stage. And, in any case, it is possible to arrange the blocks so as to exert pressure in the most critical area, with the aim of normalizing the center of gravity of the building. Bringing pieces of the same color into contact allows us to collect extra points and unlock various challenges and objects, but it doesn't make things easier for us. This basic mechanic is joined by several others that shuffle the cards on the table: sometimes we will have to throw the blocks following trajectories from the side areas of the screen, in other cases it will be necessary to reproduce figures with their own tower. And let's not forget the boss fights, which boast a unique structure for each location, based mostly on timing. The control system is very simple: with the d-pad of the mobile we can move the block during its descent, with the 0 key we rotate it clockwise and finally with the 5 key we can make it fall rapidly. The game boasts a truly spectacular technical realization, whose most appreciable element is undoubtedly the style: Wonder Blocks is full of cute and very likeable characters, the graphic effects are really beautiful to look at and the use of colors is absolutely masterful. In these respects, the new Gameloft title is really out of the box and deserves at least a conversion to a portable console. The sound amazes for the quality of the music and effects, which for once are reproduced simultaneously and without any problems. If we really want to find a technical defect, it must be said that the uploads are not always very fast... PRO Solid, varied and addictive gameplay A good number of stages and challenges High-end graphics and sound AGAINST Long uploads Sometimes frustrating", "date": "2008-10-05", "grade": "S.V."}
