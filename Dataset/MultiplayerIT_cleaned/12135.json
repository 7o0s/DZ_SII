{"name": "Dawnspire - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dawnspire-recensione.html", "text": "Fundamental choices, questionable mechanics Once the client is installed, it is surprising how easy it is to enter the mechanisms of Dawnspire: the gameplay offers team battles for up to 16 players, taking advantage of a series of immense maps within which relics are distributed to be stolen and taken to one's base, outposts to be captured and, in general, a series of places where you can collide with your opponents. It was therefore preferred not to prepare a multitude of modalities, opting rather for the inclusion of all the challenges within each single game, leaving it to the host to decide how many points to assign to the various objectives. Immediate, it was said, and in fact what has just been written would already be more than enough to show what is offered to the player, who never feels oppressed by cascades of menus and options. Your alter ego must be selected from a roster of five classes, each of which offers some sets of ready-to-use skills which, the more experienced, will be able to mix together, so as to obtain new and more lethal combinations. The choices are rather traditional - paladins, healers, magicians, fighters and assassins - but it is very impressive how the actual differences between them are very marked, so as to make sure, for example, that each team must always protect its own healer, to avoid to see him die and have no cover during the long seconds that separate him from rebirth. If you find yourself particularly comfortable with a group of friends, it will be possible to create your own guild, so as to have all the tools to better organize training sessions and make contact with other teams, to then challenge them and check your skills. The first few hours therefore flow pleasantly, leaving the first crunches to appear in the following sessions, which manifest themselves in all their importance when one perceives how the substantial simplicity of the rules ends up becoming repetitive of proposed situations, especially boring the more experienced and profound connoisseurs of the genre. Few pretensions and the great alternative Therefore half convinced by the gameplay, it is necessary to highlight the way in which the flaws are reflected on the actual usability of the experience. MMOGs have a limit: people tend to use them one at a time, abandoning them only after a long time and only for high-sounding, noble productions. Dawnspire has therefore not yet managed to create a solid community and this has repercussions on the number of servers present, which can often be counted on the fingers of one hand. Of course, there are always legions of computer-controlled bots available, but the artificial intelligence that controls them really leaves something to be desired, making you lose the desire to use them in minutes. The graphic sector fluctuates, which is divided between a rather spot-on design although it recalls the abused fantasy and a certain poverty of polygons and textures, which does not do justice to the power offered by modern PCs. On the other hand  and rightly so  the required system specifications are moderate, even if one must be careful not to own an ATI 9000  9250 video card, as compatibility has been completely neglected. Finally a comparison. Since Dawnspire is based entirely on player versus player, it is difficult not to refer to Guild Wars, with which it also shares a substantially identical game interface, and which however manages to outclass it from every point of view: both have no monthly fee, but where Dawnspire proves limited in its simplicity, Guild Wars maintains a fundamental immediacy, while contemplating the presence of hundreds of combinations and challenges, millions of users and, why not, also a solid structure of PvE instances. The choice is therefore not that difficult. System requirements Minimum Requirements: Processor: Pentium 4 2 GHz RAM: 512 MB Video Card: 128 MB, PixelShader 2.0 Hard Disk Space: 1 GB Test Configuration: Processor: Intel Pentium 4 3.4 GHz HT RAM: 1 GB Video Card: Nvidia 7900 Comment Dawnspire is and remains a sufficient title, perhaps even something more. Unfortunately, however, the same flaws that do not allow a higher evaluation, have prevented a greater success and the consequent creation of a solid and lasting community. It therefore proves to be good for all those who want to approach a competitive title that can be played entirely online for the first time, offering a few immediately clear rules, while it will hardly satisfy those who have been hanging out in the world of MMOGs for some time. In any case, it is good to try it before proceeding with the purchase, perhaps by taking advantage of the free trial period obtainable on the official website. Pros Simple and immediate Well balanced classes Cons Too limited for a good portion of users Youcnically not perfect There is no shortage of alternatives It hasn't been long since the introduction of MMOGs in the PC gaming world, that a flood of developers have already understood their enormous potential, investing in the creation of titles that have more or less persistent characteristics and with the common denominator of being able to be played exclusively  or almost  online. This is the case of Dawnspire, an action RPG created by Silent Grove and bearer of a philosophy that opposes the enormous delays and difficulties proposed by the most famous mass titles, offering the possibility of being competitive right from the first game and to remain so even without committing hours of your time every day.", "date": "2007-07-06", "grade": null}
