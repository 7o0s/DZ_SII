In this review you will necessarily find some advances on the plot of Final Fantasy XV, especially in the second paragraph entitled ~Chapter 13 according to Gladiolus~. Read at your own risk! Final Fantasy XV is a title that has raised enormous controversy in recent months and has failed to convince everyone, splitting critics and the public in two. There are those who liked it - for example we, who awarded it a 9 in our review - and those who just didn't digest it, demonstrating that Hajime Tabata's revolutionary approach to such a loved and famous franchise it sure was easy. One of the criticisms on which we all somewhat agreed, however, concerns the quality of the storytelling: Final Fantasy XV tells a good story, but at times one gets the impression that something is missing or that Square Enix has failed to well convey his intentions on the matter. The publication of the DLC related to the misadventures of Noctis' travel companions exacerbates suspicions. Was it a plan hatched from the beginning? Or has the developer failed to complete the game before launch, deferring the telling of some subplots to the DLCs that will be released between now and the end of the year? Be that as it may, the first of these DLCs, titled Episode Gladiolus, is finally here: now that we've completed it, we're ready to tell you if it's worth buying and playing. The vicissitudes of Gladiolus in the first DLC of Final Fantasy XV: an obligatory purchase? Playstation 4 trophies In Episode Gladiolus you can unlock seven trophies: five bronze, one silver and one gold. A couple are quite simple and can be obtained in the first game, while the others are a bit more demanding: some, for example, require you to play the extra modes that are unlocked after the final boss. Battle on the bridge Episode Gladio explains what happened to Gladiolus Amicitia - friend, mentor and bodyguard of the protagonist Noctis - after Ravus Nox Fleuret, Lunafreya's brother, beat our four heroes with thrashing. In the game, Gladiolus temporarily left Noctis's team and only reappeared later, somewhat surprisingly and with a couple more scars on which he never unbuttoned much, also because at that moment the prince of Lucis and the others had other fish to fry. In the DLC we discover that Gladio, mortified at not being able to protect his king, had contacted Cor Leonis, the right arm of the late King Regis, to ask him to accompany him to pass a test that Cor himself had faced thirty years earlier. It's about challenging Gilgamesh, the Lord of Swords, a warrior who lives holed up in a quarry in the Cleigne region. That's where the mission begins, actually a restricted area made up of ups and downs and tunnels where, in the role of Gladiolus, we will have to face hordes of enemies and some intermediate bosses before the final duel. The Final Fantasy XV combat system has been simplified for the occasion: in the absence of projection, Gladiolus can materialize a shield to protect himself and each hit parried temporarily enhances his subsequent attacks. Parrying an attack at the last moment, however, stuns the enemy and can counterattack with a devastating attack, perhaps crossed with those of Cor if the swordsman is nearby. Each successful hit charges another indicator that allows the use of some particularly powerful special attacks. They are very simple mechanics which, however, work really well, especially against the bosses: inspired by some recurring enemies in the saga, these opponents can launch attacks that Gladio can't parry and which must necessarily be dodged. In these situations, the DLC looks more like a kind of Monster Hunter or Dark Souls, in the sense that the player must necessarily learn the animations of the enemy and react accordingly without relying on a boorish and random keystroke. Despite being challenging, Episode Gladiolus is completed in just over an hour on the standard difficulty level... which is the higher of the two selectable ones. The optional dialogues between the protagonist and Cor reveal some interesting pieces of the complicated narrative mosaic that is Final Fantasy XV, shedding some light on the generation preceding Noctis and on the role of Gilgamesh in this whole story. Are these essential revelations? Not really; on the contrary, Episode Gladiolus adds little to Noctis' adventure and, in terms of content, it is actually the bonuses and extra modes that make sense of the price, however low, of the package: completing the mission unlocks a costume, a weapon and a secret technique noin the main campaign of Final Fantasy XV. Furthermore, once the DLC is finished, it is possible to play a kind of ~boss rush~ mode complete with score and leaderboard, as well as face a difficult extra battle. The two modes in question only partially prolong the experience, mind you, and their importance is absolutely subjective given that there are players who care absolutely nothing about scores and leaderboards. However, the music of this DLC deserves a special mention, because the main theme that accompanies the main menu of Episode Gladio and the new rearrangement by Keiichi Okabe of the legendary Clash on the Big Bridge - originally composed by Nobuo Uematsu for Final Fantasy V back in 1992 - are among the best songs of an already extraordinary soundtrack. Chapter 13 according to Gladius Chapter 13 of the original Final Fantasy XV campaign caused a lot of discussion and is generally considered the weakest moment of the game. From the point of view of raw gameplay, it is actually a problematic chapter: in this mission Noctis is alone and, deprived of weapons and powers, he can only rely on the magic of the Lucis ring and a semblance of stealth mechanics. All in all, the problems were bearable, but in fact that chapter lasted a bit too long and, also due to the closed and linear setting, ended up tiring the player. In reality, Chapter 13 hid a somewhat deeper meaning, but the lack of gameplay detracted from its true purpose. Chapter 13, in Tabata's original vision, was almost metaphorical: controlling a weakened, overwhelmed, alone and trapped Noctis, the player had to empathize with him. The entire structure of chapter 13 also materialized the Mephistophelean plan of Ardyn Izunia, the evil chancellor of Nifleheim: the long sequence of corridors in which the only voice to accompany Noctis is that of Ardyn himself represents the moment in which the prince of Lucis he realizes not only that he can travel only one road, but that the route has been traced by an enemy who has him in his grasp. Furthermore, in chapter 13, we discovered what had happened to some secondary characters such as Ravus and the emperor Aldercapt, but we ran into them after the fact: the game did not tell us what exactly had happened to those characters, respecting a narrative trick which serves to alienate the viewer. Noctis cannot know what happens in his absence, so he remains ignorant and this detail makes his character even more fragile in an extremely dramatic moment. The original idea was brave and we liked it, but Square Enix hadn't implemented it very well precisely because, in other moments of the game, we had witnessed some dialogues and events that had taken place in Noctis's absence: a detail that weakened not a little the narrative trick of chapter 13. It is clear, after all, that between the first and second half of Final Fantasy XV there is a certain discrepancy, and in the review we had noticed above all in the way in which the game went from an open world structure to a more linear. The update that immediately preceded the release of the Episode Gladio DLC implements additional content in the main menu of Final Fantasy XV: it is now possible to replay chapter 13 from the perspective of Gladio. In this much shorter variant of that mission, we control Gladius just like we do in the DLC and, together with an always blind but still much more mobile Ignis than in previous missions, we have to look for Noctis. It is an interlude that serves more than anything else to explain what happened to the aforementioned antagonists, even if the revelation in question is not exactly shocking and confirms - in a rather crude way - the identity of the powerful demon who haunted Noctis in the final corridors of chapter 13. Undoubtedly this addition improves one of the weakest moments of the adventure and the decision to implement Gladio's perspective, however late, is appreciable; however, it reminded us not a little of the fuss raised by the players at the end of Mass Effect 3, a controversy so enraged that it had forced BioWare to retrace its steps and publish a corrective patch that made the ending clearer. One wonders: was chapter 13 really incomplete or did Hajime Tabata have to bow his head because he had failed to fully convey his vision?", "date": "2017-04-03", "grade": "6.8"}
