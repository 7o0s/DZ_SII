{"name": "Leisure Suit Larry: Love for Sail", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/leisure-suit-larry-love-for-sail_a.html", "text": "As has been verified over and over again, mobile phones lend themselves well to certain genres of video games and less to others, for a series of both technical and practical reasons. It was enough to wait a while for the developers to commit themselves to finding solutions to each problem, and so here is a conversion with a very particular flavor, which re-proposes a genre compatible with portable devices (~point and click~ adventures) together to a very popular character, to try to break down the clich that wireless gaming must necessarily be limited to rapid and impromptu use. Leisure Suit Larry: Love for Sail therefore presents itself as a classic product in structure, perhaps simplified in the puzzles and with an intuitive interface, with particular attention to the dialogues and the ~mischievous~ humor that pervades them. It starts with a tutorial: Larry finds in the mail an invitation from his employers to participate in a course to improve productivity, and so we have to start by exploring his house to get everything we need to leave and then call a taxi that will take to the airport. From there we will have to get by on our own, facing every difficulty with intuition and cunning, analyzing all the objects available and talking to the other characters to understand what needs to be done. Once we get into the spirit of the game and understand the nature of the puzzles, our adventure will proceed quickly between one gag and another. The interface gives us the possibility, by moving the indicator, to select characters or objects to interact with according to the icons that appear on the screen. At any time it is possible to access the inventory with the objects collected and possibly combine them to find a solution to the puzzles.... On a technical level, Love for Sail is really a well-made product: the graphics show off a good number of animations and fairly varied and well-designed sprites, which are then ~framed~ during the dialogues showing really pleasant and worthy close-ups of the episodes that appeared on PC a few years ago. Even the scenarios are well done and never give that impression of repetitiveness present in some mobile games, even if they reproduce the same elements in many cases. And what about the game mechanics? The Vivendi developers have found the best possible compromise, with a control system that fits perfectly with the action and commands that can be accessed via icons.
