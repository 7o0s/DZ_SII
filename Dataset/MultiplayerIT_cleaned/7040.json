And those who have played it, in addition to appreciating those qualities that we will describe shortly, will surely have noticed how much its formula lends itself to both Nintendo consoles, which focus so much on touch controls. Said and done: already available on the eShop in the Wii U version, Color Zen also lands on the Kyoto laptop, with all its features intact and taking advantage of the peculiarities of Nintendo 3DS, certainly more suitable for short and relaxing game sessions. A great puzzle game, but also a ~zen~ and artistic experience: Color Zen comes to Nintendo 3DS! The red and the black But also blue, green, yellow and more or less all the primary and secondary colors you can think of. The Color Zen concept is easier to understand by playing than by reading a description, but we'll try anyway. The game screen is made up of a backdrop of one color, a frame of another and a whole series of geometric shapes that are also colored. Some of these shapes can be controlled by touching the nib, and when two objects of the same color come into contact, the latter becomes the color of the seabed, incorporating and making all other shapes of the same color that may remain disappear. The aim of the game is to ensure that, by eliminating the last figures, the background takes on the same color as the frame: practically - facing the game with this mentality will be very useful for the resolution of a level - you have to make sure, by eliminating hand the various figures, that the last two or more to remain in play are those with the same color of the border. A somewhat convoluted explanation which, however, is clear when tackling the first levels: in the name of simplicity and immediacy, at the first touch of the stylus you will have already understood how everything works. Which does not mean having victory in your pocket at all: if the first stages are simple tutorials useful for becoming familiar with the controls and gameplay, the long ride towards total completion not only provides for an expected multiplication of shapes and colors, but also a whole series of peculiarities such as white objects that take on the color of the shape they come into contact with, black objects that, like the holes of the same name in astrophysics, make anything disappear, various obstacles that prevent the passage or contact of forms and even, in the more advanced levels, the use of the simplistic but effective physics of the game, for example to push an otherwise immovable figure by ~throwing~ another one at it. The internships, despite their rather large number (120 for each of the four modalities), all manage to be well thought out; the difficulty, in the best puzzle tradition, gradually increases up to very high levels in which it is vital to be able to think strategically about a sequence of actions to be performed, even very long, but frustration is totally absent from Color Zen, which true to its name does not it will cause anxiety with time limits and indeed it also offers infinite retries. In this, graphics and sound also have their fundamental role. Zen and the art of solving puzzles The compositions that the various colored geometric shapes make up on each level can be assimilated to real and very pleasant electronic works of art, ranging from pure abstractionism to suggesting slightly more concrete representations, where in any case everyone can see a little ' what he wants. It goes even better with the sound, not surprisingly one of the aspects most advertised by the developers: sixteen different songs composed by the electronics guru Steve Woodzell, which establish the relaxed and serene mood of the package, excellent to listen to regardless of the game, especially as music ~for meditation~, and not surprisingly available on iTunes and Spotify. The effects are dynamic and adapt to the soundtrack, to create a gameplay/music synergy that tends to immerse you completely in the game action, especially with a pair of earphones in your ears. A puzzle game that, rather than creating anxiety and frenzy, while having fun and making you think wants to relax and, why not, even cause a light and harmless psychedelic ~trip~: if this was the developers' goal, it is perfectly achieved. And it is centered on a number of levels which, as we said, is very large, 120 for four modes, for a total of 460. In addition to the main mode, defined as ~Classic~, we also have ~Reflection~, ~Serenity~ and ~Nature~. However, only the second is really different: the game screen is divided specularly and, by acting on a shape, you also check the one in front of it as if it were, in fact, in a mirror. Thethe other two are fundamentally distinguished by the type of shapes used and by a generally greater difficulty. It might seem like a limitation, but look at it this way: with a very simple concept and very few elements available, Color Zen offers a very long experience managing to appear new and never tiring in each level. Costing only 3 Euros, is there any need to add more? Indeed yes: stereoscopy is completely missing, and the Nintendo 3DS version is less sharp and vibrant graphically than the Wii U version, and has less fluid control than the iOS/Android one, but it refers to the former because it is more suitable for short sessions than the genre requires, and on the second for greater economy of the complete experience.", "date": "2014-06-27", "grade": "S.V."}
