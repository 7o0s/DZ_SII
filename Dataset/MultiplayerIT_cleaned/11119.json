{"name": "Far Cry 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/far-cry-2-recensione.html", "text": "Nine mercenaries looking for a master The story can easily be summarized in a few telegraphic sentences: an African state in full civil war, two warring factions, an arms dealer called the Jackal who plays a double game with the two groups and a single mission, to kill him, even for take revenge for injecting us with malaria at the start of the game. Obviously this B-movie plot is declined in a thousand different ways through the countless missions that can be assigned to us, which all revolve around the classic triad deliver this, kill that, destroy this, but which never get boring. We are immediately asked which of the nine available mercenaries will be our alter ego, all disreputable types and of various nationalities, with previous military or criminal experience behind them. This choice is not simply of color given that the remaining eight will become full-fledged supporting actors, who if ~attended~ often during the game, or if you successfully carry out the missions proposed by them, will be able to come in handy in the most dramatic situations , saving the player from certain death, giving him emergency treatment and taking him to cover. But this is only the tip of the iceberg of the complexity of the Ubisoft title. The total freedom of choice proposed by the title is based on the simple concept that all those who have something to gain from the ongoing war are possible employers for the chosen mercenary. So here is that the main quests that lead us after the Jackal are joined by other missions that are used to advance our hoard of rough diamonds (the current currency of the place), which is absolutely necessary to buy weapons and upgrades. The places where to find work are scattered throughout the map, and apart from the little more than the village of Pala, it is possible to be hired by local weapon sellers, at some radio antennas, by friends and in the ~picturesque~ Mike's Bar on the river, a hideout , stealing the words from Tex Willer, of cutthroats and gallows pendants. The main point of reference remains Pala, for two good reasons: here are the refuges of the two warring factions, the UFLL and the APR, which represent the main storyline, but above all there is the church where the local priest, probably the only good person in the game, he provides us or gives us directions to stock up on anti-malaria medicines, which is absolutely essential given that about every hour of the game the screen will flicker, turning yellow, these are symptoms of sure demise. Therefore, if the (com)missions requested by the parish priest are not carried out, one will not have the medicines necessary to survive. AK-47 new or used? The choices made therefore heavily condition the unfolding of the adventure, effectively increasing the replayability factor of the title: doing more missions, main and not, gives us the possibility of earning more diamonds, which can then be invested in one's own arsenal, which can be customized according to the style of play. The weapons available (short, long, special and machete) are the real first feature of Far Cry 2. In addition to being many, and obviously of various types, precisely to ~specialize~ the style of play, they have two different peculiarities in battle : those kindly released by dead enemies jam, therefore having to push X to unlock them, with the result of making us shot like thrushes at the most beautiful, but above all they have no superimposed viewfinder. The only way to try to take something beyond 3 meters is to switch to the iron sight, or rather to the metal optics of the weapon, which slows down the player and also limits the field of vision. All this to broaden a concept of absolute verisimilitude with reality, so much so that only brand new guns bought do not suffer from malfunctions. The latter are always available, after having purchased them, at the weapons seller's warehouse, where you can also buy upgrades to your clothing, to improve your camouflage skills or to increase the number of transportable ammunition and medkits, and those improvements that they guarantee greater precision and penetration capacity to your weapon. Obviously, and this happens very often, in the middle of a prolonged fight, it can happen that you run out of ammunition for your ~owned~ rifle, thus immediately starting the countdown for the next damn malfunction! Crossroads to hell If the heart of the game is all placed in the free choice of missions to be tackled, more than a few words must be spent on the context in which our mercenary acts. The playing area, about fifty square kilometers large, is a huge playground where you can put your skills to the testand skills as a soldier on forced discharge and as an expert in land navigation. The jungle is not Liberty City, the tall and lush vegetation is the ideal place to get lost and to carry out bloody ambushes. The first impact is disorienting, an entire ecosystem made up of woods, jungle, desert, savannah, lakes and marshes is at our disposal, we can move freely from one part of the map to another from the first game. To avoid long and boring walks in this fictitious African state, there are several cars, jeeps, old utility cars and dune buggies, gliders and barges available, each of these equipped with a navigator that shows a small portion of the map, or through a convenient service bus that takes us directly to Pala and to the four corners of the playing area. It is also possible, indeed it is a must, to rely on a map equipped with three zoom levels which always shows us the points of interest and the missions in progress, and on which, using binoculars, we can mark dangerous elements such as machine gun emplacements and snipers. The map, however, lends itself to various criticisms, although it is essential in order not to get lost in the vastness of the world created by the guys from Ubisoft. Taking the wrong road is an event that happens very often, either because of the intrinsically all the same nature of the jungle, which tends to hide tracks and passages among the thick vegetation, or because at full throttle fleeing from a caravan of enemy jeeps signs at crossroads or calmly consult the map. In fact, the latter, once equipped, covers a large part of the screen: on foot it is not a big problem, while in the car it certainly is, with the aggravating circumstance of having to look down to scrutinize the areas not immediately visible on the map ! It's all rather cumbersome and cumbersome, and if from the point of view of likelihood this choice is impeccable, from that of pure entertainment it is a little less so, making the flow of movements too fragmentary at times. If by choice of the developers there are no carnivorous animals in the area, but only gazelles, zebras and so on, the real predators are the enemies present at every intersection, soldiers who shoot on sight and with the bad habit of chasing the player as if they were a pack of dogs for fox hunting. Even here, however, the game suffers some criticisms. First of all, these checkpoints are scattered all over the place, even within a short distance of each other, effectively turning the car journey from point A to point B into a sort of ~jRPG with random combat~ and above all they suffer from a heavy respawning problem. Typical situation: to complete a job you have to pass, for example, three checkpoints before reaching the goal. Once the three groups of traffic policemen armed with AK-47s have been killed on the outward journey, they will miraculously find themselves full of life and sprightly again on the way back. At night or during the day? Luckily the game automatically saves as soon as you reach the goal of the mission (perhaps in the middle of a shootout), but afterwards everything can be frustrated on the way back by the same shotguns just before, who, not happy with being reborn, push you off the road with their 4X4s, and if you get out of the car to send them back to the Creator again with bullets, you also risk being run over by them, transformed this time into perfect road pirates. Life in the jungle is hard, don't you think? Thankfully roughly as often as you come across these cute fellows, you can save your game. In addition to the places responsible for the delivery of the missions, it is also possible to record your progress in the shelters scattered around the map (after releasing them from the previous tenants), which also give us the possibility to stow weapons, and let the time pass at will, sleeping in comfortable cots. The passage of time, complete with a day-night cycle, is another of the peculiar characteristics of the game. It is possible to decide when to carry out the missions, whether in full light or not, which influences the way in which you try to achieve your goal. Under cover of darkness, perhaps taking up a silenced weapon, one can decide for a low profile, and after a meticulous remote reconnaissance with binoculars, infiltrate the enemy bases without triggering the slightest alarm. Far Cry 2 is a title that therefore offers the player a lot of freedom of choice, both on what to do and obviously on how to do it, provided that you have the right arsenal or that you choose alternative routes, perhaps on foot, avoiding the most jokes to avoid running into the ruthless guardians of the crossroads. So now is the momI want to dwell on the quality of artificial intelligence, cross and delight of every shooter, subjective or otherwise. The title of the boys of Ubisoft Montreal shows us a double face, with moments in which the waves of enemies act as good expert mercenaries and others in which they prefer to draw a crosshair on their chest waiting to be shot down. There also seems to be a certain discrepancy in behavior depending on the place where the shootings take place, as if sometimes the complexity of the seabed (in itself an advantage) is too difficult a factor to manage for the behavioral routines implemented. The cheerful surgeon If in the jungle the player, already ~realistically blinded~ by the thick vegetation and the lack of the on-screen viewfinder, finds himself dealing with soldiers who often move, hide and almost try to maneuver on the flanks of their alter ego, in the city, on the street or more generally in open spaces they lower their tactical acumen, behaving more conventionally, sometimes accepting their destiny, almost with resignation. One thing that is puzzling are some of the AI routines employed for the soldiers aboard the pickup trucks with machine guns in the back. It is not uncommon to observe drivers who, to get out of the car, pass through the place of the previously shot down machine gunner, or the latter who, in the event of a bullet hit by the driver, leave their position to reach the driving position, and then go out again. Firefights, which can be very long, hectic and filled with moments of holding your breath over the usual weapons issue, are the right place to talk about your alter ego's health bar. Absent on screen in moments of peace, it becomes apparent when it begins to rain lead. Here too a certain discourse of realism and likelihood was made, all aimed at putting the player in difficulty. If a simple injection is enough to recover from the first shots, instantaneous, but which in any case does not allow us to take up the weapon in those two-three seconds in which we play doctor with ourselves, when instead the energy is at full scale or close to zero are pains. With a gesture that is so Rambo, the mercenary takes pliers to tear the bullet from the flesh, makes a bandage or lights a flare to cauterize a wound. All this for about 5-10 seconds, with the screen turned red and the footstep shaking, obviously under fire. It follows that if there is no shelter, the utility of this operation is often zero. Hence the tactical nature of the game comes to light, in which knowledge of the environment and planning one's actions counts much more than firepower. These radical gameplay choices that make the game difficult, almost frustrating, in the initial hours, but which in the long run immerse the player in a living and hostile world that hides a danger around every corner, alone cannot stand without a technical realization that justifies them. African beauties The proprietary Dunia engine, used for development, makes our eyes roll almost all the time, and only rarely do we notice the few flat and poorly defined textures. The African ecosystem is alive and vibrant, the different environments are all extremely detailed, with the dense polygonal vegetation that bends as we pass. Even the physics engine is of absolute excellence: everything falls apart, explosions blow up shelters, flammable barrels and the miserable shacks on street corners. The much hyped flamethrower can be used with extreme pleasure, with the fire spreading realistically, as in the case of cars that explode because they are reached by the flames that burn the dry and barren vegetation of the savannah, and is therefore excellent for cutting off escape routes (especially in multiplayer) or to burn snipers in high positions. Even the special effects applied are close to perfection, HDR is a sure protagonist, as are the myriad particle effects that arise from the explosions. The management of the shadows, accurate and always present, in some situations, however, shows us some unsightly screenings almost on the edge of flickering. Another flagship of the work done by the guys from Ubisoft Montreal are the animations of the protagonist and the mercenaries. The view always remains fixed in the first person, following the movements of the player's head on every occasion, thus giving us lopsided views and effective movements, such as the aforementioned surgeon operations in the case of deep wounds. Ultimately, the graphics sector of the game exceeds all expectations, granite", "date": "2008-10-20", "grade": null}
