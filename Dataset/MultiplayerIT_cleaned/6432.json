When we reviewed the first episode, subtitled The Age of Demons, last year, we often pointed out the similarities between the Tecmo Koei title and the historic Capcom franchise: the game developed by Omega Force, the team responsible for the vast majority of Dynasty Warriors, it's a real Monster Hunter clone, but for once it's a well-crafted project full of personality, and not a simple ~more of the same~ that takes advantage of the popularity of the genre without applying too much. And the genre of ~hunting~ games has long been hidden from home console libraries, especially in the West. That's why Tecmo Koei has well thought of publishing a real Toukiden expansion not only on PlayStation Vita, but also on PlayStation 4: a real masterstroke, in many respects. Hunt demons on PlayStation 4 with Toukiden: Kiwami, an expanded version of the original game Toukiden Ultimate We can easily compare Toukiden: Kiwami to Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate in the sense that also in this case the suffix indicates a content enrichment compared to the previous version of the same game. For demon hunters who have already completed the first Toukiden, this enrichment translates into a storyline that adds five chapters to the eight already addressed, bringing them all to thirteen: in the new narrative arc, three months have passed and the village of Utakata is he finds himself under siege again by yet another wave of oni even more ferocious than the previous ones. The surviving slayers - including our alter ego, of course - will be called upon to face the new threat and, with any luck, put an end to it once and for all. Veterans will find themselves faced with a visually different village, reflecting the winter season in which the new storyline is set, while all newbies will have no reason to despair as Toukiden: Kiwami includes the entire original campaign, enriched by the features and balances introduced in this version. Considering that the new story arc is as long as the previous one, we could almost speak of two games in one. Furthermore, in terms of novelties, Tecmo Koei has followed the example of Capcom, expanding the armory of demon hunters with three new weapons. The spiked mace needs no introduction, an ignorant yet effective weapon capable of splitting the toughest skulls. The naginata - typical Japanese pike - is surprisingly fast despite its length, guaranteeing agile combos and good movement capacity. On the other hand, the rifle is very interesting, which can be loaded with different types of buckshot in the order preferred by the player: in the hands of an expert player it seemed like a slow but devastating weapon. Of course, Omega Force has not only implemented the new weapons, but also reviewed and corrected the previous ones, expanding the selection of craftable items with hundreds of new armor, swords, scythes and so on. The gameplay fixes have also touched the artificial intelligence of the single player adventure companions, much improved, and of some old enemies, whose attack patterns appeared to us a little less predictable than a year ago. Also not to be underestimated are the new mitama - the spirits that can be ~hooked~ to weapons to give the characters various types of spells - and the possibility of giving generic orders to the supporting actors, including a very useful one that allows you to reunite the group around the player: a new indicator, in fact, allows you to launch a very powerful combined attack at the address of the enemies, but only if the characters are close to each other. Playstation 4 trophies The 50 trophies offered by Toukiden: Kiwami are divided into 36 bronze, 11 silver and 2 gold, which leads to the inevitable final platinum. The trophy system pushes you to craft every weapon and kill every demon, but sometimes it won't be easy since some businesses require you to face enemies half-naked or in very unfavorable conditions. Generational clash Of course, if you play online with three other human users, you don't need pre-set orders or refined strategies to take down the oni, especially if you communicate via party chat or some other system: in fact, the combat system designed by Omega Force is much more chaotic and pyrotechnics compared to the slow and reasoned one of Monster Hunter, and the Kiwami version of Toukiden hasn't changed the gameplay one iota. Which, let's face it, is not proprimarily a defect, and indeed newbies may find themselves more comfortable with the boisterous spectacularity of demon hunters, above all thanks to the exhaustive tutorials and the transparency of the statistics and the various mechanics. Even the farming of materials is much less severe, and Toukiden: Kiwami also supports cross-save, so you can play on PlayStation Vita while you are away from home and transfer your save to PlayStation 4 to continue sprawling on the sofa, in front of the TV living room. In short, from this point of view, Tecmo Koei has had an excellent thought, even if the home version of the game doesn't have much next-gen. Toukiden: Kiwami shoots at 1080p and at 30 frames per second with moderately common uncertainties in the most rowdy situations; the result is a good sight thanks to the convincing resolution and the over the top artistic direction, but in most cases you realize you are playing a slightly improved version of the portable software, especially when you stumble upon some very low resolution textures or look around and you realize that the maps are extremely flat, linear and not very detailed. That's why, at the beginning, we said that moving from Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate to Toukiden: Kiwami was not easy. By implementing verticality in level design, the latest Nintendo 3DS iteration of the Capcom franchise changed the game when it comes to ~hunting~ games, and in this respect the new Toukiden often feels a bit ~limited~. Obviously if you don't care about Monster Hunter, nor have you played its latest edition, Toukiden: Kiwami remains in all respects a satisfactory and fairly challenging title that requires many hours to be squeezed out to the last drop.", "date": "2015-04-06", "grade": "8.0"}
