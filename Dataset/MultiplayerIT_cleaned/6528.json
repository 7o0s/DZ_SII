The aim of these enlightened minds is to unleash the adrenaline of passengers in a future where extreme entertainment has become a real science. In the Frontier Development title, coming to Xbox 360 and Xbox One, we are lucky enough to be the ones wearing the lab coat and not the ones destined to be guinea pigs. In the world of ScreamRide, extreme fun is a science in which to invest huge resources The science of extreme fun The main mode of ScreamRide can be described as a racing on rails, those of a futuristic roller coaster, in which the important thing is not to overtake any opponent but to reach extreme speeds and without derailing. To do this, it is necessary to alternate the use of the brake with that of the turbo, a resource that can be accumulated by pressing the X key in correspondence with special blue tracks. The green colored rails, on the other hand, indicate the jumps that often have to be tackled at a specific speed to prevent our trolley from crashing into obstacles of various kinds. Finally, other obstacles and broken tracks can be overcome by tilting the vehicle on two wheels but to be able to do this you need adequate speed and it is not always easy to maintain it as you are facing tight curves and having to press the X key at the right time to get the best bonus from quick time event trials. And this is the most effective synthesis for the gameplay of the most agitated mode of ScreamRide which challenges us to get the best score, measured in the screams of the passengers, in a continuous alternation of braking, acceleration and obstacles. Clearly the difficulty increases with increasing speed, tight curves and loops of the loop during which we have to keep pressing X at the right time perhaps poised on two wheels. And if there is the intention of reaching the maximum scores, things can get decidedly tough by touching the dark black hole of frustration several times. But it's a good thing that the maximum scores require a lot of effort given the simplicity of the mechanics that would risk tiring soon once all the situations have been experienced and in any case giving oneself to the extreme challenge is not mandatory. In ScreamRide there is no level that is impossible to pass once you learn the tracks which, incidentally, are not extremely long and are solved in a few laps. This creates some longevity problems but to compensate we find two other modes characterized by completely different gameplay. In engineer mode, the player's goal is to complete some incomplete tracks trying to achieve different types of objectives. But the most important phase is that of the final test which again asks us to obtain record times and not to massacre the passengers. But this time we are the ones driving the trolley which proceeds on its own and runs more or less fast depending on the gradients and the type of tracks that we have deployed along the route. In essence, the challenge is purely engineering and is characterized by a rather low level of difficulty and decidedly slow rhythms even if the final test gives us bursts of adrenaline with passengers who can be thrown out of their trolley in too extreme passages. Furthermore, in this mode we meet the editor interface for the first time and it is an element that pleasantly surprised us. The essential commands are always displayed on the screen and the automatic approximations, as in the case of the junction between two sections of the path, allow us to work in an agile and intuitive way in the name of creativity. Quite the opposite of the third mode which is all about the destructive dimension and, among other things, has nothing to do with roller coasters. The challenge in this case is ballistic and the player's aim is to launch different types of capsules against buildings of various kinds to make them collapse. As we pass the levels we are faced with obstacles of various kinds, indestructible, which force us to perform extreme doves and spin shots. To succeed in these feats we must choose the right capsule among those available, select the appropriate power in relation to the distance of the target, press at the right moment while the slingshot spins furiously and make the most of the small thrusters that guarantee us relative control of the capsule in the flight phase. The aim is to hit nerve centers and explosive bins, the most effective of which are often hidden by iindestructible, to trigger chain reactions and devastate the map with as few capsules as possible. And that's not just for bragging rights to friends but because every capsule kept grants an additional Angry Birds-style bonus points. Xbox One goals About half of the thousand points in ScreamRide are obtained by accumulating scores and completing the campaign. But only by completing the latter 100%, which is not particularly simple, it is possible to obtain a greedy prize of one hundred additional points. The other skill-related objectives are decidedly less generous but they are also easier to achieve and it is likely that you will unlock them by trying to carry out the increasingly extreme missions that are scattered throughout the fifty levels of the career mode. Rich but without too many pretensions Three different modes are tempting and fifty levels can be a good challenge for those who intend to reach record scores. The controls respond well to stress, are carefully studied and in the main mode, the one that sees us driving a futuristic trolley on a roller coaster, allow us to test our skills while always remaining on the edge between record and failure. But the race for score only makes sense in this mode which is the only one that really requires skill and commitment. The other two require more than anything else a pinch of patience and offer a rather small degree of challenge. Furthermore, to overcome an area and visit the next setting it is not even necessary to try all three modes but just face the levels of a single discipline. This means that the player can choose to play only the mode he prefers and it is not necessarily a bad thing, but such an approach can have harmful effects on the longevity of the title. Thankfully the score challenge isn't the only way Frontier Developments has tried to increase the length of ScreamRide. From the game menu, in fact, it is possible to access the sandbox mode which allows us to freely build levels with the only constraint of having to complete the career to have all the pieces necessary to build the most complex roller coaster possible. The interface, as we have already said, is intuitive and sharing your creations passes through a special hub that can be reached directly from the game menu. So it won't take long to see the game's offer enriched and it is probable that levels will arrive from the forges of the editor capable of showing us possibilities that the developers have not even thought about. But even if the amount of content is not a problem, the intrinsic limits of a title of this type still have to be considered. However vast, the creative possibilities are bound to a rather simple gameplay and are certainly not unlimited. Furthermore, the multiplayer is missing which even only in cooperative form, perhaps included in the editing component, would have given an edge to ScreamRide. Basically, without wanting to give this consideration particularly negative meanings, we can say that the offer is very close to that of a mobile title. All in all, a rich offer but with simple foundations and not excessive pretensions that also characterize a technical sector whose greatest flaw is that of being satisfied with painting a generic future in equally generic locations on our planet. Unfortunately, a recognizable style is missing and this lack extends to a rather anonymous sound sector. The models, however, are not too bad and the buildings are well designed even if the lack of details, both technical and artistic, is felt. But the relative poverty of the technical sector, perhaps also due to the cross-gen nature of the title, is compensated for by various positive factors. During the construction phase, in Sandbox or Engineer modes, the outline elements change dynamically as the tracks rise towards the sky and when something falls into the water it deforms. Furthermore, the levels even include unsuspecting pedestrians ready to flee in the event of disasters and the collapse of the structures shows us rather credible physics. The buildings, it must be said, crumble into cubes that are not particularly realistic but this is a minor defect balanced by spectacular chain explosions and by a side dish made up of multiple shots, slow motion, replays and skits which, although devoid of bite, contribute to making the title pleasing to the senses.", "date": "2015-03-03", "grade": "7.5"}
