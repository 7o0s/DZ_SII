The spirit of Indiana Jones can be found without too much forcing in the Uncharted series, which ideally has transported these cornerstones in the form of a video game and adding that necessary fun factor when the player has the opportunity to intervene personally on the events. The irony of the main protagonists, an extremely fast pace and an exceptional technical/artistic sector have consecrated Naughty Dog's creature in the Olympus of the best videogame productions of this generation, in particular from the first to the second chapter there was a sensational leap in terms of directing, graphics and unfolding of the action. Here we are talking about Uncharted 3: Drake's deception therefore, which has the not very simple task of confirming the good things seen in the past and necessarily clashing with a predecessor who still today maintains the very first positions from various points of view, not least that technician. The result? Beyond the vote that you can already see in this review, it is explained in the thousands of characters below. Ready for a new adventure! The pretext for traveling around the world is represented, this time, by a sort of bond between Sir Francis Drake and Lawrence of Arabia, two great explorers always in search of treasures and lost cities. The Atlantis of the desert, between reality and legend, seems to hide who knows what fortunes and powers, and it is impossible not to be enticed by all the mystery that surrounds it. Nathan Drake, Victor Sullivan, Chloe Frazer and Elena Fisher will answer the call in different ways, with the addition of a new supporting character, Charlie Cutter, who will have his work cut out during the course of the adventure. It is also normal that our brave characters are not the only ones who are interested in myths and legends and so that blonde and her right arm that you have seen several times in the videos scattered around the net, such as Katherine Marlowe and Talbot, will give Nathan a hard time Drake as in the most classic of action-adventure films. Never as in this third chapter, in fact, Naughty Dog has set the narrative and the game structure as if it were a Hollywood blockbuster (once at least we had to insert this meaning, forgive us), where the story ends this time without exceeding the concessions to the fantastic - as in the first chapter -, where there are no mega bosses to face but only more difficult enemies and where the pace is always very high, with continuous twists both from an ~aesthetic~ point of view and from the actual story. The subtitle of Uncharted 3 is already clear in this sense, to fully enjoy the game it is not necessary to have tried the previous chapters, but for how this third episode is set (among other things, we learn the origin of the relationship between Sully and Drake and his childhood) would not be a bad idea at all. We completed the game in 9 hours and 36 minutes with 56 treasures collected at normal level, compared to eleven hours for Il Covo dei Ladri. This is because the adventure is slightly shorter than in the previous title, but also because, as mentioned, the pace is even tighter and the familiarity with the gameplay dynamics is perfect after three iterations. Curiosity Duration of the game Drake's deception lasts between 9 and 11 hours on Normal difficulty level and depending on your skills, duration which can increase if played directly on Difficult.Settings and Chapters The game chapters are 22, with settings such as London, France, Cartagia, Yemen, Syria and another that we won't tell you. Graphic Engine The game uses the Naughty Dog Game Engine 2.5, an enhanced version of the one seen in the second chapter, while the physics is entrusted to the tested Havok engine. Multiplayer Maps Multiplayer maps are 11 for the competitive part, 9 for the cooperative arena, 5 for the cooperative adventure mode. Multiplayer mode Competitive Portion: Deatmatch, Team Deathmatch, Three-Team Deathmatch of Two, Plunder, Team Objective (including King of the Hill, Chain Reaction, Capture and Hold), Hardcore, Co-op Hunter Arena. Co-op Part: Co-op Arena, Co-op Adventure. Extras: Gallery, Bonuses, Stats, Michinima, Uncharted TV, Facebook friends integration Climbing is a bit like flying The structure of Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception is virtually identical to the past, for those who don't know it yet, we'll find you nextnzi to a third-person action/adventure where the main protagonist has above-average athletic skills that allow him to climb different types of obstacles and fight both with weapons and with his bare hands. The adventure unfolds through fistfights, firefights, puzzle solving and wide-ranging platform sections, all set in different settings that are always very inspired and beautiful to look at. We have covers that ~hook~ with the circle button, jump with X, aim and shoot with L1/R1 and so on, with some small innovations introduced in this third chapter. First of all, hand-to-hand combat, which now enjoys more animations and variety, such as when it is possible to launch from a raised floor to land and stun the enemy. In general, the fisticuffs are more fun and more interactive, with Drake who in some cases uses the elements of the environment such as tables, bottles and other things that come to hand. The grenades can be released while doing a somersault, also addressed with the aim dedicated to the shot and re-launched if the triangle button is pressed at the right time; the riot shield can now be shouldered without sacrificing speed as we see new entries and some departures in terms of the paraphernalia at your disposal, with the inevitable long guns, snipers and pistols. The response to the commands is perfect as always, climbing buildings and ledges is an extremely natural and immediate practice, thanks as always to the excellent camera that suggests where the next handhold is. We have mentioned a few lines above the animations and now we return to them with force, because in Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception they find their maximum sublimation. Nathan Drake's movement is always contextualized to what is happening on the screen and passes practically imperceptibly from the non-interactive sequences to those in the player's hand: when he is in pain he runs limping, if he finds himself running towards a wall he extends his hand to recover road, when he is in the desert his pace will be slow and as soon as the pressure of the left analogue is interrupted he may throw himself on the ground from exhaustion or stop on his legs. If there is any object around him to interact with, it will do so in such a natural way that it seems as if the player is in control of it. Trying is believing, one might say, in fact in this third chapter Naughty Dog has really found the crux of the skein to increase credibility and identification on the part of the player, also because what happens on the screen is often incredible. It should be noted that from a graphic point of view there is no important break between the first and second chapters, but in any case the developers have managed to obtain further improvements and thanks to the right choice of settings the result is fantastic, again once at the top of this generation of consoles. The painstaking work from the artistic point of view of the camera, which always shows the best glimpse, the extreme variety of textures, the ~fired~ use of colors, the continuous play of light and shadow even indoors and at night help to restore a devastating impact, made even more memorable by the fact that catastrophic events often happen on the screen. As in the case of the ship in the storm, in which every object reacts in real time to the landslide caused by the waves. The icing on the cake of this work is represented by the desert, never done so well as in Uncharted 3 in terms of interaction with the player, detail and visual impact. If we then consider that everything ~runs~ at a granite frame rate 99% of the time and anchored to 30 frames per second, it's easy to promote the graphics component with full marks, and you just need to make an effort to find some subdued element compared to the the rest, perhaps in passages in the shade or in the rare points where Naughty Dog has not put the due effort into working on the details. The audio sector takes up the excellent soundtrack of the Covo dei Ladri and adds new arrangements and some unpublished songs, of excellent workmanship and which accompanies the video part very well. The title sees the confirmation of the Italian voice actors present in the previous episode while among the various options dedicated to audio encoding, they include Pro Logic II, Dolby Digital, DTS, linear PCM 5.1 and 7.1, plus a series of options related to the central speaker and the band frequency, you are spoiled for choice. The three P rule After having exalted ourselves for several thousand characters, let's come back down to earth for a moment and talk about the duration of the'adventure, which we have said is slightly lower than Uncharted 2. In fact, the hours of play exalt so much and flow so quickly that Naughty Dog could certainly have inserted some additional game sections without risking lowering the tone. It is true that the title is extremely replayable (in U3 the Destructive mode is also unlocked by completing the title on the Normal difficulty level) and that it requires at least a couple of ~laps~ to fully appreciate the settings and collect all the relics, however you should never settle especially if the quality is so high. We have already given you a couple of ~justifications~ as to why the duration is shorter, we add a third referring to the puzzle and platform sections present in the game. In the first case there are some really nice ones that need to squeeze a few neurons without waiting for the aids that materialize after a certain amount of time spent staring into space. As always, the puzzles must be solved with the help of Drake's trusty notebook and there are a good number of them especially in the first half of the adventure, even we wouldn't have minded seeing some of them of a little wider scope. The platform part of Uncharted 3 is inherent in the actual gameplay and in the same way less ~trivial~ than in the past. In fact, beyond when you jump here and there in the clashes and to reach certain points on the map or buildings in the distance, it is all focused on what is present in the game in abundance: rhythm, rhythm, rhythm. This comes from the perspective of wanting to create an adventure with few dead ends and where the puzzles and the rest are functional to a larger scheme, without being placed there just to lengthen the soup; at the beginning, therefore, everything is more reasoned, there are more twists and moments of exploration, as you continue, the action increases and the adventure becomes even more bombastic. In this sense there are in fact several extremely spectacular chases where skill and timing with the pad count, in other situations you have to climb buildings and attack your opponents at the same time, there are even sections in the race of a quality equal to the famous train present in the second chapter. There are several moments to remember, such as the chateau on fire, the ship in the midst of the storm, the museum, the horse chase; dozens and dozens of consecutive minutes where the player is overwhelmed by the events and must govern them in the first person. It is therefore clear that for this third chapter Naughty Dog has placed the accelerator even more on fun, spectacularity and variety of situations, those who hoped for a greater approach to titles such as Tomb Raider then may even be disappointed. Dulcis in fundo the level of challenge, Uncharted 3 at a normal level remains quite easy - also because when you die the checkpoints are positioned too well - and it is advisable to start from a higher difficulty level for veterans of the saga. The enemies do not shine for artificial intelligence when they have to avoid our blows, often uncovering the side too much, while they are very aggressive in the attack phase, as they throw bombs more often - forcing you to move continuously - and attack from a multitude of positions , which makes the fights more dynamic than in the past. While on the one hand we liked the close combat thanks to the improvements listed a few lines above, we would have preferred more physicality in those with firearms, where even the impact of the blows on the opponents is a bit too light, a difference, for example, when hitting grenades or RPGs. Playstation 3 trophies Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception offers 55 trophies, of which only 1 is gold and 10 are silver. The conditions for obtaining them are very similar to those of the second chapter, and only two, bronze, are assigned to the online part of the game. We have those that are obtained with 30 kills for each type of weapon, those for discovered treasures, for headshots, for single or series melee combats, for the number of consecutive kills and for the deaths caused with the grenades. The only gold trophy is obtained, predictably, by completing the single player mode on the Destructive difficulty level. The experience continues online The first Uncharted did not have multiplayer, the second introduced a surprisingly interesting one, Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception also sees the consecration of this particular aspect. Let it be clear that the multiplayer does not intend to rival the sacred monsters of the genre from the point of view of balance and depth, but already in the last edition it proved to be extremely fun thanks also to a sc", "date": "2011-10-24", "grade": "9.7"}
