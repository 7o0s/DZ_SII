{"name": "Socom II: U.S. Navy SEALs", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/socom-ii-us-navy-seals-2.html", "text": "Infiltration what a passion Those who have already had the opportunity to play the first episode of what will probably become a long series will certainly be able to immediately enter the mechanisms of this Socom II. In fact, Zipper Interactive has rightly preferred to carry out a foil job, correcting the defects reported by users and thus trying to bring their creature to a higher level. The missions, all quite diversified both in the setting and in the objectives, require the player, as already said, to control a group of 4 soldiers, real war machines capable of getting the better of entire ranks of terrorists armed up to teeth. But unlike many other titles of this genre, in Socom II it is essential to measure and evaluate every action and every reaction, hide in the shadows or among the vegetation, go around the terrorists to hit them from behind, hiding their bodies so as not to arouse attention comrades, and so on. Team management can take place both via menu and, much more exciting, via voice commands through the microphone; the control of one's companions is not only an accessory or insignificant aspect, but on the contrary represents a fundamental component within the economy of the missions to be able to complete all the proposed objectives. And once familiar with the system just described, the gratification of the results is able to give moments of authentic exaltation to lovers of this genre. Being covered by a teammate, sending two of them in advance to take a group of terrorists from the sides, or having your team break into a room, or having a bomb planted in a building to see it then blown up are just some of the possibilities offered by the flexible and satisfying game system created by Zipper Interactive. Despite the progress and corrections made by the programmers compared to the first chapter, however, some problems related to the artificial intelligence of their companions remained. These are mostly limits, which are inseparably part of characters who act not on the basis of reasoning but on pre-established patterns. For example, it may happen that you ask your group to gather in a position previously reached alone, and see your companions move in a straight line, being identified by enemies. This factor which, combined with the need to completely repeat a mission if this is irreparably compromised during its course, can create frustration and irritate even the most patient player. And this is undoubtedly the most questionable element of the offline mode of Socom II; the absolute lack of checkpoints, if on the one hand it keeps the tension high and imposes to face the game calmly and weighing every action, on the other hand it can be poorly tolerated by a large number of users, and in most cases oblige to boring trial and error sessions. Open, flashbang and enter Obviously, however, it is in the online component that Sony production finds its ideal realization. The US programmers have kept game modes and some maps from the previous chapter, inserting new ones and thus drastically increasing the range of choices offered to the user. As for the type of missions present, these are divided into 5 modes: suppression is the classic team deathmatch, demolition requires you to use a bomb to destroy the enemy base, extraction requires you to save a group of hostages and escort them to the extraction area. Breach is a variation of demolition, with one team attempting to plant the bomb while the other struggles to defend their base, while escort is similar to extraction, except that the characters are already under the control of the military who must save them from opponents. Moving on to the maps instead, the total number is now 22 units, different from each other in terms of settings, size and structure, but in principle all extremely balanced and valid. But the goodness of the Zipper Interactive title, and the care with which it was created, are confirmed by the graphic system, which is truly excellent from every point of view. The levels, located in areas such as Albania, Brazil and Russia, are reproduced in an extremely credible way, with great attention to detail that denounces a high knowledge of the Emotion Engine architecture. The cleanliness and variety of textures is truly surprising as is the quality of graphic effects, especially those related to ambient lighting andpersonages. The latter are also modeled very well, with movements subordinated to animations that are only rarely questionable. The rare drops in frame rate only occur in extremely hectic conditions, and in any case they do not manifest themselves in such a way as to condition the development of the action. The sound component is also definitely worthy of mention: the Italian dubbing, not flawless but certainly above average, is the only aspect that does not reach the levels of excellence of music and effects. In fact, the songs, very rich in pathos and blatantly cinematic, fit perfectly into the game phases, while the effects prove to be able to reproduce practically every expected situation without ever denoting qualitative drops. Comment Socom II is exactly what a sequel should be: in fact, compared to the first chapter, practically every aspect criticized or questioned has been corrected, with a consequent increase in the global value of the Zipper Interactive effort. Of course, the offline single player mode isn't perfect, with its high dose of frustration and the need to repeat the same steps numerous times. And the online component, very rich and extremely flexible, could embarrass a novice player, with its large amount of elements to take into account and with the high depth of the game structure. But this is the price to pay in order to enjoy a title destined to accompany one's days for many, many months, revealing itself little by little and satisfying the player like few other productions for Ps2. Pros: Numerous and extremely varied game modes Intriguing offline, outstanding online Technically on excellent levels Cons: Frustrating and questionable offline in some aspects Companion artificial intelligence still imperfect For many, but not for all Although it has been on the market for a few months now, the Ps2 network adapter has so far struggled to find titles capable of justifying its purchase, that is, capable of offering a solid, captivating and stimulating online component. Among the small circle of ~exceptions to the rule~ Socom undoubtedly shines, a title from Zipper Interactive in which, in command of a group of highly specialized soldiers, one is called to face infiltration missions with large doses of stealth and strategy. Extremely appreciable, as well as fundamental to the online success of the title in question, was the support for the headphones + microphone headset: if the voice recognition functions in fact gave greater realism during the offline phases, it was precisely in the online to converse with the human components of one's team greatly exalted a game of this mold. As easily predictable, the sequel was not slow in being announced, until it reached the shelves first in the United States and now, finally, in Europe.", "date": "2004-03-19", "grade": null}
