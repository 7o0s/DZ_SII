This is the classic project that has all the prerequisites for doing well: successfully funded through Kickstarter, where it raised more than three hundred thousand dollars, it is the spiritual sequel to a much loved horror series like the Clock Tower, of which it aims to re-propose various elements even in a 3D environment. We admit that the first images shown weren't exceptional, but honestly we didn't care that it was technically at the top: it was enough for us that it had something new to say in the horror genre or, better, that it updated mechanics of the past in a convincing way. And then what a dream to go back to being chased by a creature armed with gigantic scissors! Unfortunately, after finishing it, we cannot deny ourselves and deny you the truth, which is that we are faced with an unjustifiable and, even worse, almost unplayable product. We reviewed NightCry: find out why it made us cry... Harry, where is Harry? The first sensation we had starting NightCry was one of sublime admiration! But what a beautiful landscape! Ah no, it's the desktop background. What happened? First start, first block. Let's try again. Well, he's gone. Started the game we discover that we are on a cruise ship. The first character we play is a busty blonde called Monica, dressed in a very elegant way. She just got out of a party. It is recommended to take off your heels when being chased by a monster A tutorial screen briefly explains the interface, which is that of a normal point and click: with the left mouse button we indicate to the characters where to go and we can make them interact with the various hot-spots, which become visible when you pass over them the pointer. We couldn't imagine it at the time, but most of NightCry's flaws were already verifiable in the first room. Let's get back to us. Without knowing what to do, we talk to a creepy attendant who is cutting clothes, apparently bloodied, behind a counter. We find out he's doing it on behalf of a client. We don't believe it very much, and, apparently having no more interactions available, we head towards the exit. We try to get out by clicking on the door, but Monica refuses to open it. He tells us that we still have something to do in the room. What we are not given to know. We look around and see nothing to interact with, therefore, proceeding by exclusion, we decide to speak to the attendant again. Well, more lines of dialogue. Can we go out now? Not at all. Before doing so, you need to talk to him for the third time. In the meantime we learned that we had to go in search of a certain Harry. Once out on the corridor we can better admire the animations of Monica, who we have arbitrarily renamed the ~girl who shakes even when she is being chased by a monster who wants to slice her~. Then you will understand why. We also discover that the undulating movement of her blond hair produces a strange noise, which will accompany us throughout the time spent in her company. Has anyone seen Harry? Let's leave Monica's animations alone and go back to Harry. We walk around the ship and enter a bar, where we talk to a seated man who introduces himself as the owner of the place. We also exchange a few words with the bartender, who gives us information of secondary importance, so we continue the tour. Lots of sympathy In front of an elevator, we find two of Monica's friends with whom we obviously talk. After the short dialogue, we try to take the lift but the nice blondie tells us that she still has something to do. What we don't know. We go around the floor and find nothing at all, therefore, mindful of how we left the first room, we decide that maybe it's time to go back to conversing with everyone we've already talked to. We then discover that the solution is to talk to the ship's master again, who asks us to find him something to light a fire. Doing so serves above all to become familiar with the inventory, but it is impossible not to notice the absurdity of the whole situation: he is the owner of the ship and he needs us to take an object which is essential to him and which, moreover, is on the counter immediately behind him? Alright, let's take the arduous mission for a simple tutorial and head back to the elevator. Still can't get off? Nothing, Monica won't press the magic call button until she's talked to her friends again, who will finally tell her where Harry is. The substance is that after about twenty minutes of play we are already quite impatient... and we still haven't told you about the control system, the most horror element of NightCry. The Clock Tower series Clock Tower - Super Nintendo (1995) Clock Tower 2 - PlayStation (1996) Clock Tower: The First Fear - remake of the first episode for PlayStation (1997) Clock Tower: Ghost Head - PlayStation (1998) Clock Tower 3 - PlayStation 2 (2002) Haunting Ground - PlayStation 2 (2005) NightCry - PC (2016) Harry, finally! The plot isn't even evil and has several twists and turns In order not to be found by Scissorwalker you have to pass mini-games When we finally manage to find the good Harry, the actual game begins and the agony of the Scissorwalker chases, of which we will discover more details later in the adventure. Unfortunately, now it is really inevitable to talk about the control system. As we said, NightCry is a 3D game, but with fixed shots chosen by the developers. To make Monica (and the other characters) move, you need to click and click and click the left mouse button, aiming at the chosen destination. Clicking once makes the girl walk, while clicking twice quickly makes her run. Already in the early stages of the game we had noticed the numerous problems caused by this system, due to some difficulties in making Monica understand where to go. Especially in the moments of transition between shots, we had repeatedly clicked in one point and saw her head in the completely opposite direction, perhaps turning suddenly. Apart from the annoyance, not bad, since it didn't compromise the gaming experience that much. Unfortunately, the same system literally becomes a plague when being chased, also because the developers have seen fit to add functions, such as shooting and resistance, which complicate things even more. Now, imagine the nightmare of running away from a monster and having to worry about understanding the mapping of the area so as not to click in inappropriate places, risking slowing down or spinning the character and, at the same time, having to explore the environment with the mouse looking for hiding places or other useful interactions. Let's also add that the nice Monica falls to the ground with disarming ease when she runs and, above all, she has the resistance of someone who has been shot in the lungs, she gets tired so quickly (when she is completely exhausted she ends up on the ground at the mercy of the monster). Mix it all up and you get the worst and most frustrating chase sequences of the year (and it's still April). Who couldn't take off those bloody heels right after the first chase? So, just to be able to go faster and risk falling less. It should be noted that when being chased, it continues to waddle. The overall effect is that of a C-movie rather than a horror. Who's afraid of spawn points? NightCry unfortunately fails in many other aspects, in addition to those already reported. For example in creating a minimum of tension. After the first encounters with Scissorwalker, it becomes clear that the creature has fixed spawn points, which are also emphasized by a sudden change of camera. disturbing presences So no sightings from afar with the possibility of hiding without being seen and no slow and reasoned exploration so as not to be identified. The chases are handled like events and those hoping for something similar to the Haunting Ground will be disappointed. The only element that is saved are the branches of the plot, divided into three chapters, which lead to eight different endings. Too bad that it is often very difficult to guess what to do to get to a particular ending and that some branches are linked to actions or interactions that you risk missing completely due to the problems already described. To make us understand better, imagine the lack of intuitiveness shown to overcome the first room and multiply it for the whole ship and the other rooms, with the complications that this entails. Unfortunately, the technical side is bad. In reality, some characters are well modeled and the guys at Nude Maker, the development team, have tried to insert some modern effects to try to improve the general appeal, such as dynamic hair and a not even despicable lighting system. Too bad, however, that many objects are decidedly ugly to look at, due to small and faded textures, while some environments appear decidedly too bare. Let's add a fluidity that is not exactly at the top and a little more than amateur dubbing, and disaster is served.", "date": "2016-04-13", "grade": "S.V."}
