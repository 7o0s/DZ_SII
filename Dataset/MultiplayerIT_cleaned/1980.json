We had already had the opportunity to try this rogue-lite a short time ago through a demo and we were pleasantly intrigued. Now that we've had the chance to try it in depth, what do we think? Find out in our Dandy Ace review. Illusionist profession Dandy Ace and, bottom right, Lele Dandy Ace, as mentioned, is a rogue-lite, precisely an action rogue-lite in an isometric view. The story follows the revenge of Lele, a low-level illusionist and non-existent charm. This circus caricature of Wario identifies Dandy Ace as his greatest nemesis and, having found a magic mirror, he traps his opponent in a constantly changing world, a palace where every creature responds to Lele's will and will do anything to stop Dandy Ace. Lele is not only the final boss to defeat, but is also the narrator of Dandy Ace. During our escape we will be able to talk to the illusionist who will pretend to be our ally. At the beginning of each area, for example, it will describe what awaits us and during the clashes and exploration it will support what happens on the screen with dialogues and jokes. Let's suppose that immediately the mind of many runs to that masterpiece by Hades: no, Dandy Ace from a narrative point of view is not in the least bit close to the work of Supergiant, especially in terms of sheer quantity. Lele's dialogues are few and will soon be repeated. Bosses have literally two lines of text. After being defeated, Lele will state that he still has tricks up his sleeve and that we are not free, but the other exchanges will not change, as if nothing had happened. The heart of a rogue-lite, however, is its gameplay and, from this point of view, Dandy Ace has several interesting ideas to draw on. Cards, keys, choices Dandy Ace's Mansion Dandy Ace is an isometric action game. The Palace is made up of various maps, and each of them is basically a collection of rooms and corridors. The scenarios can be explored freely and you can retrace your steps, for example to recover unused healing cupcakes (thanks to a teleporter, which reduces downtime to zero). To block the progress, however, there are gates, which can be opened by one of the four keys hidden in the game. Once obtained, the keys will be yours forever. The keys unlock access to extra sections of the maps, where you can find chests or shops for example, but above all they allow access to other maps. The progress towards Lele, in fact, is not linear: once we have obtained all the keys we will be able to decide which path to follow with each new attempt. The maps of the Palace obviously differ from a stylistic point of view (entrance hall, the gardens, the museum, the labyrinth...), but what matters most is that they include different enemies and traps, so we can decide which one is more simple for our skills or our build. For example, if we have a build based on short-range attacks, we don't want to move around gardens because they are full of blobs that leave a substance around them that causes us damage. Dandy Ace is all about combos Our exploration skills, but above all our chances of survival, are in fact based on our build, or rather on the skill cards we have. The protagonist, Dandy Ace, has no ability, in fact, and must take advantage of his own magic cards in order to get the better of it. These are divided into three categories: movement skills, direct attacks and area effects. At the beginning of each game we will get one of each type and as we progress through the maps we will have multiple opportunities to obtain new ones or enhanced versions of them, for example through chests or by completing some clashes. Let's look at some examples of card effects. There is a classic dodge, but there are versions that cause explosions, or place poisonous areas on the starting point. The basic attack is a five-card shot that shoots in a frontal beam, but there is also a big punch, an arrow that pierces enemies, rockets, area explosions, traps to be placed on the ground, black holes that attract enemies and so saying. The variety of attacks is excellent and from game to game there is a way to unlock and find something new. JollyJolly helps Dandy Ace by unlocking new cards and abilities The real strength of Dandy Ace, however, is related to the equipment of the cards. Each card can be adopted as an attack, or can be used as an upgrade of the same. In this way they can be createdand extremely effective combos. One of our favorites, for example, is the poison bubble explosion: using the bubble explosion attack (which generates 4 minor bubbles after the explosion) and adding the poison cloud attack, you can hit an enemy and apply poison to him five times in one go (main bubble + 4 minor bubbles). This is just one example, but it represents the core of Dandy Ace, for better or for worse. The combinations and the altered statuses are in fact essential to get the better of the enemies. Most of the time, in fact, it is absolutely not recommended to play with pure arrogance and it is preferable to try to get the better of it through refined plays. Between each map of Dandy Ace is a safe area Dandy Ace demands a shrewd approach: there are many enemies, ~normal~ damage (ie without the support of altered statuses) is not enough to get the better of it and the illusionist is weaker than you think. Even at the minimum difficulty, 7-10 hits are enough to go KO. and if you remain in the middle of a group you are practically doomed. The solution is to take advantage of the open map, retreat to an vantage point (for example the access corridor to the battle room) and strike from a distance, creating combinations of effects that cause chain effects (with even 6 status altered in one go) . The ~problem~ is twofold: dodging has very few invincibility frames and attacks activate an infinite number of graphic effects. Since for most of the time there will also be the visual trappings of active altered statuses, as well as those of enemy attacks, in some situations the screen is pure chaos: if you are in the middle, you no longer understand where Dandy Ace is and what attacks are coming. Sometimes it is not clear what happens on screen in Dandy Ace We didn't mind having to maintain a more cautious attack strategy (moreover, the combos are often satisfying), but if you plan to play Dandy Ace as if he were Hades, you might be disappointed. Moving away from the combat system, let's talk briefly about the ~lite~ side of this rogue-lite. By defeating enemies, we get ~shards~, which is the most important currency in the game that can be spent between one map and another (where we find a safe place to heal). Fragments allow you to unlock additional healing or new cards and trinkets (accessories that give some advantage for the current game, such as more damage or the ability to see the map). However, these last two categories must first be discovered through the ~projects~, also donated by enemies and bosses. To give you a point of reference, we first defeated the final boss after about 8 hours of play and by that point we had 50% of the cards and trinkets unlocked, but we were missing several very expensive skills in terms of fragments. Furthermore, when Lele is beaten, Hard mode is activated: the enemies are stronger and the healing areas decrease, but more fragments are obtained and progress therefore becomes faster.", "date": "2021-03-24", "grade": "8.0"}
