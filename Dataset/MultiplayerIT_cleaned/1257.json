{"name": "Donkey Kong Country 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/donkey-kong-country-2.html", "text": "Years go by for everyone Once we fired up the GBA with the DKC2 cartridge, we expected to relive dormant moments from our childhood. The moments in which together with friends we were struck by the amazing, portentous, and so on and so forth, graphics of the DKC series. Obviously those emotions have not reappeared, either because today we are used to something else, or because the small screen of the GBA sacrifices so much programming talent, or because the conversion has undergone some (usually) small rearrangements that have somehow altered the general result. Overall, the game remains very beautiful to look at and deserving of the highest marks, but it no longer manages to amaze as it did in the mid-nineties. For the record, we also compared the original for SNES, and in fact on television the game still makes a damn good impression, a sign that the conversion, however faithful it appears in most cases, fails to transfer the feeling of the game into the GameBoy Advance portable screen. The graphic downgrade, in addition to the obvious differences in resolution, in most cases is revealed in the parallax levels, which if they are not reduced in number are simplified in the animations or colors. Furthermore, the colors themselves, perhaps more often than it appears, have been lightened and readjusted to meet the poor visibility of the GameBoy screen. Even in the amusement park level, the whole background has been redesigned, going from the night sky illuminated by sporadic fireworks of the SNES version, to a certainly less effective reddish sunset, for the GBA version. In addition to the reductions, however, there are also some additions, a sign that the programmers wanted to do everything possible to get the best out of the Nintendo paperback. These are mostly minor, but still appreciable changes, such as mice, bats and fish, which move around the stage, animating the scene even more. Some distortion effects have also been applied where they weren't before. As for the animations, however, everything seems to be in the right place. There are no obvious cuts both in the movements of the enemies and in those of the Kong family, thus keeping intact at least one of the factors that contributed to making the Donkey Kong Country series great. Finally, I point out some rare cases of slowdowns, which do not affect the adventure in the slightest, but demonstrate once again what a beautiful piece of hardware the SNES was. There is no longer deaf... The soundtrack of the series is among the most beautiful and evocative ever heard on Super Nintendo. The musical motifs are so catchy, particular and artfully arranged, that they still remain stuck in the heads of many players today. Since the SNES era, in fact, the Rare sound composers have always stood out for the quality and beauty of their musical arrangements. Luckily on GBA there are all the original tracks, even if sometimes rearranged to allow for the laptop. Obviously the ~TV test~ won hands down on every aspect of the sound, and reaffirms once again that the series is a real pearl of sound design. Apart from the obvious limitations of the small speaker, we are faced with the whole sampling of sounds, tracks and jingles, prepared by Rare almost ten years ago, and if you have never had the chance to listen to it, you just have to trust us : it's really good. Furthermore, with a pair of good headphones, everything improves further, making the comparison with the original version less difficult. With the sound test mode you can also enjoy the entire soundtrack of the game, in all the comfort of two keys. Donkey Kong Country 2 is perhaps the most beautiful episode of the three, both in terms of technique and gameplay We are not making the monkey dance As mentioned in the introduction, the game is almost identical to the original version, which is a good start in itself. Donkey Kong Country 2 is perhaps the most beautiful episode of the three, both in terms of technique and gameplay. The small additions made by the Rares are to be found in some sub-games, accessible from the various maps, and which are used to recover new DK coins. Furthermore, within each level, a feather has been added which you will need to enhance the skills of the ~Expresso~ ostrich, used exclusively to compete in some mini-games. Also with regard to new mini-games, we note the addition of Funky Kong's aerial missions, where you will be committed to reaching pre-established points, rather than killing all enemies, or even recovering the various hostages. All this in exchange for more DK coins. Frankly a bit 'little for those who have already played the series on SNES, and rather useless for thoseis faced with the platformer for the first time. As with the conversion of the first Donkey Kong Country, this time too it was decided to opt for free saving: just be on the map and select the appropriate menu item. It should also be noted the possibility of spotting the statistics of each level. This will allow you to discover all the hidden bonuses in the levels in much less time, simplifying a large part of the search. These are all expedients, which come to meet new players, certainly more idle and less open to challenges than those of the past. Always present the option for two players, who will be able to cooperate or carry on two distinct games. In the cooperative mode, one player will be at the controls of Diddy Kong, who we remember is the most agile of the monkeys in the Kong family, and the other will be at the controls of Dixie, who in addition to being quite fast, can take advantage of her blonde hair to glide like a helicopter. Within the level, the two players will alternate in the game phases, depending on which of the two characters is activated at the moment, or on the one available. The game has been completely translated into Italian with good results: both the names of the levels and that of the enemies keep the various puns typical of the series. [C] One of the highest levels; similar to the original One of the most memorable moments intense of DKC2, thanks also to the wonderful soundtrack. [/C] Comment Donkey Kong Country 2 feels the weight of the years, but still manages to carve out its space. The mold of the game is the old school one: that of the millimeter leap that decides the fate of the game, that of always ready reflexes, the one that once the mistake has been made, it will be difficult to remedy it. The level design is always excellent, from the first to the last level, and offers the most complex challenges possible. The learning curve rises quite quickly, so much so that already less than halfway through the game you will begin to have the first headaches, the same ones you will have abundantly in the last maps, including the secret one. Thanks to the expedients of the programmers, however, it will be easier both to finish the game and to complete it in the maximum percentage: then you decide whether in your case it is a good thing or a bad thing. We recommend Donkey Kong Country 2 to anyone looking for a platformer that is both beautiful to look at and challenging and fun to play. To those who are tempted to buy the game out of pure nostalgia, we advise instead to dust off the old dear SNES, since the additions made are not able to tease those who already know the original episode by heart. Pros: Interesting and challenging Added new minigames and more DK medallions Cons: The additions won't satisfy series veterans The technical aspect has been scaled down... ...and the small screen takes its toll As was rather predictable, the treatment reserved for the conversion of Donkey Kong Country 2 is very similar to that received at the time by the conversion of the first Donkey Kong Country and, narrowing down, it is reduced to some cuts to the graphics, and to some additions inside of the game. We have used the term ~game~ rather than ~gameplay~, because in effect these additions are extras applied to a platformer otherwise as it is, and which in no way alter the gameplay of DKC2, as you know it. If you have the copy of Donkey Kong Country for GBA in your hand, you will have already made an indicative idea of what you could find in front of you with this sequel, otherwise, we will sift through every detail of the conversion up to the most imperceptible differences with the original.", "date": "2004-07-08", "grade": null}
