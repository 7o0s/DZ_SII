{"name": "Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-chaos-theory.html", "text": "Chaos theory While according to many, Pandora Tomorrow had taken a step backwards in terms of game structure and overall charisma of the story, Chaos Theory on PC and consoles was hailed by fans as a welcome return to the glories of the first episode, even if (or perhaps for this very reason) few modifications and novelties have been made: dear old Sam has never stopped moving stealthily in a completely 3D environment, followed by cameras under the full control of the player, trying to avoid like the plague of be seen and/or heard by anyone. All in the midst of a fair amount of enemies armed to the teeth but a bit silly, to be killed (permanently or in a softer way, the choice is yours) in absolute secrecy to prevent the rest of the company from getting alarmed, but being able to count both on noteworthy physical and acrobatic skills, and on a hyper-technological arsenal of weapons and very tasty gadgets that only a secret American agency can bestow on its employees (in reality, it finds many things around the levels, but let's pretend nothing happened). And finally, even on a Nintendo laptop we can experience the thrill of the exciting game mechanics briefly described above: in theory, nothing is really missing. Even the plot remains the same as the major versions, always vaguely realistic, even if set in the near future, and focused on the crimes of a fictitious but not too much international terrorist organization. The way of narrating the events in SC is completely different from the complacently exaggerated grandeur of Metal Gear (and on DS the understatement is further accentuated by the absence of cinematics and spoken dialogue, no Luca Ward for the two screens), and as usual the public is divided between Kojima lovers and Clancy supporters; but the story is certainly solid and in its own way exciting. Sam Fisher Jr However, the level structure is completely redesigned, based on the N-Gage version. It leaves very little to open spaces to focus almost exclusively on rooms and corridors, and almost completely eliminates the ~streets~, or in any case the options, alternatives that you encountered from time to time on the home console. The result is an even more linear design than the original one which occasionally indulged in digressions: on DS instead in 95% of cases there is only one way to resolve the issue, and the challenge often lies in finding it rather than work your imagination and come up with different alternatives. The AI of the enemies is reduced but not too much, just because even in the original it's not like it was who knows what... Here too, in principle, every mistake is paid for by alerting the terrorists, however it seems slightly easier to avoid mistakes, and , in case, escape the bad guys or face them, winning, in a shootout that has something to do with a design like nutella on sea bass Where Gameloft, this time, have made an effort is in exploiting the peculiarities of the DS. Sam Fisher Jr Where Gameloft, this time, have made an effort is in exploiting the peculiarities of the DS. On the lower screen there is always the radar and the keys to access the inventory, night vision and infrared vision; it can be deduced that the tactile function of this screen is delegated to these three possibilities, as well as the navigation of the menus. But, above all, the touch screen allows us the important operation of camera control, essential for recreating the feeling and mechanics of the original game. Unfortunately, the realization of everything leaves something to be desired, even if in all honesty we cannot think of a better solution than the one devised by the team: the problem lies above all in a certain slowness in responding to requests on the screen, and then in the simple fact that, whether you choose to control the camera with the stylus or with the ~Thumb strap~ it makes no difference, you will be forced to move your hand continuously from the screen to the keyboard with consequent dilation of the playing times, which are not so dynamic on their part (indeed ) and general perceptible discomfort of the setup, which in the long run could turn into real physical tiredness. The touch screen also serves to control various viewfinders, and the problems analyzed a few lines ago are reproduced in their entirety. In addition to the question of the setup, a small amount of oversight also weighs on the controls (for example: you can exit the ~Optical~ mode in front of a door only by pressing B; but B is the crouch/get back to standing button, and so you'll be forced to press it a second time to return to the original position) which are just annoying but really could have been fixed with an extra line of code TI want agile and snappy Eight long levels are more than enough for the Single Player to keep us busy as much as we should; the considerable slowness of the game action will probably push you to do only small sessions, and this is met by the checkpoint system, quite numerous during the stages. As in the TV versions, however, there are multiplayer modes: there are two, both usable only if you have as many cartridges available as there are players. Nothing to say about the two-player cooperative mode, from which you can expect exactly what the name says; the 2 against 2 mode, on the other hand, suffers from a very particular choice which sees the game on the side of the bad guys becoming nothing more nothing less than an FPS, with a consequent exponential improvement in control. Too bad that the ~good~ team remains in the third person with cumbersome and uncomfortable controls ... Guess who wins nine times out of ten? An always important aspect of Splinter Cell is the graphic creation: on DS forget even the slightest mention of the marvelous light/shadow effects that have always distinguished the series, but apart from this in general the effect is rendered well and the imprint Splinter Cell is unmistakable. The level of detail of settings and characters is good, always considering that we are talking about a DS, and the textures, often ~pixelated~, are never excessively so. What is wrong is the framerate, normally hovering on the border of annoyance, which largely exceeds it, encroaching on the unplayable when the infrared viewer and above all the night viewer are activated, and it does not happen infrequently, however well made. This can only be explained with an insufficiently careful and/or long optimization phase, since even if we have still seen little of 3D on DS, we can well say that the amount of polygons in CS shouldn't be such a hindrance. Finally, little to say about the sound: the music has never been the flagship of the saga, and therefore here their lesser technical quality is hardly noticed: a different story for the effects, well done even if in a considerably reduced number, however atmospheric those few that are. Completely absent speech, too bad Unlike their DS debut, Asphalt Urban GT, this time around Gameloft are committed to leveraging everything the DS makes available to developers and players. However, the results leave something to be desired because, due to the design choices, the control problems and the low framerate, the game action is slow, cumbersome, devoid of bite. The game is there, it's a more linear and one-way Splinter Cell, and it works well enough to keep it from being insufficiency. However, only if you are not afraid of a game that, already slow and reflexive in itself, also presents the problems mentioned, can you really enjoy it, otherwise it is better to leave it alone. It helps little, then, a multiplayer mode that presents a curious and very striking imbalance in favor of one side in the Vs. Pro section All the features of the DS are exploited Good polygonal detail Level design rethought, rather well Cons Poor framerate + uncomfortable controls = Slow and little bite What can be said in the introductory hat of the Splinter Cell review? We could make a brief reflection on the very high fame achieved by the franchise in a few years (but by now not a few games) of activity and relative compliments to UbiSoft, we could dwell on the fact that by now it is the embodiment of a way of understanding stealth that clearly contrasts with Metal Gear, it could still be noted that so far on laptops, N-Gage aside, the good Sam Fisher had had to give up so much of his essence but that finally on DS he can present himself with almost all his skills in the right place. Yes, all of this could be done, but maybe it's time to get straight to the point; we Third Echelon special and top secret agents like it that way. Um", "date": "2005-07-14", "grade": null}
