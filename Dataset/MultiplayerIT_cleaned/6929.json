Indeed, after the excellent porting of Disgaea 3, Nippon Ichi has decided to re-propose on the Sony laptop what, due to the characters and the irony of the story, is for many one of the most successful chapters in the ten-year history of the strategic RPG franchise. As the name suggests, Disgaea 4: A Promise Revisited brings back the game released three years ago on PlayStation 3, but rather than just being a simple port, it takes the opportunity to introduce a series of additions and small improvements. For this reason, we will focus mainly on the new content here, referring you to our original review for a more in-depth look at the game and its mechanics. After three years from the original, Disgaea 4 arrives on PlayStation Vita with an excellent re-release Portable sardines, dood! Although historical characters such as Laharl and Etna will always remain at the top of the preferences of many fans, there is no doubt that the crazy cast of Disgaea 4 is one of the strengths of the recent episode. Starting with Valvatorez, a gullible vampire who has stopped feeding on blood and has decided to follow a diet of sardines; passing through his assistant Fenrich, calmer, ruthless and planner, always ready to exploit the ingenuity of his lord to carry out diabolical plans; and then Fuka, a fifteen year old who declares war on the Prinny and is convinced that everything that happens to her is part of a dream. Anyone who has a minimum of experience with Disgaea knows what peaks of insanity the dialogues and cutscenes can reach between one level and another, and this is particularly true in A Promise Revisited. For the occasion, however, the developers have integrated into the Vita edition all the DLCs published between 2011 and 2012 on PlayStation 3, including new characters, pirate ships, maps and events. Above all, the two additional stories entitled The Flashback Episode and The Fuka & Desco Show, and an unpublished scenario called Time Leap Episode, have been included, for such a large amount of content that probably only the most patient and tenacious will be able to see the end of the 'adventure. In fact, between thirty and forty hours were needed to complete the original version of Disgaea 4, and considering the amount of extra levels, side missions and new things to do, A Promise Revisited doubles the duration at least. And that's not to mention that you can continue the game after the epilogue to raise your character to level 9999. Thankfully, to the added benefit of the PlayStation Vita version, the ability to take the game with you and play a few short matches between break and a train trip certainly helps to better distribute the hours of gameplay and make each session less onerous. Unfortunately Nippon Ichi didn't think of a system to save the game during a battle, which can be problematic when you're halfway through a long level but the console's battery is almost dry. Among the most appreciated additions, the Cheat Shop stands out, an option that was already introduced in Disgaea D2: A Brighter Darkness and which has been revived for the occasion in this new edition of Disgaea 4. It is a screen that allows you to increase the percentage of experience, mana or coins you get in battle, and as you progress through the game you can upgrade these values or unlock new variables. Although not essential for gameplay purposes, the Cheat Shop is one of those options that we hope will be re-proposed more frequently in the next chapters of the series, because it allows you to freely customize the level of challenge and proves to be particularly useful both in the normal growth of the character than in frequent grinding sessions. However, the innovations introduced in A Promise Revisited touch all aspects of the gameplay, ranging from a new type of magic to the Promotion system seen in Disgaea D2, from new special abilities to a larger inventory, up to the option to change the aesthetic aspect of the different weapons. The simple possibility of repositioning a character within his own area without having to cancel the current action each time seems like a minor change, but it helps make the experience even more fluid, immediate and suitable for a portable console like PlayStation Vita . As usual, any kind of Italian localization is missing, but at least the developers have given the possibility to choose between the original dubbing or the one in English, with a funny Troy Baker in the role of Valvatorez. It's just a pity that in the larger maps edcrowded the framerate collapses in a dizzying way, an unpleasant drawback which in any case does not compromise a re-release in all respects superior to the original for PlayStation 3.", "date": "2014-09-05", "grade": "8.0"}
