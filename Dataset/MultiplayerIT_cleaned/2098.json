{"name": "NBA Courtside 2002", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nba-courtside-2003.html", "text": "To you the choice Once the mini-dvd has been inserted into our GameCube, after a few moments we will find ourselves on the main screen of the game where the various game modes are offered including Quick Play, Arcade Paly and Season Play. Quick play is the classic single game in which we can choose as we like 2 of the teams from the entire NBA for a simple match against the computer or in multiplayer (up to 4 players). The Season Play instead allows us to compete for an entire season against all teams in an endless series of matches up to the legendary playoffs. The Arcade Mode, on the other hand, is a very fun added mode that sees 2 teams made up of only 3 elements compete against each other. The matches take place in an outdoor pitch located on the top floor of a building, while all the complicated rules of basketball remain at home, no fouls, no throw-ins and no referees, in short, everything is permitted in Arcade Play. In practice, this mode is very reminiscent of EA Big's NBA Street, of which it also imitates the famous impossible shots. Under the basket, in fact, the players make improbable leaps to perform powerful dunks for the basket. All in all it is a pleasant addition which, although not too cared for, tends to raise the longevity of the Nintendo title just enough. Also from the main menu of NBA Courtside 2002, it is possible to access the edit section to create our favorite players. It is possible to act on practically every part of the body: from the nose to the ears, from the hair to the cut of the eyes, skin color, height, shoe size and we can even choose the degree of musculature, inflate biceps, triceps, calves, abs and pectorals excessively, also generating real ~deformed~. Obviously, once we've finished having fun, we can easily create professional players who perhaps resemble us or old glories from the past. Original check The main novelty of NBA Courtside 2002 concerns the passing system. In most basketball games, to make a pass to a specific partner, there is a special key which, once pressed, brings up the next key for passing the ball to each member of the team. The Nintendo title, on the other hand, uses a system already tested in Pro Evolution Soccer, or through the C-Stick, the yellow analog stick placed on the right of the pad. In fact, by giving the direction with the stick, the ball will be immediately passed to the indicated player. Although this new system eliminates the hassle of having to press a key first and then switch, it must be said that its use is not exactly simple and immediate, but it takes a certain amount of time to get used to it. However, it is still possible to pass the ball with the B key which however does not allow us to choose the desired player, but will only assign it to the closest partner. Another important function in NBA Courtside 2002 is assigned to the backbone L, with which we will be able to give different degrees of ~adrenaline~ to the player we control. On the basis of the given pressure, first of all the running and the speed of the movements will vary, but also the types of passing, dribbling and shooting will change. Obviously adrenaline has a short duration, so it is not possible to exploit it continuously, but it must be dosed for each action. The R key is instead assigned the function of protecting the ball in the attack phase and ~aggression~ to the bearer in the defensive phase. In the latter case, however, there is a serious flaw to report: that is, the moment the R key is pressed, our player will immediately freeze in an attempt to stop the attack, but more often than not, the opponent will easily get around us to go to the basket, while we will be forced to activate the turbo in a very vain attempt to chase him. For the rest, the control system is quite simple and intuitive, but frankly it's not the best and in some cases, for the most demanding players, it can even be annoying. The biggest flaws of NBA Courtside 2002 are a certain slowness that is noticeable in the movements, especially in the jump phase where one has the clear impression that the player remains suspended in the air for too long, but above all, when walking or running, a certain ~bar of soap~ effect is evident which makes it seem that the players are floating on the parquet and that they are not firmly on the floor. This defect is particularly noticeable during changes of direction. CPU-driven Artificial Intelligence has its ups and downs. Like most basketball games, the game tends to be set up mmuch more on offense than defense. While to go to the basket we have the possibility to choose various types of penetrations or shots from outside and a considerable number of dunks, defending is really difficult. In addition, the computer, in most cases, will always try to score in the same way, i.e. by passing the ball to the central attack under the basket. On the other hand, the AI, in some phases of the game, is well developed. For example, if you are ahead and there are a few minutes left in the game, the opponents will increase their pressure up to committing continuous fouls to recover precious seconds and, if necessary, the computer will try to solve three-point shots in an attempt to recover . All in all, this aspect should not be underestimated, given that for example in NBA 2k2 I had noticed that despite being at a disadvantage, in the final stages of the match, the opponent governed by the CPU continued his game as if it had just begun, therefore without vary the type of game based on the result Graphics Technically, NBA Courtside 2002 is a very good title but not without its flaws. The most impressive aspect is that of the faces of the players, reproduced with truly incredible care. Those who love the NBA will have no problem recognizing them simply by looking at their faces. What is less convincing, however, is the rest of the body. The feeling is that the players are a little too squashed and that the musculature is too angular and fundamentally unnatural. By this I don't mean that they are badly done, but there is no doubt that the developers have not dedicated the same time and care that the faces show instead. Nonetheless, the number of polygons that compose them is decidedly high. All the states of each team are then made excellently thanks to quality textures and covered by an agitated audience made up of high-resolution sprites, which however repeat themselves a little too often. On the sidelines we can then admire the benches of both teams who react differently based on game actions; but far from what I admired in NBA 2k2 where in addition to the teammates, on the sidelines you notice the presence of the coatch and even the legendary cheerleaders! Kobie Briant, star of the Los Angeles Lakers, in addition to appearing on the cover of the game and in most of the menus, spent a lot of time for the developers to perfectly recreate the movements and animations of the players with the famous motion-capture technique. In fact, it is possible to admire a considerable number of shots, dunks and various jumps made with ultra-realistic movements, but probably the excessive willingness to experiment with this technique is also the reason for the general feeling of slowness that is noticeable in the movements of the players. The problem could be solved thanks to the possibility of increasing the game speed, but in this case, the players will run in such a rapturous way, especially by activating the turbo, as to be too unnatural. For the rest, there are no particular defects, and the general aspect is still very good, above all because there are no frame rate drops and the fluidity is really excellent. Sound The audio is normal, even something more could have been done. During dunks we can hear a cry due to the player's effort. The public roars constantly and the commentary does not highlight any particularities, sometimes being a bit monotonous and limited. Conclusions Overall, NBA Courtside 2002 proves to be a decent title which however does not reach the spectacularity and fun that only the Sega title has managed to offer up to now. The main defects are a not particularly accurate AI, a slightly too defective control system and a slowness of the animations which, although well done, take away the feeling of realism. Among the advantages, however, we should mention the new system of passing with the analog stick, which after a bit of training can guarantee excellent results; a good visual impact and the arcade mode which undoubtedly helps to increase the longevity of the game. For the moment, NBA Courtside 2002 is the only GameCube basketball game available for the European market, so if you are a true NBA fan you will probably be satisfied by bringing home a valid product anyway. But I can't help but tell you that during the last E3 in Los Ageles I had the opportunity to admire and try on the GameCube the latestimo jewel of the Sega house, NBA 2k3 and the difference is really great, as well as the time that we will have to wait to get it! So the conclusions are up to you! Pros: Very useful new passing system Good graphics NBA Street style arcade mode Nothing else on the GameCube for the moment Cons: Animations too slow AI not very well done Some problems in the controls Lacks the feeling of realism NBA Courtside 2002 Basketball for Americans is roughly what football represents for us Europeans (but especially for us Italians). It seems impossible but the truth is that in America, no one would dream of getting up on the morning of the release of Winning Eleven (or Pro Evolution Soccer) and running to get a copy of Konami's game. This, on the other hand, happens punctually for basketball games, after all, immediately after football, one of the most popular team sports in Italy as well. That is why there is a certain interest in new titles concerning this highly spectacular sport. For years, EA Sports dominated the market with its never-ending series of NBA Live, until the intrusion of Sega Sports with its amazing NBA 2k, without a doubt the best basketball simulator ever made to date, which is therefore become the benchmark for any basketball game. Left Field Productions has developed NBA Courtside 2002 especially for the Nintendo GameCube, a sequel to 2 titles that previously appeared on the N64, with the intention of challenging Sega's incredible masterpiece.", "date": "2002-06-10", "grade": null}
