The story of the game tells about the cute monster named Sulley who inadvertently let a little girl into the world of monsters. Your job will be to help Sulley bring the little intruder called Boo home safely. To complete your mission you must first of all visit Monstropoli and at the same time be attentive to the agents of the CDA (Alien Decontamination Center), always careful to find every slightest trace of human presence in their world. Furthermore, Randall also thought of putting a spanner in the works who, having discovered that little Boo is hiding with Sulley, destroyed the door which is the only way to get Boo back into his world. To reassemble the door you will have to deal with Rundall and his henchmen and only by defeating these shady individuals will you be able to bring the tender and defenseless little girl home. Sulley and Boo Starting a game of Monster & Co. you can choose whether to start from the beginning or enter a password that will make you start from the last level you completed. The game consists of a total of six levels plus a bonus level. In Sulley's Apartment you will have to rummage under the beds and in the corridors in search of the keys and the pieces that make up Boo's door. You will have to be careful as usual to the CDA agents always ready to hinder you in any way. In the streets of Monstropoli you will have to explore the rooms of the city avoiding the usual agents and electrified puddles looking for Boo's teddy bear and the pieces of the door. In the shops and restaurants of Monstropolis you will have to look for Boo's toy and the pieces of the door while being careful of the hidden monsters, the rolling barrels and the sushi chefs you will find in the sushi restaurant. In the locker room and the bathrooms you will have the entire location being careful not to run into the hidden monsters and find the keys in the streets of the night Monstropolis and bring Boo back to Sulley's room. In the door jump you will have to try to reach the door while avoiding the petulant CDA agents. Finally, in the door puzzle you must have obtained all the pieces of the door that will allow Boo to return to his sweet little house. If you succeed in the enterprise you will have access to the Boss room at the end of the level. Finally there is a bonus level called Skiing the Himalayas in which you can collect extra points.

Inside the levels you will have above all to avoid the annoying agents of the CDA. Every time they touch you you will lose energy. You'll need to use the roar attack by pressing the R key to scare the agents and or the laughter cannon by pressing the L key to stun them. Only one imperative: bring little Boo home! Monsters & Co. is a good game with a solid and well-defined plot thanks also to the good work done by the developers who based this adventure on the film which is enjoying some success in cinemas. Overall a fun action game neither too complicated nor too simple suitable for gamers of all ages. Pros: Fans will be able to play as their favorite Sulley Decent graphics Well done soundtrack The environments are very detailed The bonus level is spot on Cons: Six levels are few and compromise the longevity of the game You will finish it in the blink of an eye The monster factory has opened downtown! The world of video games is beautiful because it is varied. However, this saying does not apply to the editorial staff, at least in this period, given that after assigning me the review of Monster & Co. for PS2 I now find myself in my hands the Game Boy Advance version of this game which features the characters of the homonymous film that in this period is screened in Italian cinemas. The modest success of the film in theaters could lead the public to continue the adventure on the screen of the Game Boy Advance.", "date": "2002-04-12", "grade": null}
