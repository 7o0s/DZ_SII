{"name": "Mobile Forces", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mobile-forces.html", "text": "How do I mobilize you an army ... The presence of the vehicles is the fulcrum of the entire game for MF, in which little else is highlighted, if not a conspicuous variety of game modes present, including in addition to the classic deathmatch / teamDM / CTF, there are some partially original , such as the one in which you have to try to assassinate the opposing team leader or that of the trailer (a trolley with a bomb) transported by means of tow, to be positioned on the target of the opposing base (in some shots some clear examples). But going back to talking about the vehicles (land only) you can count those like ~dune buggies~ (famous for the action films related to the genre), the military transport trucks (very similar to the Italian conscription ones), the semi- armored vehicles and wide trim jeeps, usually used to transport the bomb cart. Apart from the obvious differences in ~tonnage~ between the vehicles, other aspects that distinguish them are the seats available on board, resistance to gunfire, speed, inertia and stability on the road. In fact, a dune buggy is much faster than a semi-armored vehicle, but a couple of machine gun bursts on the tires are enough to make it hop happily in the air. The use of the vehicle is essential to quickly mobilize the assault troops towards the opposing target, considering that almost all the maps are kilometers long and traveling them on foot would correspond to a loooong (and boring) march, which usually takes place in the open (the direct routes are also the most open ones). The most exhilarating thing from the point of view of the intelligence (I would say deficiency) of the bots is that when you are driving the vehicle you have to give an ~attack~ command, otherwise your cheerful companion does everything except get on the vehicle. When, on the other hand, a bot takes the lead, most of the time you will find yourself running from a sprinter like a madman, ranting at the top of his lungs at that reckless automaton to wait for you, since he has inexorably left you stranded (uhmmm ... they make me come in mind our diligent bus-bussers at the time of high school ...). However this aspect clearly indicates that the bots are placed there for simple training of the maps, since even at high difficulty levels they always show their ignoble and reckless artificial deficiency! ... of Blue against Red! Or viceversa. I open a small parenthesis since I can't help but mention this week's football match between the ~reds~ of Denmark and the ~blues~ of France, which saw the latter abdicate its world title in a way to say the least little indecorous! Not even a goal scored and a measly point on the scoresheet! A small revenge for us Italians, repeatedly slapped by our cousins from beyond the Alps! Returning to our MF, the teams in the field will be distinguished by their ~colour~: blue and red. Apart from this, the skins and features of the players are strictly the same, marking another point against the game. The arsenal, of which you can see some explanatory shots, is functional and not very varied. At the beginning of the game we have the possibility of being able to choose our paraphernalia based on the size (or weight) that it entails. For example, if we had to bring our beautiful machine gun with rotating barrels, we would hardly be able to choose to bring the MA41 (or at least its graphic surrogate) with us. Therefore it is desirable that the player chooses more on the basis of the ~role~ he has to cover on the field than on that of pure war ~passion~, otherwise the team would immediately be unbalanced, presenting almost everyone with the same weapons on the field. More than anything else I can mention that in the version given to us for review (90% complete, with no documentation and some missing maps) the efficiency was still far from perfect, but I was able to ascertain that even in the ~public~ version final everything remained completely ... unchanged! Among other things, the graphic effect of the shots leaves very disappointed, with a mapped flash taken verbatim from dad UT, plus all that series of sound effects taken in a shameless way always from the same game. I understand that MF is based on UT core, but since some ~free~ mods had the happy idea to ~change~ at least this aspect (see Strike Force), minimal changes were made in MF, and since the game is sold at full price, I would have expected a LOT more in that respect. But without getting lost in useless chatter, the very nature of weapons smacks of hackneyed and we are a long way from the high levels of technical perfection seen in other similar games. Indeed, we are so far away that MF has taken clear and obvious ~backward~ steps, erring on superficialityand making their use tacky and not very ~tasty~. In conclusion Mobile Forces is a title to be played purely with ~human~ teams. We also had several lag problems on the pre-final game servers and it seems that these gaps have remained anyway, given that the UT kernel had to be better refined in order to support the physics of the vehicles in game. If we wanted to exclude this aspect (which still covers its importance) and play it in LAN, the mediocre graphics and sinful sound immediately emerge, which inexorably break MF's (already crippled) legs! What can I say... if I were to give it a numerical rating, the game would just reach mediocrity. MF's only true antagonist remains Tribes, who bluntly beat him (allow me this pun) in several respects. But since MF's target remains an audience that wants to have fun immediately and without racking their brains too much ... well ... leave it where it is and look for another game, which is better! Otherwise, if you really can't do without it and are ~magnetized~ by the presence of the means, download the demo, try it and judge for yourself if the game is worth the asking price. Mobile forces This Mobile Forces is a mestizo game, which includes Tribes elements (thanks to the presence of the vehicles, which can transport several players simultaneously) and team-deathmatch elements of the famous Unreal Tournament (different game modes, some of which are original). When I was about to review MF, the first time I saw it I said << ... damn how bad it is!>> because of the non-existent balance of the weapons, the sometimes jerky graphics (even on computers of all respect) and the sound taken verbatim from his father UT, from which he also draws the entire graphics engine. In fact, at first glance this MF looks just like one of the many ~free~ mods created galore for the Digital Extremes title. Then, with the holy patience of the Carthusian reviewer (hehehe), I undertook dividing the title, playing all the maps and all the modes present, and in the end I changed - even if in part - my initial opinion << ... so bad is not ...>>. What really leaves a bitter taste in the mouth is that the game has been made too ~arcade~ and not very ~realistic~, and advanced level players who prefer slightly more complex (and long-lasting) games to simple (but more immediate) they will look at him sideways from the very beginning, without dedicating more than a few hours of play to him. It's a real shame because deep down the idea of the means, even if in the end ~recycled~ from that of Tribes, from that healthy extra touch to the inflated and all the same game module of the First Person Shooters of the last period.", "date": "2002-06-12", "grade": null}
