We find out in Rodeo Stampede: Sky Zoo Safari, the new endless game developed by Featherweight Games for iOS and Android devices. Downloadable for free, the game offers a management section that sees us organize the various areas of our park, enhance the habitats of certain animal species and buy new spaces, all with the aim of creating an attraction that is visited by hundreds of paying people. The upgrades must be purchased with gold coins, the in-game currency, which is earned not simply by collecting it during the action phase, but by hitting certain bushes and crates, as well as by completing the numerous missions available. When you're ready to run, a cannon will shoot your character onto land, directly on the back of an ox, and that's where the endless component of Rodeo Stampede: Sky Zoo Safari will begin. Keeping a finger on the touch screen, our task will be not only to avoid obstacles and the impact with other fleeing animals, tracing lines left and right based on an isometric view; but also to change mount when the beast we are on should run amok, making it difficult to stay on its back. When this happens, we will be able to lift our finger causing the character to jump and reposition it so that it lands on the back of a new animal, with which to go a few more meters with the inevitable aim of reaching the greatest possible distance. Rodeo Stampede: Sky Zoo Safari stands as a welcome variation on the theme of endless games Among the clouds If the management phase of Rodeo Stampede: Sky Zoo Safari leaves a little the time it finds, the endless sections are instead very fresh and fun due to the great variety of animals available, each characterized by different values in terms of speed, stamina and the aptitude to follow our orders. Then there is the element of novelty, represented by ever-changing mounts that appear from time to time along the route, and which must be ~tamed~ by remaining on their backs for a few seconds. Once this operation has been successfully completed, we will be able to photograph ourselves riding the animal in question, entering a real selfie mode, and add both the shot and the new species to our roster. The freemium aspect of the experience appears to have no particular constraints, in the sense that there are no timers or action energy to be consumed for each new attempt, but the progression is a little slow and earning new gold coins is not always easy . However, there is the possibility of continuing a game to game over simply by watching a short trailer, as happens more and more often in this kind of productions. Immediate, fun and fairly varied, Rodeo Stampede: Sky Zoo Safari can also count on colorful and very pleasant graphics, which use the voxel style to deliver animals that are really nice to see, which move within scenarios that change often, alternating between different landscapes and an incidence of obstacles and pitfalls that increases progressively.", "date": "2016-07-06", "grade": "8.0"}
