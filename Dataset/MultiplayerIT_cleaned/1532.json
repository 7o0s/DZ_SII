I think many, but try to think how difficult it can be to find yourself from being a simple boy who delivers pizza at home to being a delivery boy who works from one side of the universe to the other, accompanied by an alcoholic droid and a decidedly emancipated. This is precisely the story of poor Fry, a not very smart ex-inhabitant of the twentieth century, catapulted into the year 3000 due to an, um, accident with cryogenic capsules and employed by his future nephew as a member of the very shabby crew of the Planet Express, tiny interplanetary messenger company. The game obviously puts the player in his shoes, alternating them with those of Bender (the robot) and Leela (the monocle), with the task of once again saving humanity from the clutches of Mamma (who follows the TV series if he will surely remember her), an apparently docile old woman who actually has ambitions of conquering the world. As already mentioned in the introduction, the developers have opted for a game structure that favors variety, trying to diversify the gameplay as much as possible and proposing a mix of genres which, even if it doesn't shine for originality, if nothing else risks getting bored player. So here we will find ourselves guiding our heroes (well, so to speak) through levels ranging from a typically platform structure to one with obvious ~racing~ contaminations, perhaps passing through some subjective sections which, especially these days, they are definitely in fashion. However, all this has a price and, as often happens, the excessive variety is paid for with a lack of depth and care of the various sections, in this case above all as regards the calibration of the level of difficulty: the game is in fact seriously compromised by the overabundance of power-ups and the Artificial Stupidity (strictly with capital initials nd Tanzen) of the enemies, elements which, combined with a slightly nervous and imprecise control system and collision routines to be reviewed, inevitably precipitate the final judgment towards the low areas. High fedelity As has been a tradition for some time now, the graphic style used to reproduce the cartoon imprint of the series as faithfully as possible is invariably the loved/hated cel-shading, with more than satisfactory results all in all. In fact, having overcome the initial shock due to the extra dimension, which generates a sort of slight distortion in the appearance of the characters, we find ourselves dealing with extremely faithful polygonal models, both in terms of features and animations, inserted in environments that are perhaps a little too simple, but which recreate the feeling of the animated counterpart well. Too bad only for the decidedly limping frame-rate, in serious difficulty in guaranteeing even just those 25 fps which should represent the indispensable minimum, but which here instead often even seem like a utopia. On the other hand, the impressions regarding the sound sector were enthusiastic, very faithful to the TV series both as regards the music and the dubbing (also in the Italian version!), thus contributing in a fundamental way to the player's identification and helping to create a sense of continuity with the cartoon that fans will love. The longevity factor is terribly affected by the lack of challenge offered by the game, given that an average player will certainly not take more than 5-6 hours to complete the adventures of Fry and his companions, however the massive dose of extras, such as artwork, movies and music to unlock, will offer more than enough incentive for fans of the series (but, mind you, only them) to pick up the title even once it's finished. Comment Futurama is the classic product which, thanks to an important license, neglects some fundamental aspects to make a title worth playing. Mind you, it is definitely better than many other tie-ins, and the effort made by its developers in this sense is evident, however the combination of insufficient longevity, a graphics engine often in trouble and a ridiculous difficulty level inevitably confines the title in the limbo of mediocrity. The myriad of quotes and extras (not to mention the fact that the game represents an episode of the series in all respects) make Futurama a practically unmissable product for fans of Fry and company; everyone else would do wellto calmly evaluate the purchase, given that there are decidedly more attractive products on the market. Pros: Very faithful to the animated series A brand new episode Cons: Uncertain graphics engine Undemanding Disappointing longevity After a long series of titles set in the prolific universe of the Simpsons, the videogame industry has finally decided to get its hands on Futurama, the latest creature of that pillar of demented irony that responds to the name of Matt Groening. And it also does so with a certain ambition, thanks to a plot specially written by one of the authors of the series and an almost absolute fidelity to the cartoon, seasoning everything with a decidedly varied gameplay to conquer not only fans, but videogame users in general. But will all of this be enough to overcome the curse that has historically afflicted tie-ins?", "date": "2003-10-03", "grade": null}
