From now on, however, the two parts are sold together as one game. Finally, keep in mind that we allowed ourselves some small (but small, eh) spoilers. Where were we? Oh yes, many months have passed since the release of the first part of the game - it was still 2013 - and we admit that we have lost contact with George and Nico. Fortunately, the excellent writing of the game allows us to quickly rediscover the natural sympathy towards the legendary couple, who remained poised on the edge of a ledge in London, while the apartment behind them burns dangerously. While waiting for the firefighters to come to their rescue, we have time to remember the trail of death and mystery linked to the Gnostic painting known as the Curse, finally in George's hands. But then we leave immediately for Spain. The change of scenery is evident: warm and bright colours, a languid atmosphere, and a madman who welcomes us with rifle shots. From this moment on, George and Nico will never leave each other, working together to solve the mystery that revolves around a theological dispute between Gnostics and Christians with intriguing philosophical drifts. Driven to choose between a world where either order or free will prevails, George's sober and reflective nature will still seek the right compromise (hooray, we've revealed the ending!). In short, all in perfect Broken Sword style, with the classic encroachment on the esoteric world. At this point, however, we should ask ourselves whether the two parts of the game put together work properly, a difficult mental exercise since they have been divided with an axe. They certainly offer two very different and perhaps for this reason complementary approaches to adventure. The first half, despite the dead it left behind, had a lighthearted tone and focused more on the investigation, leaving us free to choose how to move from one location to another via the game map. There were also many more supporting characters, some of them still fresh in our memory for their irresistible idiosyncrasies. Now instead we are forced to move from one place to another following the rhythm imposed by the game and stopping only for the time necessary to solve the riddles of the moment. On the other hand, the density and level of difficulty of the puzzles balances the simplicity of the first part. And above all, the game takes the time to explore all the background, bringing the subplots to a conclusion before closing on a triumphal note. All things considered, Broken Sword 5: The Serpent's Curse is one of the most successful installments of the series and does justice to its name. At these levels of writing and production, a classic point and click adventure can hardly offer better. Ah, we forgot: the second part of the game starts with a goat. Now that you know, if you prefer to let it go, know that we understand you very well. Cheers for George and Nico, ageless stars in Broken Sword 5: The Serpent's Curse Cerebral understanding The second part of the game begins with a moderate increase in the difficulty of the puzzles. The first to have put us in difficulty concerned the orientation of two statues, immediately followed by a coded message contained in a telegram. All in all, at least in this fifth chapter, the goat has proved to be much less of a bastard. The amount of puzzles in general has also grown significantly, however at the expense of interaction with secondary characters and exploration. It must be said that this choice is not arbitrary, but goes with the fact that the plot brings us ever closer to the heart of the mystery. Therefore, fewer eccentric characters and more ancient mechanisms accompanied by esoteric symbols. This type of setting with a lot of religious curse hidden in the heart of the mountain has already been seen and seen again, we are aware of it, but not with the eyes of George and Nico. Listening to them talk to each other and with the other characters is a pleasure, not only for the beauty of the lines of dialogue but also for the characteristic humor of the series, very well interpreted by the voice actors. We also enjoyed the way Nico alternates with George during the investigation within the same scene. In fact, the developers occasionally remove the blond from the center of the action, leaving the beautiful French journalist free to explore the same screens. In his shoes, however, objects that were previously irrelevant become indispensable to continue, and his discoveries are added to those of George, giving the impression that they also collaborate on an intellectual level. For once the presence of two non-playable charactersit is resolved with one going around the block to open the door to the other. In one case, the gorgeous couple even gets busy within the same puzzle. In fact, George has to play a tune using improvised tools like a paint bucket and a fire extinguisher (this, for the record, is a puzzle that made us sweat); once the melody is right, Nico takes over, and he can complete the work. It is these moments that made us love the second part of the adventure and we regret that they weren't more numerous. However, beyond the peaks just mentioned, among which we also include a particularly ingenious use of the hideous cockroach that George has been carrying around since the first episode, the setting does not offer great elements of variety compared to all the similar mysteries already faced in the past . Flowing passages, ancient prophecies, and symbol-filled tablets are the order of the day. If there hadn't been all the previous hours spent wandering between London and Paris we might have felt a little tired. In the whole of the two parts, however, The Serpent's Curse is a journey so rich and fascinating and with two protagonists so charismatic as to keep even the last four hours of the game at remarkable levels for the genre. After almost twenty years, Broken Sword still hits the mark. Two of one By putting the two pieces of the game together, an adventure emerges that allows itself for once the time necessary to let all the characters breathe, without however losing the thread of the story. There is also room for quotes dedicated to historical fans of the series and there is no shortage of moments of genuine inspiration. The escalation of events that culminates with the grand finale is lined with brilliant gags, such as the dialogue between Nico and Shears during the cable car scene, but the actions of the two main villains are not very incisive and almost secondary in the development of the plot. Most of the time it seems that the engine of the action is more George's curiosity about the mystery than the plans of the two antagonists. Indeed, the first leaves the scene in a very inglorious and anticlimactic way, while the second lends itself to an obvious final confrontation. Were it not for these structural weaknesses, and for the rigidity of the second part, The Serpent's Curse could have aspired to even greater heights. Perhaps those who will play it in one go will grasp its global merits that unfortunately escape us - and even if we wanted to start over from the beginning, it would no longer be the same. That said, production value remains very high. There are beautiful pictorial looking backdrops, unforgettable characters, fine animations in most cases and a writing that serves the main characters beautifully, bringing them out in all their glory. George and Nico, as they have been characterized, would look good in a film, or in a novel. And it's one of the rare contemporary point-and-click adventures that we would like to recommend to everyone, even those who have never heard of Broken Sword. Indeed, it is precisely these who have the opportunity to discover the qualities of a classic in its modern guise, if such a thing is possible. But yeah, it's Broken Sword - it can do that and more.", "date": "2014-04-25", "grade": "8.0"}
