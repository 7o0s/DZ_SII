Without wanting to take anything away from the various FIFA and PES, excellent in the role they play, the Sports Interactive series is in fact the one that manages best to awaken in us all the passion we feel for football, bringing us to the center of its varied dynamics . The appointment with the game created by Miles Jacobson and colleagues is part of a tradition that has been renewed for more than twenty years, during which this simulation has been enriched with many elements that allow you to completely trace the life of a coach. Witness the countless stories (to the point that a documentary has even been dedicated to them) on the impact of Football Manager in the life of those who let themselves be captivated every year by the enormous involvement that this game is able to exercise, bringing those in front to the monitor in first person between the bench and training fields. Spending hours and hours adjusting tactics and looking for tomorrow's talents is the only way to accompany the chosen club to victory, then witnessing the result of our work once the day of the match arrives. We did it again this time in the company of Football Manager 2019, and now is the time to tell you what we think of this new chapter. The main news: tactics and training Like all the other annual titles, Football Manager also has to face the need to renew every time to justify the purchase of a new edition, beyond a simple update of the squads and championships. Football Manager 2019 is somewhere between the most conservative and the most innovative vintages, bringing some interesting ideas on some aspects of the game but at the same time suffering from some historical flaws that the series has been carrying around for several years. Starting from the first ones, one can only start from the new tactics system developed by Sports Interactive, the real heart of the managerial experience of every Football Manager. Despite the interventions of the developers, over time the tactical module had become a bit too complex even for the most experienced players of the series. Football Manager 2019 tries to simplify this by first introducing a set of predefined playstyles starting from popular terms like tiki-taka, gegenpressing and so on, while allowing less experienced players to have a predefined system to rely on and to the more experienced ones to be able to start from a base, on which to then go and build their own game idea. The latter can now be defined between the three phases of attack, transition and defense, each of which has its own submenu that collects the various options. However, the indication to the individual player on how to interpret his role remains similar to the past, for example attributing to the center forward the label of false nine, pure center forward, etc. Overall, the system is decidedly more intuitive than in the past, offering, as we said, the right compromise between immediacy and depth that is right to expect from such a central component for the gaming experience. The new section dedicated to training also seems to refer to the same principles, another historical exposed nerve for Football Manager on which Sports Interactive has tried to intervene with mixed success. This edition provides the possibility of defining a weekly plan divided into three daily sessions, each of which can be dedicated to the specific aspect on which you want to concentrate. For example, a day can be divided between attacking on the wings, tactics and defending the ball on the ground, always remembering to give the players the right amount of rest and to dedicate the necessary preparation and rehabilitation sessions after the effort to the pre and post match. After an initial impact, the system may seem complex especially to those who do not have particular knowledge of real training, but luckily we have our staff who can help. In fact, it can be entrusted with the initial definition of the training calendar in order not to run into errors that could jeopardize the performance of our team, then going to check the situation firsthand once the right familiarity with the various programs has been acquired. The gameplay: new interface, old glitches As we said at the beginning, Football Manager has become bigger and bigger over time, to the point that the risk of getting lost in its menus to reach a certain option is alwaysalert. For this reason, the developers have once again dedicated part of their work to the creation of the interface this year, which, starting from tactics and training, tries to give all the other sections a fresher and more immediate look. Adding more options to watcher reports is probably the most welcome aspect since the revolution we made in this section last year, when we unintentionally complained that we didn't have all possible actions just a click away. For the benefit of those who do not feel comfortable in the dynamics of each section, Sports Interactive has prepared in Football Manager 2019 what is called ~manager induction~, an interactive tutorial linked to all the main aspects of the game. In intention it is obviously dedicated to novices of the series, but we do not deny that we too used it in some phases to refresh the functioning of the aspects we remembered less. Moving on to the rest of our virtual manager life, we can't help but notice that some of Football Manager's historical flaws keep popping up here and there as we progress through our adventure. It almost shocked us to see that the interaction with the media remained almost identical to that of previous years, as well as that inside the locker room. In the case of interviews, the presence of a few more answers does not reduce the level of boredom that assails us in dealing with the many questions before, after and during each game: in the editions prior to Football Manager 2019 we managed to resist answering in first person , while this time we have delegated everything to the deputy. Having finally found a balance between tactics and training, we hope that in the next edition this aspect will become one of the priorities to be renewed. The engine: the VAR arrives Throughout its history, Football Manager has often proved receptive to innovations that in the real world have a significant impact on the football universe. In previous years it was Brexit that had become an integral part of the game, while Football Manager 2019 introduces two aspects related to technology on the pitch: VAR and goal technology. In championships that use it (including the Italian one), it is therefore possible to see the referee taking a few moments to approach the screen, before miming the classic ~square~ gesture with his hands to validate a goal or award a penalty. In general it is undoubtedly an addition that increases the level of realism of Football Manager 2019, even if its application seemed a bit exaggerated to us even when the actual location of a foul inside or outside the penalty area was also quite clear watching the game at normal speed through the 3D engine. The latter continues to take a few steps forward, even if some connecting animations continue to be missing which in some cases make the movements of the twenty-two on the pitch awkward. Also in this case there are some historical defects such as too many injuries (on which the developers have already said they want to intervene), some senseless choices by players (why shoot from the edge when there is all the space to enter the area? ) and matches where the opponent's goal seems haunted. Seeing the following screenshot with clean sheets and thirty-two(!) zero shots in the first half is to be believed. Finally, we also report a couple of application crashes, which occurred at seemingly random moments: we advise you to save often.", "date": "2018-10-30", "grade": "8.2"}
