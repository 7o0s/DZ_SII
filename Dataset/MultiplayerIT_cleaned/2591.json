{"name": "Dogs of War", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dogs-of-war.html", "text": "The interface Now let's analyze a fundamental aspect for a strategic one, the management of the game interface, it must be said that it could have been done better, in fact while with one hand you will have to use the mouse with the other you will have to manage the movements of the camera, the rotation of the same and the zoom, the forward, backward, right and left movements are obtained with the direction keys, the rotation instead is obtained with the combination of shift plus the direction keys, and this could already have been implemented in a better way, finally the zoom is managed with the + and - keys of the numeric keypad, of course the remappable breast keys but in any case, especially at the beginning, you will have to try your hand at real keyboard virtuosity. For example, for managing the zoom it would have been much better to be able to use the mouse wheel. As far as the graphical interface of the game is concerned, we are at good levels, even if many of the options it makes available you will use very rarely, given that the combinations with the keyboard prove to be faster, the table for managing the groups. We become cameramen Let us now analyze the management of the cameras. The zoom level is very good and allows you to observe almost the whole map from above or to restrict the view to a single unit, it is very unlikely that you will find yourself playing with a fixed view throughout the game and you will often find yourself changing the visual looking for the one that best suits each given situation, which is a considerable advantage. Furthermore, at any moment of the game you can switch to the direct control view of any of your units, which means that you will no longer give it the mouse commands typical of all RTSs but you will control it directly in its movements with the arrows while you will manage it with the mouse aiming and fire, just to understand with a Tomb Raider-style third-person view. In this way you will have total control of the vehicle, you will also be able to have your other units follow and escort you or continue to give them orders. The singleplayer and the multiplayer Dogs of War has both a single player and a multiplayer mode, let's start by analyzing the single player. In the missions you can choose whether to play the dogs of war or the imperial troops. The two factions differ quite a bit in their usage. While with the mastiffs you will find yourself facing your opponents head-on with the use of armored units, with the imperial troops you will have to use surprise attacks with chosen troops. The missions can range from defending a bridge, to recovering men to protecting a city and so on. It is to be appreciated that the missions are well differentiated from each other you will never find yourself doing repetitive tasks, but there will always be twists or unexpected events that clearly differentiate each mission from the other. Another noteworthy thing is the fact that it does not matter in which part of a unit you shoot, just to give you an example if you shoot a tank from the front you will inflict very little damage while if you hit it from behind with a few shots it will be destroyed. this increases the tactical aspect of the game even more, forcing you to plan your mission well. A demerit note should be made to the artificial intelligence, which in some cases could be renamed artificial deficiency, with enemy units that in some cases do not even react when you are shooting them. Another thing I didn't like very much is the fact that the missions are quite unrelated to each other, the logical thread that unites them is almost non-existent. Movies could have been inserted that better tied the missions together. Another thing that many may not like, especially those who are not an RTS veteran, is the high degree of difficulty of the various missions, quite high right from the start which could discourage trying this kind of game for the first time. games. In multiplayer mode, in addition to the 2 factions present in the single player, you can also use the Mantai, a kind of armored dinosaurs, some capable of throwing fire or blending into the environment. You can try your hand at the classic challenge between the various participants or between teams. Also in this case you will be able to choose the units to be used only at the beginning of the game and you will have to manage them in the best possible way. In fact (and this also applies to single player clashes) it is useless to try to attack your opponent en masse with all your units head on, 90% of the time you will meetto a humiliating defeat, you will have to choose carefully what to employ, a single well employed unit can do much more damage than a frontal attack with all your troops. Finally, the sound As far as the audio effects are concerned, we can say that we are at a good level, with a masterful management of the EAX and A3D that give a big hand in immersing you in the 3D world of Dogs of War, the comments of the units are also very well done (unmissable the training mission), the music on the other hand is without infamy or praise, but never annoying. There was a world far away.. The real-time strategy games are going through a golden age, they are in fact in the pipeline or some authentic masterpieces have already been released and Dogs of War seems to be among these too. DoW is set in a recent future during which man has now embarked on space exploration by founding colonies on various planets. One of the first was Primus IV; things seemed to be going well in the colony until it was attacked by the Mantai, a race of sentient indigenous creatures. They never proved to be diplomatic creatures: anyone who fell into their hands was killed or dragged into their lairs. The colonists pleaded with Earth for help but their pleas were ignored and they were overwhelmed by the Mantai. Over the years the Earth seemed to have forgotten the colonists until a new mineral was discovered on Primus, SL18 an extremely resistant material, the Earth was increasingly dependent on the new mineral, but the colonists could not wait for anything else to be able to take revenge for the wrong suffered when they were left alone against the Mantai and began to sell the SL18 to other planets as well. The emperor therefore decided to send a landing force to Primus to restore order, but the colonists, strong in their economic power, hired the Dogs of War, in order to impede the advance of the empire. The game begins right at this point, with the imperial troops ready to land and the dogs of war willing to do anything to defend the planet. In the game it will be possible to play both factions. First of all it must be said that Dogs of War differs enough from the classic RTS, in fact the management of resources and the production of vehicles and structures have completely disappeared, in fact in each mission you will start with a certain number of units that will remain there throughout the level, this implies that you will have to plan the various attacks in the best possible way, since losing even a single unit unnecessarily could prove fatal for the completion of the level. At the beginning of each mission you can select which of your men to assign to the various vehicles or to use on foot, this choice will prove to be of fundamental importance given that the use of unsuitable vehicles and men will lead you to immediate defeat. Another thing to consider when choosing men is their level of experience, in fact all the men who survive the various missions will gain more and more experience, thus making them more effective in battle. Once you've selected your men and read the mission briefing, you're back in the game proper. Thus, you will be able to admire the quality of the graphics engine, entirely in 3d. The graphics are very clean and of great quality, especially for a strategic one, and the landscapes are reproduced with very high detail, particular mention goes to the water effect, one of the most realistic I've ever seen.", "date": "2001-04-27", "grade": null}
