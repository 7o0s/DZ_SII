{"name": "Inbento", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/inbento-recensione.html", "text": "With the review of Inbento for Nintendo Switch we will try to answer one of the most important questions of humanity or: can a cat be able to prepare a bento? Not only purring, wagging his tail, hunting for mice, ruining furniture and sofas in the house or spending his days sleeping, but also correctly placing food in the typical Japanese tray with lid used to serve a meal. Yes, because the purpose of Inbento, a new game by the Polish team Afterburn, already author of Golf Peaks, is just that. In reality, the cat thing is just a narrative device that gives life to a cute story about parenthood, a simple background to the series of puzzles that represent the real core of the game. Puzzles and kittens Inbento debuted at the end of last summer on mobile platforms, then iOS and Android, reaping good success. As has already happened in the past, thanks to the affinity of the hardware, the touch interface and the ecosystem of the eShop, the developers have well thought of giving life to a conversion on Switch. As per tradition in the case of puzzle games, telling the mechanics is much more complex and cumbersome than discovering them simply by playing with them. In addition, Afterburn's work from this point of view is absolutely commendable: the progression is gentle but far from slow, the elements are introduced in a sip-stepped way and the logics are extremely understandable and accessible but by no means simplistic. In extreme synthesis, it is precisely a matter of preparing a bento following recipes. Each level has a recipe that must be replicated to perfection, and to do so you must ensure that the appearance of your work is identical to the reference. In practice it is therefore necessary to place the ingredients at one's disposal inside the tray. These, of different shapes but always made up of ~cubes~, can be rotated before placing them in the bento box; but the key element to take into account is that the ingredients can be superimposed, even if only the last one that has been inserted will be calculated. In addition to the simple ingredients, there are also pieces that cause the movement of one or more ~cubes~ or the exchange of position with others. We repeat: in words it is complicated, in practice absolutely not. Without a doubt, however, Inbento is not an ~easy~ game, because it is enough to get to the third or fourth chapter to necessarily start racking your brains, working with logic and broadly considering the consequences and connections of 3, 4 or more moves in sequence . Equally certainly, being able to find the solution to a level generates enormous satisfaction, and gives a great incentive to tackle the next one. Technically From a technical point of view there isn't much to talk about, because Inbento is a simple game even in its aesthetics. While counting on a pleasant and spot-on graphic style, there are no frills or particular effects at all beyond the representation of the simple bento and ingredients. Not that a puzzle game takes much more than that, to be honest. The sound accompaniment, on the other hand, is not much, even annoying at times: we preferred to deactivate it after a short time, also to favor concentration. The interface is obviously based on interaction via touch screen, which is certainly the preferable solution using the console in portable mode. Anyone who for some reason prefers docked use and therefore on the TV should know that control via Joy-Con is also allowed, which works quite well even if you lose some speed and immediacy. Finally, as regards longevity, Inbento offers a total of 127 puzzles: taking into account that, after the introductory levels, one is soon faced with the need to spend more than a few minutes on the individual puzzles, it can be said without fear that the overall duration fully justifies the reduced selling price. Finally, there are obviously neither in-game purchases nor freemium elements, so the only cost remains that of purchase.", "date": "2020-03-12", "grade": "7.5"}
