It fits into the vein of those ~emotional~ adventures that have had a lot of luck on PC with exponents such as Dear Esther or Gone Home and which have found sensational landings on PlayStation such as the award-winning The Journey. Well, there is no trace of titles of this type on Microsoft's home consoles, at least not significant. Knowing that the first exponent with a minimum of echo arrives thanks to a team born and raised in Rome, with members coming from years in the world of video games around the world, is very pleasing. A rather rapid development in fact, if we consider that the first signs only occurred at the beginning of last year and that Nero is distributed in its final form on May 15, 2015 exclusively on Xbox One. The game was born with a project for Wii U and therefore developed entirely with Unity with good ambitions and a theme that is certainly challenging. That of love, family and the sacrifices one is willing to make for it. Nero is the first game by the Italians Storm in a Teacup: it's a pity it didn't fully convince us Nero's Drama The protagonist of the game, all subjective, is this little hooded creature with a luminescent robe that crosses a strange world populated by flying jellyfish, fluorescent plants and animals that initially light up a series of caves dotted with strange constructions of unknown origin. The story is told, in a rather courageous way, on several levels, namely that of the aforementioned family and that of a band of brigands who in time immemorial have inhabited this strange place littered with centipedes and gigantic mushrooms. Everything is played on the thin thread of fiction, fantasy and a deliberately dark, painful story which in the console panorama is decidedly anomalous and which leads to an ending of which we do not anticipate anything but which cannot leave you indifferent. The first of the game's problems, not the only one, however, is the full understanding of this story which, despite being developed by an Italian team, is completely in English including subtitles. It is true that the good dubbing of the narrative voice would have suffered, but in a title that focuses so much on emotions and curiosity, our language would have helped to reach a wider audience. However, managing to overcome this rock, you find yourself immersed in an emotionally shattering swamp to cross by solving a series of environmental puzzles with which you interact by throwing blue energy spheres on switches, pillars and platforms that move ancient devices for four chapters and as many settings. Already after a quarter of the game, our protagonist is joined by another, larger, hooded character who can be directed to certain parts of the seabed so as to be able to unlock more complex mechanisms. Of this kind of puzzle there are mandatory ones to continue and optional ones with the latter activating panoramic scenes on the settings in which the narrator paints more precise features of the ongoing drama. As mentioned, they are not necessary, but they help to enter even more into the world of Nero. Xbox One goals Black is a pretty generous game. We finished the first run collecting 570 of the 1000 target points expected, but reaching 1000 seems to be just a problem of re-exploring the four chapters in search of the missing frames, as there is no difficulty level to choose and there is no reason to replay other than that to make full loot which is a rather easy undertaking for anyone with a minimum of patience. Jellyfish and hospitals The puzzles are quite simple to understand and solve and only on a couple of occasions can one be perplexed about what to do, but it almost never happens with the puzzles necessary to continue the adventure which can therefore be crossed in just over three hours. Scattered around the levels, whose maps then become larger and full of hills and shrubs, there are a series of frames that contain fragments of some photographs to be collected to unlock the related objectives. By collecting them all and solving the puzzles, it is difficult for Nero to last less than five, six hours, at the end of which one cannot remain indifferent. It's a fascinating experience, but a bit expensive, given the 19.90, in which the puzzle component is just an excuse to pace the narrative and in which of the four chapters only the first two can be said to be truly complete. The third, distressing and morbid, lasts a breath and the fourth serves to launch the good ending, but has only one puzzle to solve. A climax is missing on the gameplay front which reaches its peak in the middle of the game with thehe most exciting sequence of the whole title also thanks to a sound accompaniment that is perhaps the best thing about all Nero. Really incisive and well intertwined with the settings and situations in which it is found. Nero gets off to a good start, slows down a bit, and then gets lost with the interactions between the two characters being used for only a handful of puzzles, but it's still a brave and out-of-the-box title. Neither Unity nor the technical realization help him which in any case shows the side of a limping frame rate in the more complex scenes and a polygonal modeling that sometimes leaves something to be desired, failing to satisfy the ambitions of the game designers. Especially when leaving forests and caves behind with narrower environments the frame rate gains, but the details jump out at the eyes suspending a bit the beautiful atmosphere created.", "date": "2015-05-15", "grade": "6.8"}
