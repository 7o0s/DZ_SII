Knowing is Power is missing to sum up the PlayLink experiment of PlayStation 4. This last title also focuses on the encounter between smartphone and home console, in order to offer intuitive, fast and engaging fun for everyone present in the room. Knowledge is Power tries to do it by dusting off what used to be the heart of the old Buzz: a series of sweeping questions where not only the most perspicacious wins, but above all the fastest. Playstation 4 trophies You may not play Knowledge is Power with the intent of taking home the platinum trophy, but know that it's there. Among other things, obtaining it is not even too complicated: however, you will have to play, replay, and overplay the title, even in groups of six people at a time, using all the avatars, all the games, and all the gadgets to annoy the opponents . Warmly welcome our competitors Knowledge is Power is the PlayLink title that best embodies the basic idea of the series. It can be played strictly by two participants up, up to a maximum of six, all connected to the PlayStation 4 through the application that can be downloaded for free on mobile devices (the game on PlayStation costs twenty euros instead). If the network is unstable, the console is able to generate a direct channel for communication with smartphones, bypassing the problem. After a simple initialization, everything is (and will be) managed with the phone in hand, using the touchscreen controls and the internal camera. Competitors challenge each other to those who know more in an improvised quiz show, complete with a talkative presenter, whose suggestions and explanations are extremely effective for the first approach to the game mechanics. The questions concern the most disparate topics and the most distant interests: typical dishes of various countries, general culture, politics, literature, cinema, cars, comics chase each other in an apparently bottomless cauldron. Always in full board game style for brainiacs, sooner or later each user will find the most congenial topic for him, even if of course the product is not designed for the little ones. The selection of the various answers is entrusted to the touchscreen of your smartphone, where the four possible solutions are indicated from time to time. When pressed, the red and green colors will immediately inform us of the outcome of our performance, which will be repeated a few seconds later on the screen for all the participants, with the alter egos they will move towards the corresponding box. Who win? Who of course knows more than the others. But the procedure is not that obvious: a score is assigned to each correct answer, which also depends on the speed of selection of the answer itself. Not to mention several tricks and teases to embarrass your opponents, making them lose precious points. Pyramids, bombs and snowballs Fast and pressing, the matches of Knowledge is Power are always based on a dozen multiple choice questions, but interspersed with a couple of mini-games that break the monotony by offering a different type of challenge. Sometimes it is a question of linking words that have some affinity between them: the artist to his works, a state to its cities. But there are also solutions focused on completion: for example, starting from the words ~life~ and ~death~ we should quickly insert one or the other within a series of film titles, set phrases, famous jokes, and even more. After completing the sequence of standard questions, the final phase of the game begins: the Pyramid of Knowledge. Based on the score accumulated up to that moment, we will place ourselves on a more or less high step compared to our opponents, so as to be able to start with an advantage or a disadvantage. Whoever reaches the top first wins, but in reality the substance does not change from what has been seen up to now, since a new sequence of questions on the most varied topics begins again. It would have been much more interesting to alternate the playful offer with something different, but the Wish Studios title doesn't seem to want to go too far beyond what is basically a proven and effective formula. Here too it will be possible to hinder the other competitors with infamous but functional gadgets, based on gelatinous substances that will prevent the reading of the answers on the smartphone, snowballs that will slow down the selection, and bombs that will block it completely in case of impact with our finger . A note of merit for the technical sector: although this is certainly not one of the titles that must show the muscles of the console, the improbable, caricatured and cheeky graphic style marries the general fluidity ofthroughout the production, leaving the eye almost always satisfied.", "date": "2017-11-26", "grade": "7.0"}
