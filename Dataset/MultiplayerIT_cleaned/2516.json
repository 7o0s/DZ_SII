{"name": "Quake 3 Revolution", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/quake-3-revolution.html", "text": "Why ~Revolution~? Spending some words to introduce and describe one of the most famous titles that exist might seem absolutely superfluous, but I'll be lenient and, for those two or three of you who don't know anything about Quake 3, I'll go here to illustrate what this masterpiece from ID Software. Let's start immediately by saying that Quake 3 Revolution is developed by Bullfrog, a team that has managed on balance not to disappoint in addressing the difficulties involved in converting a ~must~ of the genre. In fact, let's not forget that we are in the presence of the most played title on the net in the world, and that when it was released on PC it allowed online challenges like no video game had ever done before. Now, thanks also to EA, this never too praised king of multiplayer arrives on our PS2, where he will have to contend with two rather fierce competitors, and which correspond to the name of Unreal Tournament (also a conversion of the respective computer counterpart) and Time Splitters. Everything is now to see which of the three will win. First of all, we immediately underline the fact that, just like its two challengers, Q3R too cannot be played on the Internet. This is because Sony's choice not to immediately commercialize a 56k modem in order to be able to aim for online gaming right now, has led the developers to impose certain limitations. Precisely because of this serious impairment, they had to reinvent and enhance the ~single-player~ aspect, as well as having had to riskily adapt the ~multi-player~ mode to the old split screen system. Single-player and Multi-player It must be admitted that playing Q3R alone is not a bad experience after all, thanks to the structure effectively studied and adopted by the programmers. They have in fact tried to connect the massacres that we are going to carry out in the arenas with a sort of common thread, which will link the various missions. To begin we will have to choose between five characters, each with different characteristics, which will make the approach to the game quite different. As the warrior chosen by us progresses in the enterprise, he collects upgrades that have the function of increasing his values, such as strength, armor, and so on. These upgrades are not then lost from level to level, but are even shown in the character model and can be saved on a memory card for use even in group play modes. The types of challenges present for single player are quite varied and range from the very cruel ~Deatmatch~ (in which we will have to kill as many opponents as possible), to ~Elimination~ (we will have to kill everyone before losing the lives at our disposal) , to ~Capture the Flag~ (in which we will be persecuted by hordes of enemies while we try to keep possession of a flag for as long as possible), to then continue with other variations of these modes. So the job done to ensure a decent depth to this part of the game is good, even if its true heart is multiplayer, considering that this is its real origin. As mentioned, support for up to four players in split screen is provided (if we play in two we can choose the vertical or horizontal division of the screen). The modes available are practically the same as described above, with the difference that here there will be the possibility of facing them in an ~all against all~ or by creating teams. Regardless of the number of human players, thanks to computer-controlled bots, up to six fighters can be present at the same time, unlike the large crowds with more than ten players that are created on the net via the PC. Of course it must be said that unless you have a nice big TV, you will really struggle to play in the small portion of the screen that will be assigned to you. In fact, when two challenge each other, things already change, having a wider view available, which consequently generates less confusion in making you disentangle the narrow and dark corners of the arenas. PS2 vs. PC Anyone who has played the original Quake 3 Arena that has been out for almost a couple of years now will have no trouble realizing that this conversion is the result of the obligatory technical limits of a console compared to the more pumped-up Personal Computers. Consequently, those who are used to seeing Quake run on a powerful processor will immediately notice the difference in terms of speed and fluidity. However, counting that until yesterday it was unthinkable to see a titleor similar on a console, and considering the young age of the PS2, one can't really complain. Thus, in this sense, the good work done by its authors during the programming phase can be seen. Technically speaking, in fact, Quake 3 Revolution makes a great impression, offering a top-level visual spectacle. The graphics are excellent and fast enough to guarantee unbridled fun at times. We are certainly not dealing with the special effects created by the very latest PC graphics cards, but otherwise everything has remained unchanged. The levels are in a gothic and luxuriant style, with endless curved surfaces, hallucinating textures and decidedly effective atmospheres. The single player game features a really high detail, a resolution of great workmanship and above all a frame-rate nailed to 50 frames per second, if not in some very sporadic situations, in which you can notice very slight slowdowns, caused by cumbersome graphic effects and particularly complex architectures. Even switching to the game in split screen for two and four players, the situation remains unchanged, even if of course we will end up with a loss (however acceptable) of detail due to the small size of the windows. The sound is taken verbatim from the PC version and is therefore also excellent: both the effects of the weapons, and the music (in a hard rock style perfectly suited to the situation), and both the voices of the various characters (all localized in Italian, like the entire game) do their part very well in making all the adrenaline-pumping challenges just right. Nobody's perfect Unfortunately, like all games, Q3R is not without flaws. In fact, wanting to overlook the terrible impairment such as the lack of modes for online challenges, given in any case as mentioned by choices independent of the Bullfrog's will, one cannot fail to reproach its developers for an unsuitable adaptation with regard to the settings of the controls they implemented. First of all, they eliminated the possibility of the comfortable mouse-keyboard pairing usual in first-person shooters, then justifying themselves by saying that it would not have been easy to find the right balance of difficulty level such as to be able to guarantee a balance between the use of these controls and those of the joypad. The Dual Shock 2 was thus left the only way to be able to manage all the multiple commands present. Furthermore, as if that were not enough, they have also entered a standard configuration for it, but without even leaving us the possibility of customizing them to our liking, consequently forcing us to spend a long time before finding a setting that suits our tastes, and which allows at the same time to be able to walk, look around and shoot aiming enemies (which is much easier said than done). Other small flaws of the game can be seen in the five selectable difficulty levels (which should be enough to entertain both newbies and Quake experts, but which on closer inspection seem sincerely ill-calibrated), and in the long loading times between arena and the other (sometimes really endless). So, is it worth it? Ultimately, Quake 3 Revolution, despite the many limitations in its game structure, the absence of online challenges and its difficult controls, beats the direct competition currently present on the Playstation 2 without too many problems. So, if you have any friends available to challenge you and you want a good reason to buy the multitap, feel free to spend your hard-earned savings and buy the Q3R CD: you will see that thanks to it you will spend really intense afternoons. If, on the other hand, you've already been playing it for a while on your PC, or you think you'll find a good successor to Quake 2 or Medal of Honor to play it alone on your new Sony console, the advice is strongly not to pay attention to this title from the EA and indeed wait for the release of the now imminent Red Faction and Half-Life. Pros: graphics worthy of the biggest PCs, very engaging multiplayer atmospheres and challenges; amazing enemy AI Cons: lack of online play difficult controls and exhausting loading; ~single-player~ mode too repetitive Viuulence! Are you the type who likes to spend long hours focused on video games that you are passionate about due to the strong brain effort required and who like to amuse their brains with immense strategies? Well, then if that's the case I think you'd better turn the page right away and look it up on queI'm site the review of a game that has these characteristics, because here ... you've just landed on the wrong article! Quake 3 Revolution is everything except a video game that requires even a minimum of intelligence. Its only purpose is in fact to vent all the deadly and disgusting thirst for violence that is hidden inside you. And if you have some friends on whom you would like to turn this violence against, then that's even better. Therefore, only and only if you think that this thing might even interest you in the slightest, go on reading, and start warming up your joypads, because the biggest manhunt ever seen on the Playstation 2 is about to begin.", "date": "2001-05-08", "grade": null}
