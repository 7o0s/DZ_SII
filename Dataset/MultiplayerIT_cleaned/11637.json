{"name": "Magic Match", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/magic-match.html", "text": "Puzzle games like Magic Match have a very long history behind them, having been born in the wake of Tetris. Games in which you don't have to fit pieces to continue in the stages, however, but (as happened in a classic like Columns) place the equal elements side by side in a number of three or more so that they are eliminated. In this specific case, making blocks disappear does not clear the screen, rather it changes its layout to possibly create new possibilities. In Magic Match all this is justified by the numbers found on the right of the board, which indicate how many units of each type of ingredient we need to create a potion and, therefore, continue towards the next level. The forty-two stages that make up Magic Match are divided into locations, each one introduced by a sort of ~karaoke~ that plays a piece of music over a rhyming text. The arrangement of the board gradually becomes more complex, and if in the first levels we manage to put together the necessary ingredients without too many problems, later it will be necessary to resort to magic from time to time: by pressing the left function key, we will be able to choose whether to mix the elements of the board or whether to swap the position of two adjacent cells. How the game works is quite simple: we will have to identify the ingredients arranged in groups of three or more adjacent elements, then select a cell by moving over it and pressing the FIRE (or 5) key, follow the path on the adjacent and equal tables, then press the button again to make the ingredients in question disappear and see them deducted from the count on the right side of the screen. All this until we have the ingredients necessary to create the desired potion, which will automatically move us to the next stage. To make things more complex, extra elements will begin to appear on the board that can represent an advantage or a disadvantage: solid blocks that cannot be eliminated, but also flashing boxes that can be associated with any ingredient, or ~bombs~ that they delete a category of items on the screen. Time will be marked by a bar placed in the upper part, which empties as the seconds pass and which will determine the game over once it reaches zero. As in any mobile puzzle game, Magic Match doesn't boast a shocking technical achievement and doesn't need to: the graphics manage to be functional to the action and there are no problems of any kind, even if the design in general is characterized by a which is anything but exciting. It is possible to identify the elements on the screen quite quickly, even if it is almost impossible to ~think~ about the movements because things are rather confused: there is not too clear a differentiation of the ingredients in terms of color, so you have to do a little of attention. The sound has the merit of accompanying the games in a nice way, with some catchy music and a series of extremely simple effects. Nothing to say about the control system, which in fact consists only of the joystick and the FIRE button, as well as the function keys (the left one to use magic, the right one to pause and possibly save): you learn to play after a few seconds. PRO Simple and immediate A good number of internships Some good finds... AGAINST ...but the game doesn't involve that much Sometimes confusing graphics Not the best puzzle game ever, quite the contrary", "date": "2008-02-07", "grade": "S.V."}
