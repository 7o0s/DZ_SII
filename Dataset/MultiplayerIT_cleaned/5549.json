{"name": "Scusate il ritardo", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/167067-final-fantasy-ix-scusate-il-ritardo.html", "text": "With Final Fantasy IX, Square Enix ends the PC porting of the ~PlayStation Era~ of the Japanese saga, after having inaugurated it nineteen years ago: in fact, the first Windows version of Final Fantasy VII dates back to 1998, followed by a couple of years later, the eighth chapter. At this point, only the first two and those made for PlayStation 2, i.e. the tenth and twelfth, are missing. A very welcome version also because, according to the famous vote aggregation site Metacritic, it is the episode with the highest score ever (94): the arrival on the Steam platform is therefore an excellent opportunity to rediscover this authentic masterpiece which at the time, especially in the West, did not record the same success in terms of sales compared to its predecessors as the release (we are talking about Christmas 2000 for America and even the beginning of 2001 for Europe) was already several months the futuristic PlayStation 2. Final Fantasy IX for PC is a basic port, but the game remains great even after the years No danger to you Here's Orko... that is, Vivi particularly pissed off... Today we can evaluate this JRPG that should not be missing in the collection of those who define themselves as a fan of role-playing games. For the porting, Square Enix relied on the small Thai studio Silicon which in practice took the contents of the 4 CD-Roms on which the original title was divided, making it intelligible to Microsoft operating systems. Among the few changes worthy of mention is the possibility of playing on high definition screens: in this case the hand-drawn backgrounds on which the protagonists move are ~stretched~ based on the chosen resolution, fortunately maintaining the correct proportions . Final Fantasy IX was in fact designed for obsolete 4:3 televisions, therefore decorative sidebars are applied to the current 16:9 that fill the surface of the monitor. The polygonal models have been the subject of a slight update that makes them more detailed and even the great full motion video cutscenes have benefited from a gain in definition. From the point of view of the game structure, there is the introduction of an autosave, which therefore does not force you to use the Moogles forcibly, and the possibility of using some cheats, renamed boosters, such as the removal of random clashes and so on: options that however we recommend not activating it as the level of challenge is not prohibitive even for the less experienced. To underline a mapping of the keys at least curious if you use the joypad for Xbox; to be avoided like the plague instead the idea of relying on mouse and keyboard. In the very first stages of the game, the ticket for the theater show must be validated The story begins when the Tantarus theater company, which also includes the protagonist Gidan (as known, it is the ~Italian~ name, given that in the original version it is called Zidane: a choice born to avoid juxtapositions with the French champion who played for Juventus at the time), a warrior with a monkey's tail, decides to take advantage of a representation in the city of Alexandria to kidnap Princess Garnet. Once at the castle with their flying galleon, the comedians succeed in their intent with excessive ease: in fact, the girl even goes so far as to ask to be taken away from the clutches of Queen Brahne who for some years has risen to control after the death of the old King. The wizard Vivi (who said Orko?!) and the captain of the guards Steiner also participate in the escape, to which Freija, Quina, Eiko and Amarant will be added during the course of the work, for a total of eight player characters. Structures Final Fantasy IX, while maintaining the game architecture that made the fortune of the two predecessors unchanged, presents a return to the past on a stylistic level, offering a medieval setting that the saga had abandoned in favor of the cyberpunk universe of the seventh and contemporaneity of the eighth chapter. One of the first and most delightful subgames The player finds himself moving not only Gidan, but also the other party members, which already happened with the various Clouds and Barrets: this allows you to experience the adventure through different points of view, guaranteeing considerable depth to the story and increasing the level of empathy towards the protagonists which in itself is already very high. The merit must be given to the creative vein of the designers who have managed to create extremely strong and captivating personalities to which one binds quickly and simply. The story is really good, full of plots and twists and, although notproperly original, it holds up beautifully the important task of keeping the player's curiosity alive for the entire duration of the title, the completion of which will not be less than thirty hours. As always, the gaming experience can be divided into two phases: inside the inhabited centers you will mostly find yourself conversing with the non-playing characters, collecting some quests and above all enjoying the countless sub-games that are one of the gems of the game. Square production. Suffice it to say that from the beginning you can enjoy jumping rope or following quick time events in the representation of a sword duel: these are only the very first examples of how Final Fantasy IX can undermine social life. Then we will have to scan every single pixel to look for hidden treasures; the real protagonist, however, is the card game Tetra Master which even has its own dignity within the main plot. There are also the adorable Chocobos, in turn honored with a section dedicated to breeding which will lead to the creation of an ever stronger and more dynamic ~big chick~. I can kill you! As per tradition, the number of dialogues is generous, but in this case the programmers have given the player the opportunity to decide whether to further explore the plot thanks to the so-called real-time events: in practice, it is the possibility of watching some cutscenes which, although since they tend not to be influential for the purposes of the plot, they provide interesting details on the protagonists. The Tetra Master The Italian translation is peculiar because it does not disdain some dialectal slang which provides an even deeper and more bizarre cut to the psychology of the characters. At the time, a real diatribe arose over the opportunity to debase a universe as harmonious as that of Gaia with unorthodox expressions: it is a choice that certainly does not leave one indifferent and which, in any case, years later, could also be re-evaluated . In any case, to the delight of purists, there is the possibility of opting for languages other than ours. The soundtrack has, as always, been entrusted to Nobuo Uematsu, whose quality standards are excellent even if the usual perfectionists could argue that the master was not in the brightest moment of his career while composing the Final Fantasy IX soundtrack. During the wanderings from one village to another, the view moves to the game world and here the other cornerstone of the series clearly emerges, that is the fights which, as per tradition, are random in the exploration phases. In this case it will be possible to bring four of the eight characters available to the battlefield, each of which is extremely conditioned by their own skills: Steiner for example is the classic tank with an industrial amount of life points and the possibility of attacking in melee; Vivi masters black magic, Gidan is a thief and so on. The fights take place with the mythical Active Time Battle rule: conceptually they are turn-based battles, but they are managed as if they were in real time to ensure a more lively rhythm. The well-known action bar fills up over time; in this episode you can choose whether to freeze the stopwatch when selecting the type of attack or whether to continue in the fray aware of the fact that it will be necessary to quickly decide what action to have the unit take. In addition to the usual physical and magical attacks in Final Fantasy IX, the state of Trance also appears, the counterpart of the Limit Break of the seventh, which gives a sort of Berserk mode once a lot of punches have been collected. Also noteworthy are the skills that work in a conceptually similar way to matter and that are learned only when certain objects are equipped which with use unlock more powerful ones.", "date": "2016-04-26", "grade": "8.0"}
