Legacy of the Duelist: Link Evolution let's talk about Yu-Gi-Oh!, one of the most famous trading card games in the world. Our readers with fine memories probably already remember a review of Yu-Gi-Oh! Legacy of the Duelist: Link Evolution on Nintendo Switch, published last summer always on our pages. And they remember well, in fact: quite simply that game, enriched with a certain number of new contents, is now preparing to debut also on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC (via Steam). If at the time you trusted him on the Nintendo hybrid console, however, do not despair: a free update will be available just in the next few days. Let's examine the title in question, trying to understand what has changed, what's new, and what has been revised in the meantime. The contents Yu-Gi-Oh! Legacy of the Duelist: Link Evolution is ready for its second launch on PlayStation 4, strengthened by some new content that was previously absent on Nintendo Switch. As you may recall, for example, the plot of Yu-Gi-Oh-! Vrains stopped after a few episodes: now among the playable characters (with respective decks) you will also find us characters such as Varis, Emma, Lightning and some others. You will be able to unlock them by continuing in the main campaign, which faithfully follows one saga after another of the anime Yu-Gi-Oh! Obviously, a lot of things have changed in the trading card game in question since last summer, starting with the publication of unpublished cards, never seen before. For this reason, Yu-Gi-Oh! Legacy of the Duelist: Link Evolutions on PlayStation 4 will include 900 previously absent alters from launch, for a total of over 10,000 cards featured within the entire title. All the more so Yu-Gi-Oh! Legacy of the Duelist: Link Evolution is reconfirmed as the most complete game of the franchise launched on the market in the last 20 years, at least from the point of view of content. The latest additions consist of a series of unpublished duels and stories related to the story of Yu-Gi-Oh! Vrains, all available without making additional purchases within the title (just unlock one and the other in the single player story mode). This obviously does not exclude the arrival of new paid DLCs in the near future, such as those that have accompanied players since last summer on Nintendo Switch. Plot Check out the new contents of Yu-Gi-Oh! Legacy of the Duelist: Link Evolution, you will probably have noticed that the ~new version~ arriving on PlayStation 4 (and Xbox One and PC via Steam) is none other than the package previously proposed on Nintendo Switch, with the addition of all the news of the case related to the evolution of the franchise in the last months of 2019, and in the first few months of 2020. The fact remains that in any case these contents are able to enrich even the game plot of the Konami-branded title to a minimum. Previously Yu-Gi-Oh! Legacy of the Duelist: Link Evolution already allowed you to relive all the narrative arcs of all the anime series; will now carry up to the latest events shown in Yu-Gi-Oh! Vrains. Precious opportunity for opera lovers, who will thus be able to challenge the protagonists and enemies of the last narrative arc; after all, the current owners of Yu-Gi-Oh! Legacy of the Duelist: Link Evolution on Nintendo Switch will simply have to download a free update to get back on par (it will be available from next March 24, 2020). The plot of Yu-Gi-Oh! Legacy of the Duelist: Link Evolution presents an extremely linear and standardized progression: duel after duel the protagonist, building his own deck, faces the main protagonists and antagonists of every single narrative arc, from the first saga of the Pharaoh and Yu-Gi-Oh ! GX up to the most recent, futuristic and dystopian. Of course, continuing from opponent to opponent, different rules, game modes and types of cards are also unlocked, i.e. Synchro, XYZ, Pendulum, and so on. Those who have never particularly appreciated the new game rules can simply stop at the first two series and stay with those available rules. Playstation 4 trophies Yu-Gi-Oh! Legacy of the Duelist: Link Evolution comes to PlayStation 4 with a whole host of Trophies, including the Platinum Trophy. To obtain it, it will be necessary to complete all the narrative arcs, defeat all the duelists linked to the CPU of the title, win at least one online ranked match, finally respect some conditions over the course of many duels (damage to be inflicted, monsters to be summoned, special conditions, and so on saying). You will also need to win a game using Exodia's effectProhibited! Limits and some considerations Yu-Gi-Oh! Legacy of the Duelist: Link Evolution on PlayStation 4 has some obvious limitations, the same ones that we actually underlined at the time also for the Nintendo Switch version of the Konami title. As editor of your own deck and from the point of view of the richness of the cards present, we simply have nothing to object to; but it is undeniable that the single-player adventure and that the management of the levels is incredibly sparse. Poverty of animations, game environments, effects as a whole make Yu-Gi-Oh! Legacy of the Duelist: Link Evolution incredibly sparse, a simple duel simulator that is still sold at full price (39.99 euros). In all the months since last summer there would have been at least the time to add animations for summoning monsters, or the presence of 3D animations similar to those of Yu-Gi-Oh! In short, Duel Links on mobile devices. But no: it's a simple fetch and update operation, with no major changes whatsoever. As a result, the vote remains the same.", "date": "2020-03-24", "grade": "7.0"}
