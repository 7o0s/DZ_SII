Firstly because the development team, ZeptoLab, is known to the general public for the blockbuster Cut the Rope and nobody expected that they would be dedicated to something different in a short time; secondly because it is the first freemium title of the Russian studio, a project that on paper pushes a lot on the competitive interaction between different users. The name of the game says it all, since our goal throughout the adventure will be to become the king of thieves. This means first of all building a fortress to keep the gold that we'll be able to get during the various missions, then invade other users' bases to steal the precious ones they've collected. The mechanism works through an asynchronous system, in truth, and you never come into direct contact with your potential victim; who will have, just like us, to organize the defenses of his fort in such a way as to make it really difficult for us to reach the chest full of gold. From this point of view, the solutions adopted by ZeptoLab are very interesting, because it is possible to place traps, guardians and anything else to protect our possessions, but to save the configuration of the fortress we will have to demonstrate our ability, overcoming its defenses to twice in a row. The rest draws on the tradition of freemium productions, with stones, deposits and padlocks to be gradually enhanced to make it increasingly difficult to cheat us. And if someone is clever enough to do it anyway, we will be able to follow their tracks and seek revenge... King of Thieves is an interesting and immediate title, but spoiled by an unfortunate freemium approach Time jump We have said that the idea behind King of Thieves is to reach the gold chest located in each fortress, whether it is that of a real user or one of the eighty missions that make up the single player campaign of the game . But how exactly does the gameplay work? It's actually all very simple, and to control the character just a single touch on the touch screen. Characterized by an automatic movement, which only changes direction when we bounce against a wall, our petty thief is a little creature with funny connotations, who can take large leaps to avoid circular saws or more or less agile guardians, trying to reach the chest to complete the mission and return to base with a few more gold coins. At first the operation turns out to be quite simple, but as you progress through the levels the challenge gradually becomes higher, new objects are introduced to interact with and often you have to make several attempts to obtain the desired performance and the traditional three stars. In case of problems, however, the King of Thieves experience will not be particularly punitive, going to ~delete~ the enemy or the trap that has put us in great difficulty to allow us to continue, albeit at the cost of a lower score. Jumping from one platform to another, bouncing off walls, checking the position of enemies and so on are all operations that require precision, timing and a cool head, however the feeling is that the basic concept does not lend itself very well to complexity that the game tries to achieve from a certain point onwards. Apart from these doubts, the big problem of the new ZeptoLab title is the management of keys and padlocks, which act a bit like the classic ~action points~ of freemium productions, reloading every few minutes but adopting a random setting that makes really frustrating to run out of tries. In fact, before accessing any fortress, we will be faced with a certain number of locks and we will have to use the keys in our possession to get the right one right, precisely with the risk of running out of them without succeeding. An unfortunate approach, which dampens even the most fervent enthusiasm and overshadows the excellent technical realization of the game, capable of proposing very fluid, colorful and pleasant to look at graphics.", "date": "2015-02-21", "grade": "6.0"}
