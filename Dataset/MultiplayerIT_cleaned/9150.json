From Eternal Darkness to the most recent Alice Madness Returns, there are countless titles that at least once have challenged the player's ingenuity and patience by recycling this listless puzzle design expedient. What if instead it was the adventure that was placed inside the Game of 15? This was the intuition that in 2009 gave life to the first Continuity, a student project that earned the four Ragtime Games students several important prizes and awards. Precisely because of the game mechanics, their bizarre puzzle platform seemed designed specifically to be played via touch screen, and it is therefore understandable the enthusiasm of the fans to know that its sequel, Continuity 2: The Continuation, would not only be released on iOS devices, but it would have been designed precisely to make the most of the tactile interface of the iPhone and iPad. Continuous surprises Continuity 2 proposes the same and identical idea behind the first chapter: you play a stick man in a two-dimensional puzzle platform in which to reach the exit by collecting all the objects along the way. In short, the usual story, except that each level is divided into a certain number of tiles that must be constantly moved and rearranged to compose the correct path. This is not always easy, as it will often be possible to pass from one level fragment to another only if the two pieces of scenery fit together perfectly. We start with rather simple puzzles, consisting of only three or four tiles that give the player the opportunity to become familiar with the mechanics, and then move on to infernal levels divided into eight different tiles in a flash. From this point of view, the developers manage not to frustrate those who play with a learning curve that is too steep, but rather take them by the hand in the first few levels, letting them walk alone as soon as things start to get more interesting. Since the path is in continuous transformation and must be broken down and reassembled over and over again during each level, the player can not help but reflect on the next moves to make, while trying becomes completely useless in puzzles a bit ' more complicated. But the development team didn't limit itself to creating dozens of unpublished levels and bringing a two-year-old game to the iPhone: the possibility of inverting the gravitational force by rotating the device represents an important novelty in gameplay, adding greater thickness to the whole game and forcing, in the more advanced puzzles, to move the various tiles taking into consideration all four possible points of view. As if that weren't enough, the last levels introduce a system of doors, switches and circuits to be connected by moving the tiles: some could argue that there is really TOO MUCH meat in the fire, but as mentioned at the beginning, the developers have done an impeccable job in not make the experience frustrating as you go along. A trophy system rewards if you collect all the numbered icons scattered around the level or if you finish the challenge before the time limit, ensuring a certain degree of replayability for those who want to complete the game 100%, not to mention the recent integration with Game Center, which through its objectives offers even more difficult timed challenges. AI earning more, in the transition from browser game to iOS, was certainly the feeling with the controls, and even if someone will have to digest the need to swipe a finger to jump, zoom on a tile or move them in the grid it is now much more intuitive, comfortable and fast. The only note perhaps concerns those rare levels in which pinpoint precision is required to avoid deadly stings, an obstacle that moves badly with such a simplified control system. As for the graphic style, however, Ragtime Games has preferred to maintain the minimalist solution of the original chapter, perhaps a little bare but certainly spot on and able to allow the player to guess, without getting distracted, which tiles can fit together. It's a pity only for the rather repetitive music that nullifies the pleasant sensation of distance or proximity that one has when the volume decreases or increases depending on the zoom.
