{"name": "Million Dollar Poker", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/million-dollar-poker.html", "text": "It's hard to believe, but watching people play poker can be fun. It must have happened to everyone to watch even a few minutes of some such broadcast, commented by the usual assorted duo who bring ~color~ on the one hand and technical expertise on the other. Well, either for the fact that poker players in general are bizarre characters, or for the direction that shows us the cards of each participant in real time, in the end ~one feels in the game~ and ends up getting excited even if the main component of gambling is missing, i.e. risking money in the first person. If you like, it's a bit like what also happens in videogame reductions of poker, where you win for fun and certainly not to get a cash prize... Million Dollar Poker, in this case, is a very rich title in all its aspects and tries to recreate sports poker games with great detail: each player is described in detail, each hand is played by individual participants and there is a particular beware of the artificial intelligence of our antagonists. The start screen allows us to try our hand at a quick game, start a career or face a challenge. The latter is, in practice, a two-player game: we will have to deal with only one opponent at a time, who is increasingly dangerous. Career is the modality characterized by the highest degree of depth, however: starting from our houseboat, we will have to move to various locations and participate in very demanding challenges, in which the classic rules of Texas Hold'em apply. This means that we will have to make several players leave the table, trying to make the right choices at the right time. The game control system is not based on the combination of selection / action, in the sense that we will not find ourselves managing an indicator and selecting choices, but the latter are directly assigned to the keys of our terminal: pressing 2 plays all the capital, with 4 we check or call, pressing 6 we can raise and with 8 we fold. The 5 key is used to see the two cards in our possession, which are only folded on the table, in a rather realistic way. The same key is used to determine the amount of the raise, if we have made that choice. Finally, the function keys will allow us to skip the slowest phases of the game, which, however faithful to real games, can quickly prove boring... As mentioned above, this new Gameloft product is very rich, with the games being represented in each phase and with a large use of animated graphic elements, also equipped with a good level of detail. The legibility of the cards is good but not excellent: those in our possession and only ~folded~, ironically, are much more visible than those on the counter. The choice of such an essential control system is initially surprising, but it is really difficult to make mistakes in the selection phase and a little practice is enough to assimilate it perfectly. In the face of graphics characterized by quality, unfortunately there is a serious price to pay: the loading times are very long, definitely above average for titles of the genre. As far as the sound is concerned, we finally have both music and effects, the latter not very numerous but convincing, capable of enriching the game action.
