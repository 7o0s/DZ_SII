In particular on the occasion of the event held in Los Angeles in which we participated in first person. After a couple of weeks and after a global launch that was very successful, even without making the miracle cry and far from the numbers that Pokmon GO did three years ago, now is the time to sum up this new experiment of Niantic linked to the Wizarding World born from the mind of J.K. Rowling. It is difficult to give an unambiguous judgment on a mobile title that lives its nature linked to augmented reality so viscerally and it is clear that if you have not been a supporter of the previous Ingress and of the aforementioned Pokmon GO, Wizards Unite will hardly be your GOTY. However, this does not eclipse the excellent steps forward made by Niantic (in collaboration with the San Francisco studio of Warner Bros Games) in the gaming system and in the contents present since launch, in greater numbers than those present in the cousin with the little monsters even after three years of life. The Calamity and our possibilities The initial advice is to recover our previous tried to deepen everything concerning the plot included in the title and the basic mechanics of the game, which we will sketch here only for the sake of completeness in the review. Harry Potter Wizards Unite engages within the world of the most famous wizard ever with the aim of calling us to order to face the so-called Calamity. A particularly thorny event for the Ministry of Magic to manage, it is disseminating a multitude of magical elements within the Muggle world, thus exponentially increasing the risk of ruining that magical secrecy maintained and protected for decades. Set after the events of the main saga (this can be understood from some dialogues present in the game), this pretext represents the starting point for disseminating the world map (the real one) of events to be carried out to resolve the calamity. The bare and raw gameplay takes place in a simple and immediate way, but not insignificant for this. Your goal is to make gestures on the screen to draw glyphs related to specific spells. Each of these is used in a contextual situation, and you can't choose which one to throw firsthand. The events require you to drive away simple disturbers, so that you can free the magical element and bring it back to the place that belongs to it, or to face real clashes. These can take place against creatures from the magical world, but also werewolves and death eaters. During these face to face you will be required to cast more spells until the enemy resistance bar (which represents the HP) is completely discharged, defending yourself from enemy attacks to avoid being the one to succumb. Just the clashes also live of a second nature, that of the Fortresses. Scattered around the world based on points of interest, they require a rune to be ~opened~ in order to gain access to them. These turn into real raids that can be tackled by up to five players and which require you to defeat a greater number of enemies in succession. There are still a number that is difficult to decree, and each time one is completed, the next level is automatically unlocked. To conclude the main elements on the map we take care of the inns, necessary for the recovery of the energy that is used to cast spells, and the greenhouses which instead come in handy for collecting ingredients for potions. What we didn't know We had left open two elements related to inns and greenhouses during the first test, aware of having to deepen the title to get an idea. In the hours following the global launch, Niantic was immediately ready to meet the demands of the players by significantly increasing the amount of energy obtainable from the foods consumed. Which is why, as things stand, we feel comfortable saying that unless you live in the backwaters, it's damn hard to dump more energy than you can gather around. This is an excellent sign for a title that initially seemed stingy in this sense, with the risk of making its use more difficult and staggered. Another detail regarding the inns is that relating to the Dark Detectors, objects which (in full Pokmon GO Bait Form style) come in handy to attract more events in your vicinity and which last for half an hour. Up to three Detectors can be placed simultaneously by three diversplayers on a single inn, doing so will incredibly raise the possibility of finding very high-level lost. For greenhouses, on the other hand, the possibility of cultivating one's own seeds has been added. These turn into ingredients that you can harvest for a short time. The interesting element is that each player who approaches the greenhouse will have the opportunity to use their energy and cast a spell, to increase the amount of ingredients that will be generated. This is because although only one player can plant the seeds, everyone can then reap the benefits. From this post-release test, we wanted above all to understand how fun the title was in the long run and usable even without having to spend a single cent. It is useless to discuss whether or not the system can be pay to win. It is evident that by spending real money it is possible to recover a quantity of objects and extensions for one's inventories which make research and collecting much easier. However, this does not exclude that the title is easily playable without spending a single euro. This is what we have experienced on our skin, without ever finding ourselves excluded from any event due to limited resources. It is clear that you may not have all the ingredients required for a potion, or you may lack some cure useful for overcoming certain events, but this does not mean that this does not mean that this does not mean that this does not mean that this is an existing problem in any title, also dictated by poor management of one's resources . We conclude with what concerns the events, the first of which will begin this week and which will require the recovery of a certain type of lost, increasing the amount of experience points recovered and useful resources for that specific category.", "date": "2019-07-01", "grade": "7.5"}
