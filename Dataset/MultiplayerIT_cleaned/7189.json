Obviously not all components have the same weight within the adventure, which wants to take us to a dark fantasy world where destiny, legends, wars and sacrifice are the most important themes. Last year we brought you a trial and now that the game is ready for release on Steam, we had the opportunity to test the full version. So here's our review of Shattered Heaven. dark fantasy Andora, Magni and Ishana are our three heroes Shattered Heaven tells of a cursed world in which four tribes are condemned to live without ever sleeping, without being able to reproduce and with a life expectancy set at exactly forty years. Each tribe can count on a Vestal, a young woman who has great powers and who every ten years must face a battle known as the War of Ascension, before being reincarnated as another member of the tribe. We are just one of them, Andora, the vestal of lightning who is accompanied by her two Champions, Magni and Ishana. The former is an armored warrior, tough and powerful, the latter a young blind girl who is guided by a dark entity that both aids and consumes her. The plot, divided into chapters related to different regions, pushes us to discover the game world, the tribes, the past of the Vestals but also of the world itself, up to its roots between reality and mythology. Without spoilers, we can tell you that it is an interesting plot and that the narrative is quite central. In fact, don't be fooled by the ~roguelike~ categorization: Shattered Heaven creates dungeons in a procedural way, but there is no permanent death, you don't have to start over with each defeat or after a certain number of victories. It is in all respects a single player narrative role-playing game and the plot evolves on this assumption. At the entrance to the dungeons, in the moments of rest and obviously in the key moments of the plot we will have in front of us various dialogues that line after line immerse us in this fantasy world. Shattered Heaven should therefore be approached by those interested in the narrative component, especially if you like to make some choices in the most important phases so as to influence subsequent events and the ending. This also makes it replayable, as the procedurality will guarantee slightly different dungeons in a second game. Dungeon Crawler Shattered Heaven dungeons are a series of rooms to explore We are talking about ~slightly~ different dungeons because, on balance, the small labyrinths of Shattered Heaven are not that varied in purely structural terms. The game is divided into regions, which determine the aesthetics and type of enemies we'll face, but the variety of individual dungeons isn't huge. These are just a series of rooms, with a few crossroads, but you can easily retrace your steps. The goal is usually to find and defeat enemies, or collect treasures, and then get to the exit where a boss might be waiting for us. In the rooms, randomly, there may be traps, events that can grant penalties or bonuses, or battles. Exploration is simple and fast and there are no limits for movement and is therefore not particularly interesting. In Shattered Heaven we can also use potions, buying them or creating them with the materials obtained in the dungeons The focus of each exploration is in fact combat. The three heroes we will lead have their own unique deck of cards. The Vestal Virgin is dedicated to offense, the Magni warrior can easily create shields to defend himself and allies, while Ishana can easily use afflicted status on enemies. In various ways, during an exploration, additional cards can be obtained to add to the decks for the single exploration. Furthermore, by completing the main missions, new cards are definitively unlocked and we can thus vary the deck. Leonardo Interactive has made the excellent choice of not proposing new cards that are trivially more powerful, but simply different, so that one does not have to abandon the basic ones for the new ones, but is pushed each time to make a choice on how to compose the deck, which must also follow very specific rules. The creation of a deck is therefore interesting, above all because it must be managed together with various other character enhancement systems, i.e. skill trees, accessories to be equipped with various very useful effects and additional bonuses to be purchased with a special currency that is obtained in dungeons . Even completing missionsi secondaries, it's clear that you can't get every boost, so it's constantly a matter of making choices. In bossfights there are additional rules that make Shattered Heaven even more fun However, speaking more precisely of the battles, Shattered Haven puts us in turn-based battles where each hero has a number of action points. Each card has a cost, but often there are ways to play more, by combining effects. Andora, Magni and Ishana have significantly different decks not only in terms of tactics but also in terms of mechanics. The Vestal Virgin, for example, can obtain Divinity points by playing cards of different suits and then obtain bonuses. Magni can build up rage which must be spent to activate skills. Finally, Ishana earns Thirst which she invests to use an enhanced version of her own cards. We must therefore always think about how to act and how to create synergies between the moves of the three heroes, with fairly challenging clashes even at the lowest difficulties. Speaking of the difficulty level, we started our adventure at a ~normal~ level, and then switched to the lowest level after a few dungeons. The reason wasn't so much the difficulty (we were winning without problems) but the slowness of some fights. The main dungeons usually ask you to face up to seven or eight battles with often repeated enemies: on normal difficulty the battles tended to take a bit too long due to the simple fact that enemies have many life points. By lowering the difficulty level, the experience has become more streamlined, without being too easy. In short, the difficulty level system is well managed and should guarantee an excellent experience for multiple types of players, also considering that there is a difficulty above ~normal~ which promises to put everyone to the test. In the dungeons of Shattered Heavern you will come across random events with various effects Furthermore, the most interesting part is the fact that in each battle we can try to complete a secondary objective, such as not playing certain cards or eliminating a specific enemy last. These achievements gradually unlock additional rewards and spice up the fights. Finally, mention of merit for the bosses: instead of simply being more powerful, they also have unique game mechanics, which make the battles even more tactical and particular. Surely these are the funniest moments of the adventure. Finally, we point out that Shattered Heaven is not translated into Italian, an important factor for many considering that we are talking about a game where there is something to read continuously. The English voice acting is good, but we would have liked more variety in the generic phrases that the characters recite during combat. After a few battles our heroes repeat the same lines and it gets boring. On a visual level, however, the variety of environments is discreet while the cards are all very beautiful to look at.", "date": "2023-05-29", "grade": "8.0"}
