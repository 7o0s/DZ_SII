{"name": "Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mario-rabbids-sparks-of-hope-recensione.html", "text": "Ubisoft Milan has a beautiful story, one that, seen from the outside, recalls a fairy tale from a 90s film all about good feelings and ~we want to~. It's the classic story of the Hollywood movie underdog: the protagonist no one believes in, who after overcoming countless obstacles transforms against all odds into the only hero capable of saving the shack. Now, let's take this wonderful lump of love and hope and let's throw it in the wet bin, as it should be; also because if one has been hanging out in the world of video games for some time, what Ubisoft Milan did with the first Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle is paradoxically much more impressive and worthy of recognition precisely when compared with raw realism to the brutal and ultra competitive landscape. Starting from an intellectual property like the Rabbids, rarely taken into consideration when it comes to quality, and pairing it naturally with Nintendo's characters and worlds is certainly not a trivial matter, let alone applying it all to a turn-based strategy variant like this well thought out to deserve praise and compliments almost everywhere. Such a coup requires talent, perseverance, and a head as hard as a diamond, and it should therefore come as no surprise that today the Milanese team is almost seen by large segments of its fans as a ~pure and uncontaminated~ reality separate from the parent company , despite having benefited a lot (and still benefit today) from the enormous support deriving from the infinite team web of the French giant. A blockbuster, however, shapes huge expectations, and there's no denying that the demon of hype has been hovering around Davide Soliani's team ever since the announcement of Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope, the inevitable sequel . With even more help behind it from a Ubisoft now completely on the bandwagon, new systems, and a whole series of promised evolutions and expansions, this therefore had to be the litmus test: the crystal clear demonstration that this Italian software house had the talent to confirm itself also on markedly more ambitious projects with high production values. The task of our article today, however, is not the vulgar one of creating forced suspense; we therefore want to clarify immediately that yes, Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope is a reconfirmation and a sequel of remarkable quality. Except that ambition is a dangerous opponent to spar with, and Soliani and his men didn't come out without bruises from this fistfight this time. Let's try to understand why, in our review of Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope. Movement and AI: Free everyone, except enemies. The complete Mario +Rabbids Sparks of Hope team, ready to decide the next planet to land on The first Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle was an interesting variation on the theme compared to the turn-based strategy classics, to whose charm both the care of the representation of the characters and worlds and a series of brilliant design solutions contributed equally. Much of the experience, in that game, focused on the movement mechanics, markedly more central and flexible than seen in the rest of the genre, and implemented with great intelligence within a balanced and more accessible system than the average. This combination of ideas represented a breath of fresh air capable of replacing the mix of management elements seen elsewhere, and was flanked by linear worlds, but so well-kept and well-structured as to not make simple puzzles and limited exploration a tedium. In this sequel, therefore, the developers have made the most logical choice: to avoid inconsistent additions and potentially capable of ruining the ~flavor~ of the dish, focusing on the evolution of those ingredients already acclaimed by critics and the public in the original title. The focus of the changes are on worlds, progression and movement, with the clear intention of keeping the fun captured in the past, and significantly expanding the range of options and content. The first world of Mario +Rabbids Sparks of Hope is very nice to see, but perhaps too ~introductory~ So far so good - it's a solid approach to a sequel, which can take the quality to real highs if applied shrewdly. At the same time, however, intervening on a formula that is granite in itself can create cracks, because the mantra of ~more options at any cost~ often translates into ~more problems~, especially when numbers get in the way. However, it is better to make a well-calculated speech on every single aspect that has changed, because the moves made by Ubisoft Milan and beautiful company have led both to perfchanges than problems, and there is no better way to understand the overall result than a meticulous analysis of each factor involved. Movement is, in all probability, the best element to start with, because it is a perceptible change moments after starting the game. Sparks of Hope is not limited by the presence of a grid system, but this time uses well-defined areas where the player can move freely within his range, at least until he decides to attack someone. At first glance, the change may seem very marginal: the tendency of anyone, even with the possibility of moving at will, is still that of taking cover, and the offensive possibilities while moving remain more or less the same, so as to allow to apply the strategies seen in the predecessor without too many jolts. Mario +Rabbids Sparks of Hope's new movement system allows for much more precise shots and more creative use of positioning. Don't underestimate him By dint of playing, however, the possibilities and changes deriving from this new system begin to appear, and significantly change the approach to battles. To understand, a free movement system allows a large number of additional subtleties, including movements to the millimeter behind certain obstacles that allow you to remain protected even if you do not reach cover, or accurate repositioning that guarantees hitting well-protected targets by bringing the trajectory of attacks to graze barriers or an embankment; none of these maneuvers were possible to this level of precision in the first Mario + Rabbids, and it's nice to see how many extra options the sequel offers when it comes to making decisions about where your team is placed on the battlefield. For the record, implementing real-time movement during the turn is a good idea even when considering newbies. While boasting greater complexity, in fact, it is more intuitive for those who are not accustomed to turn-based strategy. The only problem derives from the presence of enemies such as Bob-ombs or armored Goombas, which must be eliminated and thrown with precision to obtain advantages (bob-ombs, predictably, also have a time limit before exploding), and this closes a bit the doors in the face of the public of the youngest or non-gamers, since it requires a minimum of coordination. However, it is a conscious choice, especially in a genre like this, and we do not believe that it represents such a barrier that it could lead to any penalization of the chosen system. The first world of Mario +Rabbids Sparks of Hope No, the flaw can be seen in another aspect: artificial intelligence, given that its behavioral routines are closely linked to movement. In fact, if we were disappointed by only one factor in all the mix described above, it is precisely the fact that Sparks of Hope's AI behaves almost exactly as if we were still playing Kingdom Battle. The subtleties related to the positioning described above? The enemies here are unable to use them: regardless of their diversification, in Sparks of Hope they practically always reposition themselves in cover to hit you, applying rather predictable offensive strategies; for their part, the more mobile opponents and with the tendency never to enter cover then always follow the shortest route, and at times it happens to see the AI literally give up the turn if you keep the right safety distance or it does not see obvious options to do you harm. Let's be clear, this does not mean that the game's AI is mediocre - the enemies are still quite aggressive, able to exploit interactive elements such as pipes (which greatly expand the movement range) to apply pressure, and it is rare to see them of the all blocked - however we would still have liked to see, at least on maximum difficulty, some more refinement in their tactics, if only to increase a level of challenge perhaps a little too low to fully satisfy the most demanding players. Combat mechanics and progression: keep these sparks Do you see this rain of fire? It is one of the abilities of Mario +Rabbids Sparks of Hope. When used well they can make you true forces of nature, and enemies also have various elemental weaknesses to exploit However, the second systemic revolution of the game takes care of modifying the approach to combat even more, or rather the addition of a myriad of nice fusions between Rabbid and Sfavillotti named Spark. These fluttering partners of your characters have a double function: each of them has an ability aactive, which if used consumes one of the two usable action points during movement, and a passive enhancement effect that is often anything but negligible. From this description, their presence might seem comparable to a simple extra equipment, but you would be wrong to underestimate their usefulness in this way. The Sparks, in fact, are levelable, their effectiveness increases, and you go from being able to equip only one up to two at a time. The powers they have and the bonuses they offer are such as to literally allow the player the possibility both of maximizing the specializations of each character and of varying their roles, a feature that exponentially increases the number of ~useful~ compositions to rely on. Mario +Rabbids Sparks of Hope: You are no longer forced to have fixed characters in a group this time. Have fun If, in fact, in the first Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle you were forced to use Mario and a Rabbid in a team, this time you will have the possibility to bring every possible combination of characters into combat, and synergies such as that between Rabbid Mario and Peach, or even simply the long-range defensive combinations of the Mario brothers are still incredibly effective; with the help of the right Sparks, however, you can do without support characters altogether, maximize the aggressiveness of certain specializations, or even concentrate on a defensive strategy by offering a significant increase in damage to those who normally close to the hedgehog. It's a nice strain, and one that significantly enhances the experience. Be warned though: this kind of total flexibility tends to carry over quite far into the campaign, and early on the tendency remains to overuse certain skill combos to curb any ability. enemy offensive. The game designers have therefore implemented a simple but incredibly effective solution: to push for a constant change of team through missions that are much more diversified than the average. In the campaign you will find very variable fights waiting for you, from simple maps to go through to reach a specific area to paintings full of sponge enemies, through multiple objectives to be eliminated with one blow, up to invulnerable enemies to get rid of by dint of slips and throws out from the screen. We are no longer faced with a strategy that can be completed exclusively by dint of Peach's barriers and atomic punches of a mustachioed rabbid: the progression is designed to push you, at least in part, to develop all the protagonists (who level at the same speed, whether you use them or less) and to experiment continuously. Mario +Rabbids Sparks of Hope's Sparks are more numerous and flexible than we expected, but obviously make it difficult to balance everything So is this the maximum possible evolution of the formula devised by Ubisoft Milan? Not exactly. When the factors in the field increase, the balancing problems also increase exponentially, and with Sparks of Hope unfortunately the work done on the mathematics of the systems and on the progression is unfortunately not always superfine. Let's start from the beginning... and by ~beginning~ we mean the very first stages of the campaign: in fact, this sequel is always divided into worlds, but no longer boasts a linear progression with specific chapters and a precise progression of the battles, but rather open maps explorable with multiple objectives, where only the clashes related to the main story follow a precise order, while a good portion of the secondary missions can always be tackled at will (with inevitable extra unlocks once certain primary events have been overcome). Taking these changes into consideration, we must say that Sparks of Hope starts too much with the handbrake on, fielding an introductory world that is truly limited in the possibilities offered, which even sees usable teams stopped at two characters and a single Spark for a nice bit, and still all too basic clashes even when the team comes to three available choices. The initial tedium, however, is not at all limited by the new structure of the levels, because while the main missions and some of the more significant secondary ones (usually those that offer new Sparks if completed, so to speak) have a well-calculated and highly enjoyable incremental difficulty, it happens all too often to come across frighteningly easy or not designed fights with the same level of care, especially in the first two planets. Dark tentacles usually signal the most interesting battles in Mario +Rabbids Sparks of Hope Ok, it's not really a particularly serious flaw, because the original and interesting clashes clearly outnumber the more b", "date": "2022-10-17", "grade": "8.4"}
