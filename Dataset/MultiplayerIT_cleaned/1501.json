{"name": "XIII", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/xiii_a.html", "text": "'Cause no one lives forever. What made the No One Lives Forever series great were the characterization of the characters, the dialogues and the sufficiently articulated plot. XIII makes the narrative plot one of its main cornerstones and the construction of the story also takes place through good twists and flashbacks that show a reality that is often different from the one we thought we were able to reconstruct, documents that gradually reveal the backstory on the our character and identity of the antagonists. The emphasis is placed more on the protagonist and it was to be expected. As a result, the characters that surround us are not very detailed and perhaps also for this reason they have been characterized to the maximum through some effective comic book devices (see the FBI boss without an arm, but what recruitment criteria do they adopt at the bureau?). 'Cause no one lives forever. One thing that struck me a lot is the direction that juggles the whole plot by presenting it impeccably. The flashbacks, which I mentioned a few lines above, appear suddenly as soon as we find ourselves in a place that by chance reminds us of some past event or when we talk to some character we had to deal with before the accident . The flashbacks are marked by a fantastic graphic device (take a look at the screenshots around here) and during their occurrence we are allowed to interact with them, as happens in Max Payne's nightmares, just to give an idea. This expedient contributes to stepping into the uncomfortable shoes of agent number XIII, as much as the beautiful animated sequences between one level and another. The sequences have been designed to take the form of the two-dimensional comic and at times the scenes in a box come to life to emphasize a particular action. The moment the action stops, very often the skit and animation restart in another frame. The boxes themselves are in motion, creating a very convincing graphic effect that recalls certain directorial choices that are back in fashion today: do you know Ocean Eleven? Interlude sequences so to speak? Something very similar. The spy's beauty case. I mentioned NOLF earlier for the similarities in terms of setting, just to say here too we will have the cloned villains, all dressed the same way, as in NOLF. But above all the gameplay constitutes the real meeting point of the two titles, in fact XIII is also a sort of FPS with many stealth elements like the well-known Miss Archer series. Although here we play a sort of killing machine that comes close to the sculettante prototype in tight overalls presented to us by the competing series, very often we will be required to act in a very discreet way, without letting the enemy foresee our presence. For this purpose we will have a whole series of specific gadgets: throwing knives, crossbows, furnishings and various furnishing objects. The crossbow is a very elegant tool, but smashing a chair on the head of the guard on duty is vaguely more exhilarating, although I doubt that in the real world this can really avoid making any noise... at least try it at home on your younger brothers. An accessory that I found very fun to use is the grappling hook to be launched with an attached automatic mechanism and winch, it will allow you to climb the most inaccessible walls, but can only be used in certain points that will be reported to you. The funny thing is that very often you can only attach yourself to protruding metal hooks that seem to swarm everywhere, even in a canyon in the desert someone had fun nailing these supports everywhere, never mind: easy money for you. Hey look at me! I am here! You will have understood that in a game with such a presentation the AI does the core of the gameplay, if the reactions of the enemy were well proportioned to your actions the gameplay would be well balanced and would allow for fluid and moderately demanding action. Unfortunately, there are some sore points. There are times when you can crawl like a mongoose towards the guard whose back is turned, not make the slightest noise, be about to hit him in the back of the head with a sharp blow and this cursed one will turn and beat you up. In short, as if he had perceived variations in the Force or as if you had eaten too spicy the night before, while paradoxically at other times you will move undisturbed in the middle of corridors crowded with hordes of very bad guys who won't deign to look at you. On the other hand, the enemy reacts adequately if you abbwait for someone close to him, he gets suspicious if he finds his colleagues torn apart and scattered around the level and if he doesn't find you after a certain amount of time he returns to his duties commenting on the incident. At the time of the actual engagement, however, there are again big laughs and honestly, at an average difficulty level, you can afford to run around the levels on a scooter by unloading kilos of ammunition at will: arcade weapon model and enemy suicidal intelligence at level of Quake, in short, nothing impressive, especially given the inevitable comparisons with sacred monsters of the ~stealth~ genre such as the Thief series and the aforementioned NoLF. Hey look at me! I am here! Let's console ourselves with the extremely simple and intuitive interface and a trivial but very effective system to make your life easier in solving the few and simple ~puzzles~ present. Ubisoft doesn't let us wander around looking for a pixel to click among tons of inert pixels, but every object with which it will be possible to interact will be highlighted by a white rectangle the moment you have it in your view, an easy and practical system. A matter of style. And this game has plenty of style. The graphics engine that animated Unreal 2 returns fully edited to move a whole world made of cell-shading. A particular technique introduced by the latest generation video cards, which in the particular case of XIII made it possible to develop the entire game as if it were a sort of ~animated comic~. The effect is quite remarkable, fits well with the atmosphere of the game and contributes decisively to the noir atmosphere, so dear to fans of Diabolik and the like. The animations in a certain sense are proportionate to the aesthetic aspect, in the sense that although at times vaguely rigid they fit well into the cartoon atmosphere that pervades the Ubisoft product, consequently it could also be deduced that they were conceived so on purpose. Lights, particle smoke effects and various cotillions enrich the very varied panorama of settings, which pushes the player to proceed not only to get to know a new piece of the plot, but also to see the new locations in which the agent's adventure develops number XIII. In addition, how can we fail to mention the gimmick of adding a video onomatopoeia to the noises produced by ours and by the various antagonists? It seems to be back in front of the television with the episodes of Batman (tadadadadadadada... Batman! ehm) played by Adam West and every time a particular noise is produced it is written, like in a comic strip, on the screen: one more point in more to the atmosphere. XIII is a game with a sense of self-irony and often doesn't take itself too seriously despite the dark plot, small humorous inlays often lighten the bloody missions and painful flashbacks, guards arguing with each other, singing, programmers locked up in asylum why not they had time to deliver the patches for a program... they are all small additions that manage to amuse and amaze, despite the fast action, every now and then it is worth spying on the opponents' dialogues: do it and you will often witness juicy skits, very well chosen . All this mixture is amalgamated thanks to the splendid soundtrack full of lounge and acid jazz tracks that give the game a certain ~groovy twist~ that fits perfectly with the colors of the graphics, the design and the type of action. It goes without saying that the soundtrack is dynamic with respect to the action and therefore changes depending on what you do, but it is a detail that deserves mention. Comment I don't think, I honestly don't think there can be anyone out there who doesn't quite like this game. I admit it, I got involved I really liked it and I think anyone who loves thick FPS will agree with me. There is also multiplayer and although I haven't had the opportunity to try it ~live~, but only with the bots available, I must say that the impact has been sufficiently positive. It could be said that XIII's multy playability looks a lot like that of the series of mods called Action for the various games already on the market (Half-Life in the lead): fast, pseudo-realistic and adrenaline-pumping, not bad, but out of reach for those who he prefers more simulated and tactical engagements. The singleplayer is a little jewel, it's my personal opinion, but in terms of plot and playability it far surpasses the super blockbuster of this period: Max Payne 2 (I can already hear the chants of ~buuuh~, compare the playability then we'll talk about it ). It's original, it's addictive, it's something fresh in a panorama that is getting staler from month to month than the bread I've been keeping in my cupboard for two and a half months. The most obvious neo could be constituted by the AI and this creates big moral problems for me in assigning the final grade... half a point more or half a point less? I'll be strict, by half a point mainly because of the lost comparison with No One Lives Forever. However, if you are also a fan of beautiful plots, original gimmicks and Soderberg's films, rightly give it a good nine, as XIII rightfully enters the short list of the most intriguing titles of recent years. Pros: Original Intriguing and well shot plot High playability Cons: AI not always optimal Mutiplayer not memorable Sooner or later it ends Spy vs spy. Spy stories with complex and tangled plots, double if not triple twist stuff that after ten minutes you are forced to keep the sign of the plot on an A3 format notebook to have the space to draw diagrams that reconstruct what you are following. I've always liked these stories, perhaps if they are classically set in an international scenario, full of folk characters and chases across entire countries. XIII has something of that in a way despite being set within the United States. XIII is the piece of an immense and abnormal puzzle, made up of twenty numbers, twenty obscure characters who take advantage of their positions of power to lead a huge political conspiracy that was born with the murder of the President. XIII is us, and that's the only thing we're allowed to know at the start of the game. Thus begins the plot of the Ubisoft game, on a Californian coast a lifeguard, who seems taken from the Baywatch stable, recovers us as soon as the tide drags our bodies onto the shore. Three shots were fired at us at point blank range, but we are still alive and as we are being escorted to a shelter strange flashbacks begin to shed flashes of light on the memory darkened by the accident. Within minutes we will be embroiled in a fast-paced savage manhunt and nationwide political intrigue and I won't tell you more for now.", "date": "2003-11-05", "grade": null}
