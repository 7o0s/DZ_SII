{"name": "F1 Grand Prix", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/f1-grand-prix.html", "text": "Gentlemen, start your engine! The revival in the 2005 version of Formula One according to Sony, winds through three canonical modes respectively called: single event, championship and multiplayer. As in any self-respecting racing, the player who will take part in the single event will have at his complete disposal any one of the drivers, cars and tracks of the Formula One world championship; this mode has no real purpose but allows you to become familiar with the tracks, with the control system and perhaps create a feeling with a particular driver. The championship mode is the direct evolution of the single event: the races are no longer amateur but offer precious points for the conquest of the world championship; the player will be catapulted into the great formula one circus and following in all fidelity what really happens, he will have to take part in a series of car races in an attempt to win over his opponents. Before each championship race it will be possible to do test laps on the new track to get to know it or go to the virtual pits for one last set-up before the important qualifying lap. Unfortunately, the first negative note of the game comes from the chapter concerning the set-up: the only changes that can be made to the car concern the driver's driving style (aggressive, balanced or defensive), perhaps falling too far into the arcade setting that the game does not takes care to hide. The achievement of certain objectives such as the victory of the world championship will lead to the obtaining of bonuses such as cars taken directly from the past and new tracks on which to compare. The wireless multiplayer mode will allow you to compete in three particular modes: in the timed trial the goal will be to beat the best time, in the head-to-head two or more human players will compete against each other in a single grand prix and in the last mode called grand prix single you will be challenged to compete in a mixed match between humans and AI-driven cars. One of the novelties of this chapter on PSP is represented by the ~scenarios~: this section, through a series of tests aimed at improving the guide, will allow the player to significantly increase the non-excellent longevity of the game: for example, he will be asked to complete the race in conditions of worn tires without losing further positions, or to cover a short stretch of road in a pre-established time. The missions, albeit few, help a lot to contribute to the improvement of the driving style above all because of the extreme situations that will be proposed. The last and perhaps least interesting mode is the one called TV mode race: the game will randomly load a formula one race into its database, and will display it on the PSP screen without you being able to do anything except observe (just like does on television) the race. an overly marked and sometimes annoying arcade setting is added to the not excellent control system Dark side of the brum If up to this point Formula1 Grand Prix could have seemed like a decent game, unfortunately we have to disregard this assessment. The game is affected by a series of annoying defects, the non-excellent control system is added to an arcade setting that is too marked and sometimes annoying (reaching the final victory by bumping into people around the track is sometimes all too easy) and some small bugs management of superimposed graphics: more than once it has happened that the order of arrival indicated by the graphics was totally different from reality. To these or presumed defects are also added infinite loading times which affect the gaming experience by creating dead spots and boring blocks. From a graphic point of view, however, the excellent polygonal models of drivers, cars and tracks should be noted: everything perfectly recalls the world of formula one, with a customization that borders on mania (just look at the advertisements on the cars to get an idea). The engine holds up well the game load and does not miss even in the most intricate situations of maxi rear-end collisions, everything flows smoothly and fast without hitches making the feeling of speed of a formula one quite good. However, yet another cue comes from the sound sector: the game features only six musical tracks by famous artists (including QOTSA, stereophonics and Andy Gray) and does not set up a random mode of the tracks, forcing the player to open the menu screen to go to change the soundtrack. Being 'forced' to listen to the same song 3 or 4 times in a row is one of the reasons why you will find yourself completely muting the PSp to find another sound source that is certainly better equipped. Formula1 Gran Prix is everything that perhaps a formula1 game should no longer be: non-existent damage management, arcade formula based on the three canonical laps per race, poor longevity supported by very few stimuli to continue playing it and perhaps unlock the numerous bonuses . Added to this is a bad management of the sound sector and some small bugs scattered throughout the game. On the other hand, visually it remains an excellent product, probably if the developers had looked for a middle ground between gameplay and graphics instead of jumping on the latter, we would now be discussing a good game. Sin. Pros: visually well done it has the official Formula1 license Cons: too much too arcadey bad sound management some programming bugs are evident It was the year 1995: Sony entered the world of consoles with its newborn Playstation. The launch was a real success, the games in the line-up hinted at the potential of the generational leap and 3D graphics were beginning to take their first steps in the world of consoles. Psygnosis was undoubtedly the great protagonist of this start with a bang: a small English software house which, thanks to successes such as Wipeout, Destruction Derby and Formula One, proved to be one of the most capable of using the new development tools. Nine years have passed to date, Psygnosis unfortunately no longer exists, but Sony passing the baton to Travelers Tales tries again the coup simultaneously with the launch of PSP.
