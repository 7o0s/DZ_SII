Man At the end of Megaman Zero 4, Zero sacrificed himself to save the world from the threat of Doctor Weil and the Dark Elves. Falling with the Ragnarok space base, Zero was left with only a shattered helmet in the rubble of the impact, and the scientist Ciel promised that, now, he would find a way to bring peace to the endless war between humans and Reploids. In the future, Ciel's promise has been fulfilled: Reploids and humans live in relative peace, even mixing their own characteristics. Humans use Reploid technology in their daily lives, and they have perfected their brain structure so much that some of them manifest emotions and feelings. And yet, the terrorism of the Maverick criminal androids is still present, albeit circumstantial outside the civilized capital, controlled by the company Slyther Inc. to which the mysterious Serpent belongs. Vent and Aile are the delivery men of the Giro Express, and one of the two will be the protagonist of this story: during a delivery an aggression forces them to receive the help of the contents of the package, a Biometal called X which will transform them into the Megaman Model X. With this extraordinary power, Vent or Aile will join the anti-Maverick resistance, responsible for the death of their family... When Megaman meets Castlevania So here we are, talking about yet another incarnation of the Blue Bomber. Leaving aside the various spin-offs such as the Battle Network series (a sort of action/strategy/RPG) or the Adventures bilogy (a 3D action/adventure), the main series in the various sequelizations has always maintained a rather traditional mechanics, often modified with adding new features. For example, since Megaman X 4 it has also been possible to use Zero, whose fighting style based on the lightsaber (the Z-Saber) differed drastically from that of Megaman X and his canonical arm-cannon X-Buster. In the Megaman Zero series, on the other hand, Zero himself acquired various weapons with the most diverse functions, and the addition of the Cyber-Elves represented an innovative variant to the usual power-ups. However, a central element in any episode of the Megaman series has always been that of the end-of-stage bosses: once the boss on duty was defeated, Megaman or Zero absorbed its power, acquiring a new weapon or special move, effective against another boss, and consequently it was possible to discover the hidden order to easily defeat one enemy after another. In Megaman Zero this mechanic was exacerbated by the evaluation system: finishing a level in the shortest possible time, without being hit, and defeating the boss with a neutral weapon, a score was obtained which, if high enough, unlocked new abilities and powers for Zero, making the already difficult game a real challenge. The various Models not only expand the possibilities of exploration, but totally change the style of play. When Megaman meets Castlevania All these elements in Megaman ZX are in a certain sense taken up, reworked, transformed. To begin with, there is no longer any subdivision into stages or levels: the world of Megaman ZX is a set of interconnected areas, freely explorable from the start far and wide, between forests, cities and mountains. However, it is not uncommon to get stuck in front of seemingly insurmountable obstacles such as stone blocks or walls too high even for wall rebounding - that's where the Biometal Models and bosses come into play. The latter are found at the end of certain areas, and can only be tackled if the corresponding mission has been activated: after defeating the boss, you thus obtain a Biometal (or rather, half) and the corresponding Model, which follow the powers of the four Lords of the Zero series. Thus, the Model H (Harpuia) allows you to remain suspended in the air and thus reach normally inaccessible places, while for example the Model F (Fafnir) can destroy boulders and open passages here and there. The various Models (more than five) not only expand the possibilities of movement and exploration, but totally change the style of play, replacing the X-Buster and Z-Saber of Model Z, for example, with the shurikens of Model P (Phantom ) or the spear of Model L (Leviathan), not to mention the various super-moves available for each Model, by downloading the appropriate Live Energy indicator. Considering that each area or boss does not bind to the use of a particular Model and that these can be changed almost on the fly by pressing a button, the variety of action and possibilities offered by the new Model System is enormous. Additionally, some of these enable special abilities accessible via the bottom screen, though they don't make use of the touch-screen vreal: the Model H for example shows the energy of the target and its possible weak point, while the Model P allows you to view a map. We have mentioned the missions, which allow you to proceed in the story and in the game, but there are also the quests: in the city, without wearing any Model and making use of the limited human form, it is however possible to converse with the inhabitants to obtain information or activate of ~quests~ that will eventually reward Vent or Aile with power-ups or Data Chips (the latter expand a sort of database relating to the enemies and characters encountered in the game). Megaman Zero v.1.5 Technically Megaman ZX doesn't look very different from what Megaman Zero is on Game Boy Advance, keeping the same excellent character designer and a cartoonish visual style very close to what Megaman X already was, but modernized and more alive. However, the visual improvements are notable, and Megaman ZX reveals how the decision to keep the two dimensions, despite the capabilities of the DS, was decidedly wise: although the first screens give a strong sense of deja-vue, exploring the more advanced areas he is surprised by the artistic level achieved by the Capcom graphics, who have created splendid scenarios working on the backdrops thanks to a partial and unobtrusive use of three-dimensional elements and multiple parallax. Some ~stages~ such as the playground, the sewer pipes or the mountain in full storm are absolutely spectacular to see, even in their traditional two-dimensionality. The sprites obviously enjoy a greater number of animation frames and are often large and particularly colorful. Also surprising is the sporadic inclusion of some cartoon sequences that make some moments of the adventure more incisive. Unfortunately, not only are these sequences dubbed in Japanese and only subtitled in English, but the same numerous textual dialogues, which in the Japanese version were entirely spoken, in the American edition do not enjoy any dubbing: the speech is limited to a few sentences expressed by the bosses and from the protagonist. On the other hand, the music reproduces the classic tunes of the series, suitable for the action but not too memorable, certainly pleasant and never intrusive, completing a more than good overall technical framework but perhaps a little too traditional. The absence of speech and the general traditionality maintained in this new series dedicated to Megaman are certainly the only marginal defects of a surprising cartridge. Anyone who thought that the Blue Bomber had by now sunk into a perpetual playful recycling will be proven wrong by a certainly trivial but successful idea: Megaman ZX acquires a dimension and a depth that bring it very close to Castlevania, refreshing a by now ancient game system and making it compelling again, without distorting or modifying it excessively. The Model System is highly enjoyable, the difficulty well calibrated (and selectable), the locations enormous to the point of being almost dispersive, the longevity average but higher than that of a simple action-game. Technically it doesn't differ much from the last episodes produced for Game Boy Advance, but the added visual and sound features do partial justice to the capabilities of the DS. A new beginning for an old hero? Certainly. An unmissable purchase for every Megaman fan and generally recommended for every Nintendo DS owner. Pros It plays like Megaman, but it's something new More calibrated, long-lived and varied than usual Technically traditional but well-finished Cons Average audio department and absent dubbing Sometimes distracting The amount of video games dedicated to Megaman now exceeds a hundred: you can find them on all platforms, in all rooms, in any video game generation after the NES. The android created by Capcom in 1987 has undergone many metamorphoses both aesthetically and in gameplay: from the ruddy and placid little robot to the fearless hyper-technological warrior of the future, from the treasure hunter to the virtual antivirus program, Megaman was also a footballer, a go-kart racer and even fought alongside Marvel super-heroes. In short, he has seen all the colors, especially since in 1993 at Capcom they thought of starting a parallel series, Megaman X, set in a decidedly more adult and violent post-apocalyptic future than the light-hearted atmospheres hitherto seen on the NES. Zero was also introduced in the X series, a character who has since become recurring and almost more famous than Megaman himself due to his characterization as a heroic enemy / friend. The success of this character was such that he became the protagonist of his own series, set even further into the future, and proposedto entirely on Game Boy Advance: four episodes to tell the deeds of Zero and a new chapter in the history of the Reploids, Megaman Zero. From the first series to the Zero series, passing through the X series, the storyline of the saga has always been linear and compelling, despite some narrative holes necessary to motivate a new beginning: this is how we arrive at Megaman ZX, which not only proposes new protagonists and a new setting, but also a brand new gameplay that basically makes this episode the best Megaman ever.", "date": "2006-10-17", "grade": null}
