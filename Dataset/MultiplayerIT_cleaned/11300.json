{"name": "Star Wars Jedi: Survivor", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/star-wars-jedi-survivor-recensione.html", "text": "The curse that weighed on Star Wars video games having been cast off with the excellent Jedi: Fallen Order, in a moment in which the qualitative bar has also risen thanks to them, the guys from Respawn Entertainment found themselves facing an even greater challenge difficult: do better. Survivor arrives after just over two years, directly on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X | S and on PC. No cross-gen versions to justify anything, this time, and a stack of titles released and released with which to confront in a ruthless duel to the last frame. In the meantime, however, the brand has changed. Indeed, the perception that the public, large and small, has of Star Wars has changed: between novels, comics, films and TV series that are somewhat convincing and somewhat not, it becomes increasingly difficult to find the right balance and please everyone. In this sense, we wrote this review of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor dividing ourselves between our love for George Lucas' far distant galaxy and our love for video games, imagining a formula that could address a potential reader who doesn't necessarily have an interest in the brand name. The question, therefore, is only one: is Star Wars Jedi: Survivor a good adventure video game? A distant distant story Dagan Gera is a High Republic Jedi and Rayvis the Gen'Dai is his right-hand man in Star Wars Jedi: Survivor Let's start immediately from an assumption that will probably reassure players who have completed Fallen Order and couldn't wait to find out how the story of Cal Kestis and his friends on the Stinger Mantis would continue: no, to understand the plot of Survivor you don't have to read the prequel novel Battle Scars or binge on High Republic books and comics, and if you've forgotten what happened in the first Respawn title, you can always launch the handy summary video on the main screen of the new game. Of course it would be much better to have played Fallen Order in first person, because Survivor builds a lot on the characters already established and the relationships they built in the opening chapter. Incidentally, Scars of Battle is practically completely ignored by the narrative of the game, which is limited to mention in passing the accident in which Greez lost his arm, glossing over the rest of the story nicely. The speech is a little different as regards the notions on the High Republic. For months we've been poring over Survivor trailers, speculating that the one-armed man in the bacta vat was a High Republic Jedi just because of the clothing he wore in one scene. It turns out that this man really belongs to the High Republic: his name is Dagan Gera, and Cal involuntarily awakens him while exploring the ancient ruins on Koboh at the beginning of the game. Gera was a Jedi obsessed with the idea of reaching Tanalorr, a legendary planet hidden in the impassable Abyss of Koboh, and for this reason he had rebelled against the Order who had preferred to shift all his attention to the threat of the Nihils and the Great Disaster that it was ravaging the galaxy. Nihil, Grande Disastro, Faro Starlight, words that will sound foreign to anyone who hasn't dug their claws into the multimedia project of the High Republic that Disney and Lucasfilm have been conducting for some years and which mainly affects publishing in the form of books and comics, but which will soon also arrive on TV with the series The Acolyte. Fortunately none of them significantly affect the plot and the characterization of the characters, entrusted to cinematics and dialogues that make only vague references to the era of the High Republic. If you want to go deeper, each event or scan enriches the database with information that contextualizes everything better, but which remains perfectly negligible. In this sense, Respawn has done a decent job: on the one hand, it is commendable that we are finally beginning to integrate the High Republic into the general Star Wars imagination; on the other, perhaps that is exactly why there is a strange feeling of forcing, as if Lucasfilm had forced director Stig Asmussen to slip the High Republic into the narrative to give it some publicity, but in the end if it had been a different era or any other alien civilization, nothing would have changed. The fault is also a bit 'of the screenwriters, who in our opinion have failed to characterize the character of Gera really well. Gera, in fact, is the main antagonist of the story. Awakened in an era where the Order no longer exists and an Empire subjugates the galaxy, the Jedi decides to resume the search for Tanalorr together with the Chaos Marauders, a band of anonymous thugs who have appropriated Separatist technology - and this explains the presence of the droids dating back toand the Clone Wars - and following the orders of an armored Gen'Dai who goes by the name of Rayvis. Absurdly, a character like Rayvis, who is a kind of henchman with a handful of dialogues, appeared to us significantly more incisive than Dagan Gera. Bode Akuna is a mercenary working for Saw Gerrera: he will befriend Cal on Coruscant. For this reason, having passed the frenetic but linear prologue on Coruscant and reached the planet Koboh, Cal Kestis' new adventure gradually slows down, assuming contours that recall those of the previous Fallen Order: in Gera's footsteps, Cal will explore Koboh and then Jedha in searches for some artifacts and along the way he reunites his old comrades as he tries to figure out if there can be more to his life than the fight against the Empire.Without the Inquisitors to hunt him down again and with the Empire reduced to a secondary antagonist, Survivor seems a season of The Mandalorian: Cal explores new worlds and cultures alongside his Baby Yoda, the ever adorable BD-1, as he switches from one MacGuffin to another. At full speed, without exploring or looking for optional content, Survivor is probably completed in about twenty-five hours. It took us thirty-two, dedicating ourselves to a good part of the secondary contents and with many others still to be discovered, but if two thirds of the adventure are comparable to The Mandalorian, the last act is much more Andor-style. The Utapau senator has a decidedly marginal role The TV comparison may seem far-fetched, but it makes sense. The Mandalorian has always been an entertainment, a fanservice-focused show with a plot that feels like a pretext. The first two acts of Survivor do exactly the same thing. Andor, on the other hand, has earned the favor of critics and the public for a level writing that abandons the space fantasy fairytale stereotypes to embrace a mature and concrete narrative: we have just described the last act of Survivor. adventure, in fact, the narrative makes a sudden surge and the themes so dear to Star Wars that were missing in the early hours, to give way to a more contained and circumscribed story, come back with arrogance in an exciting roller coaster that drags up to to an excellent epilogue, open and closed at the same time. We particularly appreciated the more mature and human perspective, as well as the importance dedicated to introspection and the relationships that the characters have built over the course of two games, and which make every moment in their company decidedly special: Greez, Merrin, Cere and above all newcomer, Bode Akuna, are credible and convincing supporting actors. The merit also goes to the Italian dubbing, truly superlative all round, and to the music by Stephen Barton, who recalls - and sometimes uses - the very famous scores of John Williams without missing a beat. The improved gameplay of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor Planet Koboh's level design is excellent It is undeniable that Survivor is very similar to its predecessor and from the very first bars you have the feeling of being grappling with a Fallen Order 2.0 which at least demonstrates the attention that Respawn has dedicated to player and critic feedback. The prologue on Coruscant is a remix of the one on Track in Fallen Order, with Cal engaged in a frenetic race between enemies and platforms that serves as a tutorial and teaches the rudiments of gameplay. There's just one small difference: Cal begins Survivor with all the skills he learned in Fallen Order: Force powers, wall-running, Jedi somersault, and so on; Survivor mixes everything already in the very first minutes of the game, gradually offering increasingly complex challenges, and at the same time already providing our hero with a new tool - the cable lift - which makes exploration even more dynamic and articulated. However, Coruscant remains a very linear introductory stage which also represents a showcase of what awaits us in the course of the new adventure: it is therefore not surprising that Bode Akuna also comes to help us, a gunslinger armed with a jetpack that Respawn created for Survivor. In a mine near Meta Promessa you will find the Rancor, a challenging optional boss The game grants us minimal control over the battle partner, but it is only an illusion: in reality we will only be able to indicate to the supporting actors such as Bode which target to hit with a special attack or which objective to reach to unlock a new path. Bode and Merrin will help us in specific moments of the campaign and in this sense the dynamic that the game calls Companion Assistance is perhaps the one that has remained the most unchanged compared to Fallen Order: we must admit that we would have liked to choose who to take with us, whenor and maybe even in any situation, but the script at least justifies the comings and goings of the companions to force Cal, and us with him, to go it alone in the exploration. This last aspect of Star Wars Jedi has been greatly improved from every point of view view, and it becomes clear as soon as you land on Koboh and take your first steps in this sort of open world which is not exactly an open world: it is more of a gigantic, immense map structured in the meitrodvania style which guarantees the player the freedom to go wherever he wants right away. It's inevitable that you'll bump into some unbreakable wall or gaze longingly at a platform that's too far away, but over time, following the main mission, you'll unlock the skills and tools you need to overcome each obstacle: you just need to find them again. Koboh's hang gliders allow Cal to fly great distances. In this sense, Survivor offers the player two extraordinary features. The first is the map, which has been significantly improved compared to that of Fallen Order: it is now clearer and more readable, and Respawn has enriched it with filters and options, but above all it accurately records each collectible, passage or puzzle, whether it is accessible or not. The other feature that literally changes the approach and, in a certain way, underlines the quality of the level design, is the fast travel. Accessible from the save points, it allows you to move from one to the other with a short load, and the Californian developer has taken care to distribute collectibles, puzzles and so on always in the vicinity of these locations: backtracking is therefore reduced to a minimum, although it is inherent in the nature of this type of game, and returning in one's footsteps is always a pleasure because the skills learned in the meantime open the door to ever new and interesting paths, challenges and rewards. Exploration is therefore the beating heart of Survivor, if only because the Respawn game always gives good reasons to snoop around. If in Fallen Order the collectibles were limited to the different types of ponchos or the components to customize BD-1 and Cal's lightsaber, this time there is much more to collect and every detour leads to something or someone. Doma Dendra is a merchant who sells clothing and hair in exchange for Priorite Koboh is a nexus of the galaxy that is the envy of Tatooine and Jakku. You'll find everything from Separatist droids that have been isolated for years to Jawa junkyards, Rancors, Jedi ruins and Imperial outposts. It is an enormously diverse planet in geography comprising gorges, crevices, mountains and wooded patches, lakes and marshes, volcanic terrain and flying strongholds. It is no coincidence that Greez has opened his Pyloon Saloon right in the outpost of Meta Promessa, a place where some colorful personalities meet. These NPCs frequent our friend Latero's tavern or wander among the buildings, and in some cases they will give us tips that the game calls Rumors: they are, essentially, the secondary objectives that appear on the map and tell us that in that area we could find something interesting. The freedom granted by Koboh's open structure, however, allows us to go to a certain location and solve the secondary assignment even before talking to the NPC: in that case, Cal will be sure to inform the NPC that the objective is been already achieved. Rumors aren't really side quests; they fall more into the realm of clues and do not reward the player with tools or experience points. Find Ashe Javi and her DD-EC droid to unlock the jukebox in Pyloon's Saloon In some cases, however, solving a Rumor can guarantee us respect for the NPC in question that we will actually ~recruit~ in the Saloon: there it is always worth having a chat with the patrons, who will react to the evolution of the campaign and maybe have some new Rumors for us. Some will unlock additional features such as the jukebox, the growable garden on the roof, the aquarium to fill or the Holotactics minigame that uses a Pokmon-esque trick: it's a kind of turn-based strategy, but the pawns are the enemies we've made scan to BD-1 after defeating them. The vendors then offer various merchandise in exchange for particular currencies that Respawn has placed more or less prominently on Survivor's planets: ranging from additional components for the lightsaber or BD-1 to new clothing for Cal, which can be customized even in the hairstyle and beard cut, but also Benefits and other upgrades. Caij, the bounty hunter, will offer us additional properties", "date": "2023-04-26", "grade": "8.5"}
