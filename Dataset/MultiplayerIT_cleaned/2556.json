After all these years here is that Kurt, the hero of the first episode returns to our beloved desktops and televisions as the game is also available for the Sega Dreamcast, having been programmed for the 2 formats in question simultaneously. For once I'll start right away by talking about the technical side of the game since it's by far its forte: graphically it's gorgeous! Just as the games converted by PlayStation pay the price of being too similar to their console counterparts (see the conversions of the sagas of Resident Evil, Final Fantasy and the latest arrival Dino Crisis, recently available also for PC), not exploiting their much more galvanizing potential, so this Dreamcast conversion is practically the perfect copy of the console version: excellent frame rate, perfect use of colors, stunning backdrops, sprites of enormous dimensions, sublime light effects and I could easily continue on this path for a another hundred characters! Obviously the negative side of this little visual miracle are the hardware requests to worthily manage Omen, the powerful graphics engine developed by Bioware (also programmers of the rpg Baldur Gate, whose sequel is imminent); since I have read various reviews worldwide on the web and not so many different points of view regarding the technical specifications to play this game at least with dignity, I tried Mdk 2 on various PCs and with many different configurations assuming that the game only supports OpenGl for its use, after having the latest drivers for your video card (it is still possible to install GL setup): on a P2 350 with 64 mb of ram and Voodoo 2 with 12 mb onboard set to 640x480 the game runs fairly well with strong drops of frame rate only when there are many sprites on the screen, perhaps seasoned with various explosions; however, it is possible to decide the quality of the textures every time you start a game with the game configuration program where, among other things, you can also enable the resolution to use or activate the eax and T&L respectively for the owners of the SB Live! and a Geforce. On a P2 400 with 128 mb of ram and Voodoo 3 3000 it plays very well at 800x600 with a few clicks here and there, as always only in cases of screen overcrowding; on my P3 500, 256 mb of ram and G400 max the game runs smoothly at 60 fps, with the resolution set to 1024x768 and 32-bit color, even if some minor slowdown persists all the same. However, it is good to underline that the different sections of a level are loaded while you play and therefore while you will walk, generally in narrow tunnels without enemies, you will notice strong clicks aimed at loading the next area and not a possible bug that triggers the all when there are no enemies. The music thanks to a number of bpm that does not make any techno floor filler regret, combined with the fast pace of the action, at the beginning gasano the gamer a lot but after a while, also due to the small number present therein, they tend to annoy . Does history repeat itself? The sound effects are discreetly taken care of, surely something more could have been done in this sector too, both for the quality and for the quantity; slightly worse is the dubbing in Italian: even if the doctor's voice occasionally arouses a smile (especially when he says that his spaceship is 99.9% impenetrable instead of 100% ostentatious 1 minute before having intruders on board), I don't find adequate that of Kurt, at times too cavernous for a character that should make you smile more than scare while perhaps the best voices of the lot (but certainly not exceptional) are those of one of the bad guys, Shwang Shwing and the reporter, really hilarious when during a of the interludes he wonders which of the 3 heroes will step forward to pass the seventh level. The events Once the game has started, we are greeted by a first comic introduction (a technique also used in fairly fast loading) of the history of Mdk2 aimed at giving us an idea of the protagonists; immediately after the real intro starts, also managed by the Omen graphics engine instead of the by now canonical FMV but you won't miss it since the graphics, as mentioned in the previous paragraph, are beautiful; we see Kurt, Dr Hawkins and his dog Max toasting the defeat of the aliens when suddenly the city of Edmonton is attacked by a group of aliens! After the usual resignation typical of anti-heroes, who have not the slightest intention of sacrificing themselves for the Earth and who have become so popular in recent years (especially in Japanese productions, think of Shinji by Shin Seiki Evangelion or Dark Schneider of Bastard who mark a clear break with the typical hero without blemish and without fear to Hokuto no Ken or Saint Seya), Kurt launches himself into the attack but as we will see later he will not be alone in his adventure since both the Doc how much Max (the only dog with 4 arms I've ever seen in my 23 years) will replace him in the moments in which he cannot take part in the fights (for example when he is taken prisoner at the end of the first level). Precisely this detail gives something different to Mdk 2; 3 usable characters and 3 different playstyles..or almost. Are 3 heroes enough? Depending on the events that the plot invented by Bioware will offer you, you will be able to use the aforementioned Kurt, Max and Dr Hawkins whose style of facing alien adversity will now be described in detail, obviously starting from that of... Kurt Hectic He is the protagonist of the previous episode, equipped with a special suit equipped with a parachute that allows him to flutter here and there, land softly after huge flights and take advantage of air currents and as a weapon he uses a lethal double-purpose machine gun : as in the prequel in fact, in addition to the normal game action in which you will have to move through the scenarios cleverly designed by Bioware (which include closed and claustrophobic backdrops as well as open up to the far-fetched without the semblance of fog, bad-clipping covers and similar tricks to hide graphic bugs , ranging from the alien spaceship to towers invaded by enemies and much more) by shooting down the enemies that appear in front of you every now and then it will be necessary to calm the hot spirits and use the sniper function (sniper mode) to which I was referring at the beginning of the review. It is a modality borrowed from the first Mdk in which you have to aim at the targets that lying aliens will occasionally raise or at enemies sheltered by domes or barriers with particular projectiles that ricochet on the ground. Kurt's gameplay in my humble opinion is the best, it offers a clever mix of furious phases where you will be literally attacked from all sides and calmer phases to let you experience the thrill of true sniping at the expense of the not very large variety of monsters inserted in the game (the so-called bifs that launch electric shocks that will chase you everywhere or the flying brains that will make you angry when they bomb you while you are preparing to snipe or to find the main road again are really lethal!). Among the objects that can be used with Kurt, I would like to point out the grenade, a not excellent weapon, a machine gun that is far more devastating than the default one, a hood that makes Kurt invisible for a little while and a mannequin that attracts the attention of enemies . Ben + destructive is instead the gameplay of ... Max It is said that a dog that barks does not bite ... I dare not imagine what a dog can do with a cigar in his mouth and 4 arms armed to the teeth! Max's gameplay is aimed at a game scheme very close to that of Kurt, however clearly preferring the devastating component, omitting the sniper mode and giving the nice big dog in question the possibility of blowing up parts of the seabed such as rocks, doors , switches and more. Not happy, the programmers also gave him the opportunity to take advantage of a jet pack with which, even if for a short while, he can fly using refills present in the places suitable for the function. The immediacy of the gameplay of rude Kurt is here replaced by a certain cumbersomeness inherent in the weapon change system: in fact, having Max 4 arms you can assign a different weapon to each single arm (even if the key to shoot is always only one) , only that to do this you will have to switch the various weapons with the left and right selection keys and with 2 other keys you can respectively select and deselect the weapon, making the gameplay cumbersome especially in the agitated phases when perhaps you run out of ammunition for one or more weapons and while you launch yourself into the wildest strafe also try to select the new war armament, whether you use (as I preferred) keyboard and mouse or a console joypad; the gaps don't end there anyway because some stages are really redundant like when after a section with the jet pack you land on a platform, blow up some turrets, use the jet pack again to do the same thing done a scant minute before , complete with identical platform and turret placement! Speaking of the weapons at his disposal we only have pistols, Uzis, sawed-off shotguns and an automatic weapon, the gutgun which in any case does not constitute what can be called a vast and varied war arsenal. But after so much destruction it is, intelligents in fundo, the turn del... Dr. Hawkins With this nice old man there is the substantial modification to the ~shoot, jump~ gameplay of Kurt Hectic or the hound Max: the doctor can combine different objects together to use them in the most disparate way, from offense to the defense, with objects such as toaster, lighter, electric cable, etc. As for Max, here too a complicated method of selecting objects gives something cumbersome to a character who gives a little break to the warmongering action of which the title is indelibly permeated anyway. So let's sum up After 9600 characters I think the time has come to draw conclusions even if I think they are quite obvious: the title has a screaming graphic design, a discrete audio department for quality but a little less for the really low amount of music and sound effects , a gameplay that amuses and excites but at the same time boring in the case of sections that are too similar to each other. The presence of 3 different characters decreases the monotony that perhaps would have occurred during the ten levels proposed in this latest Interplay effort but in my humble opinion it would have been enough to add a few more skills to Kurt alone, perhaps some borrowed from the other 2 protagonists such as the jet pack or the ability to combine Max and Doc's objects respectively to have an excellent platformer, to be recommended to anyone without reservations; as it is, it is a packaged title that is discreetly advisable both for those who want to take a break between the wave of strategic and fps that invades the PC market and above all for lovers of platform games. In case you are still not full about Mdk 2 here is the reference link, or the section dedicated to it on the Interplay website. The good old days! About 5 years ago Intel introduced Pentium processors on the market with mmx instructions to improve videogame performance among other things; those were the times when 32-bit consoles appeared on the European scene, when 3D graphics began to be used massively not only in arcades but also in gamers' homes. A bit like what currently happens for T&L, MMX extensions have been exploited by the embarrassing number of a couple of video games before the advent of P2 processors and their most sophisticated technology: Pod, an excellent racing game with a futuristic background by Ubi Soft and, needless to say, MDK (which should be the acronym of Murder, Death, Kill but there is always someone who denies it) by Interplay (however programmed by Shiny led by Dave Perry to whom we owe Messiah, already reviewed on Multiplayer.it), a game seasoned with platform and shooter sections permeated by superfine humor (just remember the enemies defended by domes and barriers that mocked us) and some nice gimmicks such as the introduction of sniper mode, the sniper mode that by now it is found almost everywhere (although I think it is more due to the beautiful Goldeneye for N64). Mdk had quite enthusiastic reviews for the time even if some criticized some sections of the game a bit boring or repetitive and was also ported to Playstation.", "date": "2001-04-27", "grade": null}
