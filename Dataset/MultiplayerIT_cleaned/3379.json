{"name": "Blacksad: Under the Skin", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/blacksad-under-the-skin-recensione.html", "text": "Blacksad: Under the Skin is taken from the comic series of the same name created by the Spanish author Juan Daz Canales and drawn by Juanjo Guarnido. The work has met with some success especially in France and sees a private investigator at the center of the story engaged in the resolution of controversial legal cases with the help of some precious allies. In the background, America at the end of the 50s is painted, whose social problems and contradictions are outlined through the characteristic style of the noir genre. The narrative component with adult, raw and realistic tones is also filtered through characters with the features of anthropomorphic animals. Developed by the Iberian team Pendulo Studios - which someone will probably remember for the graphic adventure Runaway - under the Microids label, the game has already landed on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, while it will arrive on Nintendo Switch by the end of the current month. In our review, therefore, let's take stock of the salient features of the work, framing whether or not it has managed to respect the original pillars by combining them with a stimulating narrative and playful context. Story: investigator Blacksad grappling with an alleged suicide Private investigator John Blacksad is a man - sorry - a straight cat in late 1950s New York. An individual who takes his job very seriously, one who still has the horrors of the Second World War imprinted in his eyes, despite having barely managed to turn the page by dedicating himself body and soul to solving controversial cases on behalf of private subjects. John is not simply a surly ex-soldier who cut his teeth in the most infamous neighborhoods of the city: our feline protagonist is in fact endowed with superfine intelligence and deductive abilities. It is precisely these qualities that allow him to associate events, people and clues to exploit with great wit the probative evidence of the cases for which he is hired. In accordance with the atmosphere outlined in the comic, Blacksad: Under the Skin is a title with a strongly noir imprint, both for the way in which the themes are treated and for the staid rhythm of the narration and the disillusioned, sometimes openly cynical attitude of certain characters. Not to mention the perfect sound accompaniment, based on persuasive jazz sounds in which trumpets and saxophones dominate unchallenged. As we have already had the opportunity to point out in our special dedicated to comics, the events narrated in this new adventure take place chronologically between the Arctic Nation and Anima Rossa volumes. According to the typical tradition of the reference stories, the case that must be completed would seem at first sight linear and simple to resolve. But nothing is as it seems in the shadow of the Big Apple, least of all when a mysterious suicide and shady individuals linked to the American sports business are involved. Celebrated boxer Bobby Yale suddenly disappeared just as his trainer, veteran Joe Dunn, was found hanged in his own gym. In a complex situation, around which the interests of many individuals seem to revolve, his daughter Sonia has chosen to rely on the services of Blacksad in the hope that clarity can be shed on the whole affair, bringing to light the gray areas that seem to be been concealed with great skill by the mysterious instigator of a full-blown staging. The only certainty is that if Bobby doesn't show up for the fight scheduled two weeks later at Madison Square Garden, where he is expected to face the mighty defending champion Al Stone, the gym run by the Dunn family will sadly close its doors. I begin a complex investigation and not without twists, in which Blacksad himself acts as narrator, in accordance with the typical scheme of the hard-boiled genre. The investigator spends himself in frequent and articulated personal reflections, often linked to the complex situations that life confronts us and to the choices that we are sometimes forced to make in borderline situations. Clearly at his side there are some characters already well known to fans of comics, including the seraphic commissioner Smirnov and the bizarre photojournalist Weekly. Gameplay: collection of clues, dialogues and deductions Blacksad: Under the Skin presents gameplay in many ways similar to that made famous in recent years by the adventures of the now defunct Telltale Games. The protagonist himself did not fail to bring us back to memory in some ways that of Bigby Wolf in The Wolf Among Us. The interaction is therefore very limited, mainly linked to the observation of the circus environmentmany, as well as the collection of clues and the completion of dialogues. The verbal comparisons with the other characters are probably the most successful component of the work, by virtue of effective multiple answers that open the way to a rich variety of choices on the tones to keep with one's interlocutor and on the strategy to undertake. For example, it is possible to decide to be sincere or to lie shamelessly, to act in the light of the sun or vice versa to hide one's cards while waiting for the right moment. Sometimes you also need to act quickly, as a time indicator appears on the screen which forces you to select the answer without thinking too much about it. Alternatively, you can still decide to remain silent and see what happens. Accessing the Your Blacksad section keeps track of all the consequences of the individual decisions made by the player during the game and the influence they are having on the protagonist. Various items are considered here such as decisiveness, cunning, romance and so on. A special indicator also tells us how many chances there are of being able to solve the case correctly on the basis of the actions already undertaken up to that moment in one's game. In keeping with tradition, the search for clues passes from the analysis of the people who need to be consulted to elaborate the material useful for the investigation. In these situations the view slows down, the colors fade and it is necessary to move the cursor over the body of the subject in front of you in search of neuralgic points capable of revealing important information. This is because the resolute Blacksad is possessed of an above average nose, eyes and hearing. It is thanks to his skills that the investigator is in a position to perceive fundamental details, even where at first sight there would not seem to be any anomalies or oddities whatsoever. The careful reconstruction of the facts takes the form of Deductions: by accessing the relative menu, the player is called to logically associate some of the evidence that emerged during the investigation, in order to continue further and identify possible new leads. It must be said that this dynamic works somewhat in alternating phases, contrasting some solutions that are too telephoned with others that at first sight seem difficult to relate to each other on the basis of what is concretely specified in the text. The situation becomes more complex in the second part of the story, when the story begins to unravel and the implications related to the various subjects involved in the crime become more compelling to follow. Without big surprises, the least effective component of the game is linked to the management of the limited action sequences that are interspersed with verbal exchanges and exploration of the levels. These interactions are as usual reliant on quick time events, requiring button presses and flicks of the analog sticks with the correct timing to unlock the next sequence. Unfortunately from this point of view Blacksad: Under the Skin lacks more than one occasion of fluidity and effectiveness, making it necessary to repeat certain actions several times certainly not due to their complexity but rather due to the approximation of the control system. Added to this are too slow movements during the phases of exploration of the surrounding environment, with some evident problems that are evident above all in smaller rooms or in low light conditions. The dubbing proved to be well made, first of all as regards the vocal timbre of the protagonist, while the presence of Italian subtitles makes it easy to follow the story even for those who do not speak English (unlike what happened in the products of the aforementioned Telltale). We also found it quite irritating not being able to quickly skip dialogues when it becomes necessary to retrace a certain scene because the main objective has been failed. In the face of an average longevity with the needs of the genre - therefore in the order of about a dozen of hours - the title of Pendulo Studios also faces criticism from a technical point of view. The character models are faithful to the original counterparts of the comic and the 50s noir atmosphere is transmitted effectively, nevertheless these qualities have not been supported by an equal solidity of the graphics sector, which on PC suffers from obvious optimization problems even with configurations more than adequate for the task, revealing the presence of numerous bugs and glitches that distract the user from the narrative on several occasions.", "date": "2019-11-13", "grade": "7.0"}
