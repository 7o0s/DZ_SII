Let's now see if this particular choice will have the qualities to open new perspectives to the videogame series or if it will prove to be a banal hiccup. Kick into the balls Dragon Ball: Revenge of King Piccolo, like all titles related to Toriyama's manga, finds its precise location within Goku's numerous adventures: in this case, the facts narrated here range from the Red Ribbon saga and end with that of Piccolo. The common thread that binds the various episodes is always the search for the Dragon Balls by the little Saiyan, a theme often taken up by the excellent real-time cutscenes with which the Story Mode is peppered and which effectively manage to establish a strong point of contact with the animated series. Too bad that not all the narrative elements of Dragon Ball: Revenge of King Piccolo live up to the aspect just mentioned: the opening and closing of the various levels often find space for incredibly verbose and fundamentally useless dialogue sequences for the purposes of the story, which perhaps only the most ardent fans of the series will find the strength not to skip it. To be honest, it is precisely the entire Namco Bandai production that oscillates dangerously between acceptable quality standards and old-gen baseness, starting from the technical sector. If the good realization of the cutscenes is out of the question, the same cannot be said of the in-game graphics, which leave room for more than a few perplexities. The polygonal models of Goku and the enemies are cared for and defined down to the smallest details, and even the animations - although not spectacular - do their duty: the scenarios, however, are not convincing at all, extremely repetitive and poor in details, equipped with questionable color palettes that combine with Wii's proverbial poor definition to produce a truly mediocre result. However, the lowest points of the Namco Bandai work must be sought in the context of the sound accompaniment. The music that forms the background to the action is kitsch beyond endurance, while the effects are limited and very little incisive, but the black flag must undoubtedly be assigned to the English dubbing: even if we want to overlook the bad acting, the voices are incredibly annoying , especially the shrill one of Goku who -moreover- takes care to accompany every single selection made by the user in the main menu... You were so small Things are - fortunately - a little better with regard to the gameplay of Dragon Ball: Revenge of King Piccolo, although here too the developers have been guilty of some significant oversight. The Story Mode is divided into chapters relating to the various sagas taken into consideration, which in turn are divided into three stages which tend to always offer the same mix of fighting game and platform elements. Taking advantage of the Remote + Nunchuck combo, Goku moves within levels created in 3D but developed on a two-dimensional plane, and you must reach your goal by beating up enemies, jumping on some platforms and solving elementary puzzles. Although the combat phases are the master, we often find ourselves running for long empty spaces, which suggests that level design is not the strong point of the Namco Bandai production. Conversely, beating hands is quite fun, even if the few moves available to Goku and the foolishness of the opponents end up making everything repetitive soon. Don't worry, however, the Story Mode is so short that the risk of getting bored definitively before having completed it is really remote. Evidently aware of this fact, the developers have tried to extend the life of the product with the World Tournament section, in which you can engage in one-on-one battles by choosing from a list of characters from the anime. Unfortunately, this mode is based on too simplistic mechanics, reducing itself to a button smashing without rhyme or reason. The offer is completed by a Shop in which to spend the money collected during the game to unlock extras such as costumes, character sheets, movies and so on, in a plethora of elements that joins the collectibles hidden in the various Story Mode stages. A tribute to the fanatics, but a very small attraction for everyone else.", "date": "2009-10-29", "grade": "6.7"}
