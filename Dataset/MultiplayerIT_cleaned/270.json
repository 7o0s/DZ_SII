{"name": "Secret Neighbor", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/secret-neighbor-recensione.html", "text": "The Secret Neighbor review takes us back to the eerie imagery created by the Russian development team Dynamic Pixels. Although represented in a cartoonish style, it cannot in fact be said that the context in which the games of Hello Neighbor take place was carefree, given that it revolves around a neighbor who turns out to be a mad criminal and a boy who tries to unmask it. The same formula is applied to this asynchronous multiplayer experience, which after its debut on PC, PS4 and Xbox One also arrives on iOS devices with a free-to-play version which, however, places several limits on a progression carried out only in-game , rather pushing us to subscribe to a  2.99 monthly subscription in order to be able to select all nine available characters rather than waiting to collect the (many!) coins necessary to unlock them. Gameplay Secret Neighbor, the menacing Neighbor next to a security device. As mentioned, the starting idea of Secret Neighbor is basically the same as Hello Neighbor, in the sense that in the main game mode our goal will be to get to unmask the neighbor after gaining access to his basement. However, the mechanics change, this time declined in the multiplayer environment with an asynchronous setting, five against one. During the game, five users will therefore control the kids (Packer, Lionheart, Investigator, Inventor, Chief or Scout: all names that refer to the related skills peculiar), while one will be the Neighbor in its three possible incarnations. There's more: through a clear reference to the blockbuster Among Us, the player who takes on the role of the villain will be able to blend in and hide among the ranks of his potential victims, to then suddenly reveal himself and capture them. Secret Neighbor, the kids have to open several locks before they can access the basement. Unfortunately, the iOS version of the game has a huge limitation represented by the control system: with touch controls it is practically impossible to play with dignity, the movement of the view is too slow and therefore it is very difficult to manage the character. Furthermore, using the touch screen remains fundamentally disadvantaged in cross-platform matches. Fortunately, Bluetooth controllers are supported by the game and improve the experience substantially, allowing us to explore the environment (which changes randomly from time to time) much faster, interact with various objects while looking for keys and cards of safety, as well as react promptly in the face of dangerous situations. Structure and technical realization Secret Neighbor, the bulk of the gameplay involves opening drawers and cabinets looking for keys and cards. Secret Neighbor allows you to try your hand at a quick match, personalized or with the brawl mode, a variation on the theme in which the participants face off with slingshots in a sort of deathmatch. As mentioned, the scenario changes randomly every time we visit it, in order to modify the position of the various objects and therefore present an always different, unpredictable experience. The enjoyment of matches depends a lot on the ability to coordinate actions with those of one's companions , via voice chat or gestures, because facing the situation alone when playing as one of the kids will hardly lead to appreciable results. Sometimes beautiful sequences come out, but in general Secret Neighbor doesn't have much to give and the interactions are handled in a rather cumbersome way. A problem also linked to the uncertainties of the frame rate, even on the iPhone 12 Pro (which moreover gets very hot when running the game), and to a really problematic rendering of the interface on smartphones, with tiny and difficult to read writing starting from the main screen . Then when you move to the iPad Pro, the graphic resolution appears inexplicably lower, with very evident jaggies and artifacts. In short, as already happened with Dead by Daylight, it seems that even in this case the developers have not managed to effectively adapt the experience of Secret Neighbor to the mobile context, ending up overshadowing the albeit not numerous positive aspects of this asynchronous multiplayer interpretation.", "date": "2021-06-26", "grade": "6.0"}
