So starting from the obvious assumption that this review will take into account the fundamentally incomplete nature of the game, let's see if it's worth putting yourself in the shoes of the umpteenth poor wretch who survived the umpteenth zombie apocalypse... Collecting like there was no tomorrow As evident from the title, the survival element is the keystone of the product created by the Russian team Kefir, which was clearly inspired by Don't Starve and similar: the player's goal is therefore simply to survive, fighting the adversity, collecting the resources offered by the scenario and transforming them into objects and tools useful for one's livelihood. Generally, in this genre of video games, the protagonist starts as they say in canvas pants and in Last Day on Earth this aspect has been taken literally: after the initial loading screen, we end up with the character wearing only a pair of red long johns, in a clearing that offers few dangers and enough raw materials to make this area your headquarters. We therefore begin by picking berries to soothe hunger and thirst, wood and stones to build the first rudimentary tools and then proceed by cutting trees, breaking stones and hunting wild animals, then investing the accumulated resources to build a house and the fundamental structures for ensure a minimum of self-sufficiency. Each completed action is rewarded with experience points, and as you level up you get emblems to spend to unlock new projects to create new objects or improve existing ones: all with increasingly large and diversified requests in terms of raw materials, forcing the user to explore the world in search of the necessary. Like practically all members of this peculiar genre, Last Day on Earth also has a fundamentally cyclical structure and is characterized by rather slow rhythms (also thanks to the energy that is consumed on each journey and which must be recharged over time or by spending coins), which are ill-suited to those looking for action and immediate fun in a mobile game: here it is instead necessary to arm oneself with patience and adapt to an almost passive gameplay, so much so that in a corner of the display stands out a virtual button that lets you collect automatically to the protagonist the resources available nearby, leaving the player only to look at the screen. For anyone who has this kind of experience in their ropes, however, the Kefir product can offer a considerable amount of content, although it is still in the beta phase: the objects scattered around the world are countless, there are many areas to explore and events to face (your own base and that of other users can, for example, be victims of assaults and raids) and there is always something new to build that pushes you to look for the required materials. There is obviously no shortage of dangers, represented not only by the different species of zombies that roam the scenarios but also by the other users who cross their path and who you can decide to ignore or kill to take possession of their possessions. The combat system is decidedly basic and is certainly not the most successful aspect of the game, but it is not even the most attractive: the clashes are nothing more than obstacles to the collection of resources, which always remains the pillar of the game. gameplay of the title around which the inevitable in-app purchases also revolve. In this regard, it certainly cannot be said that Kefir went lightly: beyond the usual in-game coin packs, it is allowed to buy resource crates at absolutely insane prices in our opinion (at the time of writing we are talking about 2  .29 for a single unit), which will not be essential to continue but which taste a lot of loan sharking for players who legitimately want to use them. It is hoped that future updates of the application can correct the shot of this and other elements that do not appear fully focused in Last Day on Earth, which in the flood of content offered also presents some dead ends and poorly implemented functions or at all evidently absent children of the development still in progress. Even the technical component still denotes several corners to be rounded - especially sotthe sound profile - but for now the work done on a clear and comfortable interface to use and on an isometric graphic that performs its duty very well is appreciable.", "date": "2017-09-19", "grade": "7.8"}
