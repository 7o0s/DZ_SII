{"name": "Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/baldurs-gate-dark-alliance_b.html", "text": "HISTORY Describing the storyline of an RPG is at least inappropriate, given that a large part of the fun that comes from this kind of video game comes from the discovery of new pieces, more or less important, of the plot conceived by the programmers. Once you have selected your alter ego from the three available (the archer, the dwarf and the sorceress) the real game begins: you are an exile who has just arrived in Baldur's Gate, a port city that stands on the Chionthar river, which is part of the wide world Abeir-Toril. Just when you arrive in the city, some shady figures will pounce on you, and then escape thanks to the presence of some guards, for once, present at the right moment. Who are they? What are they up to in the city's slums? Why is the citizenry afraid of a possible civil war? Bread for your teeth, unwary 4-penny adventurers.. GAME STRUCTURE The attentive connoisseurs of the Baldur's Gate franchise will surely wonder if these lines (in this case the initial paragraph) were written by someone who had never tried the Black Isle Studios RPG, given that there was also talk of the name Diablo , exceptional bilogy of role-playing games more aimed at fighting fanatics, than the user eager for a strong storyline, several npg and so on. Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance breaks away from its illustrious predecessors, offering a game structure very similar to that of the saga created by Blizzard, with lots of enemies to shoot down, some extra quests here and there to complete to get special items and experience points extras and so on. The game system set up by SnowBlind Studios extensively exploits the Sony controller, entrusting the left stick with the task of moving our alter ego, the right with the task of rotating camera, relegating the tasks of changing the spells available to the ~historic~ digital pad ; the rest of the keys are for hitting, jumping (!), interacting with the environment (opening doors, activating mechanisms, etc.), using objects. The rescue system provides for the achievement of (very frequent) checkpoints where you can access your memory card. The initiative of inserting an option to play the same adventure in two is commendable, however forcing the subsequent use only if with both adventurers present, therefore you will not be able to get to the end of the first act with your fat little brother, go out with your girlfriend and hope that the infant can beat the umpteenth wave of monsters. Many have declared themselves amazed by this clean cut with the past that brings Dark Alliance closer to a scrolling fighting game than to an RPG as in the episodes available for computers, but this does not mean that the fun is missing, on the contrary! Smashing hordes of enemies, using ever more powerful and spectacular magic and weapons, finding (by chance) the bottle that the drunk asked you to look for in his place while you try to find out more about your future enemies, translates in an exciting story (although continuing the story loses some interest), where it will be difficult to get bored before having written the word end to this third chapter of the Baldur's Gate saga. The advice of whoever writes these lines is to ignore the easy difficulty level, opting immediately for the normal one (about fifteen hours to complete it) and, later, the more difficult one, perhaps using a different character than yours. first excursion in this excellent video game. To ensure that the game does not collect dust on the shelves at home, after solving it the first time, Snowblind Studios has included numerous extras that can be unlocked gradually such as the extreme difficulty level, the hilarious Gauntlet mode (15 minutes to finish a brand new dungeon) and more. GRAPHICS How many times have you heard that the Playstation 2 does not know how to properly exploit the anti-aliasing? Dozens have been the moments in which the malicious have asserted that the video memory of the black beast Sony would not have allowed a considerable number of polygons, special effects and anti-aliasing on screen together passionately without compromising the frame rate? Well, if these people with Gran Turismo 3 A-Spec, This Is Football 2002 and Jak And Dexter still haven't changed their minds (it shows that they are hard-headed!), proudly show them this visual gem given to us (so to speak, obvious) from Snowblind Studios; the first impact is something devastating, lots of incredibly detailed sprites move without bothering the Sony Emotion Engine in the slightest, thoughtful in garant a lot of special effects on screen (including one of the best representations of liquids in a video game, if not the best), although on screen there will be about twenty imps, gargoyles and soldiers ready to throw you, axes, fireballs , spears and so on. The amazing character and weapon design also extends to the moment in which it will be necessary to modify one's equipment since if, for example, you want to change the shield of your intrepid dwarf, this will be displayed on the screen, like his armor, the weapons he wields at that moment and so on (needless to say that if you don't have armour, helmet, boots and gloves, your alter ego will be shown with a cheerful underpants that very much reminds Arthur of the Ghost'n' Goblins saga), thanks to a disproportionate amount of polygons and textures (the latter of really excellent quality). Many times we end up preferring, qualitatively speaking, the characters that the player will be called upon to impersonate, with a bestiary that is sometimes limited in quantity, sometimes disappointing from the point of view of artificial intelligence and so on; Snowblind has also thought of this and the many monsters (mice, demons, imps, gargoyles, soldiers, birds, zombies, deceased souls, sorcerers, cyclops, etc) that we will meet along the 3 (rather long) phases of the game are extremely detailed, well diversified in appearance as in the various attack strategies but above all (as already mentioned a few lines above) although present in massive doses on the screen, they do not cause the slightest hesitation to the graphic engine. The superlative graphic department of Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance, however, is not such only for the sprites, but also and above all for the magnificent special effects implemented by the guys at Snowblind Studios: particle effects, fog, transparencies, explosions, deformations are only a small part of the show for our eyes that slowly makes its way into our retinas. However, what really upsets is the way in which some metal floors have been made (surprisingly and realistically reflective) and the particular animation routine of the liquid surfaces that must be admired by anyone (between a little drool and the other that cola) and above all by those who believe that Splashdown and Jet Sky Riders present the best creation of wave motion, at least on Playstation 2 (otherwise we would have to bother with Wave Race Blue Storm for Gamecube). Graphically we are, therefore, faced with one of the greatest visual expressions of the video game, now let's move on to. SOUND Already appreciated for the soundtrack of the handsome Icewind Dale, Jeremy Soule also gives proof of his excellent skills in the musical field in Dark Alliance: the beautiful, very atmospheric music bursts into the gamer's ears, giving him the feeling of being faced with a movie. Majestic in the key moments, relaxing in the moments of calm, absent when useless, the soundtrack of the game is well suited to spot-on sound effects and high sound quality, even more so if equipped with a Dolby Surround system. We close on the sound side with a note on the Italian adaptation: having also watched the American version for a while, the undersigned has nothing to complain about the voices used to give life to the inhabitants of Baldur's Gate (Time Crisis 2 is by now the paradigm videogame dubbing), although some voice actors, such as the very active Stefano Albertini, are used to dub more than a single character, a choice certainly dictated so as not to excessively burden the adaptation costs. CONCLUSIONS Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance is a simply excellent start of the popular RPG saga on consoles, given that the video game here will also be released for Gamecube and Xbox, presumably in the Autumn. Graphically shocking, it is a clear demonstration that the Sony black monolith, if exploited by capable software houses, is not yet annihilated by younger competitors. The soundtrack is simply stupendous, a masterpiece with a contour based on well-crafted sound effects and crystalline quality, as well as an Italian dubbing without infamy and without praise. Fun abounds in massive doses, even if sometimes monotony reigns supreme and the story is not always brilliant, as it is in most Squaresoft and Enix masterpieces; longevity, although a little below the average for RPGs, is guaranteed by the presence of 3 different characters to control, the option to play in two and the various extras to unlock. An excelnte role-playing game purely devoted to action, with an amazing cosmetics and a soundtrack worthy of a film, if with the inevitable sequel they increase longevity a little, we will certainly have a masterpiece to be ascribed in the annals of videogame history, therein only touched. Pros: Exceptional graphics Majestic and atmospheric music Very funny Interesting extras to unlock Cons: A bit repetitive Voice acting just ok Longevity a little below expectations Obligatory intro!! Debuted on PC just over a couple of years ago, the Baldur's Gate saga has not failed to excite several legions of role-playing game fanatics, ready to spend hours trying to kill hordes of terrible enemies, solving quests hand by hand proposals to the party of adventurers, dialogue with dozens and dozens of non-playing characters, between one level of experience and another hard acquired. The popular rpg branded Black Isle Studios not only won many excellent votes and various awards from the specialized press, as well as being assumed the status of a true paradigm of the rpg genre, but with the subsequent expansion Tales Of The Sword Coast (joined with the game main DVD version, bundled with many DVD players), it was now clear that a new brand had been created, capable of ensuring record sales to Black Isle Studios (the programmers) and Interplay (distributor). In the spasmodic wait that arose for the inevitable sequel, many let themselves be entertained by the good Icewind Dale, created with the Baldur's Gate graphics engine and, among other things, the tasty dessert of what was Shadows Of Mystaria, which distances itself from any point of view (graphics, sound, playability and longevity) from its illustrious ancestor. A lot of water has passed under the bridge, the Baldur's Gate bilogy, with its expansions, is now very well known both among PC owners and console owners, so far spoiled by masterpieces such as the Final Fantasy sagas, Phantasy Star, Chrono Trigger and Legend Of Zelda (although quite different in terms of game setting, plot and character design from typical western RPGs). With the success that Playstation 2 is, deservedly, achieving all over the world, Interplay certainly could not miss the opportunity to introduce its favorite franchise to the owners of the black monolith Sony and, after so many announcements, denials, videos and so on followed, the first episode of Baldur's Gate on consoles finally peeked out, with Snowblind Studios proving to be one of the few software houses able to handle the graphics capabilities of the Playstation 2 in a sensational way and ... to produce the best clone of the Diablo bilogy never seen, heard or played. After this long but inevitable premise and waiting for the already announced conversions of this Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance on Xbox and Gamecube let's start talking about the..", "date": "2002-03-05", "grade": null}
