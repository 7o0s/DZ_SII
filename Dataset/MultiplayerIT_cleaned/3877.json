{"name": "Lemmings", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lemmings-la-recensione-del-gioco-mobile.html", "text": "It is not an exaggeration to say that Lemmings is a game of great importance for the history of video games, yet it has failed to renew itself in a convincing way and present itself again to the modern public in new chapters that also had a drop of the original genius. Perhaps the problem is precisely the fact of being based on a great idea, an intuition that is valid once, represents a pillar of game design but fails to establish a true canon, exhausting itself in that single original expression or completing itself as much as possible with the second chapter. In fact, the series has never managed to confirm itself in the years following the 90s and is not able to do so even with this new mobile interpretation, which emerges as a good puzzle within these platforms but pales in comparison to what a official heir to the DMA/Psygnosis tradition, as we see in this review. The new Lemmings is clearly a rather low-profile production, as can also be deduced from its practically surprising appearance on the iOS and Android digital stores, but this would not even be a great defect, given that technical means have never been fundamental elements of the series. The biggest problem with this new version is its oversimplification, as well as the nuisances that can emerge from the free-to-play structure but to which we are more or less accustomed. The concept is always the same: it is a question of bringing safely as many lemmings as possible from an entry point to an exit point within the various levels, trying to make them avoid obstacles and mortal dangers by assigning some of them of specific tasks. Unlike the original, all levels of this Lemmings are developed in a single screen to fit better on mobile device screens and this, while it represents an excellent idea to ensure the best playability on these platforms, is however a significant limitation in gameplay development. Planets of Lemmings The original idea of this Lemmings is based on the presence of some planets to populate with the little creatures of the game. This gives some sense to the collection of rodents within the various levels but has no particular insights in terms of gameplay, being more of a way to increase the sense of progression. Within the levels, the action recalls the classic one but with some fundamental variations placed on the control system, to work better with the touch screen: instead of acting on the individual lemmings, the actions are set up directly on the portions of the scenario on which we want take action, with the screen appearing divided by an invisible grid on which you can place these orders. We can thus arrange the destruction of blocks (if these can be destroyed), the construction of stairs, the positioning of umbrellas to repair the lemmings from falling or establish points in which to place the stoppers. There is no time limit to complete the levels and the actions must fall within the maximum number of possible operations that we have available: once these have been completed we must stop and wait for the energy to restore, or obviously buy a top-up with money real. This can be decidedly annoying because the total consumption of the moves that can be performed can take place at any time in the middle of a game, thus forcing the purchase of micro-transactions or the abandonment of the level. If the problem may seem remote in the early stages of the game, it becomes quite pressing when the levels are more difficult, forcing several attempts to find the solution, which affect the expenditure of moves and therefore the possibility of moving forward. For the rest, there are obviously many points in common with the original games, starting from the basic concept up to the actions to be performed by the lemmings, but the general feeling is quite different. This is due to a certain reduction in the possible actions and to their different management: in fact, it is a question of acting more on the elements of the scenario than on the lemmings themselves, with solutions that generally lead to less sacrifice and strategic use of the creatures than those which required levels in the old style.", "date": "2018-12-27", "grade": "7.5"}
