{"name": "Romancelvania", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/romancelvania-recensione.html", "text": "A game that tries to mix metroidvania and dating simulation should be appreciated regardless, if only for the courage and originality of the idea that is not common even in the current indie landscape lined with strange gameplay amalgams, but Romancelvania's review demonstrates how the goal set by The Deep End Games is perhaps too complex to achieve in a convincing way. In this bizarre reinterpretation of Castlevania, the protagonist Drac is a vampire called to redeem himself after a century of starvation and self-pity for having been betrayed and defeated by his love, and to do so he won't have to set fire to the human world (although a bit yes, in hindsight), but rather play the ~tronista~ in a reality show organized by Grim, the not very sad reaper who has rediscovered himself as a glam and avant-garde television producer. Conceptually it is an idea that does not one fold: instead of wandering through a labyrinthine castle in search of revenge, revenge and glory, we do it largely to conquer the various participants in the reality show, among which we will then have to select the most ~deserving of attention~, let's say. As they say, ~pull more of a werewolf fur...~ Or something like that. To tell the truth, this is an even more valid motivation than many other premises used for secondary missions or entire games, opening the door to insights and even narrative branches based on the selections we find ourselves making. The subjects in question present an impressive variety, ranging from supernatural creatures of all kinds and sexes, all quite well characterized. Although we obviously play a bit on some stereotypes, it is always done with a certain intelligence and depth. The design is therefore brilliant and also the staging has its reasons, the problem of Romancelvania is precisely in its gameplay, as we will see, and unfortunately it is not a trivial matter. The vampire tronista Romancelvania allows you to choose the appearance, gender and voice of the protagonist Drac has spent 100 years brooding over the former lover who betrayed and defeated him, leaving the castle in ruins and staying away from the fighting and action for far too long. A mysterious invitation from a cabal and an encounter with Grim upset the sober normality of the vampire by throwing him into a sort of sentimental reality show, which he is forced to participate in to redeem his name and control of his castle. The beginning is a clear citation of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, with our hero who finds himself fighting some monsters at the peak of his power, only to lose his powers once he meets Grim who invites him (willy-nilly) to take part in the show. It is obviously a parody of the typical premise of metroidvanias and in particular of the Konami classic, with the protagonist finding himself having to regain his abilities to open new paths through ever higher movement and combat possibilities. pragmatic and inflexible (complete with a fight against the budget boss) and Drac has to work hard to invite new participants to the show and try to keep interest by cultivating the various relationships. Among the guests are deities, muses, demons, witches, werewolves and other assorted creatures, each characterized by its own personality and specific interests, often at odds with one another. In Romancelvania, the characters are definitely over the top Based on the choices we make, we can deepen our knowledge of one or the other guest, consequently also developing the story in a different way, albeit with marginal ramifications. Relationships are nourished above all during the dialogues and in the ~tte--tte~ appointments, which take place according to the trappings typical of programs such as ~The Bachelor~. Based on our attitude and our answers (generally schematized in categories such as ~provocative~, ~sexy~, ~friendly~, ~threatening~), the relationship with the interlocutor advances in a different way, with lots of selections to be made periodically to eliminate competitors that we consider less interesting. Metroidvania-style gameplay, or almost Romancelvania plays out like a metroidvania, most of the time Beyond the romantic digressions, Romancelvania is a metroidvania, even if it is probably one of the crudest interpretations of the sub-genre that we have seen in recent times. The most direct reference is clearly Castlevania, of which it stands as a sort of parody, also given the more explicit citations such as the types of monsters to face and the mechanics ofthe basis of the gameplay. Here too we find the typical movements in 2D platform style, complete with a double jump to reconquer and transformations into fog or super speed, as well as a combat system focused on different weapons to be assigned to three keys, choosing from a range of various game solutions. attack. In this sense, the romantic component has effective reflections in the gameplay because, as the level of the relationship with certain characters increases, the possibility of purchasing specific related perks is also unlocked, which increase Drac's statistics and abilities. Theoretically, the elements they are all there, but they fail to translate into a convincing game mechanic, for various reasons. The levels, interconnected in a single map as per tradition, are sufficiently varied and well characterized, although sometimes confusing also due to an original but inconsistent artistic direction. Absolutely incomprehensible, in a game of this kind, is the lack of a map to recall on the screen, which forces you to go by heart and makes backtracking even more frustrating than necessary. There is also a general woodiness between response to commands and animations that mortify the classic spirit of the metroidvania, whose gameplay should enhance the agility and speed of the protagonist, while Drac often seems pachydermic in his movements. All this makes the gameplay action almost an accessory compared to the much more accurate ~sim date~ component, when it should perhaps be the other way around. A strange aspect of Romancelvania The 2D character dialogues show the best aspect of these The artistic direction reflects the general originality of Romancelvania, staging a game with a truly geeky aspect. The choice of 3D graphics perhaps has to do with the need to contain costs and resources, but character modeling and animations remain rather sparse, despite an excellent character design in terms of 2D illustrations. For a game that leverages their charisma, perhaps something more could have been done to better characterize them during the game and the cutscenes, also because the dubbing and acting are generally well done (although not uniformly, given that some characters are not dubbed). it is an element clearly wanted by the developers and also appreciable, if you enter the wavelength of the game. Another matter is the lack of elegance of the animations, which combined with a not always optimal response of the controls only increases the idea of a general awkwardness of Drac and enemies, although the character should instead suggest elegance and lethal charm.", "date": "2023-03-19", "grade": "6.5"}
