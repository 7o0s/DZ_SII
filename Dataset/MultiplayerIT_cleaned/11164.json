{"name": "La forza scorre potente sulla PSP", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/star-wars-il-potere-della-forza-recensione_b.html", "text": "Star Wars represents an example of absolute success in the field of merchandising, something truly extraordinary: the two film trilogies have created a universe from which comics, cartoons, books, toys, gadgets of various types and, of course, video games have been drawn. Almost one hundred tie-ins, in this case, which in the last thirty years have enriched the toy library of all generations of home computers, consoles and even cell phones. Despite these numbers, LucasArts is convinced that it can still invent something new and original, and with Star Wars: The Force Unleashed it precisely wanted to create a title that would give the player the opportunity to use the Force as never seen before. Well, we can say without fear of contradiction that at least this goal has been fully achieved... Portable powers The PSP version of the game offers a total of three modes: in addition to the story mode, in fact, it is possible to try your hand at a wireless multiplayer and challenge a friend within the numerous arenas present, or access the ~The Force Unleashed~ mode, in in which you face all the bosses in sequence using a character of your choice from those available (many must be unlocked). The latter option is exclusive to this portable reduction, and on balance it has the merit of increasing the longevity of a product which, otherwise, could only count on the ~replayability~ factor thanks to the extra difficulty levels, the upgrade system and to hidden clothes. The story mode begins with an internship that acts as a tutorial, in which we take on the role of none other than Darth Vader, and then move on to command his cunning apprentice for the rest of the story. The control system does not change: we can strike spectacular slashes with the lightsaber by pressing the Square button, jump with X and use the Force in two different ways, using the Triangle and Circle buttons. In the first case we will be able to grab objects and enemies with telekinesis, throwing them away or making offensive maneuvers from a distance; in the second case we will be able to launch electric shocks like the ones that made Emperor Palpatine famous. The parry is always entrusted to the Square button (it must be held down), while the back buttons are used to make shots and evasive actions (back R) or to perform special moves in combination with other buttons (back L). Rich prizes and cocktail parties Being able to count on a boundless and colorful universe like that of Star Wars, the developers of Krome Studios (whose latest effort for PSP was Hellboy: Science of Evil, unfortunately treated badly by the trade press) have included in The Force Unleashed a large number of unlockable extras: characters, stages, arenas, ~historical~ battles, swords and so on. These are elements of great interest to fans, who will eventually be able to restart the adventure at a higher level of difficulty but being able to count on all the enhanced skills, personalized swords and unpublished clothes. Your Effort is bigger than mine! Star Wars: The Force Unleashed is presented as a third-person action game in which combat plays a fundamental role. Our character has an automatic ~lock on~ system, which hooks the closest enemy but puts us in great difficulty when the numerical inferiority is strong, since it is not possible to manage the view directly: very often we will find ourselves fighting ~blindly~, moving quickly to take as little damage as possible. The fact of being able to use the objects scattered around the locations as weapons is interesting, and more than once it will take away the proverbial chestnuts from the fire, since we will be able to attack from afar (although without demanding great precision). All the stages are organized in the same way: there is some exploratory component, but more than anything you have to get rid of all the ~simple~ troops quickly and then face the boss on duty in a spectacular fight. At this juncture we will be able to fund our repertoire of special moves and combos, the latter ~purchasable~ and upgradeable from the pause screen by spending the points acquired up to that moment. The fight always ends with a ~God of War~ sequence, in which the buttons indicated on the screen must be pressed promptly: if the combination succeeds, the duel ends with the ruthless elimination of our opponent. Technical realization It's unusual to praise plot and direction first, in the usual paragraph dedicated to technical realization; yet it is undoubtedly the two most refined elements of the game: the story told in The Force Unleashed is really excellent, it is chronologically between the end of the trilogy classic and the beginning of Episode I, and can count on excellent choices as regards the direction of the cutscenes and the dubbing (in Italian in the local version). Moving on to the actual action, the polygonal models of the characters aren't extraordinarily detailed but they do their job well, with a decent set of animations and numerous variations during the final stages of the boss fights. The locations boast a good design, with numerous interactable objects (those that can be moved using the Force) which however give the sensation of being there a bit at random, without being properly part of the setting. Certainly the PSP version pays duty compared to what was seen on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 for the ~global~ spectacularity, but it could not be otherwise. Nothing to say about the sound, however, which manages to involve and excite thanks to music and effects of proven quality.", "date": "2008-09-29", "grade": "7.0"}
