{"name": "Il Padrino II - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/il-padrino-ii-recensione.html", "text": "Less than a month after the last field test of the new Electronic Arts title based on the Godfather film license, we already find ourselves having to sum up the developers' effort in rendering the incredible atmospheres, charisma and violence of the masterpiece by Francis Ford Coppola. Although the first chapter has not achieved the immense success hoped for, the software house tries again and offers us an updated, enlarged and improved version of the predecessor, trying to plug some defects and update the base to give an exciting game sensation for newbies and at the same time innovative for veterans of the series, be it videogame or cinematic. Keep your friends close... but your enemies, even closer! The story narrated in Godfather II comes to life at a precise point in the film of the same name, namely the expulsion of the Corleone family from Cuba following the Castrista revolution and the deposition of the dictator Batista, so much so that the first level, little more than a sort of tutorial , will consist of escorting Michael and Fredo Corleone to the airport, crossing the city immersed in the chaos of the rebel occupation. Back in New York, the Corleones will first of all have to deal with reconquering the territory lost due to their expatriation and now in the hands of the boss Carmine Rosato, and the person in charge of this real ~reconquest~ is, needless to say, the player himself, represented from a virtual avatar named Dominic that can be customized down to the smallest detail (it is virtually possible to create one's own virtual double, even if for the article we based ourselves on a predefined model). The resumption of power will be sought both with actions on the road, directly guided by the protagonist, as well as through the ~Don's view~, or an elevated view of the city, which can be activated by pressing the ~TAB~ key, in which you can manage the aspects management of the mafia ~business~, from the number of guards to put in the activities under your control, to the number of affiliates to your family (or to those of your opponents) up to the bribes to the police, and the supply of weapons and equipment, etc. To conquer everything on which you will then have to rest your criminal empire, however, you will have to rely on the ~free~ mode of the Godfather II, easily attributable to the GTA series (or to the now classic Mafia) although with some typical prerogatives of the saga created by Eletronics Arts. This is the environment that we have chosen! The cities reconstructed in Godfather II (New York, Miami and Havana) show a good reconstruction in their typical streets, in the models, however limited, in the cars and in the numerous pedestrians that animate them, up to, of course, the shops and other businesses that will fall victim to your racketeering. In fact, to control a city, it is essential to have funds, and what better way to earn money than by extorting the unfortunate traders? The Godfather II amply justifies its ~18+~ since it will allow the player to do much more maneuverable and ~definitive~ actions than those normally seen on our screens: do you want to beat up a stripper to scare the club owner? You can do it: no one prevents you from headbutting, kneeling and slamming her head against the wall by executing certain combinations of commands, just as you are not prevented from hitting store managers with baseball bats or killing waiters in cold blood for scare employers: after all, it's just business. Furthermore, let's not talk about what it is necessary to do to scare rival gangs: in fact, it is not enough to kill their leaders with an attack or by shooting at them: it will prove necessary to discover all their secrets (through small secondary missions) and find the best way ~ impressive~ to eliminate them, in orgies of violence ranging from strangulation, to throwing them from the tenth floor of a building to even burning them alive in pizza ovens or suffocating them with a piano cable, paying attention however to one detail: if a citizen were to seeing you engaged in illegal activity may start screaming, and you will soon hear sirens approaching; needless to say, the ideal solution is to kill the unfortunate witness before he reaches a telephone. And the police? There is not. One of the first defects that are felt in Godfather II is, in fact, the scarce presence of an ~authority~ or anyone who can in any way hinder the omnipotence of the protagonist, also the fault of an artificial intelligence that stands at extremely low: based on predefined scripts, it often sees enemies who get killed without finding shelter (or who walk tens of meters at a time to reach ituncovered) who fight with bare hands against people armed with machine guns and who, in general, have an unworthy aim. This defect applies to both mafiosi and police officers, who very often will witness murders, shootings and settling scores without lifting a finger and then perhaps trigger a manhunt for a violated red light or a car theft. It should be noted that the driving model of the few models present is little more than an additional frill to quickly reach the various city locations, and that to lose any pursuer just press the pedal in a straight line, regardless of the quality of the vehicle used (and see a driving cars is not nice), also because the policemen will tend to suddenly appear in front of you rather than running after you. Our men are not here for passion, but only for money. The title includes some activities that he cannot carry out, for which he will therefore have to be entrusted to ~professionals~ to be recruited on the streets: we speak of legal and everyday actions such as explosive demolitions, breaking into safes, shooting with the accuracy of a sniper and so on. The characters, who can be hired simply by wandering around the slums of the cities, are immediately inserted into the family tree, which reveals their importance within the organization and, if necessary, they can be joined by the protagonist to solve situations that require their particular skills, such as a bank robbery to empty the accounts of enemies or destroying a door to break into a room in which they have barricaded themselves. It is also possible to entrust these gentlemen with the defense of shops or other businesses in case they are attacked by adversaries, who sooner or later will react violently to your meddling in their business. The presence of the ~soldiers~ (as they are called in the game, with a rather dubious lexical choice), as well as other minor members of the various criminal factions, makes the firefights incredibly lively and ~fought~, which will see, between followers of the Corleone, dei Rosato and any policemen to act as a third wheel, even 20 people committed to shooting themselves. Too bad for the aforementioned mediocre artificial intelligence. The Corleones were a Family, Senator! Between an extortion and a murder, a shooting and an escape, it will often be necessary to check the aforementioned ~Don's View~, a mode that at first glance may seem simply an end in itself and inserted just to lengthen longevity but which turns out to be very soon essential. Through the strategic view it will in fact be possible to place a certain number of guards in the occupied places, as well as administer the family tree by promoting, removing or replacing affiliates who died in action or turned out to be traitors, control particular buildings that act as warehouses, guaranteeing your men a continuous supply of bonuses such as bulletproof vests, armored cars, better weapons and of course send punitive expeditions to destroy enemy warehouses, perhaps before direct action by the protagonist, so that the guardians find themselves without protection or badly armed. Michael Rizzi: Go in peace and may the Lord be with you! We end this long analysis by focusing on the purely graphic aspect of the Eletronics Arts product which, perhaps due to the fact that it is intended for extremely different consoles, presents peaks of excellence together with abyss of mediocrity. On the one hand we have the protagonists, perfect, with models to scream, remarkable details and convincing animations, on the other side the side characters: grainy textures, flat, repetitive models, woody in their movements and devoid of any personality, and for the aficionados of the film saga we unfortunately have to give news that not even this time Al Pacino has given EA the rights to the treatment of his image, forcing the developers to give us a Michael Corleone only vaguely resembling the actor. We have stupendous cars, with shiny bodies and an excellent yield of the damages of accidents and shootings immersed in anonymous cities, repeated backgrounds and without personality, which of the metropolises they represent have only names and in which we have never seen the conditions vary weather. We have pyrotechnic explosions worthy of cinema, beautiful particle light effects and sparks so realistic that the player feels the shock, but at the same time we miss some ~banalities~ such as flashes and smoke from gunfire, or blood oozing from wounds (which are nonetheless represented in the models, albeit by unrealistic two-dimensional holes). The modMultiplayer ality Nowadays it is almost impossible not to take into account the love for the average user towards multiplayer challenges, and The Godfather II is no exception, introducing for the first time in the series a multiplayer mode that includes different challenges and missions. In fact, it is possible to transport one's family to the servers and then engage in furious battles with other virtual players in various ways such as destroying certain objectives within a set time, destroying a certain number of deposits before the opposing team, emptying the enemy's safes before he empties yours and finally the classic deathmatch. An online leaderboard will continuously update and families with the most points will have access to exclusive equipment in both multiplayer and single player. Furthermore, through a free patch that will be released soon, a multiplayer mode is planned to recreate the ~don's view~, in which it will be possible to have diplomatic relations with opponents, convince their best men to betray and act against their centers of power. Comment The Godfather II is comparable, on an equal footing, to the film: starting with a very solid license behind it and the hard responsibility of being worthy of it, it turned out to be such without being able to give the same satisfactions as the original masterpiece. But the film was a masterpiece, as was its continuation. No, EA's Godfather (video game) was not a masterpiece, and it follows that neither is its sequel, of the same level: it is undoubtedly a good game, thoroughly studied and which will give several hours of fun, up to but when the umpteenth violence becomes repetitive, and the umpteenth firefight will be the same as the previous ones. The uncertainties of the graphics engine and the limits of artificial intelligence strongly undermine the premises of a title that could remain in the minds of gamers for a long time but which simply ends up being a pleasant but not shocking title.Pro It's always The Godfather Extremely violent and addictive Some technical aspects are great...
