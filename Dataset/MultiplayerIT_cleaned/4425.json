An opportunity therefore for many fans to discover or rediscover what was perhaps one of the initially most underrated Final Fantasy ever by many historical fans, also due to a different combat system from the one they had been used to up to that moment . Linked to random clashes, enemies not visible on the screen and fights in any case regulated by turns, fans found themselves displaced in front of the Gambit system and a revolutionary method of party management for the series. Thanks to it, in fact, the gamer can create a series of actions and strategies for each member of the group, setting them in such a way that he then executes them in total autonomy on the battlefield. So far too far from the traditional formula compared to those who preceded him, to please everyone. Still current Over time, however, things changed, and the game was gradually re-evaluated precisely because of its peculiar nature, which became the main reason why many of its fans managed to get over its flaws and began to appreciate it more and more. Another aspect in which the title has made its own history within the saga is the character growth system, which in this remastered is based in particular, like the rest of the entire production, on the International Zodiac Job System, a PlayStation 2 edition released in the summer of 2007 on the occasion of the twentieth anniversary of the saga, and unpublished in the West. The level of the characters increases by accumulating experience points, but the level up not only increases the stats of the six heroes, but also their License Points to spend on a kind of chessboard. There are twelve different paths, each with a chessboard on which to unlock specific skills and techniques for the associated ~profession~, which allow you to almost completely customize each character: in fact, they unlock the possibility of equipping certain objects or accessories, the Espers, the Apotheosis, to wield certain weapons and to cast precise spells. To make the gaming experience more beautiful, there are the various additions, such as the possibility of accelerating the action to 2x and 4x with the simple pressure of one of the backbones of the pad (the game supports the DualShock 4) or, for the keyboard, using the F2 and F3 keys, (to return to normal speed just press F1) and thus speed up dead times. And again the Challenge Mode, which through a hundred different scenarios gives the user the opportunity to test their fighting skills, support for Steam trading cards, new game options available from the start such as New Game Plus and the New Game Minus, auto-save functions, compatibility with ultrawide 21:9 monitors and some aspects related to the technological sector. On PC it is (significantly) better From a technical point of view, Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age has been optimized, as far as possible given the nature of the production, for PC hardware, starting from the adjustable full hd resolution and the frame rate that can be set up to sixty frames per second (default is thirty). Thanks to these elements and to those already present on PlayStation 4, such as the sensitive restyling of some textures and the good lighting system, the general visual impact remains positive despite the years on the back, thanks to an absolutely superlative artistic direction that already at the time made it one of the most spectacular titles on PlayStation 2. Compared to the PlayStation 4 counterpart, it can also be tinkered with some settings by activating the anisotropic filter or acting for example on the depth of field, anti-aliasing, ambient occlusion, shadows and so on. Street. For this reason it is just slightly higher. In all cases, however, do not expect miracles because, we repeat, the starting point is always the same and sometimes certain filters paradoxically end up accentuating and underlining the paucity in terms of resolution of the bulk of the textures. By the way, it has been reported to us that some users have had some problems with the game, especially related to crashes and excessive speed, especially in movies. Well, in this sense, with the settings at the maximum and the Vsync disabled we have not had even one after several hours of play and situations. Returning to the analysis of the title, the speech regarding the audio sector is positive, which can even count on a soundtrack engraved from scratch, with the steexcerpts from the original re-performed again by composer Hitoshi Sakimoto with a live orchestra. In practice, it is possible to choose between this, or the remastered songs (and sounds) with 7.1 surround sound and high definition voices, or the original ones, as well as between the Japanese and English dubbing (with Italian subtitles).", "date": "2018-02-06", "grade": "8.5"}
