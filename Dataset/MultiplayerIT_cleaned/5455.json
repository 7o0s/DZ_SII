This time to land is the latest incarnation of the Onechanbara saga, called Z2 Chaos, originally released for PlayStation 4 in 2014 and here resumed for use by those who have so far missed this atypical action game. It is certainly not a masterpiece but, considering the uniqueness of some of its characteristics, it is worth going back to it once again... Digging beyond the taunt there is insufficient play, despite the programmers' experience History? An option These are action in which two pairs of historically antagonistic sisters Kagura and Saaya of the Vampiric dynasty and Aya and Saki, belonging to the Banefu clan, abandon their ancient rivalries to unite in an inevitable fight against evil. In the first seconds of the game we find the girls exactly where they had ended the previous chapter (released for PlayStation 3), that is to beat them with thrashing, when suddenly a fifth female figure bursts into the arena: it is Evange who, as predictably, he decided to take over the planet. A blow is enough for her to break through the floor and catapult the four of them into the castle's dungeons where a decidedly short adventure actually begins: the story mode shouldn't take more than five hours to complete. Then there is a mission mode in which you have to confront each other in single scenarios in which the enemies are present in a pre-established number: as you complete the challenges, more and more demanding ones are activated, but in the long run, even in this case, you loosen the bite. The reflections on the game structure inevitably follow the tracks traced by Lorenzo in his review for PlayStation 4: we are in the presence of a really shallow title that seems to bet everything on the procacity and succinctness of the clothes of the protagonists, constantly filmed in shots that leave little to the imagination (there is even a DLC that unlocks an outfit made from a banana and two strawberries!), unfortunately forgetting to focus attention on combat techniques that could conceivably also be valid, but which get lost along the way due to both an excessive repetitiveness of the artificial intelligence schemes and the lack of a tutorial that forces the player to find the combos in an absolutely random way. All attention on the girls The challenge focuses on the exaggerated amount of enemies to literally tear to shreds, in a compilation of mutilated limbs and bodies split in two, more than on their actual skills: the stated goal is to reach the longest sequence of shots possible, and in order to do so it is necessary to coordinate the actions of the four heroines (who can alternate in real time during the battle) creating combinations that are as spectacular as they are difficult to obtain. In addition to the standard attacks, specific to each sister, there are ~berserk~ states that can be obtained by defeating a large number of enemies and which increase the player's speed; in this mode, however, vital energy is consumed which, once it is finished, will put the girl out of action for the rest of the level, forcing her to use the survivors. Then there are the so-called Ultimate Combinations which can only be obtained by changing the character during a combo and which allow you to unleash really powerful attacks. For the rest there is very little other meat in the fire: the levels are really sad and small, with a low level of interaction and conceptually repetitive. On the other hand, the developers have spent several hours customizing the girls' outfits and hairstyles, which become available as you improve your statistics. However, it is worth spending a few words for the technical realization which not only has not been subject to restyling compared to the one seen on the Sony console in 2015, but is even afflicted by some bugs which further penalize the return of Tamsoft on computers (the first appearance is dated no less than 1996 with Battle Arena Toshinden). Speaking of graphics, unfortunately we have to note that the very low level of polygons and the poor quality of the textures, although masked by the speed of the action, make the title difficult to digest for anyone who is not satisfied with the provocative female silhouettes of the protagonists, the only subjects on which a little more care was taken, especially considering the palate tends to be more refinedto of Windows gamers. To expect a review of the engine was perhaps too optimistic, even if absolutely legitimate considering the high price at which Onechanbara is offered: however, it was a must to pay a minimum of attention to some technical aspects which unfortunately ruin the already skimpy gaming experience. In addition to some other defects corrected in the early days, to date the Japanese action still suffers from the lack of support for monitors with high refresh rates: therefore, not being able to disable V-Sync, if you try to play on a 120 or better screen still at 144 Hz you will finally be able to agree with those who believe that video games cause epilepsy. The soundtrack, typically Japanese, is of a much different thickness, the only positive touch in an otherwise sad picture, just as sad is the English localization with the voices not falling in the part of sexy warriors.", "date": "2016-06-20", "grade": "5.0"}
