And if the golden years of the Japanese giant remain a thing of the past for the moment, the nostalgia operation implemented in recent months allows us to savor a taste that is very different from what the market offers today. Not to mention the opportunity to introduce the younger ones to some pieces of history. After the revival of the two Sonic Adventures, Jet Set Radio and others, the turn of NiGHTS Into Dream has come..., a title as little known as it is bizarre, but certainly worthy of attention precisely because of its uniqueness. But how does it work? Classifying NiGHTS Into Dream... is quite difficult. At first glance it could be compared to a two-dimensional platformer, albeit rendered in a fully polygonal environment. The player is called to lead a sort of dream spirit, called Nights, through levels that we could define as infinite loops. The beginning and the end, in fact, coincide, so as to move by flying on the two axes, vertical and horizontal, trying to collect twenty ~orbs~. These spheres, once recovered and brought back to the beginning of the scheme, will unlock the current loop to activate the next one, always within the same map. After completing four of these, you are teleported to an arena to fight the end-of-level boss. The very narrow narrative background tells of two boys, Claris and Elliot, who find themselves in a colorful and imaginative dream world called Nightopia, where they will join forces with Nights. This is how you start each level by controlling one of the two boys on the ground, and then take the commands of the fluttering spirit of dreams. And we will return to the ground in case we collide with an enemy or run out of time before having collected all twenty spheres. Dreamlike gameplay The basic gameplay mechanism is basically the one described, although NiGHTS Into Dream... has the defect of not being able to explain itself. Nothing in the game will make it easier to learn what needs to be done in order to continue the adventure, forcing the player to fumble along. An old-fashioned approach that makes it even more difficult to approach an ancient and unique title. After a little practice you realize how the SEGA game does not present a real degree of challenge or difficult enemies, proposing time as the only real nemesis, which flows inexorably while we will have to juggle in flight by harmoniously rotating, going up and down, following the path of each level, trying to find the best and fastest way to the finish line. Each loop offers different elements such as trampolines to use to gain speed, circles to pass through and bad guys to dodge to accumulate high scores, chaining actions one after another. At the end of each circuit, the score obtained guarantees a vote. This system pushes the player to perfect his way of tackling each level, which thus becomes a real track, like a racing game. The comparison is a bit forced, but NiGHTS Into Dream... pushing the user to improve their times on closed circuits, trying to chain the best sequence of actions to reach the finish line faster and at the same time more harmoniously, it approaches a racing more than you can imagine. The well-tuned controls help make the gameplay perfectly enjoyable. Remastered SEGA has done a decent job of converting Sonic Team's work, offering a package full of content. From a technical point of view, it was decided to include the PlayStation 2 version released in 2008 only in Japan, updated to high definition and equipped with support for 16:9 screens, although the latter appears more like the result of a drastic zoom -in rather than an extension of the view. Rich content such as documentaries, galleries and the original version for Saturn make this edition of NiGHTS Into Dream... truly exhaustive. Although the age is clearly felt with edges and above all some really woody animations, in general the picture, thanks to the very colorful and well-kept style, is always pleasant and fluid. The sound accompaniment is excellent, graced by music that is really apt for details.", "date": "2013-01-09", "grade": "8.0"}
