{"name": "SoulWorker Anime Legends", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/soulworker-anime-legends-la-recensione.html", "text": "SoulWorker was built at the table by GameForge to leverage several elements popular with Asian audiences and anime fans in general and, as we see in this SoulWorker Anime Legends review, the mobile game also focuses on the same features, adding the ubiquity given by portable devices. A combination that could be explosive and which probably will be for those who are easily caged by the mechanism of constant progression and customization of the various fighters. Being a free-to-play MMORPG and having seen the previous ones in the series, such as SoulWorker: Anime Action on PC, we know where the developers want to go: it is about building a fairly interesting game world and above all charismatic characters, taking advantage of somewhat stereotyped but technically remarkable anime characterization and focus on these aspects to ensure a strong connection between player and character, whose constant evolution becomes an irresistible driving force and can also lead to the easy spending of money on micro-transactions. This with regard to the worst elements of the game, which on the other hand derive from the very structure of the genre on which it is based, but it must be said that SoulWorker Anime Legends is not limited to this and also offers some convincing aspects. First of all, the gameplay: although it is a fairly classic MMORPG from many points of view, the fights are fast and dynamic, with direct control over the character and an on-screen ~keyboard~ that allows immediate access to numerous skills and special techniques, in attack or defense, which allow you to trigger truly spectacular combos. Then the technical realization: despite being a game created specifically for mobile platforms, the graphic system is of remarkable workmanship, especially as regards characters and animations but there is also a considerable variety of settings, even if exploration is clearly limited . Already on these two aspects, SoulWorker Anime Legends at least stands out among the numerous similar titles, even if the distortions of its structure and free-to-play still emerge over the distance. Special fighters in a ruined world The story isn't exactly the height of originality but incorporates the classic stylistic features of post-apocalyptic anime, an excellent starting point for an MMORPG based on heroes, a world in ruins and the last hopes of a humanity on its last legs. The world of SoulWorker was shaken, fifteen years before the events narrated in the game, by the arrival of a dimensional cataclysm called ~The Void~, a sort of interdimensional channel that sucked up most of the humans and destroyed buildings and entire cities, transforming the Earth in a sort of desert of ruins and destroyed civilizations, roamed by terrible creatures from the Void itself. However, humanity survived and tried to regroup around a few small towns, besieged by darkness but able to give new hope thanks above all to the initiative of some groups of fighters. All is not lost, therefore, in particular with the advent of a new type of individuals endowed with superhuman powers, called SoulForcers, able to exploit the SoulForce, a sort of spiritual energy possessed by those who have mysteriously managed to emerge unscathed from the Void, after being sucked into it. Among these, the SoulWorkers are even more powerful beings and able to change the unfolding of events, central elements in the attempt to rebuild human civilization and, obviously, among these we also find the protagonists of the game. At the beginning of SoulWorker Anime Legends we choose our character among the six predisposed protagonists, each characterized by its own specific background but with the story that continues substantially identical for all, except for the contents of the dialogues and some specific moments of the plot in which the different motivations and links that characterize them. What most distinguishes the various heroes are the characteristics that emerge in the combat system, with a differentiation of class and style of struggle given by the different way in which they exploit the SoulForce in the form of different weapons and powers. We therefore find hand-to-hand and medium-distance fighters based on the specific weapon that characterizes them, as well as much less marked specializations on the fighting style, even if on this aspect we do not find the typical depth of the classic RPG. protagonist is an element of great importance in the game and the main push for the exploitation of micro-transactions. The strong characterization of the characters helps to create a leagueme, also considering the diversity of characters and styles with which they were built, but it is only a basis for starting the customization, which opens up to a truly impressive amount of possibilities. We are not talking only of weapons and equipment useful for combat, but also of various clothes, hairstyles and outfits, always in anime style, which stimulate players to customize the appearance of their characters and possibly to purchase the various packages between purchases in -app. Quests, fights and interface The setup is the classic MMORPG one: it's a matter of accepting the various quests proposed, going to the various requested areas and cleaning up the dungeons from the threats present or possibly saving some NPCs within different and partially explorable settings, actually inside of fairly closed sections of scenery. The level of challenge is progressive and depends on the player's experience level and therefore on the quests that can be activated on the basis of this, with more challenging and stimulating moments that emerge during the boss fights present at the end of the ~dungeons~, but all this soon tends to flatten out as soon as autoplay is activated, which becomes an inevitable consequence when the tightest grinding takes over. This option, among other things, also allows the auto-completion of the quests complete with automatic movement of the character, so to maintain the semblance of a game it is advisable not to abuse autoplay. In the heart of the action, SoulWorker Anime Legends is practically a button masher, in which we basically find ourselves launching melee attacks while paying attention to the cooldown that characterizes the various special moves, as the only tactical element present in the combat system. The character is controlled with a virtual pad on the touch screen, with a series of icons placed in the lower right corner which allow the direct activation of special moves, standard attacks and evasive and defensive maneuvers. very similar to the one seen in Lineage 2: Revolution but here everything seems more refined on mobile use, with a rather clear interface also facilitated by the clean and well-maintained graphic style. The amount of information on the screen is always very large when in menus, with text and icons necessarily small and not easy to see on smaller screens, but if nothing else in the course of the action the screen is not overly flooded with information difficult to understand and the semi-automation for upgrading and equipping weapons and armor greatly simplifies the use of the menus.", "date": "2020-07-31", "grade": "7.3"}
