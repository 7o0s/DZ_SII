{"name": "Field Commander", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/field-commander.html", "text": "Blue General! Field Commander is based on a game structure very close to that of Advance Wars; also in this case, in fact, the player is put in the role of commander of a group of units, to be managed within a strategic map to try to get the better of the challenger's troops. Everything takes place in turns, and the land is divided into a grid of squares that allows you to manage your movements; the territory itself can also be used actively, since it affects not only the mobility of one's men but also the defensive factor, increasing its coefficient in the event of an attack. For example, hiding in the middle of trees or inside a city allows you to limit the damage of enemy fire significantly compared to the same situation in the open field. Obviously the troops are divided into different types, from infantry to tanks to other four-wheelers to aircraft up to submarines and boats, each with different characteristics, attacks, strengths and weaknesses. The presence of factories allows you to build all types of units, but at the cost of a certain amount of money to be earned based on the number of cities (represented by buildings scattered on the map) under your control. All factors that contribute to increasing the strategic factor for a mechanic that broadly can be traced back to that of chess, so to speak. Too bad that at the end of the missions there is no type of evaluation, which would have allowed to give a stimulus to replayability. The various commanders then have special powers, to be unlocked via a bar that loads over time, and which allow you to enjoy effects such as upgrades of your units or penalties for your opponents. If all of this sounds familiar to you, it's because it's an almost perfect copy of the aforementioned Advance Wars; the substantial differences are in fact to be found in the surrounding elements, such as the aesthetic ones. Starting with the style adopted, which moves away profoundly from the comic style of the Intelligent Systems effort, preferring a realistic one instead. This aspect cannot be criticized a priori, but which in the specific case appears extremely bland and uninspired, unable to differentiate itself from the crowd and therefore give the game its own personality. The characters are stereotyped and not very intriguing, without particular distinctive elements; in the same way, the troops within the game are unable to break through, also due to an insufficient differentiation between them which leads on occasion to confuse them with others of the same ~class~, and the story full of clichs does not solve the situation. The graphics engine is also three-dimensional, and not 2d as in the case of the inspirers on GBA and DS. The result is appreciable above all during the first game sessions, but soon we notice defects such as for example the choice of a somewhat limited color palette, which often mixes elements of the seabed and troops. As for the fights, they don't take place in a different screen; on such occasions, in fact, the camera moves from a bird's eye view to a zoomed side view, without interruption. A pleasant choice, but which collides with the big drops in frame rates especially during explosions. Better accompanied than alone Where Field Commander shows its greatest qualities is undoubtedly in the multiplayer component, which truly represents a point of reference for the next titles of the genre to be released on the market. In local mode, the hot-swap function allows you to exchange a single console with your challenger at each turn, without necessarily having to have two PSPs. However, there is also a substantial online mode, which in turn is divided into Live Play and Transmission Mode (or Play by E-mail). The first is simply a game like all the others, while the second allows you to play ~delayed~, sending your moves to the challenger who will then have plenty of time, calmly, to finish the turn and send the results. Again to go back to chess games, do you remember challenges by mail? Well, the concept is the same. There is also a mission editor, perfect for anyone who wants to try their hand at creating custom maps. We therefore conclude with a word on the sound, rather bland with nothing more than enough music and effects. Comment Field Commander represents one of the brightest examples of how important style is within a video game. Accepting the cloning of the Advance Wars mechanics would in fact be a very simple exercise for any user to carry out, given the goodness of the mechanics that made the series one of thethe best portable console experiences ever. Unfortunately, however, the total anonymity of the artistic direction of Field Commander, both as regards the characters and the settings, considerably lowers the incentive to face the various missions present, which already cannot count on an evaluation method that opens the doors to a possible replayability. Furthermore, the 3d graphics fail to prove neither more pleasant nor more effective than the 2d of Advance Wars; the only aspect where Sony production proves superior is in the excellent multiplayer mode. In summary, Field Commander is a good strategic title, competent and appreciable, but which really lacks too much personality to be able to aspire to more than a discreet promotion. Pros Proven game mechanics Good longevity Great multiplayer Cons Personality, where are you? Unconvincing 3d graphics Too similar to Advance Wars Despite the great success that the Advance Wars series has garnered, first on Game Boy Advance and then on Nintendo DS, in reality the Intelligent Systems title has not generated that substantial series of more or less faithful clones that on the contrary would have been legitimate to expect. However, this Field Commander for PSP is placed within this semi-desert vein, a title created exclusively for the Sony laptop and which really shares several aspects with the aforementioned strategic masterpiece.
