The series was born in 1984 on the first 8-bit Famicom, or Nintendo Entertainment System, and was one of the first examples of a motocross-based video game, remaining to this day one of the most original interpretations of the sport. Probably mediating between the limits imposed by the hardware of the time and the need to make a simulation of this type fun, the solution adopted by Nintendo was undoubtedly particular: two-dimensional side-scrolling representation with lane track and, obviously, jumps to the limit of the absurd. Rather than relying on the classic racing game structure which essentially imposes overtaking on other players and being careful not to crash or go off the road, Excitebike based, and still bases today, its structure on a system of rules specially created for this game . Both in the original and in this remake we find ourselves managing simple things with a certain timing and sense of proportion: you accelerate with one key and use the turbo with the other, while the bike can move on a vertical plane by sprinting between the lanes of the track or along the axis perpendicular to the bike itself with the ability to shift weight back and forth, essentially raising and lowering the front wheel. These simple controls condense all the historical gameplay of the original and we find them verbatim, a little aged but still with the purely intuitive freshness of the 80s, in this Excitebike: World Rally. Although the structure may seem overly simplistic to the modern player, if experienced in small doses the game demonstrates its full potential for old-fashioned ready-to-wear entertainment with a substantial new introduction: the ability to play multiplayer online through Nintendo WiFi connection. As in the predecessor, there is also an editor here that allows the creation of customized paths, which can be modified piece by piece. Up, down, right, left, turbo This WiiWare version keeps intact the gameplay of the first Excitebike (also available for download on the Virtual Console) presenting it under a completely redone cosmetics: tracks and bikes are now in 3D, although still represented with a fixed shot, with contour elements that differentiate the various scenarios in a characteristic way. It is certainly clear, even from an aesthetic point of view, that we are dealing with a product built with a tight budget, but the graphic aspect proves to be functional if nothing else, although the variations in setting are ultimately few and tend to repeat themselves. As for the rest, the only adaptation made on the original structure is represented by the possibility of tilting the Wii Remote (held horizontally) to the right and left to settle the bike instead of using the d-pad, as well as the possibility of shaking it vehemently when we crash, to get back into the game. They are superficial but rather well implemented novelties, which can however be completely bypassed by choosing the classic setting of the controls, in which case the Remote is interpreted exactly like the old NES pad. The aim of the game is to reach the finish line first and in the shortest time possible, which can be done with a good dose of reflexes and attention to a few simple rules: avoid obstacles on the track by changing lanes in time (in the case of mud puddles) or rearing the bike (in the case of walls or other riders), tilting the bike so as to take advantage of the best angle when taking off a jump and adapting it to the inclination of the runway when landing and finally being careful to dose the turbo, which gives powerful acceleration but risks burning the engine if it is abused, making it necessary to periodically release the key or to cross particular sections of the track which cool the bike. The game modes include the championship, in which we find ourselves facing the various tracks in a progressive way, trying to get the best placements, the time challenge and the multiplayer. The latter allows you to play online through the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, with friends or with users drawn at random from all over the world, in a game experience that is not affected by lag and which represents a significant plus for longevity and the use of this title.", "date": "2010-02-15", "grade": "7.3"}
