{"name": "Paradise - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/paradise-recensione.html", "text": "the setting has changed, but the game formula is the same and Sokal's signature is unmistakable Welcome back Sokal! As already anticipated, the game mechanics are the same and we are always faced with a classic ~point and click~ adventure in third person with hybrid graphics, which superimposes 3D characters on pre-rendered two-dimensional backgrounds, in which the plot constitutes the driving force and is topped off with a series of mechanical puzzles and inventory-based puzzles  in terms of gameplay and interface, however, it should be noted that in many respects Paradise deviates from the model proposed by Syberia... and certainly not for the best. The most striking difference however is represented by the setting and the atmosphere of the game: the icy and boundless Nordic landscapes that we have explored in Syberia leave room for the heat and desolation of Africa, which is still an ancient continent steeped in legends where people often live in extreme conditions. Obviously, this antithesis is also reflected in the graphics: the bright and predominantly cold colors of Syberia are replaced by the warm and washed-out hues of Paradise, which offers an equally enveloping and evocative visual experience. In search of paradise lost Africa, the cradle of civilization and a land of contrasts, is a place where wild and untouched nature still reigns but where the worst of human nature also manifests itself, a continent torn apart by civil wars, genocides, persecutions... Sokal's picture of Africa is fascinating and contradictory: having grown up in colonial Belgium, as a child he was exposed to the exotic charm of the Congo and the mysterious cultures originating from the black continent, he admired and dreamed of its most unique animal and plant species than rare, devouring stories and books on the subject. Once an adult, however, he also learned about its dark side and troubled socio-political background. Paradise represents precisely this dualism, fusing his childhood fantasies with a more mature vision of reality: Sokal does not paint the usual mystical and sleepy colonial Africa, but a region torn apart by violent internal conflicts. Nonetheless, he does not give up a good dose of imagination nor even less to dream and, where man has not succeeded in establishing his own hegemony, his Africa remains an impervious land in which nature still knows how to command respect and where they hide fantastic and unknown creatures. The cartoonist continues a journey that began a long time ago and explores new boundaries, both videogame and narrative, but the subtle vein of melancholy that crossed Syberia leads to real disillusionment in Paradise (perhaps the title originally thought by the author, ~Lost Paradise~ , would have been more appropriate): in this new adventure, in fact, we will approach much more serious and much more bitter themes, such as war, violence, resignation and the inability to communicate. Sokal declares that he was inspired by the classic of English literature ~Heart of Darkness~ by Conrad and whoever has read it (who has had the strength to read it, being a rather demanding reading) will discover evident echoes in the game. In search of paradise lost Maurania is located in Africa, even if we don't know exactly where, and it is going through a serious crisis: Rodon, the local dictator, is now old and tired but is not willing to cede his kingdom to the rebels who are ravaging the region. He hopes to be able to entrust the fate of the country to his daughter, who for some strange reason is in Europe, and therefore calls her back. Unfortunately, the plane on which she travels is shot down by the revolutionaries and, after a crash landing in the desert, the young girl loses her memory and wakes up in the harem of the prince of Madargane, a northern kingdom. Here it takes the name of Ann Smith, after the author of a book she was carrying with her at the time of the crash along with a few other personal effects. Soon the civil war reaches her and, perhaps just to drive her away, the prince entrusts her with the task of bringing a mysterious leopard back to its place of origin, a leopard with a black coat like the night, ferocious and indomitable like the nature it represents. Thus Ann embarks on an eventful journey to the south, following the course of the Maur river with the war always behind her and crossing the same kingdom of Madargane, which is now falling into the hands of the rebels, the forest of the Molgraves, a strange people who lives in trees without ever setting foot on the ground, and an old mine. It will be up to us to find out if he will finally be able to reunite with his father at the end of this adventure... the picture of Africa that Sokal offers us is fascinating and contradictory Looking forthe lost paradise The creepy profile of King Rodon. The story that gives life to Paradise is quite intriguing but Sokal has made questionable narrative choices: right from the introduction we are given too few elements to get us passionate about the story and the plot limps a bit at the beginning, slow to take off until halfway through the game and takes a certain rhythm only in the closing bars. On the one hand it could be a calculated risk: intentionally keeping the player in the dark about the background of the civil war and away from the main characters until the last moment could enhance the final twists. On the other hand, the danger of losing the player's attention is increased by the lack of a game mechanic solid and challenging enough to keep him busy in the first half of the adventure and waiting for the plot to evolve. Sadly, the gameplay doesn't offer as balanced a cocktail as Syberia's, the puzzles don't always feel as seamlessly integrated, and the dialogue doesn't flow as well or even sound rambling. In summary, the emotional involvement and identification with the protagonist are rather difficult, also because the atmosphere is masterfully rendered through the graphics but is not supported by the refined narrative devices to which Sokal has accustomed us. Only the exotic setting and the unmistakable trait of the artist push us to move forward, to then reach an all in all exciting ending. Ann Smith herself does not boast the thickness of a Kate Walker: she is a less strong and more passive woman, although her situation makes her vulnerable in a hostile and unknown country, but the fact of being affected by amnesia does not justify the apathy he demonstrates in most situations. She rarely expresses her thoughts and consequently fails to make the player participate and, even when she interacts with others or makes some observations, she is certainly not sharp and ironic like our Kate. Getting attached to other characters in the game is equally unlikely, because you don't have the material time: the presence of many of them is purely instrumental and it will be enough to ingratiate yourself with them with words or with a personal favor, to then proceed further. In short, nothing to do with the colorful and original cast of Syberia. It's a real shame because, beyond the gameplay problems that we will expose later, Sokal has created a fascinating universe as always, but this time he hasn't allowed us to get to know it in depth enough. Point and click... go back and click again! The inventory It must be said that, like the story, the game mechanics tend to improve towards the end but are still plagued by non-negligible design flaws: many puzzles are trivial or incongruous and you don't understand them even after solving them, there are objects that inexplicably appear and disappear and arbitrarily triggered events that create sudden tears in the narrative fabric. But let's go in order! The approach with the game interface is traumatic, impossible not to mention it before anything else: depending on the context, directional arrows for movement, a lens for examining the active elements on the screen and spikes to interact with them, a tongs to pick up objects and a horn to start conversations. The problem is that the cursor animations are extremely slow and delay the search for hot spots on the screen, pushing the much-hated ~pixel hunting~ towards still unexplored frontiers (and we would like to point out that there is a lot of pixel hunting in the game )! Moving the pointer, it happens to see it transform two or three times without understanding where exactly the relative ~hot spots~ are and being forced to go back and beat the screen on the carpet, peppering it with clicks. If we add to this some graphic bugs and ~path-finding~ problems, for which Ann often and willingly refuses to move even in the presence of the appropriate arrows, the conclusion is that the exploration of the settings quickly becomes unnerving. the approach with the game interface is traumatic Point and click... go back and click again! The dialog interface. The inventory, accessible with the right mouse button, is no less: examining and combining objects has never been so inconvenient. Descriptions are scarce and leave much to be desired, most of the time Ann doesn't even comment on the objects she collects and we don't quite know what to do with them. Not even by combining one or more objects does one receive adequate feedback: the image in the inventory changes imperceptibly and we don't even hear a sound that confirms whether something has happened or not. The dialog engine is multiple choice and features conver optionssation in the form of keywords in a small menu displayed in the upper left corner of the screen. It is not always possible to exhaust all the topics with a character, because he may get tired or unwilling to talk to us: in this case, by choosing the questions carefully, we will be able to prolong the conversation by covering the points of interest or alternatively we will be able try to earn his trust with a gift or a treat. This system would be appreciable, except that the dialogues are sometimes affected, sounding rather disjointed and superficial. the puzzles are never too complex, once you overcome the obstacles due to the interface and to locate the hot spots on the screen Point and click... go back and click again! One of the first fiendish machines to operate in the game. Those who complained of a lack of interactivity with the game environment in Syberia are warned: in Paradise the hot spots are very few and aimed exclusively at solving puzzles. The latter are never too complex, once the obstacles due to the interface and the identification of active points on the screen have been overcome. The same goes for mechanical puzzles: if we have no idea how a machine works, it simply means that we don't have all the necessary information and, once we have it, a few attempts are enough to find the right solution. Nonetheless, the level of difficulty is inflated by Ann's chronic lack of comments and exhausting ~backtracking~, i.e. the need to continually retrace one's steps to retrieve objects or speak to certain characters, before being able to advance. We also point out the presence of some mini-games and three game sections in real time with 3D graphics, in which we will find ourselves controlling the leopard and which fortunately can be skipped by pressing the ESC key, not having a basic function in the game's economy . Overall, the adventure can be finished in 10-15 hours, depending on experience. The unmistakable touch of the artist The graphics are undoubtedly the strong point of Paradise: it is certainly not by relying on the most advanced technologies that it manages to win over the observer's eye (also because it is limited to a resolution of 800x600), but through the poetry of the images of which only an artist like Sokal is capable. We have a taste of it right from the main menu which, in addition to the buttons for selecting the usual options, sports a black leopard animated with skill and complete with a smooth and shiny coat and a respectable roar. The settings are full of details and enhanced above all by the skilful use of lights and shadows, the shots always know how to offer the player a privileged point of view and range with agility from wide panoramas to close-ups. The pre-rendered two-dimensional backdrops are splendid and embellished with a range of colors now warm and enveloping, now bruised and distressing. Graphic effects are not abundant and many scenarios are rather static: just to give an example, after Syberia, it is disappointing to observe the puddles that reflect the image of the surrounding objects and people but which do not break up in the slightest as our protagonist passes over their surface. However, the flocks of birds that cross the sky from time to time and the particle effects that reproduce the refraction of sunlight and dust are appreciable. The 3D models of the characters are not excessively detailed and their animations appear quite natural, although they suffer from some jerks and quite a few graphical bugs, in particular frequent collisions of the models with each other or with the surrounding environment. The movies, while relatively short and not always exciting, are well done. The real-time 3D graphics that take over the game sections in which the leopard is controlled, on the other hand, are certainly not up to par with the rest of the production and appear visually outdated. Please note the wealth of detail. The unmistakable touch of the artist The audio also plays a decisive role in building the very special atmosphere of this adventure: each of the four main settings has its own distinctive musical theme and we go from persuasive arabesque motifs to ambient pieces with tribal percussion. The sound effects are realistic and convincing, especially those that reproduce the sounds of nature, and we particularly admired the use of radio news to keep the player updated on the evolution of the conflict and increase the narrative tension. The Italian localization is discreet but not free from some errors and the conversations sound a bit flat at times, although it is not known whether", "date": "2006-05-25", "grade": null}
