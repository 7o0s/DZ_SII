{"name": "Street Fighter II: Champion Edition", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/street-fighter-ii-champion-edition.html", "text": "Anyone who has had the opportunity to follow the previous exploits of the Street Fighter II series on mobile terminals will undoubtedly remember the very disappointing SFII Mobile, a clumsy conversion that put a series of embarrassing limitations on the plate, starting from the presence of only one background available. Regaining the public's trust was therefore undoubtedly complicated, yet Capcom has rolled up its sleeves in an attempt to give a series of such great fame and prestige a quality mobile episode. And so Street Fighter II: Championship Edition is in fact a must-buy for lovers of fighting games, as well as undoubtedly the best exponent of the genre on the platform in question. What surprises from the first moments of the game is the fidelity of this chapter with its original equivalent; the programmers have made an enormous effort managing not only -finally- to keep all the backdrops present in the arcade, but also offering the 12 characters, the music and the moves that have distinguished one of the masterpieces of the genre. In some ways, playing SFII: CE brings with it mixed sensations between amazement and surprise; frankly it was in fact difficult to expect such a well packaged product given the bad precedents, and instead on this occasion on balance there is very little to complain about. The feeling and sensations of the cabinet have been re-proposed in the best possible way, and keeping in mind the limits of the current terminals, it is a real joy to go through the stages again one after the other, facing the usual opponents such as Balrog, Dalshim, Vega, Zangief, Blanka, just to name a few. On the terminal we used for the test, a Nokia 6290, even the speed of the action proved to be more than sufficient, albeit with some small and not too annoying slowdowns. Obviously, however, the sword of Damocles that hangs over this kind of mobile production is the control system, and also in this case a rather articulated speech must be made. It is clear that in no case could one have expected a faithful replica of the layout of the cabinet, with the 6 buttons for the attacks; aware of this, the Capcom Mobile team has tried to make up for this limit by proposing as many as 3 different control systems, with the use of the numeric keypad, with one hand or two. The latter is actually the most balanced configuration, since it delegates the movements of the character to the joystick / directional cross, entrusting the 3 button with the punch and the 6 with the kick. In case you want to simplify your life, the special moves can be performed automatically using the 7,8 and 9 keys, even if the pleasure of performing a horiuken with low, forward, punch is much greater. The fragmentation of the market and the absolute diversity between the various mobile phone models on the market do not allow us to give an evaluation of the control system that is suitable for everyone; terminals more inclined to gaming or in any case with an arrangement of buttons that goes well with this title will certainly have an advantage.
