Released a few months before the definitive version of Minecraft, in May 2011, but clearly inspired by what could be seen in over two years of public beta of the Markus Persson phenomenon, the game by Andrew Spinks, Finn Brice, Jeremy Guerrette and the their Re-Logic was initially underestimated as a blatant clone of the Mojang title that had simply had its third dimension removed. Soon, however, critics and the public had to change their minds: Terraria had its own personality and characteristics which made it, although clearly belonging to the same vein, an excellent and sensible alternative to the product that invented an entire genre, so much so that, even achieve the success of the competition, the community that has developed around it is very nourished and passionate, also thanks to constant and consistent support over time. Terraria comes to 3DS, with its sandbox excellence but also some compromises What are we crafting today? The world in which we are projected once our avatar is customized is procedurally generated, provides for a day/night cycle, a series of hostile creatures to defend against, is completely destructible, buildable and modifiable and obviously contains all those materials and means that they can be used to create furniture, weapons, building materials, potions and various medicines and so on and so forth. Just like in Minecraft, only where Minecraft is all in three dimensions, Terraria adopts the two-dimensional approach and in graphics and gameplay. This involves a whole series of peculiarities which, together with precise design choices, detach him as we said from his putative father, peculiarities that we will analyze in detail, however, not before having addressed the basics. With the precise aim of stimulating the player's creativity, a sandbox game begins with few limits and few indications: one of the main defects of the PC version of Terraria was precisely the lack of a tutorial, fortunately instead present on the console, although it is limited to only explain the basics. It doesn't even have a fixed lens. Although practically everything must pass from the phase of collecting materials (wood, stone, minerals and so on), some players could devote themselves to pure and simple exploration, some others to the construction of an increasingly large and composite dwelling to then be transformed into a village and then again in a real city, and some others still adopt a more adventurous attitude and go around dungeons and caves eliminating enemies and monstrous bosses. Creating a shelter is a necessary operation both to defend oneself from creatures that become quite aggressive at night, and to have a base in which to create more sophisticated objects, for which particular equipment is needed such as a workbench or a furnace: but can, and personally we have found great enjoyment in this, go far beyond the basic needs and develop one's home both in width and in height, and equip it with various rooms which also take care of the aesthetic component. Then nothing prevents you from creating more houses up to founding a sort of inhabited center, and all this has concrete impacts on the gameplay: sufficiently equipped houses attract different non-player characters each of whom with their own role, from the classic shopkeeper to the doctor, the transactions with which occur with a fairly complex monetary system. And coins are mainly earned by killing monsters. The main difference between Terraria and Minecraft lies precisely in the emphasis placed on the adventure and platform component, either due to a specific will of the programmers, or due to the use of 2D that lends itself well to such situations. The fact that the scenarios look like those of a 16-bit era platformer is relative, given their total modifiability; more important is the presence of real dungeons, to be discovered perhaps by following a vein of precious ore, where the most coveted rewards are hidden, but also the most ravenous creatures and the most dangerous bosses. There is no real storyline, rather a series of individual stories and objectives, although there is an interesting premise: the world is made up of different scenarios, each with its own characteristics, including two ~dark~ and one ~good~ that they tend to expand to the detriment of neutral ones. Deciding sides and intervening in this sort of battle could be yet another approachto a game that is the very epitome of the sandbox. The 3D effect There's not much to talk about since it's completely absent. All in all, an understandable choice given the graphic nature of the game: inserting 3D would perhaps have enhanced the aesthetics, however, probably contributing to fueling a certain confusion already present. Portable crafting This is basically Terraria, and the Nintendo 3DS version features almost everything from Update 1.2 on PC, plus some from 1.3 with the promise of future updates. Obviously the development team had to somehow adapt its baby to the platform and its peculiarities, and unfortunately we have to report how the changes adopted are practically all pejorative and make this version, far from being unwatchable, certainly not an alternative preferable to the PC original, the home console siblings and even the tablet editions. Let's start with the game world, which is smaller than the other iterations. It's still big and full of things to do, but that's already one less thing. Then, the graphics. Not that the Nintendo 3DS has any problems managing an engine which, although detailed and colorful, is deliberately reminiscent of the great 16-bit classics (although stereoscopy has been completely renounced and the frame rate is pegged at 30 frames per second, which becomes 60 on New Nintendo 3DS), but the small screen size makes some elements, including several hostile creatures, almost invisible, adding to the confusion in the action; and if things from this point of view improve with the XL versions of the Nintendo portable, not so the management of the interface, which obviously uses the touch screen. Selecting the various items with the stylus is easy and intuitive, but even here the small screen means that you have to scroll through the inventory, which can be very extensive, to reach the desired item, which can take some time. The touch screen is also usable for a precision mode useful for more surgical operations, and switching between modes as well takes some getting used to. All this can create a certain confusion and leave us a victim of the numerous enemies present, perhaps while carrying out a completely different operation and, for example, not having a weapon ready in hand. The online cooperative mode is also completely missing, for someone one of the main attractions of Terraria, while there is the local one, up to four players, each of whom must however be equipped with their own copy of the game. Finally, the sound, also linked to the 90s, and the good Italian translation are unchanged.", "date": "2015-12-23", "grade": "7.5"}
