{"name": "SimCity Creator - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/simcity-creator-recensione.html", "text": "Excess of zeal SimCity Creator presents itself to users with the clear intention of offering enthusiasts a sufficiently deep version of the game, and at the same time being able to place novices in a context that is easy to learn and - possibly - fun. A very valid approach from a theoretical point of view, which however has not always been applied by the EA developers in an optimal way. From a content point of view, therefore, we are faced with a full-fledged SimCity: as the better informed will know, the aim of the game is to build and administer a city starting from nothing, with the ambition of reaching to manage a rich and efficient metropolis. Objective that can be achieved by building residential, commercial and industrial areas, planning roads and railways and providing the population with adequate services (schools, hospitals, playgrounds and so on), all while always keeping an eye on the budget and other variables such as the smog rate, the morale of the inhabitants and more. On Wii, SimCity Creator has almost all the features that made the series famous, including some interesting new features. For example, the EA product is the first chapter to allow the user to create curved stretches of road, but it also offers some fun, even if impromptu, divertissement: there is therefore a section that allows you to drive an airplane using the Remote, while managing disasters (more or less natural disasters that serve the simple purpose of destroying parts of the city for the sake of doing it) is managed in real time by the movements made by the user using the two controllers. Conversely, the game has been deprived of some of the more complex nuances: one thinks of the great simplification of the financial aspect, or in general of the reduction of the workload assigned to the player as regards infrastructures (it is no longer necessary to build aqueducts , for example). All in all, a shareable choice, except that sometimes it seems to go much further. We are referring to the (in)utility of the various directors, who are paid exclusively for making tasteless jokes on topics absolutely unrelated to the context; or again to the plethora of futile messages that crowd the banner in the corner of the screen, which theoretically would serve to give information about the main problems of the city. In short, EA got a little carried away in order to make SimCity Creator less ~serious~ and closer to the elusive concept of Nintendo Difference. I don't control the controller Another criticism to be leveled at the developers concerns the control system of this SimCity Creator: the idea of using the Remote as a pointer is obviously valid, but the application in this case has several obscure points. First of all, the lack of precision of the peripheral is palpable especially when it comes to selecting a portion of land intended for construction or to build sections of road and railway. However, the scrolling of the map is the aspect that irritates the most: instead of delegating this function to the Nunchuck or to the combination of a key and the action of the motion sensor, EA has decided to leave everything to the simple movement of the pointer on the screen , with very unfortunate results. It therefore often happens that you involuntarily move the view while trying to outline a strip of asphalt, and you are forced to always keep the controller in the direction of the screen, otherwise you will start scrolling and lose the view on the section you were analyzing . Ingenuity that compromises the value of an already rather cumbersome product: to say that SimCity is always and in any case best played with a mouse and keyboard is a triviality, but this Wii version does not make the experience so much superior to that experienced with traditional controllers. Let's add to the whole a not particularly accurate technical realization and it will be evident how SimCity Creator doesn't establish new standards for the series on consoles, even if EA has in any case avoided an extreme trivialization of the original gameplay. Too bad, because the title put some good cards on the table: the Hero Buildings (monumental constructions that influence the immediate vicinity of the city with their style), a mission mode with specific objectives and an online section where you can compare your results with those of other players. Unfortunately, SimCity Creator lacks a little too much substance. Comment Despite some good outline intuitions, SimCity Creator fails to offer the revolutionary experience on Wii that seemed to promise: the control system is therefore not particularly reliable, and the structure ludica - while not excessively fleshless - denotes ingenuity and gaps on several levels. Ultimately, the EA product settles on a transitory position, which risks displeasing the fans and not offering sufficient attraction to casual gamers. Pros A couple of good ideas It's still SimCity Cons Poor control system Annoying on-screen prompts and messages Technically bland", "date": "2008-10-16", "grade": null}
