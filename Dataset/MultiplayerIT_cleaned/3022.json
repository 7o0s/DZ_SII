{"name": "Pokmon Caf Mix", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pokemon-cafe-mix-recensione.html", "text": "Virtually announced as a surprise during the first Pokmon Presents and then released just a week later for Nintendo Switch, iOS and Android, Pokmon Caf Mix is a new (almost) completely free puzzle game that remixes the match-3 formula, inspired by the dynamics already proposed in the past by titles such as Pokmon Shuffle and Pokmon Link: Battle! What immediately attracted the attention of all the fans was the colorful and adorable graphic style that made us fear for its contents and its complexity: we discovered, however, that Pokmon Caf Mix is a really pleasant little game, albeit penalized by some important ingenuity. The pokemon bar We played Pokmon Caf Mix on Switch, in the only possible mode: the portable one. The title signed Genius Sorority, in fact, can only be controlled via touch screen, therefore it is impossible to play with the Joy-Con and the console housed in the Dock. Already this detail makes us guess its mobile nature, underlined by some dynamics that are often encountered in smartphone games: the extra lives, for a maximum of five, are regenerated every thirty minutes, for example, and the only currency in all the game, the golden acorns, is spent on consumables, bonus attempts and other totally superfluous power ups. In fact, we have completed more than sixty internships without ever having to resort to a minimal form of microtransaction: we have never bought a golden acorn with our Euros, limiting ourselves to accumulating and spending those that the game gives out every time we complete an internship. It was a pebble that we had to get out of our shoe immediately, hoping to encourage those who perhaps feared a slot trap to download, given that the game is completely free. It must be said that the recharge time on lives can be annoying if you have a lot of time to devote to the game, but Pokmon Caf Mix was designed to be enjoyed in bites and pieces, also because once all the stages have been completed, it remains well little to do, except wait for the updates and challenges promised by the developer. Above all the first stages, the introductory ones, are overcome quickly, as the different mechanics of the gameplay are learned, but within a few dozen assignments we find ourselves facing sudden surges in difficulty that require some reflection and a pinch of strategy. Hire them all But how to play Pokmon Caf Mix? Our task will be to manage a club for pokmon, satisfying the requests of small customers. To prepare these delicacies we will have to complete the various stages, screens in which we will be called to achieve a certain number of objectives which include specific scores and obstacles to be destroyed. Instead of aligning the various heads of the same pokmon, we will have to connect them: once we touch one of them, we will have a few seconds to slide our finger over the adjacent ones of the same type, forming a sort of chain that will disappear once the time available for this one is over move. At this point another interesting aspect of Pokmon Caf Mix takes over: the chains that we will form and move will physically interact with the other icons on the screen, moving them according to somewhat crude laws of physics that perhaps should have been better calculated. Moving the icons, mixing them if you want, is in fact essential to reposition some of them and facilitate the achievement of some objectives. By completing the various stages, new delicacies are unlocked and with them new puzzles, focused on particular obstacles that must be tackled in a very precise way: the sugar cubes must be hit by at least three chains, the whipped cream flakes as well but these are the most annoying because they move together with the pokmon in the scheme, the tomatoes must be dropped into the baskets, the chestnuts can only be roasted and destroyed by the special powers of the pokmon that are part of the staff. In fact, by satisfying a certain number of orders, we will convince the pokmon customers to join the bar staff, after which we will be able to select them to help us in the stages with their peculiar skills: by composing a certain number of chains, we will therefore fill an indicator which will make the screen appear a special icon with which we will be able to activate the special power of our pokmon, usually a sort of ~smart bomb~ which eliminates all the icons in a given area. The progression is, in short, encouraged by the new puzzles, the progressive expansion of the bar and the recruitment of new pokmon in the staff over a hundred stages, completed which there is not much else left to do but wait for any updates from by Genius Sorority. It must be said that longevity depends a lot on skillage of the player - who can also resort to acorns to buy power-ups that make life much easier - and by his dedication to the title, although the latter becomes extremely repetitive within a few dozen stages, especially because at a certain point the developer seems to have run out of ideas, going round and round the same puzzles with some small variations that seem to be designed more to test the player's patience than his intelligence.", "date": "2020-06-29", "grade": "7.0"}
