Inevitable therefore that the announcement of this Disney Epic Mickey: The Power of Magic ignited the hopes of nostalgics to see their favorite again in an adventure worthy of its glorious past: thanks also to a deliberately allusive subtitle in its international version (Power of Illusion) and above all the involvement of a team like DreamRift, which with the excellent Monster Tale on DS had amply demonstrated its competence with the genre. In short, the road seemed paved towards an assured success. And instead... Painting between jumps Disney Epic Mickey: The Power of Magic vaguely relates to the work of Warren Spector as regards the plot. Mickey Mouse is in fact called by Oswald to Rifiutolandia - the place where forgotten characters end up - where the castle of the evil witch Mizarbel has materialized: she has kidnapped and locked up the most famous creatures of the Disney universe with the aim of absorbing their essence and return to the world of cartoons, and obviously it's up to Mickey Mouse to stop his evil plans. Armed with his magic brush, our hero will therefore have to face levels full of enemies, obstacles and some puzzles, rescuing characters from old and new animated films. These are the premises of a classic platform game, which attempts to combine the charm and atmosphere of the old Castle of Illusion with a touchy reinterpretation of the mechanics linked to the use of paint and solvent typical of Epic Mickey. Beautiful intentions that unfortunately remain so only on paper, given the significant gaps found in the DreamRift title. The biggest grumbles are caused precisely by the way in which the developers have inserted the role of paint and solvent in the game economy: in the course of his peregrinations in the various levels, the user will often find himself faced with the need to resort to the power special of Mickey, displaying on the map that occupies the lower screen the objects that can be subjected to the work of the magic brush. A touch on the desired element and you go to a screen where - stylus in hand - you have to retrace the edges of the silhouette or eliminate its content to make it appear or disappear from the game screen. It is an expedient that gets boring after a very short time, and which can even become exasperating due to the frequency with which one is forced to draw, very often even inappropriately due to questionable design choices. And it matters little that doing a good job in these situations rewards Mickey with better items, extra supplies of paint or temporary bonuses to the speed of his movements: the activity remains tedious, invasive and above all proves guilty of excessively disrupting the normal rhythm of a platformer that, taken on its own, would be anything but evil. The 3D effect Being a two-dimensional platform game, the sense of depth is not as disruptive as in the best 3D productions, on the contrary: by raising the slider to the maximum, you can appreciate a greater detachment between the game plane and the different parallax layers of the seabed, but nothing more. You can safely play by disabling the effect without fear of missing anything striking. Beautiful soulless One of the best things about Disney Epic Mickey: The Power of Magic is a proudly two-dimensional graphic creation, which perhaps does not take full advantage of the 3D effect of the console but which is a real treat for the eyes: perfectly cared for and animated sprites they move on colored backdrops full of details, inspired by the most famous cartoons of the Mickey Mouse house. Even on the sound front, the quotations abound, with orchestral themes taken from various animated films and even some covers of Castle of Illusion music that will make the most nostalgic shed a tear. The homages to the original Disney material are also linked in some way to the gameplay, given that the characters encountered by Mickey Mouse within the stages all find refuge in a fortress that acts as a glue between one level and another, and where it is possible to interact with Peter Pan, Aladdin, Donald Duck and company: by talking to most of them you can access secondary quests which often involve retracing your steps in schemes already addressed, while others (such as Uncle Scrooge) allow you to spend the tickets collected during the adventure to improve someMickey Mouse features. These are potentially interesting elements, but which seem to have been thrown into the cauldron without too much conviction for the sole purpose of pulling grist for a really narrow longevity: the title is made up of only three worlds, and the main path can be completed without problems in just a couple of hours, despite an unjustified surge in difficulty in the finale. To be honest, playing Disney Epic Mickey: The Power of Magic one gets the impression that DreamRift has not had the material time to insert all the contents it had set with due care, with obvious repercussions on the solidity of some playful nuances: the most striking example is that of the sketches, special objects that can be recalled at will through the painting mini-game which should theoretically provide valid assistance to Mickey Mouse, but which are superfluous to the point that it is easy to even forget their existence. However, the clues in this sense are many, from the total lack of inspiration for what concerns the boss fights to the redundancy of spending resources to improve the rooms of the fortress in which the characters rescued from Mizarbel reside. In short, Disney Epic Mickey: The Power of Magic is a product that is valid only in its essence as a platformer, but lacking in all those aspects that should have supported the gameplay.", "date": "2012-11-28", "grade": "6.0"}
