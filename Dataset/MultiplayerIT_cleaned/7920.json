Action spin-off of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms strategic saga based on the Romance of the Three Kingdoms written by Luo Guanzhong in the 14th century, one of the works that are part of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature, among main series, ~derivatives~ and expansions, while almost always presenting few substantial changes to the gameplay and the same game structure, this Tecmo Koei franchise continues undeterred to navigate successfully from one console generation to another, among the waves of an increasingly difficult market for the various software houses. Dynasty Warriors 7: Empires is the latest episode in chronological order to be released by the Japanese company: it, as the suffix indicates, represents the slightly more strategic variant of Dynasty Warriors 7, in which the gamer is called to relive once again turns the war of the Three Kingdoms events by playing the role of one of the many protagonists of that story. All within a single mode divided into various campaigns, each of which is related to the factions and warriors present in the title. In this sense, there are dozens and dozens of characters to choose and play: each of them has specific characteristics, just like in a role-playing game, which must be strengthened and increased over time. In fact, by fighting you learn new combos, new moves and you get new equipment, even if unfortunately using one or the other doesn't make much difference in battle, regardless of the different choreography performed, and after a few fights, aesthetics aside, you don't he no longer notices so much diversity even among warriors. One Kingdom Speaking of fighters, among other things, it should be noted that in the game there is also an editor that allows users to create customized ones, even selecting for them the animations of the weapons, the personality and physical attributes, and choosing whether to then use them from time to time in battle instead of one of the main or secondary characters, or whether to deploy them alongside them. Thanks to the Extras mode, these warriors can also be used online, perhaps engaging one of them to join three other people to create their own Kingdom, or to collaborate with another player to speed up a victory or, again, download the characters created by other users and later use them as officers and get assistance in battle. Whatever the choice made, there is only one final goal for the player to achieve, namely that of unifying all the territories of China in an attempt to create his own Dynasty, with brute force or diplomacy, perhaps by entering into a series of political and military treaties with enemy leaders. Being Dynasty Warriors 7: Empires a sort of hybrid between action and strategy, to succeed in the enterprise it is therefore not enough just to throw hands left and right, which in any case the gamer will do for most of the adventure, but you must first plan attacks , defenses and also take care of some management aspects. Each faction in the game has its own leader and various supporting officers, who can in turn cover different tasks. In the first case it is obviously necessary to practically manage an Empire, in the sense that many decisions must be taken such as which territories to conquer, which officers to send into battle, how to train one's troops and even take care of personal relationships, even sentimental ones if necessary, with certain opposite-sex officers. Let the battle begin In the role of officer, on the other hand, you can act as advisers to the chief, but without having any power of choice on the military operations to be carried out or on the areas of the map to attack. Once the tactical issues have been settled, we move on to the real action. Each leader has different weapons and characteristics from each other, and can count on allies, who together with the rest of the troops are controlled by the CPU. To further assist the leader there are particular objects to equip before the battle, which can serve to increase his potential, allowing him to increase his physical strength or to launch magical attacks, and so on. Regardless of the choice of the faction to represent, the territories to attack and the organization of the battle, the game system and gameplay therefore remain identical to all the other chapters of the series. On the field, you make your way through hundreds of opponents by slashing, charging energy for special shots, the so-called Musou, and exploiting anytemporary upgrades drawn on the ground that develop certain skills in a superhuman way (but only for a short time), such as the speed or power of attacks. The clashes turn out to be rather frenetic and lively as per tradition for the saga, thanks also to a particularly easy and immediate control system, perfect for getting to the bottom of the swarms of opponents who launch themselves against the gamer. Among other things, the large number of enemies compensates for their artificial intelligence, which, although it has been improved a bit, sometimes does not shine for logic. Playstation 3 trophies Dynasty Warriors 7: Empires features 45 Trophies: 32 Bronze, 9 Silver, 3 Gold and 1 Platinum. To obtain them, you must satisfy a series of game requests during the main adventure, such as obtaining all the useful pieces to be able to customize your own heroes created from scratch, complete one of the Empire modes or conquer a certain territory. An army to beat However, the same cannot be said for the opposing generals, decidedly tougher and more aggressive, especially at the more advanced difficulty levels, against which it is better to reserve the special moves available. By beating enemies, the red parts on the map will gradually disappear at the expense of the blue ones, until the entire territory is occupied by the men managed by the user. Everything you do in the game gives you and the characters you control experience points that affect the six key parameters that characterize each of them, namely courage, wisdom, wealth, compassion, discipline and wickedness. By increasing their level, these unlock different and more powerful and different stratagems, useful to be used later in subsequent battles according to the needs of the leader and his subordinates. Let's close this article by taking a look at the technical aspect of the product. It being understood that the visuals are not often the best due to the usual camera not always well positioned, there are some improvements here and there, especially in terms of texture, compared to Dynasty Warriors 7. Unfortunately there are some pop-ups and the appearance sometimes by nothing from the enemies, but the thing is balanced from a certain point of view by a good fluidity and an excellent overview. As always, the special attacks and mass battle scenes are spectacular, as well as the care with which the scenarios and clothes of the protagonists are recreated from a scenographic point of view. As far as audio is concerned, there are tons of soundtracks available, many of which taken from previous Dynasty Warriors games and ranging from Asian-style heavy rock rhythms to more traditionally epic ones, all together with effective battle effects and a good dub in Japanese language.", "date": "2013-04-02", "grade": "6.8"}
