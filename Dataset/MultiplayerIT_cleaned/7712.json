That was the in-between period of DOTA 2, heir to the original Defense of the Ancients, a Warcraft III MOD capable of not only earning an extraordinary success, but also giving birth to an entire genre. The MOBAs, in the last two years, you have probably heard them too much, given the exceptional success they are enjoying. Behind the acronym, which stands for Multiplayer Online Battle Arena, hides one of the most difficult and at the same time successful competitive videogame genres ever. The audience that plays them, tries them, sets them aside and then returns to them in a continuous cycle is now vast, and includes fans of MMOs, shooters and many other indiscriminately competitive genres, demonstrating how it is a transversal and above all vast phenomenon, able to set sensational online attendance records. If there is one characteristic of Valve that has always distinguished it, it is the ability of its designers to interpret the tastes and desires of the players well in advance, and to propose products that are in some way innovative. Precisely for this reason, when, during Gamescom in 2011, the developers showed DOTA 2 to the world for the first time, the reactions were divided between the enthusiasm of those who already thoroughly knew the predecessor, and the perplexities of those accustomed to more traditional products. Time proved Valve right and, despite the prolonged invitational beta phase, DOTA 2 is abundantly the most played product on the Steam platform and has already registered over 300,000 players connected simultaneously. Dota 2 is one of the most complex experiences ever, now available to anyone who dares to try it Tough foreplay For all those who are not familiar with the first DOTA, attending a match of this direct successor can be an alienating experience. Despite the vaguely fantasy setting, the heroes who clash divided into two teams seem to have no thematic link between them, the map can appear incredibly small and limited and, above all, it is difficult to find a common thread that binds the whole conceptual experience. The best way to explain DOTA 2 to a layman is to compare it to a multi-player chess game, where team dynamics inevitably add up to the skill of the individual, bringing the complexity of the whole to levels well beyond the usually average grazed by competitive video games. Nonetheless, the underlying mechanics are not, on paper, complicated at all, and see two teams of five heroes each fighting for dominance of the opposing base, on maps that include three approach corridors and neutral areas (defined jungle) in the middle. From the two specular bases, creeps are generated in regular waves, NPCs that proceed in a straight line, stopping and attacking any hostile presence in their path. The lines are also defended by towers, bastions capable of attacking hard any opposing presence that enters their range. Controlling one or more lines, thus dictating the pace of play, is the first objective of the initial stages, with the ultimate aim of gradually eroding the enemy defenses and reaching the opposing base, destroying their heart and winning the game. Although the creeps, towers and neutral creatures present in the jungle play a very important role in the game economy, the real protagonists of the game are the heroes, 102 (at least for the moment) creatures equipped with four main abilities and a passive characteristic which can be chosen freely before taking the field. One of the most difficult concepts for new players to ~digest~ is the absolutely temporary nature of the level of these heroes, which is reset with each new game, causing all players to start from the same basics every time. A concept that to some, especially those who are fond of role-playing and MMO-type mechanics, could be indigestible, but makes DOTA 2, and MOBAs in general, offer a mostly balanced experience, without obvious facilitations for those who also have a lot of time to spend on it. Furthermore, this feature has deep roots in the gameplay and drives the early stages of the game, where the main goal of each player on the field is to accumulate gold and experience as quickly as possible, while maintaining a certain balance on the map. It is precisely in these unnerving first minutes that the feature that distinguishes DOTA 2 from its main competitor, League of Legends, also emerges, namely the mechanics of ~deny~ (literally, ~negation~). The latter gives the possibility to anyonehero to eliminate a creep of his team, thus denying the experience and money to the opposing player. Although it requires considerable levels of awareness and concentration, and therefore raises the average level of difficulty of the gameplay, the deny represents a tool destined to make a game of DOTA 2 a war of tactics from the very first moments of the game, especially if we consider that the same concept can be applied to your own structures and allied heroes. Similar, yet different Having experience accumulated playing League of Legends is naturally a good starting point for all those approaching DOTA 2 for the first time. Lines, bases, towers, creeps, jungles and hero growth work basically the same, but there are nevertheless some big differences. The first, and perhaps more decisive, consists precisely in the mechanics of deny which we have already mentioned, but there are others. First of all, the map provided by DOTA 2 is one and only one, without the variants proposed by LoL and other MOBAs on the market. While Valve hasn't ruled out adding more modes in the future, the classic three-line structure is currently the only playable one. Furthermore, the ~recall~, i.e. the ability that allows all heroes to return to the base provided by League of Legends, does not exist in DOTA 2, and can only be replaced by the purchase of a teleportation scroll. To make purchases quickly in the Valve game, however, there is a way, represented by the courier, a creature that can be purchased in the main shop, which allows you to buy items and have them delivered within a few seconds. It should also be said that the scroll of teleportation allows the transfer even in the vicinity of friendly towers, resulting in an accentuated mobility for the heroes and in greater possibilities for immediate support. Notable differences are also found in the mana consumption expected by skills, much higher in DOTA 2, with the consequent need to use special attacks only when absolutely essential. LoL's Summoner's Spells also have no place in DOTA 2, as do Runes and Masteries, bringing a total leveling of players to the field, regardless of the number of games played. Another interesting aspect is the fact that in DOTA 2 the killing of a hero not only brings money into the pockets of the perpetrator, but subtracts it from the pockets of the victim, making the situation even more delicate and mortifying. Last, but not least, is the immediate availability of the entire roster of Heroes, undoubtedly destined to disorient the novice player, but capable of making DOTA 2 truly free to play, where real money it can be spent solely and exclusively on the cosmetic customizations of your heroes, with no impact on gameplay. A matter of time, and of the team Considering that each game of DOTA 2 lasts an average of 25 to 45 minutes, just trying all the heroes in turn takes far more time than the average video game offers, not to mention what it means to learn the hard way the game mechanics. An experience that, on paper, may appear titanic and scare the average player but, as often happens, it is a question of a less steep climb than the premises would suggest, especially after taking the first steps. Although the initial obstacle is undoubtedly difficult to overcome, once you learn the basic mechanics DOTA 2 is able to offer a multifaceted, deep, challenging and above all fun experience. Only recently Valve has made an effort to make the approach to new players slightly less difficult, adding a mission-structured tutorial, interspersed with videos and intended to teach the basics of gameplay. Although the dialogic and narrative outline is completely superfluous and not too suitable for the context, after all the phases of the tutorial you can actually give yourself to online matches with at least a basic awareness of the mechanics. However, the initial approach still represents a major problem for DOTA 2, and Valve still has a lot of work to do in this regard. In fact, one of the most important mechanics related to the approach of the new generation, i.e. tutoring by an expert player, is not yet available and this is objectively a pity when the game is now available. From a purely graphic point of view, DOTA 2 is by far the best of its kind, thanks to the remarkable versatility of the Source engine. In the face of an inspired design and a remarkable care of the voices and animations given to each hero, the overall graphic impact does not give up a good level of effects on more performing systemsnts, without forgetting great scalability.", "date": "2013-07-22", "grade": "9.0"}
