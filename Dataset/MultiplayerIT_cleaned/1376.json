{"name": "Deus Ex 2 : Invisible War", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/deus-ex-2-invisible-war-2.html", "text": "History Chicago, 5.15 am on a cold winter day, people lazily move through the streets, unaware of what is about to happen, of what will give rise to a war. From an alley, hidden by the darkness, a figure covered by a cloak emerges. Avoiding the robots patrolling the area, he rushes to the center of an intersection, extracts a mysterious vial and starts the catastrophe. Almost in a gesture of victory a cloud of ice shoots from his hand, freezes his body and spreads throughout the city, killing and destroying everything in its relentless path. In a few moments it is calm, the city of Chicago is destroyed and an invisible war has just begun These are the facts that are the prologue to Deus Ex Invisible War. What a character The creation of the character takes place immediately after starting a new game, already from this point some important differences emerge compared to the first Deus Ex: first of all it is possible to choose to play a woman (even if this does not change anything for the purposes of the adventure), secondly, the slightest initial characterization of the character is missing, present in the predecessor in the form of skill points to be spent between different characteristics. Continuing confidently in the game, but despite several hours of activity, no trace of statistics, skills or anything similar is noticed: character customization is almost absent, goodbye statistics, goodbye experience, goodbye character management, in DEIW the only modifiable aspects are the biomods, a series of hyper-technological ~appendices~ which we will discuss in more detail later in the article. It is certainly a choice to make the game simpler, more attractive to the public less accustomed to dealing with numbers and rules to respect. Lacking the experience points obviously one of the ~engines~ that can push the player to perform some actions rather than others is missing; in the predecessor, facing a given situation in one way rather than another allowed the player to gain more or less experience. Now failing all this, assaulting an enemy outpost by firing rockets left and right, or outflanking the adversaries by stealth, by deception or by ingenuity, will change absolutely nothing (and will bring no reward other than personal satisfaction ), and once you have reached the goal you will not be awarded any type of prize or bonus. In short, DEIW absolutely does not interfere in the player's choices, it is possible to behave as new Garret (the infamous thief of the Thief series) or as battle-hardened Duke Nukem, and this for the purposes of the game will make no difference, the only important thing is the completion of the quests. The gadgets As we have already mentioned, Alex D., the protagonist of the game, is a ~special~ boy, in fact he possesses a series of cybernetic implants that allow him to improve his physical and sensory performance. In these grafts (positioned in precise points of the body) it is possible to insert special biomods; these are particular artifacts that allow you to develop unusual skills, such as silent movement, the ability to interface with terminals and computers, the ability to control cameras and robots, tissue regeneration. Each biomod can be upgraded up to the third level, to do this the player must use the necessary modules, which must be destroyed at the end of the operation. Compared to the predecessor, there is now the possibility of modifying the previously chosen biomod, this allows you to repair too hasty choices, or sudden and previously unpredictable situations; obviously by changing characteristics, the modules spent in the previous one are lost and the level of the new one starts from scratch. The modules for enabling and upgrading the features can be found in the various game locations, and can be disseminated by legal authorities or through the black market; for each graft present on Alex's body it is possible to choose between two characteristics linked to the legal modules and one to the clandestine modules. What's even more exciting is the fact that using an illegal module could lead to malfunctions or unexpected effects, at least according to the declarations of the developers; if this is true it means that the possibility of this happening is extremely remote, as I finished the game using illegal features often and it never happenedthat you run into this type of problem... In general, although it certainly does not represent a novelty, the idea of the biomods is interesting, the only sore points are represented by the too low number of features that can be activated (three for each graft for a total of fifteen), from the relative uselessness of most of beings and from the fact already during the first hours of the game anyone can manage to bring the most important biomods to the maximum level (first of all hacking and regeneration). The interface The initial part of the game takes place inside the Tarsus Academy in Seattle, a more preparatory phase during which the player is shown how to interact with the environment, with his own inventory and with NPCs (non-playing characters). For the game interface, the developers have opted for a HUD-style structure (Head Up Display, a term adopted to indicate an interface that overlaps the player's view), which although it may appear annoying, never compromises the visibility of the field or playability, so much so that each player can decide its transparency and color through the appropriate options. This certainly original choice will make many players who love practical menus at the bottom of the screen turn up their noses, but keep in mind that the game was also developed for consoles, which forced the developers to invent an interface that was more easily manageable with a joypad. The inventory consists of a series of slots in which to put objects, weapons and so on, one part is accessible directly during the game, the other only by switching to the appropriate view. In this case, one cannot fail to notice the excessive simplicity of this important aspect of the game, fundamental characteristics such as the weight and size of the objects do not affect their portability in any way. We interact As in all first-person view games, the commands are managed through the classic mouse-keyboard combination typical of the FPS (shooter) genre, which with a few clicks allows you to complete any action. Not only is it possible to pick up any object, move and throw it, but also interact with electronic equipment such as computers or control terminals. At first glance, obviously, all this is very pleasing, also because it gives the feeling of being able to do practically anything, from munching on a snack from the vending machine to playing basketball. A fully successful aspect of the game? Unfortunately not, and in this case it is even more clear how DEIW is a game with enormous potential unfortunately only superficially exploited; it is possible to interact practically with almost every object, the problem is given by the fact that it is a pure programming exercise as the objects with which you interact are of almost no use. In the last born of the Ion Storm house, the locations are nothing more than splendid showcases full of objects, you can touch, throw, break, do almost anything you want with them except to use them for something useful (except the crates to move and on which climb to reach otherwise unreachable locations). Still speaking of interaction, it should be noted that the art of burglarizing and the forcing of electronic tools have been merged. Now the use of the appropriate tools (called multitools) is in no way linked to the character's ability (in fact, lacking experience or even the slightest statistic in this regard ...) and ~consumes~ a number of tools proportional to the difficulty of the door lock; the number of operations managed automatically by the system has also increased, any vital information, be it a name, an access code or anything else, is automatically stored and recalled when the character interacts with the recipient of that information , in this way one of the fundamental functions of the diary present in the first Deus Ex is lost. The latter is composed of three sections, one for the received quests, one for the solved ones and one for images or maps useful for solving the missions. As previously announced by the developers, the quests assigned to the protagonist force him to side with one or the other side; with rare exceptions, the rule provides that there are always two factions at war with each other, each willing to offer different equipment, money or favors compared to the other party. In itself this scheme helps to make the player feel an integral partyou of intrigue to permeate the plot. There is only one flaw in all of this: repetitiveness. Moving from one location to the next, it seems that there is a pre-established pattern that always provides for the opposition of the same factions, sometimes even with the same missions. The same impression is given by the way in which it is possible to ~physically~ reach the objective of a quest; one gets the impression of having to repeat paths that are always the same, no matter whether you are in New Cairo or Seattle, whether you are completing a mission for the Order rather than for the Omar group; whatever situation you find yourself in, know that there will always be the possibility of breaking in Rambo style, that there will always be a duct for the conditioning to pass through, that there will always be a sewer or a roof through which to reach the target. In short, there are always various ways to reach your target, it is a pity that these different paths are always similar for better or worse. It is however pleasant to note how instead, the conclusion of the missions is often multiple and well thought out, for example to liquidate an opponent one can resort to violence, cunning (perhaps by posing as an ally and convincing him to disappear from circulation), or even threats (confessing his intentions to push him to offer you more than the previous instigator). We plot Without any shadow of a doubt, talking about the plot means touching the most successful aspect of this latest birth of the Ion Storm house; DEIW from this point of view inherits all the charm of its predecessor, basing its events on intrigues between planetary factions that have the entire planet as their field of action. The atmosphere is always quite dark, sometimes nebulous, giving the player the impression of always being in the midst of something unknown but certainly bigger than him; one has the illusion of representing an important pawn in the game that will decide the fate of humanity, a pawn that knows not where and how to move, which, due to some well-studied twists, sees certainties and alliances crumbling. All this takes the form of a multiple ending, which gives the player the opportunity to side with four different factions in order to obtain a different future for all of humanity. While the multiple ending is a good idea, it is in no way affected by the player's previous choices; for example, opposing a faction for the entire duration of the game does not affect the possibility of ending the game in a favorable way for this faction, thus contradicting all the previous conduct. Despite the possibility of choosing how to solve the quests, but above all in favor of who solves the quests (which, however, loses some meaning for the reasons listed above), and despite the multiple ending, the game has a substantially linear structure, little inclined to grant the player total freedom of action. This shouldn't be surprising, after all we all know how little a strong plot marries with a Morrowind-like freedom, however the impression remains of being in settings that could allow much more interaction (just think that apart from the smugglers there are no are shops or other points in which to buy equipment), and which instead are reduced to a mass of simple ~hotspots~ on which to act to kick off the quests... Going to analyze the longevity factor there is not much to be proud of, the game is decidedly short (10, 15 hours of play at most) and has an average level of difficulty that is too simple, this mainly due to the ease with which the maximum levels can be reached in the essential biomods. Let's arm ourselves (and let's go) The weapons in the game are all part of the classic inventory that has been present for years in any FPS game (first person shooter); almost all of them have a double function, in some cases indispensable (such as the viewfinder of the ever-present sniper rifle), in others amusing (such as the typical possibility of the rocket launcher to control the fired shot at a distance), in still others totally useless (such as the supplementary gun lamp). All of them, on the other hand, can be equipped with some modifications freely selectable by the player. To do this it is necessary to obtain the appropriate modules (available between levels, as a reward for a completed mission, or purchasable on the black market), the installation of which causes the irrevocable elimination of one of the two slots provided", "date": "2004-03-05", "grade": null}
