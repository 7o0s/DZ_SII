The great strength of Spike Chunsoft games has always been that of knowing how to maintain a minimum common denominator and offer their fan base well-diversified, fun experiences with crazy situations. Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls, in addition to having a particularly long title, is also one of the lesser-known episodes because it was only released on the Sony laptop and is a spin-off of the main saga. A little over two years after its launch, Ultra Despair Girls tries to make a comeback on PlayStation 4 with a port that we have tried for you just these days. Conversions from PlayStation Vita to PlayStation 4 are never an easy affair, especially when it comes to adapting the game to a control system devoid of any touch screens at all, so we were curious to find out how the production would behave in this case. Let's go find out together. Welcome back dear Monokuma We don't want to go into too much detail of the plot to try to avoid any spoilers but the fact that this Danganrompa is placed right between Trigger Happy Havoc and Goodbye Despair makes the task particularly difficult. Just know that the title is stuffed with quotes and references and to enjoy it to the fullest it would be better to have played the two chapters just mentioned. However, in case the series isn't exactly your thing, Ultra Despair Girl could still entertain you precisely because of its plot unrelated to the main series and a completely new gameplay on balance. Thus we will find ourselves playing the role of the young Komaru Naegi (yes, she is Makoto's sister), a teenager forced to live in a room with no way out, kidnapped by who knows who. The slow monotony of the days is suddenly broken when a violent Monokuma enters the armored door ready to tear it apart, an event that kicks off an over the top story. Our innocent protagonist will have to escape from a sadistic violent game created by a gang of kids, which has thrown the whole city into panic with the aim of eliminating every single adult still alive. The crazy Toko Fukawa will also help us in this enterprise, with whom we will try to escape from the city. To get the big picture of what awaits you at this incipit you will have to add the classic situations and crazy characters of the series, elements that are intelligently mixed with a brilliant narrative, probably the high point of the entire production. Playstation 3 trophies In order to platinum Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls you will have to complete the main story, thus unlocking most of the hidden trophies, but you will also have to examine every single palm of the city in search of the most disparate collectibles, without which the coveted trophy only a distant mirage will remain. Dance teddy bear, dance! It is when it comes to getting to the heart of the game, in fact, that the first flaws begin to emerge and some of the elements that are all in all justifiable on PlayStation Vita become intolerable on PlayStation 4 due to a porting work that was really done with minimal effort. Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls is a rather classic third-person shooter with extremely slow rhythms. The movements of the two protagonists are woody and even the aiming system does not hide any important quality. It's all very classic, with you needing to eliminate hordes of crazed Monokuma as you explore every corner of the city, looking for collectibles and clues that delve deeper into the plot and characters. The staid movements of the protagonist are echoed by a pace of play that never gets maddening, leaving the player all the time in the world to aim at the Monokuma's weak points, more specifically in the left eye, which allows them to be killed instantly and charge a special shot for the next shot. In more complex situations, it is possible to call Toko to the rescue who with her scissors will start beating enemies in close combat via an extremely simplified beat em up system, where combos and supers are the masters. Thus the two protagonists alternate through five chapters that are not too demanding, for a total duration of about twenty hours, but with little replayability despite the presence of the new game plus mode devoid of any specific addition. In an attempt to give a little variety to everything, the arcade machines will then take care of it, game sections where you will have to find the best method to quickly overcome Monokuma-infested areas by exploiting the differentif skill of our weapon. In fact, Komaru is not equipped with the classic pistol but a powerful megaphone equipped with eight types of bullets. Some cause direct damage, others allow you to make the target dance by immobilizing it while still others have the function of making certain specific elements of the scenario move, so as to give greater depth to the exploration. All in all, what comes out is a pleasant product to play but still rather backward. When you miss pandas The Truth Bullets, as the different types of bullets are called, can then be upgraded together with Toko's melee skills, and it is possible to buy from some status stalls to be applied to the shots, which can be freely mixed together to obtain additional special effects. A system that rewards experimentation and gives further variety to the game system. There is even a rather basic character growth system, linked to collectible books scattered in the maze of the maps, nothing that makes you cry for a miracle for originality. Analyzing everything that accompanies the game system, one can observe an uninspired and rather linear construction of the levels, with many backtracking phases. The biggest problem in this case are the heavy and frequent uploads that the title carries with it from PlayStation Vita and which in this home edition break the pace of the game excessively. In short, from this point of view much more could have been done and even the management of the interlude scenes has not already gone completely. Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls uses some animated two-dimensional artwork to tell the story and sometimes, during in-game sessions, intersperses the action with pre-rendered scenes using the game engine, while others still use animated shorts. Choices that confuse and show a discontinuity that we really didn't appreciate.", "date": "2017-06-26", "grade": "7.0"}
