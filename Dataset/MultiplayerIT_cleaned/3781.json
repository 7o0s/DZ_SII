{"name": "Rainbow Six: Siege - Operazione Burnt Horizon", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rainbow-six-siege-operazione-burnt-horizon-recensione.html", "text": "Although the name of the new Operation suggests anything but, the horizon of the Ubisoft title has never been clearer than this. Burnt Horizon takes us to explore the wastelands of the Australian outback, in the now typical format of the new contents of the tactical shooter developed in Montral. And we want to start from there, from the Canadian city that hosted thousands of people from all over the world on the occasion of the Six Invitational, the leading event in the Siege competitive panorama, during which, for the first time, we were able to witness at the presentation of the new update, welcomed with jubilation by the many in the stands of the Place Bell. With Burnt Horizon two new Operators, Mozzie and Gridlock, go to replenish the anti-terrorism armed forces of the Rainbow team, thus bringing them to count 46 units, a remarkable number for a shooter, but still far from the approximately 100 soldiers promised on several occasions by Alexandre Remy, Brand Director of the title. While the roster continues to expand starting this season, Ubisoft makes a new u-turn: the 20 classic operators, made available for free with a change to the progress system, exactly one year ago, return to being unlockable only through credits in-game. We are not talking about large figures, since if you buy them all, starting from scratch, the cost of credits (obtainable simply by playing) is still lower than the cost of the individual DLC operators. In fact, it is the latter who benefit from a discount, thanks to the implementation of a scalable price system which sees, for example, the 8 units inserted during the course of the first year halve their cost. If we add to this the introduction of a new mode called New Recruit and reserved for players below level 50, Ubisoft's goal becomes self-evident: to make the climb less steep and more pleasant, so as to open up to new users. Not that there are any, indeed! The French giant, precisely on the occasion of the Six Invitational, ~celebrated~ the achievement of 45 million users worldwide, once again underlining the commendable work done on the title which, we recall, at the launch which took place in the now distant 2015 hadn't been a huge success. The winning formula was, without a doubt, that of the new totally free content released on a quarterly basis and able to provide new stimuli to veterans and arouse curiosity in newbies. And it is precisely because we are aware of the above that the revelation of this year's Road Map surprised us, at least for the courageous choice: Outback, the new Australian map (not to be confused with Outbreak, the timed event of Operation Chimera ), will be the first and last of this fourth year. In fact, the following three seasons will be characterized by the introduction of 6 other operators of different nationalities and units but, somewhat in line with what was shown during the third year, each of them will be characterized by the reworking of maps already present in the game (Caf Dostoevskij, Kanal and Amusement Park). The previous reworks of Club House and Hereford Base fully proved the development team right and were positively received by the community, but they still benefited from the alternation with the release of new scenarios (Villa and Fortezza). Only time, therefore, will be able to tell if not introducing new maps for such a long period can be a winning choice. Like any self-respecting DLC, Burnt Horizon is not limited to new content: changes to mechanics, buffs and nerfs to operators and various tricks cannot be missing. At the end of the two-week trial period, Ubisoft was able to collect user feedback within the Technical Server and confirmed most of the changes shown during the presentation. From the removal of the ACOG for Ash's R4-C, to the new interactions of Mute's Jammer, insiders have reviewed each operator in order to balance a game in continuous and rapid development. There are even purely aesthetic elements (including the new Elite Set for Hibana), the lifeblood of titles of this type. Burnt Horizon, in essence, presents itself as the right balance between the well-tested formulas of the tactical FPS and the innovations necessary for the rejuvenation of a title which, over time, has become the flagship of Ubisoft. Mozzie & Gridlock: best friends A little in the wake of what was the CGI short, entitled The Hammer and the Scalpel and shown in world preview during the Six Invitational, Mozzie and Gridlock were presented to the public in a different way: characterdeep characterization, mixed with lore and backstory. Never, before Burnt Horizon, have operators with such strong personalities been seen and never had they been made to interact with each other within the typical pre-release trailers. With the two members of the SASR, Ubisoft has started a new path: the aim is to make users become attached to the operators, abandoning the aseptic style that dominated the previous DLCs. Gadgets and their very essence seem to have turned what was previously shown upside down (they still come from the ~Upside Down Continent~, right?). Tori ~Gridlock~ Tallyo Fairous is without a doubt the largest female in the game, as well as the first heavy forward (Armor 3 - Speed 1) not to possess a shield. Concrete, strong and extremely serious, she carries around three metal barrels, the Trax Stingers, an enhanced version of the spikes used to stop vehicles during chases. This gadget combines in an extremely functional mix to the attackers what the barbed wire and the Gu mines of Lesion represent, however, for the defenders. Once placed, the Trax releases 19 hexagonal structures onto the floor, one every half second, covered in metal spikes. These structures are able to fill an extremely large area and greatly complicate the passage for defenders, producing noise on contact, slowing down movement and causing damage equal to 10 HP per tick. There is no real counter for these devices, the only valid move for opponents is mechanical destruction, through gunshots, melee or explosives, all actions that are noisy in themselves. Gridlock can choose between two thick primary weapons: an F90 assault rifle or an LMG M249 SAW (a more manageable version of Capito's, but with fewer shots available). For the secondary, as usual identical for the two operators, you can opt for a Super Shorty or the SDP 9mm. The Australian operator will certainly be the sworn enemy of roamers and will forcefully enter the meta of each game mode. Blocking or, at least, covering portions of the map without having to be physically present in that area is, without a doubt, an immense advantage for the attackers. Gridlock's best friend is Max ~Mozzie~ Goose, the new defender (Armor 2 - Speed 2), as well as his exact opposite. Small, restless and with a ready joke, he boasts an extremely hi-tech ability: the Parasite Launcher. As with the attacker, this gadget also inverts the rules of the game a bit, allowing defenders to use opponents' drones to their advantage. This one-of-a-kind gun can in fact fire up to three Pests: mini kamikaze bots that look like small spiders, capable of directly attacking or ambushing drones (including the one on Twitch) and hacking them once they enter contact. In combo with Mute's Jammers, the Pests become even more fearsome, but if you really don't enjoy excellent aim, you can place them on any surface, hoping that some unwary drone will find themselves entering its action area. Once in possession of an enemy drone, Mozzie is able to move it at will within the limits of the building (after 2 seconds outside, it is totally deactivated for attackers and defenders), to scan opponents and, in the case of the Twitch gadget, to use the available shakes. While it is easy for teammates to recognize a hacked drone, thanks to the luminescent white outline, the attackers are forced to pay attention to the color of the front LED, which changes from red to blue. Being technological gadgets, the Pests have counters, including the IQ Detector or Thatcher's EMP, as well as a clear screen signal when you approach one of these bots with a drone. Furthermore, by hacking the cameras, Dokkaebi is able to reuse the visual feed of the drones lost, but which still remain in control of Mozzie. The Australian defender, as regards the primary weapons, can choose between an SMG P10 RONI or a Commando 9, both valid alternatives, but with the latter having the advantage at least for the scenic animation of the reload. In these three years of Siege, players have increasingly preferred gadgets capable of acquiring information on the position and movements of their opponents, therefore it is almost obvious to hypothesize a large deployment of Pest and, more generally, of Mozzie in the near future. If used to the best of its ability, it can even become the only operator in the game to control three gifts simultaneously. Outback, the last outpost Operation Burnt Horizon opens the door to Australia's boundless red desert...or at least it gives us an overview of one of its fictitious ~entrances~, however, focusing on the last bastion before the cosmic and dusty nothingness: the new map, Outback (name used by the inhabitants of the Land of Kangaroos to indicate the hinterland) . As is evident at first glance and as suggested by Ubisoft itself, the new scenario combines the good things that have been done with two of the most loved settings by the community, Oregon and Club House. It is a medium-sized service station, divided into three sections (motel, restaurant and garage) branching out in an ~L~ shape, connected to each other by single doors and the right number of destructible walls, the strong point of the tactical shooter . In the past, the same could hardly be said, but although the map seems confusing when viewed from the outside, the various areas of the building, inside, are arranged in a precise order and thanks to the different colors it was enough very little to settle in. Although, perhaps, it is less luminous than its direct predecessor, Fortezza, it absolutely cannot be accused of the same dispersion. The arrangement of the elements capable of creating covers or shooting angles in the various rooms leans towards the perimeter walls and no longer towards the centre, leaving ample room for maneuver for the operators. Vertical destructibility is also present in almost all environments as each area of the map extends over two floors: between wooden floors and trap doors, defenders will be put to the test by opponents. References to Australian culture cannot be missing, from the easter eggs on Mr. Crocodile Dundee to the kangaroos that cross the scenery in the distance. Ultimately, the map seemed very balanced to us and we would not be surprised to see it enter the competitive pool as soon as possible. This new season of Rainbow Six | Siege has all the credentials and year 4 could not have presented itself better than this, Ubisoft has focused a lot on the title and this will certainly make the players happy.", "date": "2019-03-05", "grade": "8.5"}
