{"name": "Cuccchi", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/cuccchi-recensione-gioco-dedicato-pittore-enzo-cucchi.html", "text": "To write Cuccchi's review it was necessary to delve into the artistic current of neo-expressionism and in particular of its Italian current, the trans-avant-garde. It is a movement born in the late seventies, a period marked by the 1973 oil crisis which had put a stop to the ~economic miracle~ of the previous decades. The social and economic repercussions were reflected in pictorial art and among the major exponents emerged the figure of Enzo Cucchi, to whose works the (almost) homonymous game is dedicated. Indeed, defining it as a game tout-court would even be bold because Cuccchi wants to be of a whole journey through which to get in touch with the art of the master from Ancona, experiencing firsthand the moods, anxieties and reflections that generated his most famous paintings, including La Casa and Pip Pap. A real interactive gallery which, however, does not deprive itself of the playful aspect, even if it is just sketched out. To unlock the photos of the fifty-one works represented, it is in fact necessary to recover the eyes hidden within the seven game levels, sometimes escaping the menacing skulls which represent a recurring theme in Enzo Cucchi's painting. However, it would have been preferable to leave the possibility of eliminating this element of challenge to allow an even more relaxed and scenario-focused exploration. How Cuccchi was born There is a way to try Cuccchi, even with all the limitations of a browser, without buying it on Steam, and that is to go to the official site of the Enzo Cucchi archive which came to life a few days ago. In fact, until a few weeks ago, the painter from the Marche region did not have his own home page: a rather serious lack for an artist whose works have also been exhibited at the MOMA and the Guggenheim in New York. His son Alessandro, director of the archive, explained to have perceived the need to be present on the net during the lockdown period, in which exhibitions and meetings with the public were interrupted. The historic friendship with Andrea Valesini, creative director of Fantastico Studio, did the rest: the publisher got in touch with Julian Palacios, technically supporting him for the creation of Cuccchi. The genesis of the soundtrack is curious: deleted from its archives by the author himself, it was recovered by his friend Domiziano Maselli, collaborator of the developer. Creativity and respect for the work Enzo Cucchi's skulls become enemies in Cuccchi Julian Palacios, the Milanese programmer with South American origins (his mother is Argentine, his father Uruguayan) behind this project, had already demonstrated his ability with interactive art, receiving the Best Italian Game award a few weeks ago at the Italian Video Games Award 2021 for Promesa, an introspective walking simulator along the lines of Dear Esther or Gone Home.Cuccchi takes up the same setting of the title that preceded it, but eliminates the traditional architectural barriers to project the player into a metaphysical dimension, where to guide him towards the end of the level there are elements like the sun, the waves, even the color that invades the screen. The magnificent first level is exemplary in this sense: starting from the empty space, we find ourselves in front of three planets, each of which ideally represents a room where related works are exhibited. Thus the arch of Dollolata leads to a city where the skyscrapers move and on the outskirts of which there is a circus tent inside which you can see the ox and the donkey. Also in the other levels there is no shortage of interesting creative cues inspired by the visionary art of Cucchi and absolutely consistent with the works staged. Painting and imagination come together in Cuccchi The adoption of the first person view is ideal for navigating through the dioramas created by Palacios, especially thanks to a graphic style in pixel art that makes it similar to a mod for Wolfenstein 3D in which the Nazis give way to the characters designed by Enzo Cucchi, whether these flying donkeys, colored dogs, heads without bodies or bodies without heads. To complete the audiovisual experience contributes the excellent soundtrack by Aldo ~Skinless Lizard~ Martinoia (some of his works can be downloaded for free from Soundcloud). It's a mix of lo-fi electronic songs that bear witness to the artist's difficult adolescent period (they were written between 2008 and 2011) and that blend perfectly with Cuccchi's atmospheres, even though they weren't made ad hoc. About twenty minutes is enough to complete the game, a bit short considering also a low replayability factor, but all of high quality. An experience that is difficult to forget.", "date": "2021-08-08", "grade": "7.9"}
