A scene that may have already been seen in some film, a pity that in Planet 51 it takes place in the ~reverse~: Captain Charles ~Chuck~ Baker appears from the spaceship, who after having fixed the American flag to the alien soil, looks around and realizes account of not being on an uninhabited planet, indeed. In front of him he sees a community of creatures extremely similar to human beings, who dress and behave as if they lived in some sort of alternative 1950s. One of them, a boy named Lem, befriends the astronaut and helps him hide from the secret services in order to send him safely back to Earth. The video game based on the film, available for all consoles, is an action game that sees us control not only the young Lem, but also Captain Baker and his cute little robot, within missions of various kinds that take place in the scenarios of the splendid Planet 51. Run, alien, run! In the main game mode we can get to know Clemont and his friends, and then access a series of missions based on speed and precision. In one of them, for example, we have to work on the house-to-house delivery of newspapers, using a bicycle with an anti-gravity system. The key to successfully completing this test is to quickly identify the areas to reach from time to time, pay attention to the ~turbo~ bar and use its boost cleverly, then press the newspaper launch keys with the right timing not to miss a single delivery. Clemont sometimes has to deal with bullies and put them in their place, so there will be speed races aboard flying cars and scooters. One of the peculiarities of the game is that any successfully used vehicle then becomes available at one of the numerous ~distributors~ that can be found on the street. Moving forward with the story, the distances to cover to access new missions and new levels are increasingly large and our character must necessarily have a motorized vehicle to move. The game also features a multiplayer mode in which we can board these vehicles and challenge a friend on the streets of the city. I see green The control system of Planet 51 is of the classic type, with the left analog stick used to move the character (even if it is Captain Baker's motorized robot) and the right one to adjust the view at any time, whose management is completely free. The only non-standard setting concerns the button assigned to the key, B instead of the usual A. The latter must be pressed to use the turbo when we are on board any vehicle, with the right and left triggers acting respectively as accelerator and brake. In any case, what is most surprising about the product developed by SEGA is the technical realization, with graphics and sound at the top compared to most video games based on animated films. Planet 51 has been reproduced in an extraordinary way, with colorful landscapes and a truly enormous explorable surface. It is no coincidence that to activate the various missions we will have to go to certain areas aboard a vehicle, because going all that way on foot would take too much time! There are houses, inhabitants strolling on the sidewalks, children playing in the parks, traffic on the street... in short, an excellent job has been done to make the scenario ~alive~. Added to this is a well-made soundtrack, enhanced by an exceptional Italian dubbing whose only flaw is the almost total lack of synchronization with the movement of the characters' lips. In conclusion, Planet 51 presents itself as an excellent video game dedicated to children.", "date": "2009-12-08", "grade": null}
