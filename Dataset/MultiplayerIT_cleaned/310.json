{"name": "Splinter Cell: Double Agent - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/splinter-cell-double-agent-recensione.html", "text": "The heavy legacy The historical defects of Splinter Cell, such as some forcing in the game mechanics, the decidedly limited field of vision of the enemies, and some not too realistic reactions in their artificial intelligence, unfortunately also remained in this chapter. Compared to the past these have been partially limited, it should also be noted that by choosing the highest level of difficulty, the situation changes radically. The guards, if alerted, perform search paths different from the standard ones, and at the same time have visual fields much more sensitive to our distance and our degree of concealment. The true essence of SC: DA can therefore be found by playing in difficult mode, profoundly influencing the whole gaming experience and the tactics to be adopted to overcome the various checkpoints. After playing and replaying the various single player missions, two types of considerations can be reached. First of all, the possibility of being a double agent is undoubtedly a good choice, indeed in all probability it is the best direction that the single-player mode could take, for a general renewal. On the other hand, after finishing the game it is understood that this is only a first step in this direction, the potential that can be seen is enormous. It's not about simply having several possible paths to finish a level, in Double Agent it goes so far as to give the player the possibility to make choices that potentially change the course of the game. However, the relationship between cause and effect is superficial, some relatively important decisions do not affect the relationship of trust within the two factions as they should, but if the developers decided to continue in this perspective, things would definitely get very interesting . Between Sydney Bristow and Jack Bauer.. The cinematic and television influences abound in this fourth Splinter Cell, from the first mission which is actually a prologue to the actual game, as in the best tradition of the 007 films, to the various references during the following levels. Like the Prison Break-style escape, Sam's similarities with Jack Bauer, protagonist of 24, up to the missions in the JBA headquarters, which take up the atmosphere of Alias. Compared to the prequels, the storyline is therefore made in a better, more continuous way and also the presence of other characters, uncontrollable, with much more charisma than previously seen is a help to make the involvement stronger. One of the features of Splinter Cell have always been the various mini games, related to picking locks or deciphering codes, well in SC: DA, the number of these has been increased considerably, as well as their difficulty also thanks to the time factor, become more and more incisive. During the game we will find ourselves decrypting sudoku-style emails, hacking protected folders on PCs, assembling mines or breaking into safes and so on, always checking the stopwatch, with the uncomfortable presence of some sentinel ready to discover us shortly thereafter. The control method has remained substantially unchanged, long-time users will immediately find themselves at ease, while new recruits will have a double level of tutorials and an extremely guided first mission, which will help them master the character. Between Sydney Bristow and Jack Bauer.. Among the novelties in the gameplay, we find a new hud complete with a mini map that can be activated on the screen, which shows us the position and status of our enemies, and a timed management of missions within the JBA headquarters. This may not convince all players at first glance, but in the long run it proves to be a good way to add difficulty to the game, in fact, we often find ourselves having to redo some objectives several times even just to gain a couple of minutes, necessary to complete any counter-espionage requested by the NSA. Too few and too many, two adjectives that can be associated with two elements in Splinter Cell: Double Agent. On the one hand, the number of levels and locations available is perhaps a little too low and, to deal with this situation, their extension has been expanded compared to previous episodes, as well as there are many more roads and paths within the settings, which increase replayability within the single player mode. On the other hand, the number of gadgets at our disposal is far too high, in particular if all the secondary objectives are completed, it is possible to unlock more and more technical resources, which a fairly practical player of the series will probably never use. The style of play is in fact directly linked to the use of the various gadgetset, there are levels where one could go unarmed or without spy gadgets, managing to evade any type of surveillance. Instead we will find ourselves having an arsenal equipped with over 5 types of grenades, various modules and projectiles that can be used in the SC-20k and other lethal or not lethal gadgets, which largely remain unused if you proceed through the various levels in a totally stealth way. Multiplayer What a Passion The Ubisoft Shanghai team was the creator of the entire mulitplayer section within Splinter Cell, born with Pandora Tomorrow, evolved with Chaos Theory and its cooperative, to then be further optimized in this Double Agent. The multiplayer in Versus mode, in addition to including about a dozen maps, is in fact better balanced due to a greater differentiation between the characteristics of the Mercenary's Spy, which translates into a better satisfaction in impersonating both characters during the various modes with different objectives and game strategies, without being led towards only one of the two classes. Spies and Mercenaries have decidedly different methods of approaching missions, as well as a greater assortment of gadgets and various arsenals than in the past, which, unlike singleplayer, are vital here to win the various matches. Among the main menu modes we will find a live zone, which contains the various news on multiplayer modes, the usual fast and personalized searches for versus matches, a section dedicated to cooperative missions against cpu-managed bots and of course the access to various statistics. The cooperative mode includes team challenges against the aforementioned bots, but also individual challenges, in which you have to excel against the other spies in the game. Unfortunately there is no real campaign complete with storyline in co-op mode, it would have been the icing on the cake for an all-round multiplayer section. Multiplayer What a Passion Graphics a Go Go! Graphically, Splinter Cell: Double Agent has two noticeable flaws: some sporadic drops in frame rate, and still the old flaw of the lack of vertical sync, which on the other hand is very sensitive to the type of connection and screen used. During our test, carried out using a VGA cable, 1366x768 resolution and an HDTV panel, the tearing problem proved to be barely perceptible, but present. Having exhausted the negative sides, one can only praise the result obtained by the development team, which starting from the base of the old Unreal Engine 2.5, has brought a series of improvements and optimizations that far exceed the previous SC: Chaos Theory in the PC version High End. In particular we can be very satisfied with the various shaders used for ad hoc situations, such as the vision of the character through wet windows, the effect of rain on the viewer, the new particle effects of explosions, the reproduction of steam or some smoke. Even the lighting and related HDR effects that were seen in the third chapter have been improved, becoming the real workhorse of the SC: DA graphics engine. The animations have also been revised, Sam moves in a more natural way as well as the various interactions with doors, stairs and other objects on the scene are more realistic. The sound department is promoted on all fronts, starting from the new in-game environmental effects, up to the localization and dubbing which, although no longer featuring the collaboration of Luca Ward, always remains of excellent workmanship. Goals 360 The objectives, 38 per 1000 gamerpoints, are very varied and well associated with the various scores in reputation points they attribute once completed. In addition to the standard ones relating to overcoming the various levels in the single player and to the performance and game statistics in the multiplayer, some interesting objectives have been included depending on the way to complete the various missions of the main storyline. Cross-platform The PC version of this new Splinter Cell is virtually identical to the Xbox 360 counterpart. The major difference is located in the character control method which, if on the one hand is definitely favored in aiming accuracy thanks to the keyboard-mouse combo, on the other loses the ease of movement that is obtained thanks to the Xbox 360 pad. The graphic level depends on the type of PC configuration in question: the requirements to be able to activate all the details to the maximum are higher than in Chaos Theory, in particular for Ram and video card. Supported Dual Core CPUs and shaders 3.0. Comment Ultimately, Double Agent is one of the funniest stealth games available on the market, and probably the most compread and best done among all the episodes of Splinter Cell. The final vote is however sensitive to the main defects of the single player, already found in the previous chapters, and also survived in this debut on the next gen platform, first of all the submissive Artificial Intelligence of the CPU in the standard difficulty level. Splinter Cell: Double Agent is however a significant step forward for the whole brand, in particular for the game mechanics, which have become much richer in elements and decisions to make, so as to make this new episode an excellent title especially in terms of depth . Pros Very successful innovations introduced Good Graphic/Sound department Well balanced multiplayer Against AI not yet up to par Few scenarios available Vsync problems still present Here we are at the fourth chapter of one of the most famous series of recent years. Sam Fisher this time it's overtime, if being the best of the Third Echelon group wasn't enough, now a job as a double agent is ready for him. The Splinter Cell series has therefore reached its halfway point, a series of events lead our NSA agent to face new tasks, new situations and having to balance every decision in order not to compromise his position in the agency or that at the inside the terrorist group called JBA. Each mission, each primary or secondary objective completed, causes a change in these two reputation indicators. While we need to keep our cover credible in order to infiltrate the heart of the JBA, the trust of the NSA cannot be undermined by committing crimes around the world. For each stage we will therefore have JBA missions and NSA counter-missions, sometimes unrelated to each other, sometimes so linked as to lead Sam to make some important choices, such as deciding between the life or death of certain characters, which significantly influence the our reputation by guiding us towards one of three different endings, poised between good and evil.", "date": "2006-10-27", "grade": null}
