{"name": "Necronomicon", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/necronomicon.html", "text": "Are you ready to enter the underworld? Necronomicon, as you know, is also a word often connected to magical or rather satanic rites. In the adventure we will have to wander in search of the smallest information that will allow us to shed light on an increasingly obscure affair. The adventure will be totally in 1st person. You will take on the role of William H. Stanton around the end of the 1700s. It will all start after the visit of your closest friend who will give you a somewhat mysterious pyramid object. From here the first questions will arise that will lead the protagonist to experience an adventure between two worlds with the sole aim of finding a mysterious character who seems to have something to do with some esoteric formulas. Point and click, PC style Immediately from the first screens you will notice that the game seems more suitable for a PC platform than for a console; this is no coincidence. The title is the sequel to a game born on PC a long time ago that has enjoyed considerable success and for this reason it was decided to bring the title to the more demanding and profitable world of consoles. The result is partly good, but it is logical that a few small problems remain from a PC-style transposition: first of all the control system. Like all investigation games, your task will be to talk to each person you meet, collecting useful information for the continuation of the game and to analyze the backgrounds in search of some strange object that will prove useful later. This is certainly not a novelty but, years after the introduction of this style of play, it still manages to fascinate many gamers who want to escape from frenetic games where you act on the spot without thinking. Sharpen your vision! Also from a graphic point of view, the title demonstrates discrete potential which, however, is achieved through a small stratagem which I will now illustrate to you. The game is based on images, or rather two-dimensional backgrounds, without any moving elements. This allows you to place all the graphics on the same level and to give more weight to the details. These screenshots are interspersed with well-crafted CG videos that will clarify the tangled story a little better. It would seem an excellent ruse, on the contrary, all this affects some aspects that make the title very unattractive and even a little boring. One of them is meeting other characters. People will be totally still and will come alive (via video) as soon as you click on them. This is a bit disarming because without moving elements and without a good soundtrack you feel lonely even if you are in a village teeming with inhabitants. Noise of silence! The paradox of the title fully explains the type of soundtrack. The sound is very little present during the adventure and more than a soundtrack we can speak of the normal noise of the wind and the sea, however well done. Instead, the videos and screenshots translated entirely into Italian are to be appreciated. Even the dialogues are dubbed discreetly and this allows a greater involvement of the player during the adventure. Has the mystery been revealed? In conclusion I consider Necronomicon a decent title. Well done for what it wants to give to the public but sometimes a little boring due to excessive longevity and monotony in the game structures, which could lead you to turn everything off if you are not a fan of the genre. Recommended for those who want to think more than act in the crazy world of video games. Pros: Well-crafted atmosphere Discreet graphics Well translated Very long-lived Cons: Almost non-existent sound It can be a bit boring Too long-lived From book to videogame Necronomicon, in addition to being a recently released video game, is a book that has achieved considerable success due to the particular way in which it dealt with a very complex subject. Now we can live these adventures with the joypad in hand instead of the bookmark, we'll see if it will be good or bad. One of the most difficult characteristics to leave unchanged compared to paper works is certainly the atmosphere. A book read by a mature person in the dim light of the bedside table certainly cannot provide the same emotions as a video game created for recreational purposes for children. Despite everything, the result seems to be appreciable and, even if a little far from the book of the same name, it proves to have something more.", "date": "2002-02-23", "grade": null}
