{"name": "Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/harvest-moon-friends-of-mineral-town-2.html", "text": "Don't let the farmer know... This is the simple but effective premise behind the new episode of the Harvest Moon series, very famous in Japan and also active in North America for some years; however, we had to wait for 2004 and the two contemporary versions GameCube and Game Boy Advance for a European publisher (in this case the forward-looking Ubisoft) to take an interest in the subject and assume the honor and burden of official distribution. Unlike the GameCube version recently examined on these same pages, the GBA episode remains very firmly anchored to the previous iterations of the saga by graphically recalling the 16-bit episodes and for the rest by recycling and almost never developing completely new concepts; not that this is a bad thing, mind you, because if our almond-eyed friends like this series so much, there must be a reason! Suddenly jolted from urban to peasant reality, our hero finds himself having to deal with the problems, far more prosaic than we are usually used to seeing in a video game, of a factor from the charming town of Mineral Town, and here we come to the key point of the discussion: what is Harvest Moon? Difficult to classify it in a well-defined genre: the mechanics are those of a classic JRPG with a bird's eye view, but unlike the semi-totality of the titles of the genre, here there is no precise and immediately recognizable final objective, there is no a journey to undertake and a path already established for you to follow, while characteristics of the genre are, precisely, the view and the interface, as well as the interaction with NPCs, the scripts and, even if little, the exploration. Then there are managerial elements, because in the end a good model farmer is expected to be able to keep the accounts of his agricultural enterprise in order, but they are extremely immediate and simplified so you do not expect to find yourself in front of a kind of Sim Farm with tons of screenshots to examine carefully. You will be able to realize for yourself, if you want to play, the ~non-genre~ to which Harvest Moon belongs, dedicating yourselves to the dozens of activities that farm life imposes on you: first of all you will have to cultivate the land, which means buying seeds in the city, preparing the land, plow it well, sow and water it every day; you will then soon have to get yourself some animals, hens, cows and sheep, and devote yourself to their daily care if you want to enjoy the products that these nice little creatures can give you. Even dogs and horses, although they do not give you immediately expendable benefits, must be looked after constantly, on pain of disaffection. Furthermore, in the surroundings of your farm, there are excellent places to fish and to engage in the extraction of minerals (we are in Mineral Town, after all), activities to which you can indulge without problems. Obviously keeping alive the farm of the kind old man who gave it to you is a beautiful thing but it does not provide us with the filling, and here, in the evening, you will be able to enjoy the fruits, read hard cash, of your hard work; and what do you need the coin for? To many things: first of all, many nice people live in Mineral Town and there is a fair number of commercial activities; just as in real life money will facilitate your relationship life by allowing you to give gifts left and right, and will satisfy your hedonistic impulses by allowing you to surround yourself with superfluous but elegant objects. With the money you will be able to buy food to support yourself (you are not robots and you cannot work indefinitely, but generally a stop at the spa, free, is enough to refresh your spirit and body), and above all expand your business and life in various ways. your farm, to produce and earn more and more and essentially obtain the monopoly of the fruit and vegetable market. Or at any rate, and it's not a bad goal, to be able to dedicate yourselves to the conquest of one of the beautiful girls who live in Mineral Town and who were immediately struck by your interesting presence: as usual, marriage is perhaps the only goal that Harvest Moon, but not so explicitly for quite a while, poses to the player. The inexorable flow of time Or, if you want, you can decide to do nothing, let the farm go to hell and devote yourself to the most senseless waste of time and an end in itself. You are free and the game does not punish, if not indirectly, those who decide to take this path; but you will understand by yourself that spending the days in this way would be rather boring... The days, exactly, because Harvest Moon thinks in a four-dimensional way: in a year there are four months, each of which corresponds to a season; a month, in turn, is made ofthirty days. The course of the seasons influences the type of crops you can grow, as well as, obviously, the atmospheric conditions and consequently the health and fatigue of your alter ego: working under the scorching summer sun is much more tiring than doing it with the pleasant spring breeze that caresses the tanned skin... Furthermore, the quiet and monotonous flow of life in Mineral Town is occasionally interrupted, on set days, by parties and celebrations, the ideal occasion to deepen your knowledge with the girl of your dreams, and from competitions of various kinds, in which you can participate or limit yourself to assisting. In terms of breaking the monotony of country life, some amusing sub-games to which you will have access through your faithful big dog or even by ingratiating yourself with some nice sprites who live north of the village are not to be underestimated. As the days go by, the lives of your fellow citizens also go on, equipped with simple but entertaining scripts and stories when you decide to get involved. Time passes only when you're outside - it gets stuck in buildings and caves - and it does it even too quickly, so much so that at the beginning, especially if you are unfamiliar with the series, you will find the comparison between the many things to to do and the very little time to do them, which among other things contrasts with the idea of a calm and reflective game that one could play with Harvest Moon. This defect, which moreover makes itself felt only when the experience with the game is little, is the only one of a certain substance that can be attributed to Friends of Mineral Town. In the particular perspective that the game offers, everything is done well and even the technical department defends itself: certainly not jaw-dropping graphics, but functional, nice and well-designed, especially the characters who show off a now mandatory ~rendered-like~ look for productions of this kind on GBA, and the same bad habit on the sound front, a few pieces of music but all very catchy, and which among other things help, by out of tune here and there, to deduce the physical conditions of our country hero. Special mention for some environmental effects, first of all the one, really well done, of the rain. Final little note: the tons and tons of text in the game have remained in the language of the perfidious Albion and the more hands-on States; the manual is in Italian, but we doubt that from its four (4) pages you will be able to understand anything. Comprehensive tutorials and explanations are all in the game, and if you're not strong with English maybe it's time to get serious about that grammar text... Comment When notes of substantial importance cannot be moved to a game, and on the contrary many praises must be reserved, it is probable that we are dealing with a great classic. It would also be the same for Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town, were it not for the fact that such a sui generis game inevitably will not meet with everyone's favor. Here we are far from what are almost the undisputed foundations of the video game industry, and if you ask a video game for action, action and still a pinch of action, and/or a very specific final goal to be achieved at all costs, perhaps scoring fabulous script developments along the way, then Harvest Moon, all Harvest Moons, is not for you. Here the knowledge you have of yourself as gamers is tested; if you have never had the opportunity to approach the series, its European debut could not be a better occasion, but if the simultaneous release of the home and portable versions leaves you a little perplexed, know that Friends of Mineral Town is an excellent episode ~classic~, where A Wonderful Life is the bearer of a not indifferent innovative charge. The choice is yours: then it ends up that you buy them both ... Pros: Substantial absence of defects Excellent representative of the series Cons: For many, but not for all Maybe you don't remember it, but when you were little, during a trip with your parents, you were irreparably attracted to a farm nearby, you entered and without too many compliments you started playing with the critters of the house; luckily for you, the elderly owner was a person with a big heart and so, far from leaving you with the faithful pusher, he was on the contrary very happy to be able to spend a few carefree hours with a lively and intelligent little boy like you were in those days and with your parents. So pleased that now that he's gone, he's bequeathed the whole farm to you!", "date": "2004-05-04", "grade": null}
