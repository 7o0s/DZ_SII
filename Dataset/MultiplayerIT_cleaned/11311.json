{"name": "Beijing 2008 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/beijing-2008-recensione.html", "text": "The typical media ambaradan that accompanies the Olympic Games every four years obviously also includes the world of video games. For decades now, punctually, the digital counterpart of the Olympics has faced the videogame market, accompanying technological progress with a constantly evolving aspect. Strange thing: every four years, the Olympic simulations should be paradigmatic of the technical changes that characterize the computer world, touching a different generation platform every two editions, on average, yet their link with the common Track and Field matrix remains undeniable . Sure, the graphics change and the sound as well, but it's curious to see how the game dynamics, in many respects, are practically the same as the classic Konami from twenty years ago. On the other hand, we agree, it is not easy to schematize athletic disciplines in convincing interfaces, in order to create real simulations. The solution remained to bet everything on timing, resistance or precision of movements, in this way, effectively, approaching the founding principles of these sports disciplines. Beijing 2008 happens right in the middle of the new generation of consoles, a moment in which the potential of the machines is well exploited, and the diffusion of platforms can ensure ample margins of success, yet the feeling remains the same characteristic of previous productions of the same type. Produced by Sega and developed by Eurocom, Beijing 2008 builds on the legacy of the previous edition of the Olympics - again by the same team - perfecting the typical dynamics of the genre and focusing on the richness of the contents. Unfortunately, the new additions are just one of the least convincing aspects of the product. Track, field or gym? The most striking aspect, at the beginning of the game, is the quantity of disciplines inserted by Eurocom. Divided into various categories (track, field, indoor and more) there are 38 specialties that can be selected in 10 different sports, a decidedly impressive number. The modes include training, single performances in a chosen discipline, the actual Olympics or multiplayer games (online or locally), with which it is possible to perform against human opponents in each specialty (option that represents then, generally, the strong point of this type of game). The main option, the one that re-proposes the path of the Olympic Games, is structured with a minimum of management framework: in fact, we will have to take possession of an entire team of athletes, selecting their nation of origin, and with it gradually try to qualify for the various rounds of competition, obviously up to trying to win medals. There are parameters to adjust at the beginning of the game with the distribution of some bonus points: accuracy, resistance, power, agility, speed, ~slow motion~ and ~extended slow motion~ (the latter two refer to the possibility of controlling with moments that require more precise timing, such as the start of a race). By collecting positive results in the various tests, we receive points in exchange which can again be distributed to increase the statistics, or to decrease the level of fatigue that progressively affects the team. The Olympics are divided into various days, in each of which we will have to perform in a series of disciplines, according to the calendar of the games. There are minimum requirements necessary to continue, which will gradually increase: in the first rounds it will be enough to qualify in one of the proposed disciplines, but soon we will have to try to get more, or Game Over will force us to leave Beijing for early summer holidays. Stress tests Once out on the track (or in the pool, or in the gym), we find the familiar atmosphere of this kind of game, and we realize that, apart from the new graphics, little substantially has changed since the days of Track and Field and of Epyx sports simulations: in most cases, the challenges are competitions of nerves and speed, to be violently downloaded onto the controller. For example, running (in its various specialties) is carried out by pressing two keys alternately as quickly as possible or, optionally, by shaking the analog stick along the right-left axis. Speed and stamina are the key to winning, and in this indeed lies the analogy between video game simulation and real sport. Eurocom has embellished the historical dynamics a bit with the introduction of new steps and movements to be performed, for example, the start in speed races is regulated by pressing an analog trigger, trying to fill a bar in the momentexactly when the pistol signals departure. If we reach the limit before the time, we commit a false start, if we wait too long, we will start late. Similarly, the various disciplines of throwing, jumping, swimming, etc. they require a whole series of different movements and various keystrokes, to be carried out with the most precise timing and speed of execution to obtain the best result. Throws require a period of ~loading~ (running phase, or rotations of the body) before unloading, to be carried out by controlling the launch angle, jumps also have the first run-up chin (with associated control) followed by various commands to be carried out in the right amount of time, up to the most particular disciplines, such as Table Tennis or Judo, which are based on ad hoc designed interfaces, but always in this line of thought based on the pre-set sequence to be performed in the best of ways. There is certainly no lack of variety, given the amount of different sports, but schematizing the actions required of the player are not many, ranging from wild button mashing to rhythmic movement or the correct execution of movement sequences. It should be noted, as regards the assimilation of the commands, that the guide that can be consulted before each performance often fails to be exhaustive, also given the complexity of some sports, forcing the player to learn the various disciplines more from their mistakes than from the tutorial . Faster, higher, stronger? Four years after the last version of the Olympics, the generational leap is certainly noticeable, in this Beijing 2008, however if compared with the current quality of sports video games, one thinks that something more, on the part of the developers, was legitimate to expect . The quality of the animations is rather convincing, despite the fact that there is no realistic variety between the executions of the various athletes, while the graphics of the scenarios are at good levels, although they lack a bit of spectacularity (the shots, for example, are very concentrated on the athlete showing little of the surrounding space). The polygonal models are well proportioned but, also in this case, they lack variety, all looking a bit alike, and certain graphic effects that other sports simulations have accustomed us to are absent, such as realistic textures for the skin, high-level dynamic shading and sweat. Ultimately, it is a decent job, but which certainly does not represent one of the peaks touched by the new generation platforms. The sound accompaniment falls within the standard levels of a simulation of this type, even if the commentator in Italian certainly does not stand out for the enthusiasm he instills in the commentary. There are, to the detriment of the continuity of the game, loading times that are really too long in the transitions between one sport and another, which tend to break the rhythm and tire, especially in the ~Olympics~ mode. The large number of sports specialties available is certainly a strong point of the product, but the artificial and complex interface, which particularly characterizes the new introductions (in particular Table Tennis, Judo, Canoe, Free Body and Clay Pigeon Shooting) it mortifies the gaming experience, leading the user to necessarily prefer the classics of this genre: the track and ~outdoor~ disciplines. Comment The official video games of the Olympics clearly leverage the enthusiasm of the whole world for a sporting event of this importance, and the favor they enjoy with the public has a purely ~seasonal~, emotional character, which ends in largely with the end of the sporting event. It's perfectly normal, just as it's normal to expect few changes in a game structure that has been practically identical for about twenty years now. If we analyze the actual game phase, in fact, we realize that fun, in its component that derives from a cerebral and sensory stimulation given by the video game, is difficult to find in this Beijing. What leads to stress joints and controllers with a game like this is to be found elsewhere: in competitive competition, largely, a mechanism that is still valid today, from the time of ~Sporting Gold from Epyx~, and this is demonstrated by the fact that the most appreciable disciplines are still the classical ones, which are repeated unchanged over the years, to the detriment of the new (questionable) introductions. But it is an ephemeral passion, destined to run out with the closure of the Games.Pros Large number of disciplines Various modalities, including a good Olympics Olympic atmosphere guaranteed Cons Always the same button mashing structure Techniquesly mediocre The new disciplines are not very convincing Xbox 360 - Goals Beijing 2008 contains 50 unlockable achievements for a total of 1000 points. Obviously, its structure naturally tends to integrate with the achievement system: many of these are obtained by reaching particular records in the various disciplines, overlapping perfectly with the tendency to improve the score that is obvious in such a game. Others are connected to the results achieved in multiplayer games, still others are obtained by continuing in the Olympic mode. In general, for a digital Olympics enthusiast, collecting all the achievements will be a moral imperative.", "date": "2008-07-07", "grade": null}
