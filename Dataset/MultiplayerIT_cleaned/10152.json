{"name": "Babel Rising", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/75262-babel-rising-questa-torre-non-sha-da-fare.html", "text": "Thus we learn from the Bible (Genesis: 11,1-9) which tells us the story of the man who decided to build a tower so high as to reach God. Then the peoples of the earth spoke only one language, at least until the Most High and Almighty decided that it was the case to prevent man from achieving his purpose; and so he destroyed the tower, dispersing the populations and confusing their language. It is said that it was then that the foundations were laid for the birth of the different nations of the earth and that man stopped understanding his own brothers. In reality there are many interpretations of the episode narrated by Genesis as well as the historical conflicts noted by some, but it is not on the exegesis of Babel that we want to focus in this review, but on God's wrath against the builders of the tower. Above all because it is precisely in your shoes that we find ourselves playing in this hit and run title for iPhone/iPod Touch by White Birds Production. When we talk about ~God Game~ it is impossible for us not to go back in memory to that Populous of the now distant 1989, developed by a young Peter Molyneux for Bullfrog. Since then we have come a long way and there have been many titles that have been inspired by the Populous system, up to presenting us with this Babel Rising of today which once again makes us play as a God who controls his creatures from above by intervening on them with its devastating powers. The dynamics of the game are immediately very elementary and immediate: it is simply a matter of unleashing our divine powers to stop the hordes of men trying to build their own tower of Babel. No smokescreens? At least the life preserver... To achieve our divine (and slightly diabolical) purpose, we have six devastating powers at our disposal that we can unleash by tracing the appropriate commands on the screen with our fingers. While hordes of homunculi will flock with their load of bricks to pull up, one floor after another, the tower that threatens our position as the only God, we will have to try to coordinate the power of the elements that can be unleashed with the reload time necessary because we can go back to using them. The cheapest power in terms of recharging is the one unleashed by simply ~tapping~ the screen over the marching men and literally crushing them under our finger. Depending on the charge notches of the power we will be able to stop one or a little more. The second power, in order of effectiveness and recharge time, is the famous divine lightning. To launch it we will have to draw a vertical line on the screen: the point where it will end will mark the arrival point of the lightning that will fry all the men it falls on. Then there is a typhoon, triggered by swiping a finger horizontally across the screen, a tsunami that will sweep away the little men when we draw a new horizontal line, but this time with the swipe of two fingers. A firestorm can be launched with two vertical lines and finally the devastating earthquake that will be triggered by shaking our device. There's one final terrifying power that we can consider an extra of apocalyptic proportions: the divine eye. One wink of God's gaze and all the little men will be pulverized and with them one floor of the tower they built will end up in crumbs. Unstoppable termite mound And the game is essentially all here: throw our devastating powers on the men to prevent them from reaching the sky. A minimum of game strategy is required to better manage the skills and their recharge times to cope with the hordes of men who swarm on our screen like termites, ever more numerous, until we find ourselves entangled in an absolutely frenetic gameplay in the desperate attempt to prevent him from ascending. A single survival scheme, characterized by very nice cartoonish graphics and an equally pleasant soundtrack but both marked by the simple and limited monotony of a single level and a dynamic that never changes. A series of unlockable trophies makes the challenge a little longer, but there is no doubt that we are dealing with a product that is valid only for small breaks to be occupied with a little entertainment made up of minutes at the end of which all that remains is to put away our pocket God , at least until the next five minutes that we don't know how to commit. The possibility of recording our scores on a leaderboard and publishing them online surrounds a minimal product that would have greatly increased its value if it had some levels to face in support, which would make the gameplay less monotonous.
