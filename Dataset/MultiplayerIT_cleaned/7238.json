Born a couple of years ago as a simple prototype in Flash, in fact, the game has received such positive feedback as to convince the developer to take up the concept, enrich it and re-propose it in a complete and salable form on PC, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita. Curiously (and unfortunately), Luftrausers also shares with the titles already mentioned the fact of having been cloned even before its release, but luckily the umpteenth setback for the Dutch team has slowed down but not compromised the work on the game, published in past and already guilty of thousands of worn fingertips and curses thrown across the skies of an infernal battle between planes and ships. Frantic, fast and violent, Luftrausers catapult into unforgettable battles between ships and planes You wanted the plane... Upon starting the game you are greeted by a calm, quiet environment, almost peaceful if it weren't for the huge submarine in the center of the screen. Once they take off, however, Luftrausers takes just a few seconds to pulverize that initial fake tranquility and put the player under pressure, bombarding him with a hail of bullets and hammering him with pressing electronic music. In an effort to survive as long as possible against an endless wave of battleships and planes, in this 2D shooter it's you against everyone else. Against enemy fighters and battleships, of course, but also against the inertia of your aircraft and the force of gravity that dangerously draws you towards the ocean. There is something in the way the player can move forward, rotate the plane and fire that may be distantly reminiscent of good old Asteroids, although having enemies return fire while being pushed down constantly makes the experience not only original, but decidedly more impetuous and pressing. Like Vlambeer's other games, Luftrausers does few things but does them well, hiding a pinch of strategy behind the apparent simplicity of the gameplay. An example is the player's energy that recharges while not shooting, a design idea already present in the original prototype but here deepened and refined: in this way a continuous tug-of-war is created, with the pilot having to alternating bursts of fire with moments of pause, retreating to a less crowded area to recharge, or risking everything, not caring about your running out of health and continuing to make your way through a hail of bullets. Since a health bar or some other type of traditional indicator would have risked distracting the player's gaze, the authors instead opted for a circle that narrows towards your aircraft as you take damage, such an elegant solution immediate, which allows you to keep your eyes constantly on the middle of the action while knowing at any moment when things are going wrong. To keep the pace up and make the experience even more feverish, a second and important design element takes care of it: the combo multiplier grows with each kill and resets if no enemy is eliminated within a certain number of seconds. It is a very unoriginal idea, but one that becomes essential in Luftrausers, with the player who cannot hesitate or get too far from the enemy ships and planes, who must strike with precision and at the same time think about which enemies to focus attention on: submarines Battleships take several hits to destroy, so it might be handy to always have a few small fighters flying around. Build your Top Gun With Super Crate Box, Luftrausers shares the sense of progression given by the large amount of unlockable content. Battle after battle you get different parts with which to customize your aircraft, including weapons, engines and fuselages with particular characteristics. You can, for example, build a jet that shoots a laser beam, which has an engine capable of withstanding ocean water and a kamikaze-like fuselage which, when destroyed, eliminates all opponents on the screen; or you can equip a devastating but slow-reloading cannon, with a shell capable of absorbing a large number of shots and an engine that almost completely cancels the effect of gravity. Much of the fun lies in experimenting with all the possible configurations in search of the plane that best suits your style of play, although some components seemed to work so badly that werepresent more of a handicap than anything else: an example are the homing missiles, which most of the time miss their targets and clamorously end up in the water. As mentioned, each combination of weapon-fuselage-engine creates an aircraft that is unique in shape, skills and even in name, but above all each equipped piece offers a series of more or less original missions, ranging from reaching a certain number of points to destroying a certain number of enemies without taking damage, never stopping, or never ceasing to fire. The missions must then also be tackled in the super-difficult ~SFMT~ mode, a sadistic option already seen in Super Crate Box. While it's just a little extra, completing all the challenges for each item gives Luftrausers a modicum of progression and gives the player a set of goals to focus on, while insane color palettes are unlocked as they build by other artists such as Dennis Wedin (Hotline Miami) and Robin Arnott (Deep Sea). In this regard, the music by Jukio Kallio (alias Kozilek) also deserves a mention, a decidedly more exciting and interesting version of the one that the Finnish artist had created for the prototype, in this case designed to be slightly different based on the parts used to build your own plane. Finally, it should be emphasized that we have noticed an evident stuttering when colliding with enemies, but it is not clear whether this is a desired effect or not, also because it does not affect the overall experience in the slightest.", "date": "2014-03-24", "grade": "8.5"}
