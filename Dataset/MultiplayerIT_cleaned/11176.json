{"name": "Opoona - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/opoona-recensione.html", "text": "The inhabitants of the planet Tizia are known throughout the galaxy for their aptitude for combat, and the young Opoona's family is no exception: his father Dadeena is a valiant cosmic guardian, and has always tried to teach him the most important values, such as sense of justice and responsibility. During a vacation in space, Dadeena's ship suffers an unexpected attack, forcing him to launch his three children to the nearby planet Landroll in emergency vehicles. When Opoona wakes up, he finds himself separated from his brother and sister in the city of Tokyo: a robotic butler explains what happened, reassuring him of his family's health and telling him that his parents are currently hospitalized, in waiting to recover from the accident. The young man originally from Tizia will therefore have to stay on Landroll for some time, attending a ranger school that can somehow enhance his innate abilities. Among these there is certainly the ~Bonbon~, a sphere of pure energy that every Titian can control and which proves to be a devastating weapon in combat... The developers wanted to emphasize the simplicity of the controls, such as to allow us to do everything with just the Nunchuck. Who are the ArtePiazzas? ArtePiazza, the team that created Opoona on behalf of Koei, is not new to the RPG genre: it is a group of developers that has collaborated in the production of several episodes of the Dragon Quest series, shoulder to shoulder with Square Enix, and that has also signed an episode of Harvest Moon for PSP and PS2. Among their latest efforts is Dragon Quest: The Chronicles of the Chosen for Nintendo DS, just released here in Italy but thanks to a huge success with audiences and critics overseas. With one hand! After a short introductory phase, which also serves as a tutorial to familiarize yourself with the game's combat system, we will find ourselves controlling Opoona in a ~social~ context, with the young Titian who at the moment cannot do anything to help his family and must adapt to the lifestyle of the inhabitants of Landroll. The developers wanted to emphasize the simplicity of the controls, such as to allow us to do everything with just the Nunchuck: we can move Opoona using the analog stick, interact with the other characters and with the environment thanks to the C button, and access the game screen status and inventory with the Z button. In all of this, the Wii-mote is only used to rotate the view via the d-pad, view which however can be managed by holding down the C button and acting on the analog stick. As mentioned, Opoona will find herself attending a ranger school, whose lessons practically translate into increasingly demanding quests, with the character having to explore various types of settings in search of objects or with the sole purpose of winning a certain number of fights. The clashes are random, which will make more than one person turn up their noses, and the combat system once again sees the Nunchuck as the only control peripheral: by ~loading~ the analog stick backwards we can determine the power with which Opoona will throw their Bonbon at opponents, as well as the speed of the blow. It is not possible to parry or dodge enemy attacks, so we will have to think about the use of the energy ball so that it also works as a ~shield~ when monsters approach: it is not an infallible technique, but in some cases it can make a difference between winning or losing. The inventory is not accessible during the fights, so it will be better to always be found in decent physical conditions in order not to risk failure, drinking the practical bottles of regenerating water that we will always have with us in a large number. However, losing a fight will not be a tragedy: the character will be recovered and taken to the base, from where he can try the mission again or devote himself to something else, while the plot proceeds in the background. Technical realization Opoona's graphics are entirely made in a cel shading that goes perfectly with the intentions of the developers, which is to create a cartoonish and colorful world. Beyond the judgments on the style of drawing, unfortunately it must be said that the final result is too simple and shows the side of numerous shortcomings: the design of the characters is deliberately essential and devoid of detail, but it is not possible that decided so also for their animations, poor in all respects. The general impression is that of dealing with a world populated by robots, which move around without walking and stay perfectly still the rest of the time. The speech does not change when it comes to the analysis ofand location: the interiors are really poor, empty and too similar to each other (it's also a problem to orientate yourself, in some cases), while the exteriors are decidedly richer in elements but have a fixed view, which cannot be rotated and which forces a frustrating exploration when you have to find ~hidden~ objects... all the more so because you often run into random encounters. The sound is also too essential: the characters don't speak, the music is anonymous and repetitive, the effects sound like they've already been heard. Comment The nature of Opoona appears clear already after a few minutes of play: it is an RPG dedicated exclusively to younger users, with a very simple plot and also a technical realization that is anything but complex. The design of the characters is too essential, not to mention the animations, and the quality of the scenarios fluctuates, with some serious discomfort. The graphics engine manages to handle everything smoothly and quickly, but there are often defects in the rendering of the polygons. The most surprising thing, however, are the solutions adopted for the controls: being a Wii game, one would expect at least a basic use of the Wii-mote pointing system and motion detection. But no: an essential approach was opted for even at this juncture, assigning all the commands to the Nunchuck and debasing the mechanics that could have aspired to something more and better. Ultimately, Opoona stands as a product suitable only for younger and less demanding players: if you were expecting the definitive role-playing game for Wii, the Koei title can only be a bitter disappointment. Pros Intended for younger players Very simple and straightforward Quite chunky Cons Technically mediocre Simplistic control system Random encounters", "date": "2008-09-24", "grade": null}
