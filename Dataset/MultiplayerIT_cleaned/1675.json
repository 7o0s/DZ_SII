{"name": "Vexx", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/vexx_a.html", "text": "Game structure Starting from a control room, the character can access the various environments with the aim of collecting a certain number of hearts. The total of these objects will allow him to unlock the following stages, for a total of ten different levels. Finding the hearts hidden in each setting is a job of variable difficulty: before accessing a stage, the game presents us with an inventory screen of the hearts collected and a series of clues to find each of them. In some cases it will be enough for you to simply collect objects to achieve the goal, other times you will have to face fights or solve puzzles. The game structure provides that the levels are not explored just once, far from it: to find the hearts and solve the puzzles, you will find yourself observing the settings very carefully, in an attempt to see a detail that had previously escaped you and which perhaps hides access to a secret area. In all of this, there will be enemies: pathetic beings who do nothing but complain and that you can quickly free from their sad existence. In the first stages of the game, their number is rather small and they never shine for the quality of their realization. In any case, you will be able to face them by alternating between normal attacks (the simple repeated pressing of a key) and flying ones, putting everything together for combos that can last even several seconds and which will fill a special bar. Once full, the latter will allow you to throw particularly effective energy shots, but only for a short period of time and without particular implications. Technical aspect Vexx is striking for its graphic setting: the characters are drawn with a particular style, which in fact does not suit the background story. The settings are quite large and there are some interesting tricks (by rotating the sundial, you can change the ~time~ of the stage, alternating day and night), furthermore the various characteristic points are well made (mountains, lakes, rotating platforms, waterfalls , etc.). Unfortunately, however, the graphics engine can't handle everything effectively: the frame rate varies dramatically depending on where you are, going from super smooth to unceremoniously jerky. A real pity, because the graphics, in general, are well made, both for the textures and for the rather imaginative conception of each level. The collision management is flawless, which works very well and which it could not do otherwise, given the presence of flying attacks (you hit the opponent while he is falling ...) and the numerous points where it is necessary to jump. The game's biggest problem, arguably, is the lack of variety. Apart from the small number of enemies and the total irrelevance of the fights, the character never acquires new abilities and always remains the same, greatly undermining the longevity of the title. Enriched by an integral localization in our language, the sound of the game alternates well-made music with effects that are anything but exciting. Concluding... Vexx is a good platformer, with some original elements (including the style adopted for the creation of the characters) and really large and detailed levels. Going around the various settings, looking for the hearts needed to continue in the game, is fun at least for the good control system, the effective management of the visuals (which is rare to find) and the possibility of moving with an excellent degree of freedom. It is a pity that some important elements, such as the fights or the development of the story, have not been taken into much consideration by the developers. In this way Vexx, even without considering the problems of its graphic engine, fails in its attempt to present itself as a complete product and, in many ways, disappoints expectations (why equip the character with such a particular offense system, without then developing it ?). Pros: Large and well-made environments Good control system Completely in Italian Cons: Uncertain graphics engine Useless, or almost useless fights Little variety History Dark Yabu, a powerful and evil creature, has decided to take over the planet. After having exterminated hundreds of inhabitants, without distinction, he also manages to capture Vexx and his grandfather. The latter, for having tried to resist, is condemned to the eternal agony of a dimensional prison and Vexx really can't take any more. Party Dark Yabu, the young man manages to elude the surveillance of his guardians and fiends up in the hold of a ship that hides spoils of war. Among these there are also the legendary battle claws, which Vexx decides to wear: the claws ~merge~ with the character, making him able to eliminate his opponents in no time, jump higher and further, climb certain surfaces and launch, in some cases, energy discharges. As soon as Vexx feels his strength increase, he unleashes his captors and literally disintegrates the area. He is later picked up by an elder of his village, who also survived the massacre, who explains to him how he must move to find Dark Yabu and free his grandfather from eternal suffering.", "date": "2003-04-24", "grade": null}
