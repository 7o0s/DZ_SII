After all, it's no secret that indie team Rocketcat Games drew heavily from Nintendo's most epic franchise, and in particular the never too lauded A Link to the Past for SNES, to make its new game on iOS devices. With an inspiring muse of this caliber, the risk was of being faced with yet another title for iOS that mimics a classic but does not take on its own personality, perhaps limiting itself to relying on the nostalgia effect or on any references to the work from which it draws inspiration . Will it also apply to Mage Gauntlet? The pleasure of clichs As mentioned at the beginning, the Rocketcat Games game seems to be a real tribute to the old action adventures with a fantastic setting, starting from a plot which, although full of clichs of all kinds, manages to take on original nuances and to be narrated through successful dialogues between characters. The story is introduced by the story of a legendary battle between a demon and a powerful wizard, a battle that ended with the defeat of the first and his imprisonment in another world. Predictably, the Lord of evil will try to return to the kingdom from which he was exiled, and the task of stopping him will thus be up to Lexi, a young girl who, thanks to a magic glove, is able to absorb energy from some objects and cast powerful spells. The touchscreen control system is as basic as it is successful, giving the player the ability to attack with their blade, charge a powerful blow, perform a quick dodge or pause the game to cast one of the spells collected by destroying vases and shiny artifacts scattered along the way. It should be noted that, although Mage Gauntlet openly winks at the adventures of Link and Zelda, some important structural differences are evident, the first of which is undoubtedly the lack of an explorable Overworld: Rocketcat has in fact decided to offer the player different levels disconnected from each other and directly accessible through a map, a more manageable solution but which undoubtedly ends up making the experience more linear and predictable. To this must be added the total lack of quests to complete or environmental puzzles to solve, and everything is resolved in a continuous proceeding through rooms and corridors trying to make their way through the enemies until the clash with the boss on duty. Precisely with regard to the latter, it makes you turn up your nose that the development team has not looked for more interesting solutions to add a little variety to the fights, so much so that they will almost all be faced in the same way, avoiding a trivial pattern of attack, eliminating annoying minions and casting spells over distance. And that's a shame, because the end-of-level bosses, as well as all the other enemies and environments of the game, are a real pleasure to admire, characterized by a pixel art so lively as to infatuate both the nostalgic of the 16-bit era and last minute players. Even with its flaws and despite being far from being an unforgettable game, Mage Gauntlet still manages to offer an over the top experience, thanks to a fun combat system, an above average duration in hours and a great variety of enemies , each of which is distinguished by a unique behavior. Don't worry about running non-stop from the beginning to the end of the level or giving yourself the most unbridled button mashing, since, especially in the more advanced scenarios, the quantity and power of the enemies will be such as to require a slightly more tactical and weighted by the player. The icing on the cake is represented by the possibility of customizing the protagonist with a whole series of weapons, armor and pendants that can be found by exploring the environments, although they do not directly affect Lexi's attack power or resistance, but more often than not they increase the chances of finding a given spell.
