{"name": "Pikmin", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pikmin_a.html", "text": "Crassssh!!!! A day like many others, Captain Olimar was aboard his gigantic spaceship, enjoying a well-deserved rest after months and months of hard work. Bad luck wanted a giant meteorite to hit Olimar's spaceship right in the middle which, after various vicissitudes, manages to make an emergency landing on an unknown planet. The impact with the surface of the same causes enormous damage to the spaceship which unfortunately loses the beauty of 30 pieces, all essential to completely replace the vehicle of our unfortunate alter ego. The fundamental problem, however, is not the recovery of the various pieces; once some of these have been located, the spaceship already has the possibility of making small movements, moving from one part of the place to the other where, unfortunately, we find ourselves, but if we told you that every ~fragment~ of our vehicle is at least the double of our Olimar? And if the planet was also uninhabited or, at least, devoid of manpower useful for our purposes? Ladies & gentleman, we are pleased to introduce you to the Pikmin or so Olimar renamed them after meeting the first of these funny little creatures.. They will be the ones to help our funny protagonist find all the missing pieces and bring them back to the spaceship, the only drawback is the time available, only 30 days, the same duration of life support provided by his very special suit. As if this were not enough, the bestiary of the place and some morphological and meteorological aspects harmful to some types of Pikmin, will give plenty of trouble to the gamer, enchanted by the wonders of the new video game edited by Miyamoto-san. Rts Nintendo?? Pikmin is a real-time strategy game.stop, where are you running???? First of all, it's very funny, it has so many touches of class that we haven't seen in a long time and it lets you play like a marvel; even the undersigned, always refractory to real time rts on P and consoles due to the excessive difficulty of the game mechanics and the player's lack of participation (sometimes) in what happens on the ~battlefield~, had to change his mind once the pad is held. To be clear, the colorful instruction manual included in the package was leafed through only after a good few hours of play, given that like all Nintendo masterpieces, the early stages of the game are more similar to a real training, but invisible to the eyes of the player. Thirty minutes after turning on the console and collecting the first piece for your spaceship, you will already be able to perform more than half of the game actions possible with Pikmin. A note of merit also goes to the exceptional Nintendo joypad: just as Halo has shown that even an FPS can be exceptionally controlled with a gamepad, the same, with a poorly concealed point of pride, demonstrates Nintendo with its exceptional strategy: with the analog pad left you command Olimar while with the other keys you zoom, cultivate and call to order the Pikmin (complete with a whistle), trim head butts and so on. The triumph of the Nintendo Difference, in short. It almost seems that inside you hear the phrase ~But in the end, what is the gameplay about?~ Simple: recover all the pieces of the spaceship within thirty days, penalty game over. Indeed, whatever the result of your actions, you either save Olimar (and the success of his holidays) or caput, all in seven hours and thirty minutes (taking into account that a simulated day lasts fifteen actual minutes, 450 total minutes of play ). If all this may seem strange to you or if the duration of the whole may seem low, well, the replayability will not fail to make you change your mind instantly: completing a real-time strategy game in 40 hours would certainly wear out the vast majority of owners of the same, but with less of 8 hours of play and the uncertainty of being able (at least in the first session) to save Olimar, is a source of immediate return to the fold by the gamer, either to succeed in what he has previously failed miserably, or to resolve everything in a shorter time or (and these days it's a real quality) for the sole sake of replaying Pikmin (waiting for the already announced sequel). The Pikmin, once cultivated, become the key to success to continue in the game: among the many functions, they create bridges, knock down obstacles, defeat enemies (albeit with some difficulty) and do their utmost to recover the pieces of your spaceship, provided you have an adequate number to support the considerable weight of the latter; Luckily, you can take up to 100 of these Anthropies with youopomorphs, different from each other in color and, therefore, in attitudes: the red Pikmin, for example, are resistant to heat, with the blue ones you can wade through the ponds while the yellow ones can handle bombs. In any case, your small group of helpers is subject to heavy drops due to the aforementioned enemy creatures, the arrival of the night (and related monsters, very strong), obstacles of various kinds (the red Pikmin for example drown in water) and off later. Very entertaining, with a well-calibrated difficulty and with a certain replay value, Pikmin is a masterpiece of originality and, above all, it is a joy to play. Marvelous Pikmins! The first time you launch the mini dvd, you are entranced by the at least photorealistic graphics of the backdrops, cared for in an almost divine way (thanks, too, to the use of bump mapping) while the little smiles of sympathy for Olimar will be wasted. The enemies are well made, both for the convincing animations and, even before, for the comic character design. The graphics engine runs at an almost fixed 25 fps (but it takes a particularly critical eye to notice the very rare spasms of the engine), but with a hundred Pikmin (all very cute, the girls will compete to grab the soft toys or action figures ) on a playing field created in a masterly way, with streams extremely accurate in terms of physics of liquids (it's not Wave Race Bluestorm but the result is excellent all the same), leaves, trees, plants and some enemies on the screen at the same time, we don't believe just that there is something to complain about in this very successful Nintendo production. To conclude the speech concerning the graphic side, it is good to underline how the transition between day and night has been implemented in a more than convincing way, both thanks to the color palette used and the timing of the ~operation~. As far as the sound side is concerned, the music is in keeping with the production, don't expect dozens of different compositions but the few that exist, are really well done and, above all, integrate very well with the graphics and what happens on screen. The sound effects are also extremely accurate but the golden palm of Pikmin's audio side undoubtedly goes to the hilarious digitized speech that will enter your brain like Luigi's whistling. Conclusions Pikmin is original, fun, full of classy touches, technically well done, with a fairly low learning curve (we reiterate, less than thirty minutes to ~command~ the Pikmin, without leafing through the manual) but with a level of difficulty certainly not easier, Miyamoto's new masterpiece could easily be the most original and fun RTS of the year without any particular effort. We dare not imagine what Nintendo will prepare in the already announced sequel. In the meantime..buy now or we'll send the Pikmin against you. Pros: Very original Very funny Graphically very valid Speech well studied intuitive interface like few others Cons: someone could turn up their noses ..but they don't know what they are missing! if you don't play it a second time (but we doubt it), it will last you less than 8 hours The master is back!! With the release of the Gamecube, which took place in the now historic September 2001, the vast majority of Nintendo fans felt, in some way, betrayed by the big N, which has always been the dispenser of a fabulous Mario episode, at the exit of each of its consoles . Luigi's Mansion, although very entertaining and full of touches of class, has not been able to gratify users as Super Mario Sunshine would have done, which will warm up the summer of Japanese and American players, both for the brevity of the Nintendo arcade adventure and for the particular type of game, certainly less endowed with that unique appeal that permeates every episode of the famous Mario. Among other things, Shigeru Miyamoto had not actively participated in the creation of the first video game starring the very nice Luigi, limiting himself to providing his advice and some ideas, being very busy in the creation of the aforementioned Super Mario Sunshine, The Legend Of Zelda and ..a bizarre strategist named Pikmin. The undersigned, when he was able to view screenshots and videos of this game at the E3 2001 edition, was at least baffled, wondering if it would actually have been worth delaying the release of the new Mario and Link games, to favor some..of ..funny little creatures that wandered, like so many little ants, through incredibly detailed levels. Now that Nintendo has released the European version of Pikmin, we've found out why everythingi those who have tried it, have come out ecstatic, an effect now assured when it comes to video games created by mr. Miyamoto himself. Let's see it together.", "date": "2002-06-15", "grade": null}
