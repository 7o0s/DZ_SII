He is a nameless hero, recognizable by one detail: the scarlet scarf shamelessly copied from Shinobi's Hotsuma (PlayStation 2, 2002). Perhaps the idea of one character against all is a projection of Intrusion 2's lone developer, Russian Aleksey Abramenko. This determined game designer publishes Intrusion in 2008, a browser game in flash that collects much acclaim. Since that day he has been working tirelessly to give his work a sequel that can compete with the giants of the genre, such as the stainless Metal Slug. Four years later, Intrusion 2 is a reality. And he fears no comparisons. Aleksey Abramenko has made several style choices. The first concerns controls. With the keyboard we move the hero, and with the mouse we aim at enemies. Alternatively, the game supports the gamepad and we can therefore do everything with the two sticks. Accuracy provided by an independent pointer introduces the strategic factor, rare in horizontal scrolling shooters. To further enhance the tactical spirit of Intrusion 2, the brilliant Abramenko then made another crucial choice: he introduced impossible physics. We can push a giant boulder on the enemies' heads, throw crates into the water and bounce on them like trampolines or kick away the bodies of the fallen, who have suddenly become wireless puppets. This means that we never know how the scenery will react to our war pirouettes, because everything moves freely. Joy of pure chaos. Finally there are the real protagonists of Intrusion 2, the end-of-level bosses. We'll talk about these extraordinary opponents, game physics and more shortly. Instead, let's make a first note. The controls could be quicker in response, especially the jump, which we happened to have to double-press in the most hectic situations. Fortunately it is a rare event. However, it's best to open the parachute and postpone the talk, because Intrusion 2 picks up where the predecessor left off, with our hero falling from the sky after an epic end-game boss battle. Give me a railgun and I'll lift the world for you Intrusion 2 begins with a bland first level where it is above all the physics that amazes. Then comes the encounter with the giant wolf, one of the ~means~ available throughout the game. Clumsy and amusing in small maneuvers, however, it becomes a fury if launched at full speed. It is capable of mighty leaps and makes soldiers in one bite. The second surprise of the game is the boss of the third level: a titanic battle on different levels which culminates in the crazy descent aboard one of its wrecks, used as a sled. During the race, ninjas on snowboards try to slice us, bomber paratroopers hover over our heads and robot-snakes free themselves on the horizon from their metal cladding to dive into the snow under our feet and suddenly leap out. From here on Intrusion 2 is an alternation of clashes and tactical pauses. In fact, physics is not a frivolity, but a game element. You can bury enemies under granite boulders, lock robots in wreckage and strafe them, pounce on mechanical creatures to avoid their claws, or simply duck behind a barrel for protection. Even the most complex enemies make extensive use of the scenery. There's a feline-like robot with big arms that picks up what it finds and hurls it at us, floating balloons that emit flames from their nozzles and missiles that shoot back at the sender. These are just a few examples, but they should clarify how important physics are in Intrusion 2. A healthy alternative to deaf advancing without ever letting go of the trigger. There are even some basic environmental puzzles to vary the pace of the game. The physics of Intrusion 2 won us over and made us laugh more than once. In fact, it's hilarious to see how easily our weight swings a giant container. But some might not even like it. Especially since in some cases it can happen to struggle to pick up a weapon stuck in the wreckage or unlock a freight elevator caught between barrels and piled up bodies. On this point we have only one piece of advice to give you: try the demo. However, apart from a few small inaccuracies, everything works fine. The only limitations are due to the fact that apart from the music, composed by Android, such a complex game was developed by just one person. In fact, there are only nine levels, with three bosses in all. Each level is quite long, but it would have been nice to have more different enemies to fight. Snow, trees, interiors of buildings, bridges and water complete with mec piranhasdogs are some of the elements that enliven the race to the final boss, but that are not enough to distinguish the levels from each other. On the other hand, the game offers numerous resolutions in full screen and runs at a stable 30 fps. Not bad, but in the most chaotic situations it would have been great to have twice as much. I'm the boss You can see it in the image above: it is the first boss of the game. Don't underestimate him. At first he only lands troops ready to kill us, but he soon has other tricks up his sleeve. To destroy it completely you have to reach many floors of rock below when, reduced to a wreck, it chases us overwhelming the scenario and firing missiles as if there were no tomorrow. Until we finally destroy the cockpits of the pilot and navigator. Tough and treacherous. But that's nothing compared to the last boss, a robot that looks like something out of a Japanese animated film. Huge, with many different attacks, and seemingly indestructible. The final one is undoubtedly the most spectacular battle ever seen in a run'n'gun. The most interesting aspect of the bosses, aside from the fact that all three present a long and complex challenge, is that they make full use of the game's confusing physics. And they require careful use of all five weapons available. In fact, our hero can count on the pistol (even in akimbo mode) a machine gun, a railgun, a laser and a bomb launcher. However, the arsenal could have been larger. Again, Intrusion 2 pays the price of being developed by one person. On a normal level it takes three to five hours to finish the game. It's true that there is a health bar, but it only takes a few hits to finish you stone dead. Thankfully the difficulty curve is calibrated to perfection. The fights with the bosses are divided into several phases - with the exception of the second - and along the levels there are several checkpoints, often manned by bastard snipers ready to take the last notch of life one step away from the flag. The challenge is a crescendo of fun and not frustration and the game invites you to take a second round on high difficulty without it becoming a nightmare. Intrusion 2 offers the best of its kind and has the courage to turn everything upside down. It lacks artistic personality but has a lot of it in terms of gameplay. If you love run'n'guns or enjoy deep interaction with the elements in play, save eight euros and let those guns thunder.", "date": "2012-08-09", "grade": "8.5"}
