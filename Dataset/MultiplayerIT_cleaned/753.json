Kennedy, who survived the second episode of the series and is now an agent of the US secret services, engaged in the search for the president's daughter, kidnapped and hidden in a mysterious village from Spain. Without going too far into the description of the plot and the more subtle facets of the Capcom production (for which we refer you to the Review of the original Gamecube version), let's go straight to the heart of the matter, or the quality of the port. On a strictly visual level, Resident Evil 4 manages to exceed even the most optimistic forecasts, presenting a cosmetic that leaves very few regrets despite the indisputable technical gap between the two platforms. The excellent polygonal models of the on-screen characters are almost unchanged, with detailed enemies equipped with fluid and realistic animation sets and a Leon in splendid shape, whose level of detail is excellent from head to toe, for the sake of the third person view feature of the game. The PS2 version of Resident Evil 4 does not struggle to establish itself as one of the most visually impressive works of the entire Sony gaming scene Welcome back Leon A similarly positive speech - albeit in less enthusiastic tones - deserves the texture sector, which has always been the Achilles' heel of multiplatform games on PS2 and for once absolutely not debased by the passage to Sony hardware: a lesser definition is undoubtedly visible, but certainly not drastic levels prophesied by the most pessimistic, indeed. The more consistent and palpable cuts instead concerned the polygonal mass of the settings and the larger enemies, with the result that both appear less spectacular, albeit with significant oscillations between one case and another. Also noteworthy is a slight limitation of the visual effects and some rather sporadic slowdowns, as well as slightly higher waiting times for loading. Nothing striking, however, to the point that the PS2 version of Resident Evil 4 does not struggle to establish itself as one of the most visually impressive works in the entire Sony gaming scene. A pleasant icing on the cake is then represented by the presence of a real widescreen option complete with progressive scan support, where the original on Gamecube offered a limited display in letterbox format. On the sound front, however, a perceptible lower quality in the reproduction of the effects should be reported, most likely the result of the compression of the game in a single DVD, unlike the two minidiscs of the Nintendo incarnation. Not just graphics Obviously the differences between the two versions of the game do not stop at the mere visual aspect, but also affect other sectors, the most tangible of which is certainly that relating to the control system. Also in this case the work done by Capcom is more than appreciable, with the PS2 pad capable of bringing home the loaf without too many worries, if we exclude a slightly lower precision as regards aiming and an initial embarrassment during the quick time events: the greater quantity and conventionality of the keys on the Sony controller can lead to errors more often, whereas on the Gamecube the large A key, the small B and only the two backbones were the only elements in play. Nothing that can't be overcome with a little practice, though. Having archived the discussion on the structural changes of this Resident Evil 4 for PS2, it's time to illustrate the tantalizing exclusive bonus materials of the Sony version. Starting from the contents perhaps more accessories, or a new unlockable costume for Leon (in this case the police uniform worn in the second chapter of the saga) and some unpublished weapons, among which the devastating laser cannon P.R.L. 412 and the picturesque Gunpowder Bowgun. The real trump card of the PS2 incarnation of Resident Evil 4 is represented by the five missions that make up the Separate Ways mode However, these goodies for hardcore gamers are accompanied by the real trump card of the PS2 incarnation of Resident Evil 4, represented by the five missions that make up the Separate Ways mode. Unlockable after finishing the main adventure, Separate Ways allows the user to throw himself back into the fray in the skimpy shoes of Ada Wong, as mentioned within five stages which, in addition to providing a substantial boost to the longevity of the product, allow you to light on some secondary aspects of the storyline, filling those holes deliberately left by the primary narrative thread. Characterized by a fairly high level of difficulty and capable of giving a handful of dhours of pure entertainment for the player, the Separate Ways missions also manage to give a touch of variety to everything, either for the different physical characteristics of Ada compared to Leon (faster but slightly less resistant), or for the specific objectives of the internships. In short, a really good extra, although in any case it can hardly constitute a valid incentive on its own for further spending for owners of the ~old~ Gamecube version. Comment Resident Evil 4 on PS2 first of all confirms the exceptional quality of Mikami's masterpiece already widely sanctioned by the original Gamecube version, revealing itself once again as one of the most solid must-buys of this generation. In addition to this, the Sony version really manages to amaze for the care and seriousness of the porting, which arrived almost a year late, but really excellent in every aspect: except for some absolutely forgivable snags, however, Resident Evil 4 on PS2 compensates for the inevitable but all in all limited technical debts with extra content of considerable caliber, which bring this incarnation to a level almost equal to the original. Pros: Great port Always excellent gameplay Convincing extra content Cons: A few imperfections here and there Comes a year after the original Initially (and surprisingly) announced as a Gamecube exclusive, Resident Evil 4 did not struggle to demonstrate, at the time of its release, one of the reasons for Capcom's decision. Characterized by an amazing technical sector, the fourth chapter of the Mikami saga seemed to scream from the rooftops as such a cosmetic rendering had been possible only and exclusively thanks to the potential of the Nintendo hardware. Precisely for this reason, the announcement of a future conversion on PlayStation 2 aroused many doubts within the gaming community, which even reached disastrous predictions of a debased and mutilated port due to the inferior technical characteristics of the Sony platform.
