{"name": "Wolfenstein 3d", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wolfenstein-3d.html", "text": "About ten years ago Following the enormous success obtained, our Bj has also moved into an 8mb cartridge for Super Nintendo (with a lot of censorships, such as the blood eliminated, like the frills, described above), in an integrated chip a little bulkier in the form of a cartridge for the Atari Jaguar flop (passed off as 64 bit) and, about ten years later and thanks to Stalker Entertainment (on behalf of Bam Entertainment), also in a tiny cartridge for the Game Boy Advance. The 32-bit portable Nintendo has so far proved to be a particularly flexible piece of hardware, capable of handling fighting games (Street Fighter and Final Fight), racing games (F-Zero and Mario Kart), as well as more demanding types of video games such as RTS (Advance Wars) and, incredibly, fps (Doom). Will it fare as well as its ~sequel~? Gameplay As already anticipated in the introductory paragraph, Bj Blazkowitz's task is to escape from the castle occupied by the faithful of the Nazi dictator par excellence in full swing of the Second World War, through 60 levels. If it is true that our Bj knows more than the devil, being surrounded by soldiers armed with pistols, rifles, perhaps with the help of guard dogs, is certainly not healthy for our hero who fortunately can heal himself with food that can find along his long wanderings. As per good fps tradition (started, among other things, with the present title Id), by shooting down armed enemies you can stock up on the weapons and ammunition of the scoundrels in question, very useful for clashes with the fearsome end-of-level bosses. Gameplay The key setup is decidedly comforting, in a few minutes you will be able to control your virtual alter ego to perfection (shot and action key on the main keys, the strafe on the back buttons and the ~select~ key for changing weapons), the system save mode allows you to save, directly on the cartridge, your position at the end of each level (like the already released console conversions), unlike the computer one where you could always save. The difficulty is well calibrated thanks to 4 different levels of difficulty (the first to be avoided a priori, the last to be tested only if you consider yourself crazy), the tension is always lurking every time you turn a suspicious corner or open the door locked with that hard-earned key to get it. Too bad for the lack of multiplayer options, however absent even in the original, if your memory doesn't start to fade. Graphics and sound There is no doubt that Wolfenstein 3d was the first 3d shooter in history, that more could have been done on Game Boy Advance, after seeing what it can do with fps, it doesn't rain: an unstable frame rate (in the presence of doors opening or a couple of sprites on the screen) embraces a very low definition of the (few) backdrops and sprites. Taking into account that this production lacks special effects worthy of the name, areas where lights and shadows are the masters, elevators, exteriors or more or less elevated locations compared to others, we can only regret the result obtained by Stalker Entertainment, in the conversion of a fundamental title for videogame history. Graphics and sound As in the original, there is no trace of music, to keep you company there are the moans of the enemies who will perish under your blows (of normal quality), as well as really old-fashioned sound effects (and therefore well converted from the original PC, one would like to underline) and reduced to the bone. Conclusions Wolfenstein 3d, despite more than one flaw on a cosmetic level (the highly contested snappy graphics engine, despite the low graphics volume), is still the game from which first person shooters were born, an excellent example of level design by a Id Software that continuously amazes its loyal audience. As for the sound side, you couldn't honestly do much more, it's practically identical to the original. Conclusions Very playable and with a longevity to be reckoned with (60 levels), if you've already played Doom, THE first-person shooter for Game Boy Advance, make your own too, taking into account the quality of the Stalker Entertainment conversion. Conclusions Pros: Wolfenstein 3d in your pocket!! 60 levels Cons: mediocre technical realization no multiplayer options About ten years ago When polygon-eating cards for PCs were still a mirage, when DOS hadn't yet been supplanted by Windows 9x and, above all, at a time when people thought only of buying Street Fighter-style fighting games and platformers starring Mario or Sonic. Id Software, a peakthe (at the time) American software house was about to invent, in fact, the genre of three-dimensional shooters (or first person shooters) with the masterpiece Wolfenstein 3d. For the first time, scrolling abandoned the only straight left-right path in which to move in order to be able to move in a much vaster and more complex space, just as the sensation derived from the first-person view was enormous, an inevitable choice for total immersion in the game ; our virtual alter ego was no longer visible on the screen, his right hand was, dripping with knives, pistols, shotguns and so on. Purpose of the game? In the role of Bj Blazkowitz, a proud American soldier with great cunning, lion's courage and considerable strength, you had to make your way through 60 levels, divided into 6 distinct episodes, in an attempt to escape from a fearsome castle occupied by the Nazis. The presence of enemy soldiers, dogs, thugs ready to do anything to kill you, the presence of many secret rooms and an excellent level design work, placed Wolfenstein 3d in the Olympus of videogames, despite the ferocious controversies regarding the abundant times) presence of blood, swastikas and other purely Nazi ornaments scattered here and there, such as the paintings depicting the Furher, Adolf Hitler.", "date": "2002-06-28", "grade": null}
