In addition to the discounted single match, playoff and training modes, we find the general manager mode in which we will be able to edit the squads, modify the rosters and create players. Then there is the season mode in which we will take control of an nba franchise for up to 25 years, playing or simulating matches, buying, selling and exchanging players and being able to create them from scratch and making them grow and become flags of the our team. Unfortunately, the possibility of challenging the computer or a friend in the characteristic American playgrounds is missing, an obvious flaw that takes away a valid alternative to the challenges all rules and referee whistles that characterize the official matches. However, there is no need to despair, in fact the developers have concentrated on making the most of the present modes without forgetting the online game, yes because NID2004 was born for the Xbox Live service and is one of the flagship titles on which Microsoft is betting to get off the ground the Xsn service, but we'll talk about this later. The playability of the title developed by High Voltage Software is decidedly good, a happy medium between simulation at all costs and the wildest arcade. We won't be able, to be clear, to feint all the opposing players to finish with a nice dunk with a 360 rotation. We won't make it because the A.I. of opponents is particularly fierce, especially at higher difficulty levels. To make a basket, therefore, we will have to build reasoned actions, perhaps calling the plays with the very comfortable D-pad or using the blocks to insert ourselves in the rival defense like a hot knife in butter. Certainly not all players have the same characteristics: there are snipers who prefer to hit from the three-point arc and there are skilled jumpers who love to dunk in the face of opposing centers, just to name a few. We will therefore have to know all the skills of our players to have full command of the team. To help us identify the main characteristics of our champions, a symbol always appears next to the name of the selected player. The symbol can represent: a crosshair to indicate shooters, a star for the sacred monsters of the NBA, a lightning bolt for those who are very fast and so on. All of this is obviously accompanied by many statistics based on the official NBA license. The control system is very good, especially as regards the passes that are executed in a fraction of a second, faithfully reflecting the high pace of American basketball. Shoot from his home and score The title of High Voltage Software, although born exclusively for Microsoft hardware, fails to exploit it properly. The work done cannot be said to be entirely bad, but certainly more could have been done. The reconstruction of the arenas is detailed enough, surely the audience could have been better and above all we had to make them more involved in the match, both from a visual and sound point of view. These are still details, important yes, but details. The players are beautifully recreated and all the stars that light up the stars and stripes basketball firmament look exactly like their real life counterparts. Iverson is the real answer, Malone is the postman we know, Shaq is perfect (even if they took off a few pounds... is it because he is the testimonial of the game?), Tracy McGrady, Tim Duncan, Kobe Bryant and all the others are and in tip-top shape, not forgetting rising stars like Le Bron James and Carmelo Anthony. The problems arise for medium-low level players who unfortunately look a bit similar graphically, certainly making the game itself lose realism. The lighting effects are good and the game engine proves to be reliable, never dropping a frame and always running smoothly. On the other hand, the animations are a little less successful which at times, except for the dunks which are always highly spectacular and harmonious, are ~robotic~ as well as not being very varied. The commentary is entrusted to some American experts in the sector, and obviously it is in English, like the rest of the game. Choice in line with products of the genre even if it would be interesting to hear a good Italian commentary, perhaps entrusting it to expert people such as Flavio Tranquillo and Federico Buffa who already cheer the viewers of Sky Sport. The music is characterized by hip hop tracks that add nothing and take nothing away from the Microsoft title, like the rest of the sound effects that are not highlighted, but are not to be forgotten either. The answer! the answer but to what? Perhaps the desire for online gaming that now characterizes every Xbox user? We really think so and NID2004 is a very valid answer that makes the most of the Xsn service. In fact, through Xsn we will be able to create tournaments in real time, compare statistics, contact our friends-rivals and try to become number one in the world. Online matches can be used, at the user's choice, to climb the rankings or as simple training. The challenges are very good, the response to the commands is immediate and the lag non-existent. However, this, it should be emphasized, depends a lot on what type of connection you have, who you play against and at what time you do it. In fact, the situation can completely reverse itself and the game become slow and ~jerky~, unplayable. It is almost needless to say that the online experience must be lived, it makes the game that already deserves it, a real drug. Fortunately, the title supports multiplayer gaming and four can play with a single console and a single registered tag, therefore with three guests. Furthermore, the possibilities of Live are not all here, and in fact the possibility of downloading the updated roosters of the various NBA franchises enriches the game. The title is updated to September 15th and, thanks to the first free download available, you will be able to incorporate the latest market exchanges and use the new ~roses~ of players dated November 15th, 2003. Comment Ultimately, NBA Inside Drive 2004 is a certainly successful title, although it is not free from some small gaps that do not affect the final result too much. It is a recommended purchase for all holders of an account on Xbox Live, while it loses some of its value towards offline players, who must feel entitled to remove half a point from our final vote, by examining the alternatives available in the sector . So if you want to start 2004 with a basket, don't miss the Microsoft title, once you get it you won't let it go for a long time. Pros: Simulative at the right point The season mode Xbox Live and Xsn, two X guarantee of fun Cons: Technically only fair Lack of a playground mode Completely in English The American sports stock market is almost centered around three main disciplines: basketball, hockey and golf. In our article we will go into detail on one of the most important titles on the basketball front: NBA Inside Drive 2004, the Microsoft title that will compete with rivals made in Sega and Electronic Arts. Will the High Voltage Software game be able to recreate the atmosphere that reigns on American parquet? Will he be able to involve us? Are online gaming and the Xsn service a real added value?
