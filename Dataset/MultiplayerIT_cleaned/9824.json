There are the stadium settings and futuristic sports a la Smash TV; there are classes just like we enjoyed them in Team Fortress 2; third person and aiming system are reminiscent of such masterpieces as Gears of War and all the shooters following its release; finally, the defense system is the classic one of any self-respecting Tower Defense. Let's mix all these elements and combine them with cooperative and multiplayer gameplay, pleasant graphics with a cartoon style that is never out of date and an attractive price as only digital delivery content can have and you will soon understand that we are faced with an absolutely must-have title , also considering the lack of oxygen of this summer poor in important releases. Mocking the famous ~Monday Night Football~ that has been on air for decades on US networks, the game developed by the Americans UBER Entertainment imagines that the sport of the future is a sort of arena for fights to the last breath between two teams of fully armed soldiers point that they will try to win as much money as possible, destroying the enemy team but at the same time defending the loot concentrated in the ~Soldisphere~ positioned in the center. There are two main game modes. The first, called ~Blitz~, sees us as protagonists together with three other friends on the net (or in local coop) against hordes of enemy-robots who attack us with ever greater vehemence and aggression: the goal is to defend the central sphere, destroying the opposing waves before they can attack it. The second mode is instead called ~Crossfire~, and pits two teams against each other with the dual task of defending their Soldisphere and annihilating that of others. A mix between The Implacable and Dodgeball It is precisely the dual objective to follow that makes the division of the players' tasks necessary, and therefore the creation of diversified classes that best perform their functions. Exactly like in Team Fortress 2 (the comparison arises spontaneously also considering that the character design of the two games is almost identical) here we can choose to be a sniper, assaulter, tank, support, gunner or assassin, each with its own characteristics such as speed , stamina, ability to jump, fly, camouflage, create traps, throw grenades, missiles, regenerate health. Each class has its own primary and secondary attack, as well as three special abilities. For example, the assassin can become invisible, the tank can attack covered by solid armor, the gunner can use the Jetpack, and so on. When playing in multiplayer, it is important that each member of the team differs from the others in order to be able to take advantage of each of these peculiar characteristics. The peculiarity of Monday Night Combat is that we can upgrade these skills directly in the game, while we fight, by activating a pop-up menu. By eliminating enemy robots, you earn money, which is useful both for paying for these improvements (invisibility or more durable jetpacks, more precise sniper aiming, magazines with a greater number of shots...), and for unlocking new weapons, but above all for building defense of our Soldisphere automated combat turrets. Each turret has a specific cost, there are various types. There's the long-range one, there's one that hits more than one target at a time, there's the laser or freezing one, which slows down enemies momentarily. These too can be improved using the money collected during the fights: all in real time and not between one wave and another. In fact, the game action takes place in turns, increasingly demanding because the CPU sends us increasingly bigger, stronger and more numerous enemies. You play up to 4 people against the artificial intelligence, or with up to 6 vs 6 in teams online in the ~Crossfire~ mode. From the options it is possible to follow our ~career~ step by step by checking the money earned, the improvements of our class, the number and type of enemies destroyed, the world ranking or the ranking among Xbox Live friends. The controls are fast, fluid, very precise: there is a certain deja vu for all those who have enjoyed Gears of War, Lost Planet, and all those shooters with a third person view and (almost) first person aiming. Online is better The developers' passion for American Football and Wrestling is quite evident right away, when the tutorial first teaches us how to shoot and throw from a distance, then the attacks and prthey are close. Tackles, melee attacks, and melee strikes are part of Monday Night Combat's gameplay DNA. Despite the great variety given by the classes, the available skills, the Tower Defense system and finally these melee attacks, the game suffers from a single real problem: the strong sense of ~already seen~ typical of many (good) productions today. Regardless of the fact that this game is aimed almost exclusively at Xbox Live Gold members (it would have little to say without its online multiplayer), longtime gamers could spend their time remembering by heart many past productions, some of which are recalled in this review. Monday Night Combat is fun, but the small number of arenas (four) could soon tire the most demanding players. The game stadiums, while not numerous, are however well designed and full of interesting ideas, despite their simplicity. They are all arranged in vertical levels from where it is possible to snipe, with defense zones, open squares and others more covered. The Unreal Engine 3 used gives its contribution with clean, colorful graphics, full of pleasant effects such as the invisible camouflage of the assassins or the particles generated by some weapons. The comment of the American commentator is a bit repetitive, who yells, yells and talks all the time saying the same things for better or worse (the audio of the game is practically made up of this and that's it). One last curiosity: the artificial intelligence of the CPU does not need patches or updates because it is entirely managed by routines deposited on the game server, modifiable ~on the fly~ by the developers at any time and for any need, a system that is taking more and more space in modern productions. Monday Night Combat, downloadable for 1200 Microsoft Points, would seem to be the ideal shooter to pass the time that now awaits the great masterpieces of this winter.", "date": "2010-09-07", "grade": "7.8"}
