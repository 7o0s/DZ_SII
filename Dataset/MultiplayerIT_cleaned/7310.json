{"name": "Lo Strider dei tempi moderni", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/128562-strider-lo-strider-dei-tempi-moderni.html", "text": "Twenty-five years old and starting to feel them a little: Strider still remains a concentrate of charisma, starting from the mighty title to get to the characterization of the main character, but it is a game that now faces the test of time with some difficulty. It is perhaps for this reason that Capcom took so long to dust off a historic brand with a great appeal like this, then deciding to dedicate a production of limited dimensions to it and also modifying its structure substantially, beyond a genesis rather complicated that has also gone through the closure of the development team Grin, initially in charge of the project. In this restructuring by Double Helix we note a tension towards a more modern videogame-form, characterized by a more complex and profound construction of the gameplay compared to the original. Not that this has distorted the spirit of Strider, in any case, since Hiryu's fast movements and the blows of his Cypher sword continue to restore that feeling of power characteristic of the old title, but if in 1989 these elements could be enough to decree success of a game already endowed with great charisma, together with a shocking technical sector at the time, today things are a bit complicated, also considering the considerable resizing of the graphics, quite far from the jaw-breaking effect of a long time ago. The new Strider therefore appears more humble than the old classic, arrives on tiptoe but then proves to be more complex and multifaceted than the original, thanks to the ~metroidvania~ style structure that the developers have chosen to give a further boost to a classic setting that would have otherwise proved too dry and light to be able to find its space within the current videogame panorama. Up and down Kazakh City When it comes to the original spirit, one must try to imagine the impact that Strider could have had in 1989: those who saw it at the time (in its complete arcade form, if possible, not in one of the ~lame~ conversions for home computers) probably saw it will remember well, given that the Capcom action game had a spectacular impact, given by a top-level graphics sector and by the speed of the action. Nowadays such a situation is difficult to replicate, especially with that structure, therefore the new Strider must necessarily aim to stimulate different strings, which does not mean diminish its scope. If on the one hand the technical aspect betrays a clearly modest level of production, on the other hand the new metroidvania structure amplifies and deepens the gameplay, giving new impulses to the player with the need to carefully explore the vast levels and thus dose frenetic action , platforms and search for passages. As per tradition, Hiryu progresses in the game by expanding his powers with the evolution of the Cypher sword and secondary and special attacks, usually obtainable following boss fights and capable of increasing the protagonist's movement and interaction capabilities with various scenery elements, thus opening up new access points and sections of levels. Most of the power-ups are necessary and contextual to linear progress in the game, but other power-ups, such as the extensions of life and attack energy, can be hidden in more or less remote places of the levels, thus guaranteeing additional objectives for explore patterns further. The problem, in this sense, is that Strider is actually neither Castlevania nor Metroid. The two titles that are mentioned together (even inappropriately) to identify this hybrid genre are in turn based on characteristics that are difficult to replicate, including very particular atmospheres and a careful study of level design, two elements that are present in Strider, but in rather limited extent compared to such great masters. Strider's characterization was excellent for a fast and frenetic action hack and slash arcade, but it appears rather monotonous and stretched within levels made wider and more complicated, in which backtracking also occupies a certain portion of gameplay, watering down the stimulus to complete exploration of all steps. Ultimately, the classic action between the platforms, which in Strider also allows interesting approaches given Hiryu's ability to climb on the various surfaces, fails to maintain exciting rhythms and situations in a constant manner during the long crossing, even if there are adrenaline-pumping elements in the gameplay. Years go by but Hiryu doesn't change his approach to problems: he swords everyone in the face with Strider Raging Blade They have remained intactsome of the distinctive elements of the original, such as the speed of the action and the great mobility of the protagonist. One of the major reasons for exaltation also in this new Strider is given by the pleasure of controlling a character characterized by this great capacity for movement, further amplified by the use of polygonal graphics, which increases the dynamism of the action, underlining it with slight changes of shot, zoom and fluidity of animations. The game progressively introduces new types of enemies that require different approaches, even if in the vast majority of cases it is a question of hitting with fast and increasingly powerful slashing thanks to the evolution of Cypher, with charged shots to break the defenses of more armored opponents or use throwing and long-range secondary weapons. In any case, the proposed solutions are many and continuing from level to level, Hiryu transforms more and more into a multipurpose war machine, with the activation of the various power-ups and secondary abilities that are conquered above all by knocking down the various bosses. The standard action tends to be a bit monotonous due to the lack of differentiation between the normal enemies encountered around the levels but the level of challenge meets significant peaks precisely in correspondence with the bosses, which are strongly anchored to the classic tradition of this kind, with increasing difficulty and the need to memorize the attack patterns in order to figure them out. Occasionally the game puts us in front of some sorts of puzzles to be solved in order to advance, usually linked to the activation of devices of various types or to the execution of particularly precise movements, but in general these are rather basic solutions in the action genre platformer of this type, something that still manages to balance the otherwise raging monotony of the run-jump-attack succession. The exploration of the vast environments, supported by a very clear and effective level mapping system, also allows you to find hidden objects that unlock extra content, as regards bonus materials such as costumes, sketches, information and more to deepen your knowledge of the game or change the appearance of the protagonist, or real additional game elements such as new alternative modes, which further enrich the playful offer and offer concrete stimuli for in-depth research of hidden objects. The additional modes represent real mini-games focused in particular on survival against progressive waves of enemies or on completing level fragments in the shortest possible time. Xbox 360 goals There are 30 unlockable achievements for a total of 400 points to add to your gamerscore in Strider. Following the double soul of classic action and exploration platform, the objectives are divided equally between those that are collected simply by continuing in the story, knocking down bosses and reaching particular points of interest and those that must be discovered by exploring the various levels in depth, rewarding therefore the most constant and perfectionist players. Strider's two and a half sizes Technological evolution has brought the third dimension to Strider's graphics sector as a gift, but it is an exclusively aesthetic addition. In fact, the setting of the game remains faithfully anchored to the canons of the 2D multidirectional scrolling arcade action game, with the application of polygonal graphics according to the classic ~2.5D~ style, i.e. with the depth of field used to build a perspective system suitable for building complex sets. This graphic solution, applied to the character models, above all allows a much more fluid and coherent management of the animations, linking them together in a very convincing way. On this aspect, as we previously reported, the work done by Double Helix is remarkable, especially as regards respect for the original: Hiryu's animations between running, jumping, climbing and slashing are clear homages to the Strider of the '89, taking up some iconic elements of the vintage sprite movements and translating them into an excellent three-dimensional interpretation. The evaluation of the technical sector cannot ignore the observation that it is a production destined for the digital market, therefore of lower value than a standard triple A, yet the care taken by the team in the reconstruction of the original atmospheres is remarkable, especially in the direct references to the original, such as the reproduction of Kazakh City or bosses such as the flying dragon Ouroboros. There are, however, notable ups and downs in this fra as wellngent, with an even excessive repetition of scenery elements to cover the wide distances of levels of great extension and in general not always very inspired backgrounds, as well as the models of different enemies. Nothing particular to report regarding the soundtrack, which accompanies the action without particular jolts but in line with the classic arcade style that pervades the game.", "date": "2014-02-18", "grade": "7.8"}
