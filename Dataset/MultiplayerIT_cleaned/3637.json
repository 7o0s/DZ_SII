Here on the pages of Multiplayer.it we have been rather critical about it in the past, but things could change with this Five Nights at Freddy's VR: Help Wanted, a real compendium of the series that promises to be even more frightening thanks to the immersion guaranteed by virtual reality: so let's see in our review if we are talking about an actually better product that can also intrigue skeptics or if vice versa it is a mere fanservice. A quiet round of terror As mentioned at the beginning, Five Nights at Freddy's VR: Help Wanted is not a real new chapter, but rather a collection of the contents of the first three episodes of the series with some additions and variations created specifically for the occasion. For those who have no idea what we are talking about, let's summarize that the game puts the user in the role of a night watchman of the Freddy Fazbear's Pizza pizzeria who will have to try to survive five ominous work shifts (from midnight to six in the morning ) during which the local animatronic puppets will come to life and try to kill him. The peculiarity of the series is that everything takes place in the restaurant's surveillance room, with the player who can only monitor the movements of the automatons through a series of video cameras and take mild countermeasures to resist until dawn, being careful not to consume before of time the energy that feeds the various devices in the room. The peculiar atmosphere of tension that was already felt in the previous titles is certainly enhanced in this version for virtual reality: constantly look around to identify possible threats and move the controllers (playing with the DualShock is also allowed, but evidently everything works better using two Moves ) to press keys, collect objects and pull levers gives a whole other flavor to the gameplay, with the audio doing a fundamental job of increasing the feeling of anguish. Playstation 4 trophies There are only 15 trophies made available by Five Nights at Freddy's VR: Help Wanted, divided between one platinum, nine gold and five silver: to obtain them it is necessary to complete all the levels offered by the game and perform some peculiar actions, nothing special too complicated anyway. However, all that glitters is not gold, and Five Nights at Freddy's VR: Help Wanted lends itself to old and new critical issues. Despite the contribution of virtual reality, the gameplay always remains extremely meager and decidedly not suitable for everyone, a discourse that can also be extended to the elusive horror effect of the product: the writer is by no means insensitive to the subject, however the The effect of the jump scares wore off in a short time, soon becoming a trivial habit rather than a cause for real tension. Not even the work done with the control system was flawless: using the Moves is fun, but on more than one occasion you feel the lack of a more precise detection of your movements. Conversely, in terms of the amount of content, you can't really complain, given that Five Nights at Freddy's VR: Help Wanted offers all four scenarios of the first three chapters of the series plus four distinct mini-games, each divided into different levels: in Dark Rooms you have to light up a puppet with a torch before it can reach you, in Parts and Service you have to repair the various automatons being careful not to touch their sensitive parts, in Vent Repair you have to fine-tune the ventilation ducts of the restaurant without getting caught from an enemy and in Night Terrors you have to survive in a bedroom instead of the usual surveillance room. Considering that each mode offers a difficult version to unlock, that there are secret tapes to discover everywhere and even a reward system to be obtained by collecting gold coins, it is evident that Five Nights at Freddy's VR: Help Wanted definitely offers a lot of bread for the teeth of fans of the series: all the others can instead run the serious risk of remaining indifferent to this remarkable offer.", "date": "2019-06-06", "grade": "7.0"}
