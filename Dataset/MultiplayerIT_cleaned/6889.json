{"name": "Asfalto infinito", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/138165-asphalt-overdrive-asfalto-infinito.html", "text": "Let's say it like it is: endless runners, one of the most inflated genres on the App Store and Google Play, exist mostly because it's relatively easy to make them. You don't need a huge budget, you don't need teams made up of dozens of people: simply, once the assets have been created, all you need is an engine that ~mixes~ them randomly, gradually increasing the speed of the action. Then that this type of production has enjoyed stratospheric success, see the various Temple Run and Jetpack Joyride, is another matter. Well, lately we have been witnessing a sort of trend reversal by one of the most prolific software houses on the mobile scene, Gameloft. Just a few days after the release of the excellent Spider-Man Unlimited, in fact, the French house has released an extremely similar title, the present Asphalt Overdrive, effectively competing on its own. So let's try to understand what we're talking about: both the Spider-Man tie-in just mentioned and the endless-based spin-off of the Asphalt series are games that belong to the same genre but which revolutionize the mechanics in many ways, aiming on a traditional progression system, with missions and levels, rather than the ~single game~ where the only goal is to cover as much distance as possible. In short, it is not a matter of endless runners properly so called, but of action games that share that type of setting and controls, however projecting these contents with a view to a structure that does not end in a single attempt. In the case of Asphalt Overdrive there is certainly the strong appeal of the racing franchise, which in the arcade field has very few competitors on iOS, Android and Windows Phone, but it is good to clarify how the experience here is profoundly different compared to the normal episodes of the series . Our car is in fact controlled by simple ~swipes~ of the finger on the screen to change its trajectory with respect to two or three ~lanes~ which are often invaded by obstacles that we have the task of avoiding. Asphalt Overdrive is an endless runner that is not endless, with many missions and modes but some limits You need speed The control of the car in Asphalt Overdrive is identical to that of the Wall Climber in Spider-Man Unlimited, even if the responsiveness of the change of direction probably depends on the model of the car we are driving and it happens quite often that the response to the inputs is not punctual as it should, creating rather frustrating situations. Yes, because speed is everything in the game and you have to try not to make any mistakes, otherwise you'll be rammed by the police cars that chase you during games in standard mode. Also in the other variants, those in which it is necessary to perform a certain number of stunts or eliminate a certain number of cars along the way, the concept of timer is very present and pushes the accelerator a lot on the upgrades, which must be purchased using the game's virtual currency and which are unlocked quite quickly, at least within the first of the five available areas. In fact, during our tests we noticed two limits attributable to the freemium nature of the experience: the first is represented by the now inevitable ~action points~, which are spent every time we attempt a mission and are recharged over time (or by resorting to the valuable, gold bars, which can only be obtained in a certain amount through in-app purchase); the second gives a questionable balance of difficulty precisely as regards the final stages of each area, given that it becomes impossible to complete all the missions using the first car we bought and this forces us to carry out a long and tedious grinding to be able to afford another car with which to finally pass the tests that remain before the jump to the next category. Added to this is a systematic repetitiveness of the situations, because the types of missions in the end are always the same. Although it is decidedly more attractive and deeper than a normal endless runner, equipped as it is with a respectable technical sector in terms of fluidity, detail and effects, In short, Asphalt Overdrive fails to offer the same variety as Spider-Man Unlimited and suffers due to of a rather limiting freemium approach. That said, the quality of the game is indisputable and should at least be tested.", "date": "2014-09-29", "grade": "7.0"}
