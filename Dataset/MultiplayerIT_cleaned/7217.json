The first act of the saga, Neve Rosso Sangue, introduced the starting concept and its assumptions in the best possible way between choices, exploration and engaging turn-based combat, making a fine show of an indisputable production value, which not surprisingly earned him a a couple of important awards during the last edition of the Drago d'Oro Award, as well as a warm reception from the public and critics. We therefore eagerly awaited the release of the second act, entitled ~Hunting in the Forest~, to verify how the developers have moved on the balancing front (the adventure takes up the character we forged during the first episode), if they have considered appropriate to include a greater number of fights to increase the duration of the experience and what are, finally, the novelties with which we will have to do in this new phase. Without wanting to anticipate anything of the plot, written by Joe Dever himself, we can say that Lone Wolf will discover what is the reason that prompted his bitter enemies to attack the village of Rockstarn, coming into contact with ancient Shianti artifacts that seem to possess a terrible power . Hunt in the Woods is an excellent second act to Joe Dever's Lone Wolf miniseries The king of the forest Having retrieved the first act save, we found ourselves exploring a completely new map, which makes each location freely explorable when it is unlocked, as in the previous episode, but which in the same way includes an unknown number of random fights, in full classic RPG style. You can try to exploit them to obtain resources from killed Giaks and Drakkars, but this is a risky bet, given that the game is quite challenging even on the normal difficulty level. Let's say that the first clashes slide without problems, even more so if you have built a Lone Wolf devoted more to physicality than to reasoning, preferring a heavy mace to an agile sword; however the enemies quickly become more cunning and are often joined by reinforcement troops which make battles much more complex, also in terms of petty strategy: we will have to understand which target to attack first, which one to try to paralyze, when to exploit Kai techniques and when wield the powerful Sword of the Sun, which now has a second special attack, capable of causing damage to all opponents on the screen instead of just one. It is also important to pay attention to your equipment, repairing your weapons and armor when they are damaged so you don't have to throw them away, as well as always having some healing potions on hand. During the adventure we will be called to make choices, some of which will give rise to crossroads that allow a certain degree of replayability. The longer duration of the chapter is in any case the result of a discreet graft of fights, probably present in as many as possible in order not to run into the opposite problem, i.e. their sporadic nature, as instead it seemed to us to happen in the first act. In addition to the padlocks to be forced with the lock pick and the dagger, a new puzzle has been introduced, while on the enemy front there are now also the huge Gourgaz, reptiles capable of inflicting huge damage and with a considerable repertoire of moves. The technical sector has seen the addition of some animations for the protagonist which only reaffirm the picture of excellence of the product, accompanied moreover by a splendid soundtrack, while there has been a work of optimization of the touch controls which has in fact eliminated the uncertainties in the quick time events that we had instead encountered in ~Neve Rosso Sangue~.", "date": "2014-04-03", "grade": "9.0"}
