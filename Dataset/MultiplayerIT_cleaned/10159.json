There was no shortage of callbacks throughout the campaign but the horrific evil mutations peculiar to the forces of destruction remained completely out of the gameplay. And finally to fill this deliberate oversight here comes the first expansion for the excellent real-time strategy game created by the Canadian software house and which responds to the title of Chaos Rising. An expansion in the most classic of the term: sold in stand-alone format (that is, it is not necessary to own and have Dawn of War II installed) at a price of just under 35, it literally expands the original game both in single player and in multiplayer component. Chaos and destruction And let's start with the single-player campaign. This picks up exactly where Dawn of War II ended, a couple of months after the defeat of the Tyranids by the Blood Ravens, the Space Marine chapter led by the player and commanded by Captain Gabriel Angelos. An icy and ruined planet appears from the Warp, the ultra-dimensional universe where the souls of living beings are deformed and torn apart to transform themselves into demons and warriors of Chaos. The terraqueous globe appears to be uninhabited but a strange automatic help message makes it immediately clear that it is Aurelia, the home planet of the Blood Raven chapter. From here on, the story tends to become believably and fascinatingly complicated and revolve around a clash of increasing intensity between the Space Marines and the forces of Chaos in a desperate quest to uncover a traitor within the ranks of the Empire. If it weren't already clear, Chaos Rising is dedicated body and soul to those who have already finished Dawn of War II and, despite the brief introduction which also serves as a summary and summary of what happened in the original game, approach the series starting from this expansion it is extremely difficult. The title immediately throws you into the heart of the action with all squadrons in full force and in the midst of a rather chaotic mission. Sure, there's a minimal tutorial that serves more than anything else to refresh your memory, but finding yourself immediately managing 4 different high-level squadrons full of different skills is quite complex if you haven't played Dawn of War II. And among other things, the numerous references and constant references to the original story are lost. At the beginning of the Chaos Rising campaign it will be possible to import that of the previous game or start from scratch. In the first case we will keep the experience and skill points spent during the game, starting without a ~history~ instead we will start with all the heroes at level 18 and the points already spent on the recommended skills. However, it will be possible to reset them once to spend them as you prefer. In both cases we will have brand new equipment: a good initial selection to arm the battalions of the various Cyrus, Thaddeus, Thule, Avitus and so on, all ready to return in splendid form on their way towards the thirtieth level, cap of this expansion. The story develops in a credible and convincing way, full of all the lore that made the universe famous and is narrated through a small handful of computer graphics sequences and through the long dialogues that prepare the various missions during the phase on board the 'battlecruiser of the Blood Ravens where, compared to Dawn of War II we will have the optional possibility to listen to more dialogues between the squadrons and have more in-depth details on the scenarios that host the battles. Corrupt are born or made? The bad guy on duty this time is the Lord of Chaos Eliphas the Inheritor, who had already been heard of in the original game and who we will finally meet not before having fought and defeated a couple of his personal bodyguards. It will take at least ten hours to reach the end playing on the medium difficulty level and there are about fifteen missions of which 4-5 are completely optional and to be tackled within a certain period of time. Just compared to Dawn of War 2, Chaos Rising's missions are much more substantial and longer, offer a higher variety of situations and are not resolved in the usual structure ~conquer respawn points as you approach the boss of the map to be defeated ~. There are timed missions, other rescue missions and an interesting variation on the theme on the occasion of the final fight where we are againwe will also find ourselves in command of two Space Marine tanks. The real novelty of Chaos Rising, outside of a brand new character, Jonah the Librarian, a sort of ranged combat mage who can be equipped with tomes to grant buffs and special abilities to all squadrons, however, is obviously the Chaos. During the missions, our Space Marines will be able to earn corruption points depending on their behavior in completing the secondary objectives. These points will automatically unlock six different talents from squadron to squadron. These are general bonuses or real new skills and competences that will sometimes replace existing ones. In addition to behavior in battle, corruption will also increase by equipping corrupted gear (which sometimes has a certain level of chaos as a requirement) and even by not bringing down in a mission some characters who, in frustration, will behave like insubordinates. The system in general works quite well, it will not be easy or reach the maximum level of corruption to unlock the ultimate ability, let alone remain faithful to the emperor's will and based on this value on the final there will also be different epilogues. A small rethinking of the equipment discard system is also interesting which, while on the one hand it can still be ~thrown~ to gain experience, now sees the addition of items that must necessarily be discarded to offer permanent bonuses to stats or very rare items and the same corrupted equipment can very often be donated to the archives to be transformed into the same higher level item (but with even higher requirements). In general, the notes to move to the gameplay of Chaos Rising are minimal being in all respects, as already mentioned in the course of the review, the natural continuation of what was seen in Dawn of War II. Perhaps it seemed to us that the difficulty level is on average easier, also thanks to the very high level with which our troops start and in general a very high availability of new equipment in the form of loot. This leads to less use of covers, the real spearhead of the gameplay of the latest strategy games made by Relic. There is a greater tendency to go into disarray with all the troops, focusing micro-management more on the use of the various skills than organizing the squadrons to exploit the morphology of the terrain. And then, but here it is almost personal, a few more missions against the Orks would not have been bad, given that the focus is practically all on the army of Chaos and minimally on the Eldar. Chaos me, chaos you! More numerous are the innovations that have invested the multiplayer of Dawn of War II thanks to the implementations made with Chaos Rising. First of all, the new Chaos faction has been added to the classic competitive multiplayer, bringing the selectable races to 5. Also in this case, in the selection phase it will be possible to choose between three different heroes, the Chaos Lord devoted to the offensive and linked to the deity Khorne, the Plague Champion for those who prefer a defensive fight and feel dedicated to the god Nurgle and finally the Chaos Sorcerer, Tzeentch-devoted support hero. Also brand new is the Victory Point mode whose objective will be to conquer and hold the seven strategic areas scattered around the map to see your counter increase in increasing speed. The first one to reach 1000 points wins. The seven new maps included are dedicated precisely to this gameplay that can be faced in a reflective 1 vs 1 and in a more frenetic and very fun 2 vs 2 vs 2. The game structure remains the same: a central base from which to train new units that can then be upgraded directly on the field by spending the relic and energy points that can be collected by conquering the structures scattered around the map. What distinguishes the Chaos faction, in addition to an even more advanced micromanagement of the troops, is the possibility of summoning heretics who can be placed to pray on the altars to gain access to units or special bonuses depending on the selected hero. The previous factions have also undergone a micro-makeover in terms of balance with the help of 5 brand new units, 1 for Space Marines, Eldar and Orks and 2 for the Tyranids. Also included in Chaos Rising is the Last Stand mode released quite recently in Dawn of War 2 via DLC and here obviously enriched with a hero for Chaos. It is a cooperative multiplayer where each player selects his own hero to fight in the company of other people growing waves of adventures.computerized pours in very small arenas. As you progress through the gameplay, you earn experience points, level up and unlock new equipment and skills to better customize your avatar. Among other things, Chaos Rising will be perfectly compatible in multiplayer even with owners of Dawn of War II only, given that all the new features will be implemented in the original title through a free patch that will be released at the time of the expansion's release. Obviously those who own the prequel will not have access to the Chaos faction but will only be able to clash against it. Two small words should also be spent on the technical aspect of Chaos Rising. Relic's graphics engine, the same one born with Company of Heroes, is now at the highest level of optimization: it runs smoothly and best manages the incredible particle effects, explosions, light effects and the excellent physics of the scenarios and units. On the test computer at 1920x1200 resolution with all the details set to High (there is an additional Ultra setting), there was never any uncertainty in the frame rate and the final result is quite engaging, especially in the most excited moments. The audio sector is excellent, especially in the sound effects and in the exceptional English dubbing (only the subtitles in Italian); decidedly more sparse the soundtrack that you will forget within a few minutes, as was the case with Dawn of War II itself.", "date": "2010-03-05", "grade": "8.3"}
