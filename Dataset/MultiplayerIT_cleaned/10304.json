Safari", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/73104-jambo-safari-il-fascino-della-natura-selvaggia.html", "text": "Version tested: Nintendo WiiSEGA has earned the support of millions of fans on the one hand thanks to its commitment to the hardware field (crowned by the creation of the Dreamcast, to date the last game console of the Japanese house), on the other hand thanks to the creation of numerous highly successful arcade games. From impressive racers like Virtua Racing and Daytona USA to shooters with lightguns, passing through ultra-arcade fun like Crazy Taxi and precisely Jambo! Safari. Released in theaters in 1999 (and perhaps also not very well known in Italy for this reason), the game took up the ~timed~ structure of Crazy Taxi by applying it to a completely different context, that of the ~safari~, with boundless expanses where tigers, lions, lynxes and zebras. The cabinet was equipped with a standard steering wheel, two-speed gearbox and accelerator and brake pedals, and the goal of each game was clear: you had to capture as many wild animals as possible using a lasso and a series of cages. The gameplay revolved around the different reactions of each beast in the face of capture, and required the player to have impeccable control of the vehicle as well as a particular sensitivity in the use of the rope to avoid breaking it during the most agitated phases. In the old factory... The Wii conversion was entrusted to the English team Full Fat, which was asked to transform an adrenaline-pumping but limited arcade into a broader experience, with clear educational facets because it was intended for a very young audience. In short, it is not surprising the presence of two difficulty levels (easy and difficult) designed respectively for players aged less or more, nor the almost total absence of violent approaches and cages, the latter replaced by nice colored nets that descend on the prey with a magical shimmer. Once the game has started, we can choose whether to try our hand at single player mode or party mode. The latter consists of four different minigames that can be played by a minimum of two to a maximum of four people in split screen, but which in no way constitute a pleasant extra due to their mediocre quality. The ~ostrich race~, for example, is a simple obstacle course characterized by a control system that to define questionable is an understatement: you have to hold the Wii-mote horizontally and shake it forwards and backwards so that our ostrich always runs faster, but at the same time you have to shake the controller to make a jump. It follows the total impossibility of running without jumping, as well as the almost total lack of precision. Things don't get better in the ~Jambo ball~ minigame, a very sad ~football game~ in which we are aboard a jeep and we have to try to collide with a giant ball in an attempt to send it into the net before our opponents. The useless ~throwing the stone~ and the dignified ~suricasino~ complete the picture, a sort of miniature puzzle game in which we have to control the movement of some rodents on a board so that they can collect fruit and deposit them in certain boxes. The law of the pack The single player mode in some ways takes up the original coin-op, but the daring chases are now only part of the experience. After choosing a character among the four available (two males and two females, but the difference is only in appearance), we find ourselves inside the ranch with three buildings that we can visit at any time: the house, the garage and the enclosure. The house is the place where the conquered trophies are displayed (the game has a rather rich and varied achievement system), but above all where we can customize the appearance of our alter ego by buying new hairstyles and new clothing. In the garage we can manage the vehicles at our disposal and upgrade them by adding rims, tyres, reinforced bumpers and more. Of course it is also possible to apply paints. Finally, the enclosure is a sort of small clinic where we take care of injured or sick animals, and then eventually free them again. The care practices are carried out through a series of nice minigames that mimic a Trauma Center, obviously without equaling the Atlus title in terms of thickness and quality. Finally, at the limits of the ranch, a map is available that shows us the territories open to our exploration and those still ~off limits~. Leaving this free zone aboard the jeep finally means jumping headlong into the action, which in Jambo! Safari involves completing a number of simple missions which sometimes involve the capture of determinesanimals, but which also include photo sessions, timed challenges, etc. Run and throw The action that the arcade game was based on has remained intact, but has become generally easier to adapt to the new target audience. To catch the animals we have to chase them and get to a short distance, then swing the lasso (mimicking the movement with the Wii-mote) and throw it at the right time (by shaking the controller downwards). Once the prey has been hooked, it is necessary to act on the trigger B in a delicate way to prevent the rope from breaking, then get closer and throw a net which marks the end of the operation: if the animal is sick or injured, we can send it to the ~fence~ and then go find it. Unfortunately the control system, which in the intentions of the developers should have made this conversion as engaging as the original, is based on solutions that are far from spot on and ends up undermining the enjoyment of an experience that is already too simple and limited in itself. In the first place, assigning the accelerator and brake to the back keys of the Nunchuck makes driving the jeep cumbersome and not very intuitive, while the lasso management and throwing system does not react precisely to our inputs, forcing us to often repeat the movements for things to go well. Added to this is a technical realization that leaves much to be desired, decidedly lower than the coin-op of ten years ago, spoiled by a dancer frame rate but above all by a poor polygonal count both in the scenarios and in the animal models.", "date": "2009-12-18", "grade": "6.0"}
