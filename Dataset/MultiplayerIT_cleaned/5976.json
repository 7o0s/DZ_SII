{"name": "Autobot di platino", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/157451-transformers-devastation-autobot-di-platino.html", "text": "Transformers: Devastation came out in America last week, and a few days ago in Europe too, and practically no one noticed. At first we didn't understand why Activision had advertised it so little, publishing trailer after trailer only in the last days before its release and above all through social networks, without even sending review codes to editors like ours, almost as if to hide it , almost as if he were ashamed of it. Yes, it's short, very short: we completed the campaign in about four hours. Yes, graphically it's really spartan: forget the complex and super detailed models of The War for Cybertron or the Michael Bay films, God forbid. Yes, the combat system is amazing: a rose water Bayonetta, with the most loved robots in the world instead of witches. The Tony Hawk Pro Skater 5 debacle could explain this attitude if only Transformers: Devastation was a bad game which it absolutely isn't. Indeed, for a Generation 1 fan, it's like a dream come true, and a photo is enough to awaken that dormant child even in the most elderly of thirty-year-olds, reminding him of the past Christmases transforming and re-transforming the robots found under the tree. . Transformers: Devastation is the gaming dream of all Generation 1 fans Autobots... on the march! While the third person shooter of High Moon Studios (The Battle for Cybertron and The Fall of Cybertron) aimed to tell a real unfinished space opera, Transformers: Devastation is narratively much less ambitious, but manages to evoke in a much more convincing way the atmospheres of the animated series produced in the 80s. The Japanese developer has chosen the so-called Generation 1 for a whole series of reasons also related to graphics and gameplay, probably, and in doing so he has skilfully touched the heartstrings of the older ones, telling a story that is all in all simple but no less captivating. just like it was a slightly longer episode of the cartoon. The Decepticons led by Megatron have attacked the city, and a team of Autobots made up of Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Wheeljack, Sideswipe and Grimlock intervene to stop them. Those who live there, in this city, are never seen; what this city is called, we don't know, even if at a certain point we will have to fight on a bridge very similar to the Golden Gate. The Italian localization is of excellent workmanship: it takes up the local adaptation, but keeps the original names of the various Cybertronians. No Commander or Tyran, therefore, but after all many new fans don't even know that Bumblebee we called him Beetle, so it's better that way. What leaps to the ear of a true fan, however, is the dubbing: Peter Cullen and Frank Welker are again to lend their historical voices to Optimus and Megatron, transforming each of their lines into a dive into the sea of nostalgia, especially for what concerns the leader of the Autobots, given that Cullen manages to make even a sneeze epic. Transformers: Devastation is full of cutscenes, and the story it wants to tell is certainly not obvious given that there are some twists, especially at the end, and a ~post credits~ wink at a possible sequel. This does not mean that, especially in the last missions, we begin to realize that something is not working, and that perhaps Platinum Games would have needed more time also to better dilute the plot: the last stages last a breath, offering only a few fights and various bosses interspersed with confused kinematics, as if at that point the story became a kind of mosaic in which the developer wanted to give a very personal touch to an after all traditional episode of the cartoon. However, the result leaves you satisfied, thanks also and above all to the stylistic choice of cel shading, which essentially makes the game an interactive cartoon, and to a truly creepy soundtrack, which accompanies every battle in rock time. Robots or witches? If in the latest video games dedicated to Transformers we spent most of the time shooting, in Devastation the emphasis is placed entirely on melee combat, and those who have played at least Bayonetta or Metal Gear Revengeance already know what to expect. Indeed, it would not be wrong to consider Devastation as a ~rose water~ Bayonetta 2: less spectacular, perhaps, and less profound, as well, but just as intuitive, fun and technical. Every fight in Devastation is music to the ears and a feast for the eyes; on our configuration the Platinum Games title ran smoothly without ever losing a single frame, thanks also to the graphics sector which at first glance may appear spartan but,Loyalty aside, it allowed the developer to commit to gameplay without giving too much weight to details, textures and polygons. If the Transformers of High Moon Studios and Michael Bay's films were a riot of rotating gears and self-propelled mechanical plates, those of Platinum Games rely on a simple and linear character design, which allows enormous flexibility in terms of animations. As a result, the clashes are real ballets in which the huge robots fight each other with kicks, punches and wheels. In fact, it is enough to press a simple key when the appropriate indicator appears on the screen to transform in the middle of a combo and literally run over the opponent, and outside of the combos the same key allows you to assume the vehicular form and perhaps distance yourself or move quickly from one point to another on the battlefield. The clashes are extremely frenetic, yet we never lose sight of our character or his targets: the scene is always very clear despite the explosions and effects that follow each interaction, and the camera follows it without hesitation. In this sense, the game certainly does not lack in terms of communication. Enemy attacks, for example, are telegraphed by a short flash that anticipates their impact, and if the player presses the dodge/transformation key at the right time, he can trigger the so-called Focus, practically Bayonetta's Temporal Sabbat, i.e. a window of a few moments during which time passes in slow motion and it is possible to strike the enemy with impunity. As the fights become more complicated, deploying stronger enemies and increasingly tough bosses, the use of Focus becomes absolutely essential, and so does the knowledge of the many combos and special moves available from the start or purchasable in the Ark of Autobots. This does not mean, however, that the fights take place only at close range, given that each Autobot can also equip long-range weapons such as pistols or cannons: since there is no lock-on, you have to rely on a really weak targeting system, which makes melee shots much more effective and engaging, although we still have to resort to firearms to destroy certain mines at a safe distance or shoot down the Decepticon Seekers who bombard us from above. No Decepticons around here The Transformers: Devastation campaign is divided into seven chapters, in turn divided into various missions which, to tell the truth, are nothing more than the fights to be faced when exploring the area on duty. As we said earlier, the last two or three missions last very little and are set in very restricted areas, but the first chapters take place in the city, at different times of the day, and offer a glimmer of free roaming, allowing the player to wander around roam the map freely and battle random enemies, solve some simple environmental puzzles, open chests, and collect collectibles galore. Once again, there is the clear sensation that the game is, so to speak, ~incomplete~: the map, for example, has a disarming lay-out, made up as it is of buildings, alleys and platforms that are all the same, and the sense of repetitiveness takes over by force especially when Platinum Games forces you to travel the streets at full speed to chase a fleeing target, mimicking racing games without really succeeding. In the beginning, in short, it seems that Transformers: Devastation wants to be something more than a simple ~brawler~, and later it is as if Platinum Games has lost the determination (or the funds, make vobis) in pursuing the same goal in the span of four or five hours. It's also arguable, in fact, that you can only play as the Autobots. If the High Moon Studios titles allowed the campaign to be tackled both from the point of view of the heroes and from that of their antagonists, the Platinum Games title in this sense is strict: the player is with the good guys, and beats the bad guys. End. And this, despite the fact that the ~bad guys~ have combos and special moves that would have made them perfectly playable. Maybe not all: it goes without saying that the flagship of Devastation are the boss fights, and not so much with historical villains like Starscream, Soundwave or Shockwave, who have all their historical skills, but with gigantic gestalts like Devastator or Menasor. Taking on the Constructicons time and time again, only to see them combine into one of the most iconic robots in entertainment history is nothing short of thrilling, as is dodging his every blow, riddle him with bullets and bring him to his knees beforebut to deliver a deadly hammer to his head. From the point of view of weapons, in fact, Transformers: Devastation plays a dirty trick with the promise of a ~loot system~ that practically recalls Diablo III but which fails to express itself fully. As well as the campaign structure or the script, this part of the game also seems to have been developed in a bit of a hurry. Basically, by defeating enemies and opening the chests, there are dozens and dozens of weapons, classified by level and rarity: each of them alters not only the appearance of the Autobot, but also the animations and execution of its attacks. Devastator's drills, for example, allow you to launch very rapid combos and can be loaded and thrown from a distance, while two-handed hammers are much slower, but also much more damaging with each blow. Between swords, axes, fist weapons and so on, there is certainly no lack of variety, but the frequency with which these loots are collected soon makes their usefulness superfluous, also because each weapon can be upgraded by consuming the other weapons : by doing so, the base weapon becomes stronger, and eventually acquires the bonus skills related to worn weapons. The system is not very clear, and the tutorial is rather superficial, leaving the player at the mercy of a real ~trial and error~ process, but in essence, once we have found the weapon we like, especially if it is rare and good quality, hardly pass on to anything else. The same goes for the ~chips~ that you can craft through a rather embarrassing minigame and equip to enjoy various bonuses. All, obviously, in the name of replayability: Devastation doesn't last long, we want to reiterate it, and perhaps this explains its budget price, but Platinum Games titles aim at an audience that loves to play and replay the same missions at different levels of difficulty, in search of the best score and perfect execution. That's why it's possible to choose which Autobots to face each mission or challenge with, as their skills, combos and ultimate techniques change drastically, forcing a completely different approach from character to character.", "date": "2015-10-13", "grade": "7.9"}
