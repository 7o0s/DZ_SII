{"name": "Lost Dimension", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/155780-lost-dimension-verso-la-fine-del-mondo.html", "text": "The beginning of Lost Dimension, a turn-based RPG developed by Lancarse, fully falls within the definition of a Japanese classic. The super villain of the moment appears out of nowhere with mysterious cosmic powers and grants humanity thirteen days of time, after which the end of the world will unleash. Fortunately, the mysterious figure takes care to reveal the only way to stop him and we are not surprised to discover that the key to saving humanity is to kill him. The undertaking promises to be decidedly difficult but luckily for us the world can count on S.E.A.L.E.D. agents. who report to the United Nations and are endowed with extraordinary abilities. This is what is told to us by a rather well animated introduction, even if characterized by a hasty cut that does not make it particularly engaging. Fortunately, things change with the subsequent scenes that finally introduce us to the characters and put us face to face with the strange figure with astral powers, who seems to have a mysterious plan that transcends the mere threat of destroying the earth. The villain himself, whose name is a self-evident The End, welcomes the protagonists in the Pillar, a megalithic vertical structure that must be climbed by facing not only henchmen and drones but by submitting to a terrible condition posed by the enigmatic and apparently cruel super villain. In fact, the group of eleven S.E.A.L.E.D agents charged with saving the planet has no hope of reaching the top floor of the tower intact. Each floor of the building requires a sacrifice that must be decided in full reality show style, with a spectacular vote that depends on our direct decision and that of the other team members. And this is where an authentic RPG dynamic comes into play, which comes to life in a lobby where we can interact with the ten agents who accompany us on the mission. The dialogues allow us to strengthen our ties with the companions or to understand the motivations of the latter who, The End warns us to add a little more spice to the already thorny situation, could be traitors. Finding out who sold out and getting others to vote against the traitors could save our conscience from burdensome decisions. Or we could fall into a deception. To find out, the only thing is to listen carefully to the numerous dialogues that show us markedly characterized characters, ranging from the classic cynical scientist to extremely determined women passing through depressed young people and wild madmen. Turn-based tactical gameplay is just one of the ingredients of the complex Lost Dimension Playstation 3 trophies Although the Lost Dimension trophies are not particularly complicated to obtain some such as obtaining the S rating in all missions and performing five Assist Attacks may require some effort. Furthermore, a single playthrough is not enough to platinum the Lancarse title. This is because some achievements are related to the social dynamics that ask us to form relationships with characters potentially corrupted by The End but some trophies can only be obtained by identifying all the traitors before the final fight. The importance of sacrifice The importance of the narrative component of Lost Dimension highlights a not exceptional English dubbing, which once again makes us regret the lack of the original Japanese accompanied by simple subtitles. Furthermore, the soundtrack does not offer memorable ideas and the animations that punctuate the narrative do not maintain the same quality as those of the introduction, but the peculiar trait that distinguishes them is not bad and still captures the attention by marrying an intriguing narrative dimension. Narration that becomes a game mechanic when it pushes the player towards a certain crossroads or leads the group to decide to eliminate a given member of the team. Unfortunately the portraits that accompany the dialogues are less convincing, veering towards the average quality of the visual novels but in this phase the dominant element is the verbal exchanges which have weight, can generate suspicions about a companion and are reflected in the ending for a intriguing narrative experience although full of those not always elegant tangles that Japanese fiction often exploits to the bitter end to obtain a surprise effect. And the game system also holds some surprises which, while respecting the canons of Japanese-style tactical RPGs and showing off a technical sector that we could define as average, chooses a path traveled by few and enriches it with some interesting touches. First of all, the game system, despite being turn-based, does not harness the movement in squares or conditional movementsonati. In fact, we can move the characters freely within a large area marked by a luminous perimeter and then decide to attack or act and therefore close the turn. Before doing so, among other things, it is always possible to reset the movement in order to position the character in the best way, in order to optimize the use of cures and attacks whose range is rather short. Among other things, losing the opportunity to use a Gift is almost a crime, given the power of these special abilities which even include the possibility of sacrificing the action of a character to make another act. With this skill called Defer it is possible to exploit twice the skill of one of the many characters who are all differentiated not only by character and silhouette but also by type of weapon and special powers. There are those who can throw flames and those who can teleport managing, in combination with the sacrifice of a companion's action, to attack an enemy apparently out of reach. Unfortunately for our characters, but this addition adds depth to the game, these special boons have a mental cost that can drive a character insane, unleashing them against the rest of the party. And that's why it's good to take advantage of the powers with measure even if these are very useful and can evolve considerably, perhaps obtaining the additional Gift points that are hidden here and there between main and secondary missions. There are also other resources that can help the six chosen characters get by, such as equipment, which can be purchased with the accumulated energy points and a good tactic that can give us potentially decisive extra attacks. We are talking about the Assist Attacks, brought automatically by characters who are in a good shooting position with respect to a target, capable of significantly speeding up fights which unfortunately do not shine, despite the interesting possibilities of the combat system. The problem concerns the lack of variety of enemies who lack aggression and are quite simple to deal with, provided you pay close attention to the movement phase, which is extremely decisive. In the finale, the difficulty suddenly rises but by facing the challenges with the right level of experience, nothing is really impossible. In any case, it is a title that thrives on giving importance to the progression of the characters; and between side quests, authentic RPG dynamics and tons of dialogue, the overall experience is decidedly enjoyable.", "date": "2015-09-09", "grade": "7.5"}
