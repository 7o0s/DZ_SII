{"name": "Virtual Skipper 5: 32nd America's Cup: Il Gioco - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/virtual-skipper-5-32nd-americas-cup-il-gioco-recensione.html", "text": "~Pumpkins, fuck the hawser!~ The famous sentence of fictional memory, showed an exhilarating scene during which the clumsy accountant tried in vain to deal with a sailboat. Similar but much less fun will be the first moments that will distinguish the gaming experience with this Virtual Skipper 5, given that in all probability the average user will not be able to move his vehicle even by a millimeter. A rather simulative approach was therefore chosen, which, regardless of the difficulty selected, poses a whole series of problems that are difficult to solve if not adequately supported by precise knowledge: for example, just know that with the ~Arcade~ settings the sails will be managed automatically , but it will still be necessary to know the difference between having fucked them up or leaving them, under penalty of a bad interpretation of the winds and therefore a certain defeat. The instruction booklet and the tutorial take care of a partial remedy, with the first well done and complete with many useful tips, while the second is too poor in explanations and superficial. Once the first obstacles have been overcome  this way of saying has never been more correct  the fun begins and you can enjoy the many options available. The nautical classes are four and range from the very fast trimarans, up to the monohull prototypes, those that compete for the America's Cup; certain competitions are linked to each, set in the most disparate bodies of water and which will culminate with the challenge to Alinghi, current holder of the world trophy. Longevity should therefore not worry and the high rate of challenge postpones the feeling of satisfaction for a long time which often causes premature disinterest. The commands are also good, which can be given via mouse or keyboard, as needed, with the latter being preferable to the former, allowing you to streamline the graphical interface and leaving more room for the boat. Surfing together As per tradition, Nadeo thought of the needs of the gamer community that would gather around this new product, providing a series of tools to facilitate its proliferation. The editor for the races is complete and guarantees the customization of every aspect: the coast can be embellished with many structures and surfaces, so as to have a more realistic horizon, while the winds and sea currents are arranged as desired, both for direction and intensity. The route is traced according to taste, placing buoys and gates where desired, being careful to respect the regulations. Once a challenge has been created, it can be tackled alone or shared with the rest of the players, through the game client itself. The actual multiplayer takes advantage of the profile that is compiled upon first activation, indicating the nickname and nationality. The proposed challenges are different, including team or fleet battles, all clearly indicated by the servers and whose rankings, global or local, can be consulted at any time. Finally, the fun MediaTracker, with which to film and then edit the replays of the most beautiful challenges, adding text, sounds and images. A matter of sensations Technically we are certainly not dealing with a masterpiece, but overall it was possible to obtain an honest result, which has the notable advantage of restoring the perception of really being on a boat. The models of the ships and their crew are accurate and rich in detail, with the sails flapping realistically according to the wind and the animations of the characters enjoying a certain variety. The sea is less convincing, whose surface is too shiny, it almost seems to be made of plastic, while the seabed has a certain charm, even if it loses quality as you get closer. There are several cameras, so as to be able to check all angles, which will get wet with water splashes and, in principle, prove to be suitable for any context. The navigation tools have a digital-like layout and are in considerable quantity, perhaps excessive and in any case greater than what would prevent one from often being confused. The sound isn't bad either, poor in music and spoken commentary but strong in credible effects, especially if you are able to listen to them with headphones. StarForce: what a passion! Like any good title developed by Nadeo, Virtual Skipper 5 also contains StarForce security software. For those not aware of it, this program has represented and for someone still represents, a wise way of protecting one's work from crackers, being hardly subject to reverse engineering operations and guaranteeing the impossibility ofocare online on official servers, with copied versions of the title. Unfortunately, the price to pay can be high, since full functionality with all readers is not guaranteed and creating some incompatibilities between programs. In the case discussed in this review, the protection is only present in the ~boxed~ release, so if there were any doubts or indecision, it is always possible to use the one that can be downloaded for a fee from the official site.

The license of the America's Cup and the new class of boats add depth to the single game, which is however only the antechamber of the multiplayer: in full Nadeo style and virtually infinite, thanks to the editor. For all the others, a trial is strongly recommended, aimed at avoiding unpleasant disappointments, especially relating to the technical aspect that is not exactly next-gen and to a learning curve that is anything but soft. Pros The America's Cup and its charm Lots of options, single and multiplayer Challenging and addictive Cons Not for everyone: both genre and difficulty Technically fair Sailing: a fascinating sport, not only for its performance or the means used, but for its unique ability to attract an absolutely loyal public willing to invest in its passion, so much so that the America's Cup has become the third international competitive event , for profits, preceded only by the Soccer World Cup and the Olympic Games. Having said that, it is evident that not everyone can afford a boat with which to sail among the waves. Nadeo  former developer of the famous TrackMania  has thought of putting a patch on this problem. With his Virtual Skipper, he proposes to virtualize most of the situations that can be faced at sea, obviously winking at the novices, but proposing a series of characteristics such as to satisfy even the most seasoned sailors. This fifth incarnation brings with it a whole new license, as can be easily guessed from the title, leaving the characteristics that have been so much appreciated in the past unchanged.", "date": "2007-05-24", "grade": null}
