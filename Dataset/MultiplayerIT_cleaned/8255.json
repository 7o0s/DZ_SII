All this despite the fact that it is not a game based on a particularly popular topic, namely that motorcycle trial which, despite the spectacular nature and skill of the riders, does not enjoy television airtime on the most important networks or the attention of the sports press. But the formula studied by the Finnish team, based on an extraordinarily high level of difficulty by modern standards, however, capable of offering enormous rewards in case of success, was well received by a certain type of audience, evidently not purely niche. Just the fact of being a sort of white fly in a videogame panorama that now prefers to focus on the narrative rather than on the challenge has allowed Trials Evolution to earn the well-deserved limelight. However, the success of an expansion is not so obvious, basically due to the fabulous editor included in the original which allowed anyone to create new tracks and share them with the community; if already in this way Trials Evolution could be considered almost infinite, and if the quality of some of the works of the aforementioned editor could very well rival that of the Finnish game designers, what need is there to buy an extra DLC? Heachache Without a doubt this is something that RedLynx itself has also reflected on, and in fact Origin of Pain (this is the name of the expansion in question) offers a good number of contents at a really affordable price: 400 Microsoft Points is a figure that leaves little space for reflection, suggesting the impulse purchase for a large part of the fans of the original. But Origin of Pain certainly does not have the flavor of the packaged product to make enthusiasts take the bait and bring some money to the cash register; on the other hand, the weight of almost a gigabyte of the dlc provides a sufficient suggestion regarding the amount of guaranteed content. Among these, let's start with the 36 new tracks: these are obviously distinct routes by difficulty, which however even for those labeled as ~easy~ immediately require a greater commitment than the analogues of the main package. The track design is obviously excellent in most cases, the result of experience and an impeccable level of refinement; where the programmers wanted to ~play their hand~ is certainly in the settings, even more extreme and absurd than in the past. On the other hand it is difficult to think otherwise when we talk about underwater sections complete with teleporters, or a world of colorful toys with abacuses, Rubik's cubes and toy cars in the background, to then move on to the next one at the edges of a coliseum and so on . With a title that can be translated as ~the origins of pain~ it is quite predictable in which way the Finnish boys have chosen to let off steam. In general it takes about 2 hours to see all the tracks and many, many more to get the gold medals. But Origin of Pain isn't just about new tracks; the most interesting novelty is in fact represented by the inclusion of a BMX bike, which obviously rides on pedals instead of a motor. The refined physics engine of Trials Evolution has made it possible to outline the differences of the new vehicle far beyond the simple aesthetic aspect: the weight and speed of the bike are in fact very different from motorcycles, and this results in the need to adopt a even more precise and careful. It is obvious that the BMX is therefore a means intended for experts, and in this sense it is particularly sad to discover that it is not possible to use it in the original tracks of the game, probably to avoid problems related to online rankings. Finally, the Origin of Pain package closes with 100 new objects for the editor, which will make the happiness of those who want to start giving vent to their creativity again, and with two skill tests (cannon launching and climbing) that are actually not overly funny. Origin of Pain is therefore a DLC that is easy to recommend for Trials Evolution fans; the price of 400 Microsoft Points appears to be fully justified, and the variety of content is sufficient both for those who want to get their hands on the editor, and for those who prefer to just run and run. The few really high difficulty levels and the non-extraordinary quality of the skill tests could slightly reduce the appeal for more experienced users, but for the ~average~ Trials Evolution player this expansion is a thumbs-up.", "date": "2012-10-16", "grade": null}
