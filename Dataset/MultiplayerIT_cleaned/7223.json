{"name": "Neon White", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/neon-white-recensione.html", "text": "A few months after our test we finally got our hands on the full version of Neon White, the action and platform game published by Annapurna Interactive. As indie fans well know, this publisher is famous for the high average quality of the games it publishes and, let's say it right away, even in this case it didn't fail: Neon White respected the good first impressions aroused this spring through the demo. Available from June 16, 2022 on PC and Nintendo Switch, Neon White will offer you a journey to a Paradise in which something doesn't add up but above all it will allow you to play a frenetic, fun and cheerful game. For all the details, keep reading our Neon White review. Suddenly Heaven Neon White takes us to Heaven For anyone who hasn't read our review, let's take a step back. We are White, a murderer who died and ended up in Heaven. No, there was no mistake and no forgiveness whatsoever: our criminal didn't earn a place in eternal bliss, but was summoned and transformed into a Neon to do the dirty work of the Believers, blessed spirits who run the nine Heavens. The work of the Neons is the elimination of Demons, cursed beings that infest Heaven, especially during the Ten Days of Judgment: this is the time we have before being hunted again, unless we become Neon number one and obtain thus a whole year's stay in Paradise. Neon Green is the antagonist of Neon White However, White is not alone and will have to try to steal Neon Green's place, while also confronting Yellow, Red, Violet and a host of other Neons. Those mentioned are old acquaintances of White, who however remembers almost nothing of the past: the adventure will therefore see us interact with these people, who seem to be friends and enemies at the same time; who can you trust? The plot and the entr'actes, in visual novel dating sim style, are mostly comical, with jokes, over the top scenes and sometimes even nonsense. However, do not expect a plot full of joy: White's stay in Paradise will reveal various dark secrets and, while snatching a smile in many dialogues, there will be dramatic events. Overall, Neon White offers a simple but enjoyable story that gives one more reason to get to the end of the game. Run, shoot, repeat Water allows us to run faster in Neon White The core of Neon White is its gameplay: run, shoot and repeat over and over and over again. Said like this it might seem uninteresting, but we assure you that it is exactly the opposite: Neon White is probably one of the funniest games of recent times, merging immediacy and the need for precision. The game is divided into levels, linear areas with an exit point: the goal is to eliminate every single enemy that is on the path and reach the end; to do this we will have a whole series of weapons on our side, represented as colored cards. That basis is a katana, but using it often means doing something wrong: the real weapons are the guns like a pistol, a machine gun, a single shot rifle, a shotgun and so on. The peculiarity is linked to the fact that all weapons have at least one special ability: the pistol, for example, allows us to jump, even in the air, while the bazooka becomes a grappling hook that pulls us in the direction in which we aimed. Using secondary skills means discarding the card, but shooting and running out of ammo also has this effect. However, you shouldn't imagine the levels of Neon White as those of a shooter, but as those of a linear 3D platform game, where each section has a specific solution. Every few steps the game gives us exactly the card we need and we will ~only~ have to understand how to use it and above all how to do it while staying on schedule. In some levels of Neon White we will have to juggle various projectiles Each level is in fact a race against time: there will be three records to beat, with the second (Gold) and the first (Ace) raising our Neon rank, which in turn serves to unlock the next levels. Neon White does not claim to get all Gold or Ace to advance, by eye half or a little less of levels beaten with a record are enough to be able to reach the end of the plot. In our case, we all got Gold / Ace until the final missions were unlocked: the difficulty is therefore not prohibitive at all. Furthermore, even if you are not a lover of record hunts and want to settle for the minimum, you will still have a reason to return to the various levels: once completed, a gift package appears inside which is necessarysario to unlock dialogues of the various characters we meet and side missions with an altering style and more difficult than those of the main storyline. The gift packages are very intelligently hidden within the levels and demand a good glance but above all to think about exploration in an alternative way. Since the completion time is secondary in this case, the gift hunt significantly transforms the experience. Which becomes more of a puzzle-platformer where we have to figure out how to get around the original design to get just the cards needed to get to the gift. This Neon White enemy charges up and then takes us out in one hit More generally, the design of the levels is always incredible: very often there are also shortcuts that we don't notice at the first attempt (obtaining Gold unlocks a hint in the level that helps us see them) and by replaying we can therefore have fun learning a new way to complete the route. These often last a few tens of seconds, so failure and restart never weigh. Loads are instantaneous within levels on PC, so don't worry about wasting time. Sadly, we can't speak for the Nintendo Switch version, which we haven't tried. We don't know if the performance, granite on PC, is valid on Nintendo's small console: 60 FPS are mandatory for Neon White and not having them could preclude the enjoyment of the game. Furthermore, playing with the controller could be unsatisfying: the precision of the mouse and keyboard cannot be beaten and Neon White needs efficient movements; we've more than once broken a record after many attempts to within a few hundredths of a second, and based on our testing with an Xbox controller, we wouldn't have made it using the analog sticks. Longevity We completed Neon White in just under nine hours, getting almost all Gold/Aces, but leaving most of the presents behind. For a 100%, we believe playtime easily approaches 15-18 hours. There is also a mode in which all the levels of the game are played in a row, adding up the times: those who love to hunt for records will have to spend a lot of time to get perfect times.", "date": "2022-06-15", "grade": "9.0"}
