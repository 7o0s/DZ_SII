The Korean Pucca has the intention of entertaining young and old by attracting eyes to her thanks to her funny behavior towards her beloved ninja, chased and covered in kisses and little hearts of love. It is inevitable to be overwhelmed by the sympathy of the character because within the title, when Pucca is unable to find or keep up with her beloved Garu, she stops and with an astonished expression, a comic cloud with the image of the beloved and the question marks that signal one's amazement! However, it is also right to dwell on the lightness of the game which somehow manages to embrace a large part of the female audience passionate about the character and above all it must be considered that it is a renowned brand with vast merchandise, from clothing to video games. kiss Me again The gameplay is managed in two dimensions and is naturally quite easy, being still a game within the reach of the little ones. Pucca: La Corsa ai Baci makes the player the helper of the protagonist, in fact among our available means we have a prehensile hand that helps Pucca in situations where jumping is not possible and like when we can only intervene with the help of a small trunk, which allows the protagonist to pass from one bank of the river to the other. We have a saber available to cut any obstacles placed along the way such as bamboo canes: even here, however, particular attention must be paid not to cross the aforementioned obstacle before it is cut, otherwise the game must be restarted and then the trick is to stop Pucca's race by pausing with the B button of the Wiimote and cutting the obstacle with the saber which, once eliminated, will leave the passage free. Another critical point are the black clouds with lightning under which we should avoid running into and electrocuting the little brunette always stopping her running through the break. The running stop of the protagonist is implemented on almost all levels where the possession of a series of objects is combined, including fans, chains or stars that serve to eliminate the ninjas who intend to put us offside, which allow, like the sword previously described, to eliminate obstacles and easily slide the levels interspersed with very simple mini-games including a puzzle or a labyrinth that manage to divert attention from the game, preventing the player from getting bored. Pucca: The Race to Kisses is divided into episodes and in each of these there is a points threshold to reach which allows us to receive prizes at the end of the game, a moment preceded by a meeting-clash between Pucca and the Bosses who can be defeated simply thanks with little tricks. The title therefore manages to mix moments of light but exciting play with those particular comic curtains typical of the animated series Pucca, and thanks to this peculiarity it could be of interest to girls as well as mothers or older sisters, thus exploiting the multiplayer mode which gives the possibility to only two players to interact in the same game. The game therefore appears to be lively and dynamic and thanks to its lightness and smoothness in an average duration ranging from two to five hours, it also grants the public a plot divided into episodes containing funny gags that give ample scope to the plot which is sometimes too childish .", "date": "2011-04-07", "grade": null}
