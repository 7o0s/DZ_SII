{"name": "Gli incubi su Kinect", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/93825-rise-of-nightmares-gli-incubi-su-kinect.html", "text": "Game requires Kinect peripheralThe relationship between hardcore gamers, so-called, and Kinect has been quite rocky from the beginning. The idea of the camera and its potential have undoubtedly attracted many users, eager to play with titles such as Dance Central or Kinect Sports, but also curious to try more complex and long-lasting experiences. After a year of waiting and with Microsoft itself more dedicated to integrating Kinect with classic titles such as Halo: Combat Evolved - Anniversary and Forza Motorsport 4, than to churning out dedicated games of greater depth, we have begun to glimpse the first signs of this potential so far only minimally expressed. After that Child of Eden which finally put together the gestures allowed by the peripheral and the mechanics of an old school shooter and that Gunstringer, released these days, we had time to play, and to finish, Rise of Nightmares, a real delirium horror by the same authors of House of the Dead, which promised a sort of first-person adventure walking through catacombs and a villa infested with monsters and quotes. Can Kinect work in a game where you have to move in a 3d environment? Is it possible that such an experiment could be successful for a software house like SEGA, which often seems to be looking for itself? On balance, it could have been better, but also much worse... A delusion Rise of Nightmares is a hellish bandwagon that takes the story of Splatterhouse, tries to give it some monsters and the air of Silent Hill (the second one) and the boss fights of the House of the Dead with energy spheres, horned beings and beams of light strictly purple. A young couple is traveling in Eastern Europe, after an argument, the girl flees in the dining car of a train populated by absurd characters and, while the hero tries to reach her, a series of increasingly disturbing signals lead to total chaos , seasoned with a train wreck that sees the absurd group of passengers gather around a bonfire in a forest and their beloved kidnapped by a monster with her head locked in a steel shell. From there you have to go through a series of chapters, divided into acts, in which you will learn about the reason for the kidnapping, the mystical experiments of a crazy surgeon and the fate of all the supporting characters in the game: the trash saga, in short. The view is subjective, moving one foot forward moves forward, while moving backwards does the opposite. By rotating the torso, the camera is oriented, putting the arms in a guard position, the framing is stopped on an enemy and the blows of the opponents are parried, to respond to which you have to fight, bare or brandishing the many weapons that are found in I go around the different levels and some of them are really crazy, as they vary from meat tenderizer, to chainsaws, grass mowers, vases and acid charged bellows. Each weapon is used by replicating the movements that would be made wielding it in reality, which comes quite naturally, and fortunately, since there are constant fights. Among other things, there is also a minimum of strategy, given that the enemies have mechanical parts that nullify the effectiveness of the blows, so that it is necessary to bring them to the ~soft~ body parts to obtain some results. Which is even more effective in cases where you have to lunge towards the screen and you realize that Kinect detects which point of the screen you are hitting towards, even with differences of a few tens of pixels. To interact with the objects in the game, since you can open doors, climb stairs and operate levers, just make the corresponding gesture, only after, however, having reached out to the indicator on the screen to confirm the interaction with the object same. This is undoubtedly a mistake because it is difficult to accept the idea of having to confirm the opening of a door, first by imposing the hand, and it marks a distance between the player and the setting itself, but being that one often fights close to of the doors, for example, we see that the team has not had the opportunity to think of an alternative way to avoid that during a fight we found ourselves opening and closing doors continuously, while we found ourselves attacked from all sides. Having said that, the work done by SEGA is among the best that it is possible to try with Kinect both in terms of the much feared latency, completely absent, and in terms of accuracy, so much so that the team was able to go so far as to ask the player to interact with the game in a much more complex way than other titles on the market, especially in the boss battles at the end of the level. Interactions with the environment, on the other hand, are limited in number, rather repetitive and always limitedfrom the request for preventive interaction, and, if you don't get carried away by the fun given by the trash/kinect combo, it probably becomes impossible to have fun with Rise of Nightmares. Xbox 360 goals Like all Japanese titles, collecting objectives always requires a bit of effort, given that by finishing Rise of Nightmares on an easy level, you can earn around 350 points of the 1000 available. Then you have to go to the most difficult level (and it's not a walk), collect all the secrets and kill the enemies using all the available weapons. In short, it takes time and sweat, since you play with Kinect. Boss fight The fights, given that the environments to explore are never very large and that the puzzles are limited to having to find a few keys and operate some levers, make up the majority of the interactive experience of Rise of Nightmares. Luckily they work, as well as the blocking and movement system. When you lose energy, the screen turns red, but just move away from your opponents a little to recover it rather quickly and be able to jump back into the action. Played at an average level, Rise of Nightmares is anything but difficult and it takes no more than 7 hours to complete, also taking into account that the checkpoints are not exactly rose water and that in some cases (since it happens to die, which is strange for a Kinect game) force you to repeat significant sections of the game. After finishing it, all that remains is to collect the many secrets (the fortuneteller's tarot cards and the podcasts left around by a detective who tell the background of the ~plot~), or play it at the most difficult level. Here, however, things get really difficult and we doubt that anyone will ever want to revisit the adventure a second time or even just dedicate themselves to a sort of survival mode that is unlocked after the end credits. In this one, you are thrown into a series of rooms, on the most difficult level, in which you survive as long as possible to make the highest score and burn as many calories (!). Having said that and listed the defects of Rise of Nightmares, if you manage to get into the perspective of the title and become familiar with the control system it is inevitable to have fun, as it becomes difficult to be able to stop before reaching the end of the game and of this bizarre story . Also because there are boss fights that ask you to move in rooms, even narrow ones, dodging blows, trying to understand the attack patterns of the monsters, to understand which moves can be parried and, towards the end, when is the right time to hurl energy balls and towards which goal. In short, certain situations are fun, there is little to do. You sweat like with Kinect Sports, but because you find yourself doing super sayans in a series Z horror film. All this is not supported by a technical sector which in itself would make an excellent impression on an Xbox or a PlayStation 2, but that in the month of the release of Gears of War 3 at least makes you smile and not so much for the monsters, which also have their why, as for the rather bare settings, even if not repetitive and accompanied by a game that also tries to tell a story so naive as to be almost pleasant.", "date": "2011-09-29", "grade": "6.8"}
