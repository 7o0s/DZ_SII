{"name": "Stray Blade", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/stray-blade-recensione.html", "text": "The result of the efforts and passion of a very small team hidden in the heart of Berlin, since its announcement Stray Blade has been able to conquer the spotlight of the main specialized information outlets on several occasions, something that not all indies can do. Sure, it's not common to be published by a giant like 505 Games, but the attention that this independent adventure has been able to gain over time has nothing to do with its publisher. On the contrary, it is the ambition that Point Blank Games wanted to instill in its creature the main reason why the game has often crossed our pages, since after all we don't hear about an open world action adventure with so many elements every day soulslike, a technical and punitive combat system, set in a constantly evolving fantasy world. Net of these true blockbuster premises, we were completely convinced that the title would still have to deal with production dimensions very far from the typical ones of blockbusters, that's why we couldn't wait to find out what the compromise Point Blank would be. Now, a few days after the release of the game on PC and console, we finally have the complete picture of the situation, and we are ready to tell you about it in our review of Stray Blade. Do you want to find out what is hidden in the Acrea valley? Well, first get ready to... give up. The Enchanted Valley Farren West, in Stray blade, is a hero with a very sharp irony Inequality, corruption, violence and greed. We don't know much about the world of Stray Blade, but every time it is described to us, we discover how the domination of men has made it a place of absolute brutality, in which it is almost impossible to survive without it coming to the detriment of someone else . In this context, it is easy to imagine why the Acrea Valley has taken on the contours of a legendary land: it is said that here ancient peoples lived in total symbiosis with the surrounding ecosystem, they believed that all creatures were somehow linked to a single vital flow, and it seems that it may be the only place where nature still remains completely untouched. Considering the fame of Acrea, it was more than natural that an adventurer like Farren West, the main protagonist of the work and illustrious explorer, designated it as its last, greatest horizon. However, the ~irrelevant nomad~, as he likes to call himself, does not go very far. As soon as he sets foot in the Valley he is fatally hit by some rocky debris, and ends up embedded himself in the eternal vital flow of Acrea, which if it sounds very similar to Avatar's Eywa and the Tree of Souls of the Na'vi, is because the concept is basically the same. Farren is now suspended in limbo, unable to leave the Vale and being pursued by a small stool-sized creature named Boji, who brings him back to life each time the explorer dies. The two will embark on a journey through the folklore of Acrea, which will lead Farren to discover the history and culture of the peoples who have inhabited it, while trying to resolve his particular situation. The adventure, from a narrative point of view, never reaches particularly high writing peaks and indeed, often settles for being a pure background for exploration, but if it has a merit it is to stage the relationship between Farren and Boji in an exquisitely authentic way. Seeing their connection rekindle, grow, and shapeshift was what kept us engaged in the story, and it's definitely one of the best things Stray Blade has to offer. Half Soulslike Stray Blade's combat system tries to emulate the best soulslikes, but there is a long way to go Having put the narrative introduction to the adventure of Farren and Boji in the safe, we immediately recognized all those elements that had made us talk about Stray Blade so frequently. The new creature of Point Blank Games is configured as a third-person adventure with a strong action personality, in which the combat system is technical, reasoned and damningly punitive, to the point that it is natural to compare it to that characteristic of soulslikes, even if with some dutiful distinctions. Here too you die with two or three well-aimed blows, even at lower difficulties (there are four in total), and it is always necessary to strategically manage the fight, alternating parries and dodges with the right timing following a pattern of colors that identifies the type of incoming offense. Yet, everything seems less precise, the feedback of the hits is often incongruous, while the animations are weighed down to excess, resulting absolutely woody and not veryfluid. The speech does not change for any of the 30 weapons available to Farren: each one boasts its own, personal set of moves and between spears, axes, rapiers and two-handed broadswords you will be spoiled for choice, however by holding one of the lightest the fluidity experienced in other soulslike is in any case only a distant, distant memory Here is Farren's skill tree in Stray Blade Forget, however, to become attached to only one of them, and then take it with you throughout the course of the adventure. There are no weapons stronger than others in Stray Blade, and usually their attributes are always well balanced, but net of any personal preference in the end we will be forced to use them all, since Farren's skill tree is really linked to these faithful travel companions. The tree upgrades are each linked to a weapon, and only by finding the project, forging it in a forge and accumulating enough mastery, will we finally be able to spend a skill point to activate its effects. We like the idea, and indeed it proves to be fundamental for diluting the repetitiveness that could have arisen due to a creature park unable to evolve effectively as the game progresses. The gameplay absorbs variety from the presence of many different move sets, making the shortcomings on the enemy front less serious. Linear history, capillary exploration The world of Stray Blade has a fairly complex level design Fortunately, Stray Blade does not bet all its cards solely and exclusively on combat, given that a large part of the gaming experience is represented by the exploration of the vast and varied world of Acrea, a large open world full of secrets and creatures, divided in three biomes very distant from each other, for aesthetics and atmospheres. For heaven's sake, the adventure remains quite linear for its entire duration, but often taking new paths always leads to something, be it a fragment of mythology, a secret, a new weapon or simple materials for crafting, which are fundamental not only to make weapons (and, therefore, to enhance Farren) but also armor capable of increasing our adventurer's protection against all kinds of adversities. Snooping around in the most hidden corners of Acrea is in any case useful, even if we will not always have access to each route. At least, not initially. The world has a structure that includes some metroidvania elements, as entire sections of the Valley only open up to exploration after obtaining one of the powers held by the Stray Blade bosses. These are six in total, unfortunately they are not particularly original and their boss fights do not have that typical soulslike epicness, but at least they reward the player with special powers, which Boji can use to access previously inaccessible areas of the world. In reality, these powers can also be unleashed in combat to have advantages over the opponent, but their specific weight is so marginal that we only rarely found ourselves using them against an enemy. The bosses of Stray Blade are unfortunately not taken care of as we would have liked Given that by continuing with the adventure new travel paths are therefore unlocked, backtracking remains a constant in Stray Blade, and in this sense we are a little sad to note that one of the great promises of the game, namely that of a world in constant change over time, receptive to our presence, has not materialized as we would have liked. The areas change and welcome new enemies, it's true, but everything seems like a mere ploy to mess up the cards on the exploration table: a wood full of aggressive creatures, the second time you cross, could host a camp full of soldiers, and later that same camp may again be attacked by savage monsters and reclaimed by nature. Interesting as a system, sure, but not endowed with the depth we would have imagined. A technical sector of great compromise From a technical point of view, Stray Blade does not excel in practically any field It is from a technical point of view that the enormous compromises that Point Blank Games had to accept during the development of Stray Blade become more evident. We have already dealt with some technical problems that affect the final result of the Berlin studio, such as the imprecise and woody animations with which Farren and the enemies try to attack each other, but it is worth further elaborating the issue in a dedicated paragraph, given that of course the problems don't end there.development area of modest size. The models are quite coarse, they often float a few centimeters from the ground as Boji's character almost always does, the user interface is the victim of some graphical bugs and the interpenetrations are the order of the day, a balance that even for a strongly independent is far from acceptable. Obviously, also given its open world nature, no one could legitimately expect the most visually beautiful indie of recent years, however with a lot of extra cleaning many, many problems would have been solved which considerably penalize the use of the title by of the player.", "date": "2023-04-25", "grade": "6.5"}
