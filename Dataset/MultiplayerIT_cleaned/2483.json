{"name": "Extermination", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/extermination_b.html", "text": "A marine in the ice In fact, everything takes place in an American base located among the ice, where scientists were studying an alien artifact from which a new being has come to life which, by multiplying, has infested the entire building and infected it with a strange green acid, which manages to penetrate the fabrics, all members of the refuge, transforming them into horrible mutant beings. In this case the similarities between the T-Virus of Capcomian memory and the corrosive green acid that mutates human beings are quite clear. The protagonist of the entire game is a marine by the name of Dennis Riley who crashes, under mysterious circumstances, with the plane that was carrying him along with his companions. Initially the members of the special team are divided and the only two who find themselves together are precisely Dennis and his friend Roger, who however will leave the game very soon.....but I don't want to reveal too much of the plot so I'll leave you the pleasure of discovering the rest of the story, thanks also to the complete translation of the game into five languages, obviously including ours. All of this is obviously thanks to the large capacity of the DVD which was used by the programmers to also insert a fair amount of cut scenes in computer graphics that were very well made and dubbed. The aim of the game is to destroy the entire research center so as to definitively erase the danger of contagion for the rest of the world, and to do so it will be necessary to guide our hero in the construction which, although not large in size, requires the passage in the same zones for several times, also thanks to the continuous changes that the scenario undergoes due to the explosions that take place and not only. Fear makes nine From a graphic point of view we are certainly not at the levels of excellence seen in the Metal Gear Solid 2 demo but we are more than ever in the average of the products seen so far. As already mentioned before, the CG sequences in real time are very beautiful with the animation of the faces really well done. The movements and animations of the protagonist are instead so-so, especially in the execution of the jumps which turn out to be very approximate and which are added to a not exactly intuitive control system which makes reaching certain locations easy at all. It is also very difficult to find a truly playable shot because the ~intelligent~ camera just doesn't want to let us see what interests us and so it is often necessary to switch to one of the two shots offered by the shooting mode, i.e. in first and third person that make our life (and above all our eyesight!) easier. The backdrops are also discreetly made, even if rather sparse (for example, there are rather approximate representations of the corpses); some monsters are really big and quite moved and the general level is more than sufficient. Very nice is the morphing effect of the water in the puddles which varies in a decidedly realistic way at each passage of our good old marine, as well as the effect of the flashlight placed on our rifle which follows the three-dimensional model of the places which it illuminates by deforming from time to time. The sound is entrusted to standard effects and a techno music soundtrack that is well suited to various situations with continuous variations of rhythm that increase the suspense. Waiting for Resident Evil... I conclude by referring to the longevity aspect: the game is quite easy and it takes about six/seven hours to finish it, also considering the puzzles which, rather than puzzles, should be called ~search for the object and use it~. Nice the use of a rescue system with batteries that are consumed with use (these also serve to interact with other objects during the game) which, alas, are however infinitely rechargeable with special chargers located in the various rooms ; this somewhat precludes the total longevity of the product given that the player does not have to rack their brains too much to save the position, as instead happened in Resident Evil where each Ink Ribbon had to be used wisely and sparingly. In conclusion, a good game that offers a not very original concept but until now not present in the not too crowded catalog of titles for the SONY black monolith; therefore merit goes to this first Deep Space effort which, although not perfect, will appeal to all lovers of survival horror..oops sorry, panic action adventure! Waiting for the release of the conversion of the Capcomian masterpiece, such Biohazard: Code Veronica, already appeared on the ~defunct~ SEGA console, the PS2 people will be able to amuse themselves with the first effort of Deep Space, the new development team which includes among its ranks several ex-members of Captive Comunications, Capcom for friends. Precisely this fact will immediately make it clear that the basic concept of this product partly follows that of the more famous older brother set in the legendary Racoon City. However, the differences are many, starting with the setting, and this leads us to consider the game no longer as a classic Survival Horror, but a Panic Action Adventure, a new definition that was introduced by the author himself. To be clearer, we could define Extermination as a mix of several games, such as the aforementioned Resident Evil, Tomb Raider and Siphon Filter, indeed perhaps the latter is the product that comes closest to it. At this point it is necessary to talk about the plot that seems to have been born from the same great author of ~The Thing~, the famous John Carpenter.", "date": "2001-06-18", "grade": null}
