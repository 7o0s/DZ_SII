This year Infinite Warfare made its debut developed by Infinity Ward, the same studio that ~gave us~ a pearl appreciated by millions of fans of first person shooters, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, which returns in a remastered version exclusively for owners of the Legacy Edition of the new title. Between the acclaimed and the despised, Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare certainly wins the fact of being much discussed, we are in fact facing a very curious chapter which is not very easy to talk about but which, after having spent several hours playing it, we can say without too many doubts to be an excellent collection of good ideas fused with solid and functional gameplay. Infinity Warfare is not a masterpiece but a solid title with lots of ideas and lots of content A journey into the solar system Let's start by talking about the campaign mode which, as you may have guessed from the title, is not without surprises. The game takes place in the future, a future where Earth's ecosystem has been deeply disrupted by overpopulation, forcing humanity to roam the solar system to establish colonies and gather valuable resources and fuel. The player will take on the role of Captain Reyes in command of the Retribution, one of the last warships on Earth. A war that happened years earlier generates The Front, a separatist faction led by Admiral Kotch which aims to subjugate the Earth by conquering the various terrestrial colonies. In this scenario, the player will be catapulted into a campaign never seen before in the Call of Duty franchise, where classic ground-based shooting sessions alternate with space battles on the Jackal, a space fighter jet that we can pilot and customize to our liking. In all of this, as captain of the Retribution, the protagonist will also have to choose the destinations of the ship, thus having the possibility of carrying out secondary missions of your choice between the Jackal Strikes, which are entirely based on the fights on the Jackal, and Ship Assault , in which a ~down to earth~ session is added to aerial combat. By carrying out the secondary missions, upgrades are unlocked for the Jackal or different armaments that can be used in our missions, but no less important is the possibility of killing some important components of Kotch's army which we can then remove from our ~special targets~ board in the captain's cabin. The latter is a resting place within the Retribution, where between one mission and another we can take a few minutes off by accessing the captain's terminal where various audiologs, information on personnel and mission reports and much more are contained. The game experience deriving from all this is therefore fluid and consistent in which, almost like a routine, once a mission is completed we will return to the ship, choose a new destination, then go to the armory, select the equipment we want to use for finally land, aboard our Jackal, in the place of the mission. The quality of the story and the narration, on the other hand, seem to move towards a fairly classic direction, in which, although very close attention has been paid to the protagonist and his evolution during the events of the game, it appears to maintain the simplicity, almost superficial, emblematic of the saga. Although it gives us the opportunity to reflect on Captain Reyes, the weight of difficult choices and the value of sacrifice, this time too, the story remains quite linear and not very thorough, with excellent characters, such as the antagonist Kotch, to whom unfortunately, however, very little space and weight is devoted in terms of texture. Regarding the narration, being the protagonist a Captain, we are faced with a different approach than usual which however fails to emerge completely in a significant way, leaving us with a story worthy of being told but still too simple to be praised up to bottom. A campaign for specialists During the campaign we will wander in the solar system going from planet to planet and we will face various enemies making use of our chosen arsenal before starting each mission, but it will not be uncommon to find ourselves in situations in which we will decide to radically change the equipment. Shock Grenades, Hacking Modules, and Energy Weapons are especially good against any robot that gets in your way, while bullets, explosives, and brute force always come in handy against humans. They also dore their appearance some Mechs that we will have to destroy using heavy weapons or armored enemies invulnerable to frontal attacks, for which we will have to ingenuity and make good use of the map in order to defeat them. The combat system has remained more or less unchanged from the solid result achieved with Black Ops 3, so by dint of walking on walls and amplified jumps, interactions with the surrounding environment will still be fundamental and will not be limited to the classic explosive barrel to hit . As already mentioned, what Infinity Ward probably dared to do was structure the campaign in such a way that the player continues to assume the roles of the character even outside the missions, resulting in a very strong sense of continuity between one mission and another . What surprised us most about the campaign of this Call of Duty, however, is the ~Specialist~ mode, which is unlocked once the game is over. Once this difficulty is selected, the game completely changes its rules: the helmet gives access to the system interface, a health indicator with an ~x-ray~ of our body is added to the interface, weapons must always be manually reloaded, the inventory is very limited and, most importantly, health does not regenerate but you will need to heal yourself through injectors. In this scenario, our style of play varies completely, frenetic shooting sessions now alternate with premeditated actions aimed at not getting hit. Too many hits on your helmet can destroy it causing you to lose the game interface, a bullet hitting your arm will make it almost impossible to aim, an injury on your leg will make you limp or again, if a bullet hits your weapon, you will have to catch it on the fly or you will end up unarmed. These are particularly interesting dynamics but which unfortunately are limited to a single ~difficulty~ which is unlocked only after having already completed the campaign. Finally, the nice YOLO difficulty makes its presence, a challenge launched by Infinity Ward which consists in completing the game on Specialist difficulty having a single life available, as the name suggests (You Only Live Once, ~you only live once~). . So imagine having reached the end of the game, being hit by a sniper and with great joy starting all over again... we'll see some good ones! Trash 80s and Zombies in space! Zombie is now an inevitable mode in Call of Duty: fun, crazy and guarantees a satisfying level of co-op challenge every time. We've seen plenty of themes in recent years, from Nazi zombies to aliens, but this time it's the turn of the 80s with Zombies in Spaceland, with a vast Luna Park full of nice space-themed attractions and full of clichs typical of those years. But nothing is random, everything has a story behind it. Four aspiring actors go to an audition of a certain Willard Wyler, one of the biggest stars of the Horror genre, in a few moments they are catapulted into the scene, finding themselves in this theme amusement park where they will have to do their best and play their parts trying possibly not to die. Obviously, the four protagonists depict ~typical characters~ from the films of the time, so players will have to play as AJ the sportsman, Poindexter the nerd, Sally the teenage girl and finally Andre the rapper. Some nice additions are made to the classic game mechanics, given the theme adopted by the mode. Once dead, you enter a large game room where you can carry out activities to earn points and come back to life by filling the corresponding bar. Since then everything is themed, while we are alive we will be able to run around the Luna Park and earn Tickets by carrying out the various activities including the roller coaster or a practice match at the various Arcades scattered on the game map. Tickets are an additional currency to the classic dollars that allow the purchase of even more powerful equipment or grenades. Everything is very nice and fun, except for your companions who will have to save your skin while you are engaged in these activities, so remember to choose an appropriate moment to have fun. Each area of the map has its easter eggs, its traps, the various activities to be carried out and in addition a portal that leads to the central square, all of which must be activated by finding a power generator. Exploring more areas also means scattering the zombies and portals are a very valid escape route in case the situation becomes too dangerous. Also noteworthy is the presence of the ~Safe Zone~ in which it will be possible to enhance one's weapons making them even more lethal and which can be accessed via the main portal but sonly if all four players are present. In short, in a normal session players will have to try to survive hordes of increasingly powerful Zombies, buying weapons, spending their Tickets on more powerful gadgets or grenades, unlocking new ways, facing the bosses of the strongest waves and using Fate and Fortune. The latter are skills in the form of trading cards that can be activated during games, each player can choose 5 from their deck and use them individually in the game, turning the situation upside down. The use of these cards is reserved for the most demanding moments and can really determine the victory or defeat of the players. Some cards are for single use, so it's best to keep in mind that once activated we'll have to wait to find them in the next pack. Last but not least, to add a little more variety to the Zombie gameplay, players will be able to assemble a small robot at the beginning of the game that generates challenges that unlock extra rewards once completed, so get ready to kill zombies by jumping or hitting them with your bare hands just right to have that extra bonus provided by the challenge. Our advice is to carefully evaluate each objective: fighting zombies while surrounded could prove fatal. Multiplayer: between frenzy and fun The flagship of Call of Duty, thanks to its solid gameplay, is the inevitable competitive multiplayer mode that boasts a vast assortment of maps and modes present since launch, as well as an excellent customization system. Before going into detail, however, it is appropriate to talk about the Battle Kits, spiritual successors of the Specialists seen in Black Ops 3. These are technological suits designed to adapt to the player's style of play. Each of these has its own selection of Supers and various arsenals and attributes that will lead the player to make one choice over the other. It is important to underline that each Battle Kit still has access to all the weapons in the game, therefore the last word is given to the player in the creation of his very personal loadout. However, just to give an idea for those unfamiliar with the genre, players will be able to choose from a total of six styles: the Guerrilla, versatile and excellent at medium distances, the Hyperlight designed for close combat and for players in constant movement, the Mercenary specialized in the use of heavy weapons and perfect for defense actions, the Specter a real sniper for lovers of long-distance battles, the Striker a support for teamwork and, finally, the Synapse designed for run-and-gun combat and optimized for movement speed. Although the innovations introduced in the multiplayer of Infinite Warfare are not many, we find some new grenades and Scorestreak and Team Missions, a new way to level up with friends. Teams will be able to choose one of four available Team Missions depending on their play style and the rewards on offer. Each team will have its own challenges to follow during the matches and, once certain team missions are completed, you will receive an additional experience bonus and unique items including cosmetic items (such as emblems and skins), various equipment and much more. As already mentioned, a good selection of playlists at launch, divided between standard, Hardcore, and competitive, contribute to the excellent amount of content offered by the title. Even more interesting is the only new mode currently introduced in Infinite Warfare, Defender, in which players will have to contend for a drone and run around the map once conquered, being careful not to let it fall into enemy hands, practically a re-adapted version of the mode Skull seen on Halo. Drawing conclusions there is very little to say, as it is simply a review of the gaming experience already seen and well established on Black Ops 3. Wall runs, slides, amplified jumps and lots of freedom of movement will make the clashes intense and adrenaline-pumping , while the various Supers and the various Battle Kits will give an interesting twist to team play, especially as regards the most competitive clashes. Finally, speaking of the balance of the games, it will be interesting to see how the equipment of higher level or simply more complete will affect the games. We had the opportunity to try customized modes with all the arsenal unlocked without noticing substantial differences despite the fact that many used epic / legendary equipment, which bodes well for not too significant advantages even once the highest levels are reached. Anyway, Infinity", "date": "2016-11-04", "grade": "8.5"}
