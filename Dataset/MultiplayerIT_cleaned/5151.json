Anxiously awaited by many, Massive Entertainment's game has had to face a series of criticisms aimed at some of its key elements: endgame and reward system above all, but not only. The presence of other surrounding problems has in fact meant that even the most patient players of what had been painted as the anti-Destiny headed towards the abandonment of the servers. However, the developers have never given up, continuing on the one hand to carry out the already established annual plan, while proceeding in the development of some structural changes to the game mechanics of The Division. We saw the result of this second part of the work about a month ago, when we had the opportunity to appreciate patch 1.4. Thanks to it, Massive has established a new starting point for his creature, thus laying the foundations for his second youth, but above all to try to recall the agents who had deserted into activity. The time has now come for The Division to look further, thanks to the release of the second of the premium add-ons expected since the game's release. Together with patch 1.5, Lotta per la vita has also arrived, the DLC of which we offer you the review today after having already tried it a few days ago. The Division makes us fight for survival in a New York completely covered in snow Survive in NYC Fight for life is untied from the basic contents of The Division, both in terms of its setting and in terms of its game dynamics. Among the few elements in common with those already known we find the same map of Manhattan of the base game, on which twenty-four players find themselves moving in an instanced adventure, with a very specific beginning and end. The scenario is quite simple: while a terrible storm engulfs the entire city of New York, a group of agents is sent to the Dark Zone to get an important antidote for the disease that has brought the metropolis to its knees. When the group goes by helicopter to the mission site, things don't go the right way, and the aircraft crashes to the ground, leaving the agents in a desperate emergency situation. Deprived of their equipment, they can do nothing but carry on the assignment received, trying to reach the Dark Zone using only the materials found there. As in the normal game experience of The Division, players must beware of enemies located around the map, but not only: Struggle for life forces you to deal with other elements of danger, linked to primary needs of the agent we control. Staying too long outdoors, thus exposing yourself to the freezing cold of the blizzard, may be enough to ensure freezing and death, but freezing isn't the only additional pitfall we face. Hunger and thirst can also play tricks, preventing our character from maintaining lucidity while looking for materials, a fundamental activity to be able to successfully complete a game of Fight for life. Furthermore, for the benefit of those looking for a truly demanding challenge, the matchmaking offers the possibility of choosing whether to face the emergency in PvP or PvE mode: in the first case, in addition to the dangers listed above, one must also beware of the characters controlled by the other players, ready to kill us to ensure our survival. In such a desperate situation, consciences also change, and unlike the Dark Zone we already know, there are no renegade agents: the only thing that matters is to get to the moment of extraction, surviving an infection that inexorably makes its way even in the body of every agent in the game. Once the maximum time has passed, it's game over. There are no checkpoints and death is permanent: if you lose, you have to start all over again. Put on your tank top The opening bars of Fight for life are undoubtedly those in which the DLC demonstrates its best side, managing to successfully convey to the player a feeling of constant danger in which it is essential to plan every single action. Wandering around the streets without having a reference point to stop and warm up your body, for example, is the best way to ensure you die in a short time. As if all that we have described so far were not enough, Struggle for life deprives the character we control of all his equipment, replaced with basic elements to improve progressively.you to be able to emerge unscathed from the emergency. Once a game of Fight for your life has started, the level and gear score you had outside no longer count for anything: all participants start with the same weapon, a pistol, and the same set of basic equipment, without any ability. This feature opens up the contents of the paid pack to all players, putting more experienced players and those just starting out in New York on the same level. Returning to the game dynamics, a large part of the activity we carry out in Struggle for life is linked to the search for basic necessities, to be used to keep ourselves alive while we continue to wander to find the materials we need. In fact, the fight for life leverages The Division's crafting system, providing a workbench in the various hiding places on the map. Even elements such as scarves and hats, relegated to the pure aesthetic aspect in the base game, instead play a fundamental role in this case to keep us warm when we are outdoors. In this way, each player must create his own equipment from scratch to properly prepare for entering the Dark Zone, a task which, as you may have guessed, is by no means a walk in the park. It takes a few games and a few deaths before you get used to the dynamics of Lotta per la vita and its level of difficulty, quite high but never excessively severe. They certainly don't forgive the so-called Hunters, a new faction made up of heavily armed fanatics ready to complicate our lives while we try to obtain the extraction. Out of everything Struggle for life arouses positive feelings overall, but it must be said that it is not all rosy: after a few games, in fact, the defects that this second premium DLC carries with it begin to appear. The gaming experience developed by the developers is certainly fun, but completely different from the rest of The Division, with respect to which the points of contact are very minimal. In this case, the character and the build that we have built in the normal game mode remain only to watch, obtaining a series of rewards at the end of the game based on the accumulated score. It is obviously not said that these contain elements that we need, so it can happen that we spend two hours (roughly the time needed to complete a game of Fight for life) playing without obtaining progress that can then be spent in the other areas of the game. From this point of view, the previous paid DLC New York Underground fit better into the big picture of The Division, despite having a more limited setting. The second problem is that in the long run, Fight for Life can be repetitive: even in this aspect, Underground was better. While proposing similar places to each other, the previous DLC was in fact made more varied and fun by the random generation of missions and greater action. Contrary to what happens elsewhere in The Division, in Lotta per la vita loots are also not shared with one's group mates: a constant and annoying race follows to be the first to open a chest or search a body. Before moving on to the final comment, we feel like spending a few words of praise for the work done by Massive in the graphics field. The storm gripping the city translates into a reduced level of visibility, with wind and snow that remind us of their presence by constantly staying in the foreground. The streets are rendered unrecognizable by the drifts of snow that populate them, making it difficult to sense direction also due to the absence of the mini-map.", "date": "2016-11-26", "grade": "7.5"}
