{"name": "Expedition Zero", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/expedition-zero-recensione.html", "text": "The Expedition Zero review takes us to the heart of Siberia, in the role of the last survivor of an expedition who finds himself trapped in the freezing cold of the region and has only one hope to escape: to provide an anonymous interlocutor with some samples of the mysterious plague that caused the death of his companions. Debut title for the independent Czech team Enigmatic Machines, Expedition Zero presents itself as the most traditional of first-person survival horror, halfway between the action of the classic representatives of the genre and the passivity of more recent interpretations. A balance that is however precarious, extends to the artistic component and in the end makes the game incapable of expressing a precise personality. History and initial problems Expedition Zero, the forest is the scenario where you will spend the most time The narrative incipit is the one we reported at the beginning and it is more or less all that you will find in Expedition Zero in terms of history: the protagonist speaks for a few seconds in the introductory phases, describing his return to the refuge, a sort of mountain in the snow, but otherwise the narration is basically entrusted to notes and documents to be found during the exploration: a little, if the goal was to build a minimum of emotional involvement. Unfortunately, right from the start you come across some problems inevitably linked to the indie nature of the project, but not justifiable for this. The game supports the controller in a partial way, and it is something that we can also accept, but when we tried to change the controls we then realized that there was no function to restore the default ones. That's not all: when trying to use the controller, the Y-axis inversion option remained active and we couldn't turn it off even using the mouse, which forced us to use an external program to forcefully invert the pointer operation. A lack of attention and practical checks that frankly leave us perplexed. The last negative surprise came with the graphic adjustments, because if it is true that visually the game is really modest and generic, spoiled by important and frequent pop-up problems, at the same time it is extremely heavy even for an RTX 3070 where use the ~cinematic~ preset at 2160p, forcing the user to lower the resolution or decrease the quality of the effects to get the 60 fps. Gameplay Expedition Zero, one of the ~passive~ enemies As for the story, on the gameplay front Expedition Zero does not get lost in chatter, descriptions or tutorials: beyond a couple of warnings related to the basic functions and the indication of the current objectives, the game keeps its mouth absolutely sewn on what exactly needs to be done and above all how to do it, leaving us with the task of discovering it through trial and error, but above all an abundance of game overs that are fortunately not punishing, given that the respawn points are generally close together. other than the map (there are six in all) via an option to fast travel and armed with a shotgun, the core of the experience can be said to be represented by the looting and crafting system, which while relying on of a decidedly dated and spartan interface (the squared inventory, you know?) after a while it reveals a fair potential and at least a logical thread. In fact, we will have to check the various objects that we will face in search of metals, plastics, fabrics and electronic components useful for the creation of new equipment. Expedition Zero, a look at the inventory To build any tool, however, we will be required to find 3D printers, and here comes another annoying limitation: each of them can only produce specific objects, so we will inevitably have to explore the main scenario (a forest) at length and wide, exhausted by backtracking, to be able to get everything that the game has to offer and that will allow us to survive the pitfalls and above all the cold for longer. This last element actually poses as the main threat to our character, a factor that also severely limits the possibility of moving for large stretches without having a log of wood and a stove or a bin where it can be burned to warm up and restore the body temperature indicator. Some advanced devices will allow us to use the battery in the suit to limit heat loss, but at that point the battery charge will become the center of our concerns. Expedition Zero, the churchit is one of the places that we will be able to find in the forest But let's go back to the beginning: what is our goal in Expedition Zero? Immediately after visiting a mysterious interlocutor at a wall manned by snipers, which gives the game the opportunity to improvise some basic stealth mechanics but an end in itself (because, mind you, you just need to catch a couple of bullets to crash), the task that waiting for us will finally become clear: collect samples of the plague and send them to this person so that a way can be found to eradicate it. Trying to complete the feat will highlight the great artistic confusion of Expedition Zero, which alternates forest areas with tombs with lots of zombie arms protruding from the ground (really!), Christian references, assets thrown a bit at random on the map and only two types of enemies: ~infected~ explorers who don't even try to defend themselves from the bullets of our rifle, or Left 4 Dead-style ~smokers~ which on the contrary are far too powerful, can kill us with a single blow if we have little energy and confirm how spartan and approximate the combat system is. Graphics and sound Expedition Zero, a plane that crashed in the forest We mentioned Expedition Zero's optimization issues earlier, but how much does the heavy cinematic preset affect the visual quality of the experience? Little, unfortunately: even in the best conditions, the title of Enigmatic Machines appears strongly dated. An evidently low-budget project, with limited animations, various glitches, the aforementioned pop-up on the surfaces and a generic appearance. If the graphics are not the best, not even the sound makes one cry for a miracle: the dialogues are very few, the effects appear essential and the cries of the enemies perhaps represent the only functional element to the atmosphere of the game, wrapped in a perennial darkness which however becomes incapable of intimidating when one realizes that the pitfalls are actually few and that from the ~smokers~ it is possible to escape by running without too much trouble.", "date": "2022-03-27", "grade": "5.0"}
