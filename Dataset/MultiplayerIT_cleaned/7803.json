The feeling, after a few hours of play, is that the guys at Codemasters have this time deliberately created a ~dry~ product, with a single player career in which you run a lot and talk little, selecting the events and cups to participate in through a very simple menu to then launch onto the track aboard powerful rear-wheel drive muscle cars or perhaps reliable sports cars with four-wheel drive. The large and varied fleet of cars excludes some very famous brands in the custom-built sector but the same does not happen for the range of tracks available, which within sixteen different scenarios offers us something like eighty routes with day or night settings. The ~narrative~ expedient at the base of the campaign sees us take on the role of a professional driver in the pay of a rich tycoon who intends to create his own mixed championship and who for this reason sends us around the world to face events of every type to convince new talents that they can get a certain type of challenge by marrying our project. We will therefore have to deal with standard races and one-on-one duels, elimination races and promotional sessions based on scores, to finally arrive at the fun challenges in which the urban route is dynamically modified with each lap, depriving us of the ability to predict what will be waiting for us and how to tackle the various sections of the track. Solidity above all The particular mix of realism and arcade facets that made GRID's gameplay famous is re-proposed in this sequel, strengthened by a series of optimizations aimed at smoothing the edges in favor of an even more convincing and pleasant driving experience, capable in situations be excited to keep your nerves on edge and therefore fully involved. The ~rewind~ system has been maintained, with a generous maximum of five uses per race, which means that we won't have to launch into crazy curses at every contact with the barriers or with other cars, but we will have the opportunity to repair the mistakes made and appease any episodes of frustration in the bud. The artificial intelligence of the opponents also represents the flagship of the production, given that the drivers we will have to face on the track will never let us pass, they will try to cut us off and they will not let themselves be intimidated by a counter, making things complicated for us. We mentioned at the beginning of a ~dry~ approach on the single player career front, and the lack of implementation of a traditional economic system should certainly be read in this sense, i.e. one that allows the purchase and sale of cars, replaced by a reward-based solution that basically never makes us want for anything. The vehicles can be modified from an aesthetic point of view thanks to an editor that is both simple and powerful, but it is not possible to make changes to the engine, make particular adjustments or mount power-ups. It's a shame because this element would have added a further substrate to the Codemasters production, but strangely the defection only concerns the single player sector. In the online multiplayer, this time very accurate, it is in fact possible to improve your car while challenging other players in single races, cycles of races and special events organized by the developers to stimulate the community. The technical sector Unlike the first episode of the series, the PC version of GRID 2 necessarily requires a video card compatible with DirectX 11 (or at least DX10) to run. The developers didn't make any particular compromises due to the multiplatform nature of the product, and so they made the best use of the EGO Engine, optimized over the years to be both high-impact but light to manage for mid-range systems. On the test configuration, for example, we played at a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, with MSAA 4X, v-sync disabled (we didn't notice any particular tearing, however) and all the effects at their maximum, obtaining frame rates ranging from 30 to 50 /55 frames per second, so an average of 40 fps or more and a result that clearly far exceeds the graphics of the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game. The incredible thing is that these performances can be substantially improved by deactivating, for example, the ~global illumination~, an effect that should improve the lighting systemin general but which in practice is very little noticeable even if it substantially affects fluidity. The options available for ~scaling~ the experience on the technical front are numerous, ultimately, but they only represent the icing on the cake of a slap-up job, truly splendid to see in motion thanks to the vast use of effects on the bodies, all 'alternation of light and shadow on the tracks, the high level of detail of the scenarios and their depth. The lack of the view from the cockpit, which has sparked a series of controversies, does not affect the enjoyment of the races, which are enriched by a very dynamic management of the virtual camera, which zooms and moves according to what is happening on the track, embellishing the screen edges with some blur to further enhance accelerations. In short, we can say, without fear of contradiction, that GRID 2 presents itself as one of the most beautiful driving games available on PC at the moment, and sorry if it's not much. GRID 2 undoubtedly stands as one of the best racers currently available on PC.", "date": "2013-06-04", "grade": "8.5"}
