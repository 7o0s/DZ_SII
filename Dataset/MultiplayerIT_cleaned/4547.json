At the time, however, we did not know that Nintendo would try the hybrid route with its Switch which is halfway between mobile and home. And this is how we ended up talking once again about the fifth epic chapter of The Elder Scrolls saga, a title that makes up for a woody and sometimes awkward combat system with powerful magic, powers capable of unleashing storms, a huge map full of dungeons, breathtaking cities and an outline that goes from building a house to vampirism and adopting children. All finished in an edition which, although not the special one, includes technical finishes and DLC, adding the Joy-Con to the plate that can also be used as motion controllers. A giant in the pocket Skyrim, we know it well, is not revolutionary, it is not perfect and it is not even the largest open world. But it enjoys a breath that transcends all its limits. We are talking about real mountains to climb, huge dragons that furrow the sky, a huge narrative background and a gameplay that evolves, giving us an intoxicating sensation of growth punctuated by the acquisition of powers with spectacular effects. All centered on the figure of a true epic fantasy hero, strong in all the connotations of the case ranging from predestination to the ability to defeat immense creatures capable of making a single mouthful of a man. The result has shaken hearts since the first trailer, has made it clear that multiplayer is not essential and has been able to exceed twenty million copies sold in three years, returning to sell more with a special edition designed to squeeze the most advanced machines. Today is the turn of the Switch version which, a hair's breadth ahead of the awaited VR version, expands the library of the Nintendo hybrid with a second thick open world. And it's an open world that can still have its say even if it's now six years old on its back and was born old, at least as a concept, as far as hand-to-hand combat and movement are concerned. The use of the Joy-Con as a motion controller adds something, but the defects are all there, just as there are all the advantages starting from the puffs of snow that sweep the hills to get to the splendid rivers that cut the bottom of deep valleys. Cities on rock peaks, immense variety, hand-drawn details, like Morrowind did, and it makes all the difference in giving us a world that is a pleasure to look at, experience and explore. All seasoned with screams that evoke lightning, creatures and huge storms. This is why we welcome it on Switch, the Nintendo hybrid born to reconcile classic gaming, internal exclusives and portable size, for an all-round experience that inevitably involves some compromises. Locked to a dynamic 720p at 30fps, Skyrim looks great on the handheld version, but despite the jump to 900p in the docked version, the move to the big screen makes the drop in definition evident. The marked pop-up of the vegetation and some effects also become more visible, for a version that in various respects takes us back in time a couple of generations, to the times of PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. This means that buildings and dragons they can be seen from a huge distance, but the textures change abruptly to increase in quality as we get closer, giving us visual artifacts that are anything but pleasant. All this, fortunately, is less noticeable in the portable version which, among other things, enhances the vibrant colors and new filters of the one which, despite being the standard version of the game, has been cleaned up and softened. The result is a portable Skyrim that does not lack any essential element and that even manages to surprise us thanks to the definition of textures and bodies of water, all immersed in rich vegetation, at least at close range. And it is thanks to these breathtaking views that we are once again able to forgive the undeniable flaws of Skyrim to grasp that epic breath that made it a cult. All seasoned with far from extreme consumption which sees the console remain decidedly cold, as opposed to what happens in docked mode, so as to allow you to play for more than three hours. Loads are also quite fast and transitions are almost instantaneous in the case of previously loaded areas. Dragonporn Skyrim is pure pornography for every fantasy lover, a true cultural phenomenon that made its way into memes with the devastating Fus Ro Dah and penetrated our ears with countless covers of the wonderful soundtrack byata by Jeremy Soule. And while we explored every secret by brushing soul stones as we could, it has been reviewed so many times that describing its mechanics is at least superfluous. However, it is worth dedicating a few lines to the difficulty level of the fifth The Elder Scrolls, which is inextricably linked to the attitude with which we face the climb to power. Spinning straight towards the goal gives us a more balanced difficulty and some interesting challenges, but it deprives us of a good part of the experience and it is not said that it is the best option in a game of this type. Proceeding calmly, in fact, greatly facilitates things, but exploration gives us a myriad of contents between secondary quests often superior to the main ones and dungeons which, although not always original, often hide unexpected surprises. All of this exceeds a hundred hours of content without considering crossroads and DLC that add new areas, new quests, vampirism, lycanthropy, legendary dragons, mounted combat, monsters, houses to build, laboratories, adoption, new crafting and the island of Solstheim which takes us back to Morrowind, between cultists and legendary powers. Bows, it must be said, remain one of the most lethal tools ever, especially when combined with stealth, but some of the skills obtainable in Dragonborn are capable of clearly changing combat and giving previously unimaginable maneuvering possibilities for an experience to say the least epic. Of course, in recent years open world games have made great strides forward, it is useless to deny it, but between variety and freedom Skyrim is a game that still defends itself very well, offering an avalanche of quests in some cases that are anything but trivial. Between orphans, revolutionary heroes, puzzles and battles there is a little bit of everything, including an artificial intelligence capable of making a character cross an entire region. Of course, sometimes it happens even when the character in question shouldn't, but these are anomalies that are part of Skyrim, as annoying when they deprive us of a follower as they are hilarious in the case of crazed chickens, bodies that take off like bullets or guards they improvise Forrest Gump. At the end of the games, the only defects that we would like to underline concern the difficulties in starting some quests, the camera managed in a terrible way during the final moves and the movements of a character who, however powerful, is hopelessly in a plaster cast. But if nothing else, the controls work very well with the Joy-Con which can also be used as a motion controller, facilitating aiming with the bow and making lockpicking more engaging. The game, among other things, detects the direction of the shots, and it's a significant bonus even if the limited number of arrows and the general setting slow down the effectiveness of this addition. However, it is something more, like Zelda's tunic, shield and sword, adding a pinch of ~nintesity~ to the Bethesda creature; whose real and only problem, common to other titles that have recently arrived on Switch, is the need to pay full price for a version that adds nothing really new to a title already released on countless platforms. This, of course, if we don't consider the possibility of slipping a game of Skyrim caliber into your pocket to play it wherever you want.", "date": "2017-11-16", "grade": "8.0"}
