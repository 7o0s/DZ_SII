{"name": "The Simpsons Road Rage", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-simpsons-road-rage_a.html", "text": "We enter the yellow world of Spriengfield I had already had the opportunity to try the title in its Ps2 incarnation so I already knew what I was getting into. In fact, in addition to a slight improvement in the audio / video department, the game has remained almost identical, therefore below the average quality standard that Xbox has imposed since its inception. I don't think there's much to dwell on the protagonists. Who among you has never followed at least a few episodes of the yellow family on TV, a hilarious stereotype of the average American family, which makes us laugh so much!? I don't think characters like Bart, Omer, Moe need too many introductions and in fact we will immediately feel at home during the intro in perfect opening theme style of any episode, all completely in 3D in real time. The models of the characters are perfect and all this bodes well for the actual game which will basically turn out to be a clone of Sega's Crazy Taxi set in the yellow Spriengfield, with some variations in the form of missions that are unlocked in succession. A game destined to last?? The problem with this Road Rage, the main one I mean, is that it lacks bite. Why do I have to keep playing it? this is the question that keeps hammering in my head during the various game sessions. In fact, apart from a few bonus machines, the game offers no incentive to improve or to be replayed. Unlike CT (crazy taxi) there are no tricks or maneuvers that give additional scores there are no evolutions to be carried out using elements of the landscape and ultimately after five minutes you find yourself asking yourself ~who can do it for me?~ already after delivering the third passenger. Exact. The game basically boils down to picking someone up on the street and taking them to their destination as quickly as possible. A hand will indicate the fastest air line to follow and we will be able to break the traffic rules as we wish to reach our destination. There is also a mission mode in which certain objectives must be achieved within a certain time limit (in this case the choice of the character and the relative vehicle is set by the game) such as knocking down a certain number of objects in a certain time, or accompanying Homer to the plant in 24 seconds., plus one last option that looks like a practice mode. Graphically speaking The fact is that I don't think this is the most suitable game to do justice to the charisma of the Simpson family and the huge digital Springfield does not seem to correspond topographically to the city we know from television, evidently adapted to the needs of the game (but they are all streets dual carriageway!!!?). Certainly there is no shortage of ~hot~ places such as the Simpson house and the Flander house, Moe's bar, the school, etc. but there is not the same feeling although we have tried to keep the graphic style as faithful as possible to the cartoon. From a graphic point of view, it is worth noting the apt use of colors faithful to the animated series and the 3D reconstruction of all the main interpreters of the series, while the flatness of the textures and the minimal use of the high calculation capacities cannot really be of the Xbox. Even at the sound level there is nothing to get too excited about as the powerful audio chips of the microsoft console are not even touched Summing up So what's left!? A simple and colorful game not suitable for those looking for a deep and long-lived title but intended for the younger range of users who will be able to roam the streets of the American town with their favorites by engaging even furious head-to-head with the appropriate split mode screen. Certainly a better technical realization would certainly not have spoiled, but the major limitation of the product is the repetitiveness and the lack of ~having to do something else~ in addition to running up and down aimlessly. Even the simple but very limited (accelerate brake corner) control system does not help. The mission mode, albeit commendable, turns out to be insufficient to revive a title that right now I feel like recommending only to those looking for a fun title for their little children who will be able to do damage around without being reproached by anyone. Also missing is the Italian dubbing which would certainly have made the irresistible Simpsons even closer to our tastes. Pros: there are the Simpsons colorful and cartoony graphics can be given as a gift Cons: technical realization not up to par repetitive like few others lack of Italian localization, sopall as regards the items Materials: Tips Tie-in or not Tie-in From what world is the world from a tie-in (licensed film or comic book game) a product of good quality or in any case appreciable as a whole has rarely been obtained, either because it relies only on the name of the product, or because the funds are all invested in the license and little in the developers, you want because I don't know why, the very few noteworthy titles (the Alien vs Predator series on PC is a masterpiece for example) have been lost among the myriads of junk titles, confirming the rule general above. And this Simpsons game!? Well let's say that unfortunately it keeps more or less markedly true to the premises.", "date": "2002-04-22", "grade": null}
