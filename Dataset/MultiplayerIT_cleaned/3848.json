Instead, we want to introduce you to our review of Kingdom Hearts 3 with a more personal reflection on the meaning of the spoiler and the sense of frustration we feel in knowing the development and the ending of this very long saga without being able to discuss it. We would have a world of things to tell you, tons of answers to reveal, but after completing the game and saving the game, we fully understood Tetsuya Nomura's decision to lock down a small part of the narrative until the game's official release. Some copies have also been around for several weeks, so the information is out there on the web if you know where to look - we were very careful to write this review without revealing too much about the story. Let us tell you one thing, though: in all honesty, we didn't think Tetsuya Nomura would be able to unravel the complicated skein of characters and subplots he's been tackling all these years. We are glad we were wrong. Disney characters and worlds, the heart of the game Kingdom Hearts III has two hearts. The heart of Disney are the worlds that we will explore in what we could define as the first part of the game. Fans of the series should be prepared for the experience: each of the Disney worlds catapults the trio of characters made up of Sora, Donald and Goofy into the vicissitudes of its inhabitants. In this sense, Kingdom Hearts III partially reverses expectations, retracing the history of feature films in some cases and telling a completely new storyline in others. Obviously Nomura summarized the scripts with a painstaking cut and sew work, necessary to fit his creations into the narrative, starting with the protagonists but above all the antagonists. From this point of view, the result is not exactly stellar, and at a certain point it takes on a rather frustrating dynamic. In the Disney worlds, in fact, the main plot of the saga takes very few steps forward in Kingdom Hearts 3 and Sora's nemeses, the members of Organization XIII, almost serve to summarize the previous installments, clarifying some very specific obscure points of the complicated Kingdom Hearts mythology. Obscure points which, however, for a fan who knows the series really well, shouldn't be at all. So let's say that these scenes serve more than anything else to set the stage, reminding the players with great clarity of some details that perhaps may have escaped them. Kingdom Hearts III is, however, above all the story of Xehanort and the incredible chess game he has been playing all these years. We had the clear impression that the Disney worlds have been treated in a less incisive way, on the narrative front, and also on that of the gameplay. It is evident that some are much better designed and developed than others. The world of the Caribbean, which had aroused enormous perplexity at its announcement, proved to be one of the most engaging and varied, especially in terms of content. Even the worlds of Frozen, Big Hero 6 and Rapunzel have impressed us positively, while the Monstropolis of Monsters & Co. is undoubtedly the weak link in the chain, a too linear and repetitive world that acts as a sequel to the Pixar feature film. Even the world dedicated to Toy Story narrates, without great enthusiasm, an unpublished story that ideally places itself between Toy Story and Toy Story 2, but which fortunately focuses entirely on the two iconic figures that have become Woody and Buzz Lightyear over the years. The fact that some worlds are characterized by specific features - the sailing ship in the case of the Caribbean, the free roaming component in San Fransokyo and so on - reinforces the idea that more work has been done on some than on others, but in general this part of the game guarantees a remarkable variety of situations, contents and activities. Rather, the reconstruction of the worlds in question leaves you speechless, without ifs and buts. Kingdom Hearts III is, at times, indistinguishable from related CG films. It is not only beautiful to look at, but meticulously cared for in every respect. What struck us above all was the texturing work of the garments and the modeling of the characters, absolutely identical to their cinematic counterparts and even better in the case of productions that last more than a few years on their shoulders, such as Monsters & Co. In some worlds, the visual style also changes drastically to better blend Sora and his companions into the universe they ended up in. If in the Toy Box Sora assumesand the square shape of an old action figure, in the Caribbean world a much more realistic rendering has been opted for so that not even Goofy or Donald Duck appear too out of place together with the excellent reproductions of the actors who played Jack Sparrow, Barbossa and so on . Yoko Shimomura's soundtrack, on the other hand, seemed a little less inspired than usual, probably because the well-known composer had to rearrange her most famous melodies into pieces that only vaguely reminded them. Anyone who has played the previous Kingdom Hearts will have gotten used to this part of the soundtrack by now and knows very well that Shimomura, without constraints and restrictions, composes thrilling songs. It happens in Kingdom Hearts III too, but you have to get to the moments where Disney steps aside to feel the real Shimomura in action. Square Enix, a beating heart Kingdom Hearts III has another heart that beats even more vigorously in its chest and it is that of Square Enix. It is not the Square Enix of Final Fantasy: the extras of the famous JRPG series, which have become increasingly rare from release to release, are simply absent here, except for the Moogles who manage the shops and some tiny references. This is the heart of Tetsuya Nomura's Square, the story and characters he has written and rewritten over the past seventeen years. It is a heart that beats between worlds, slowly developing the story left unfinished with Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance, putting each piece in its place. It is felt to gain strength each time a new world is completed. The story gains momentum, revelations and clarifications follow each other at an increasingly frenetic pace, and then it explodes in what we could define as the second part of the game. Completed the last Disney world, Kingdom Hearts 3 immediately catapults us into a final rush of long cinematics interspersed with played parts and increasingly spectacular boss fights. The decision to reserve the development of the main plot for the final part of the game could make one turn up one's nose, but Kingdom Hearts III is a title that hosts dozens of characters among whom there are complex relationships that branch out in various directions, through other games. In doing so, Tetsuya Nomura made sure to bring the player / spectator to the showdown gradually, without overwhelming him with information which, by structuring the script in a different way, could have disoriented even the most attentive. In this way, however, the conclusion maintains all its emotional charge, leaves few open questions and conveys a beautiful and profound message on the strength of the bonds. Cloying, perhaps, but in a gloomy and hostile world like the one we live in today, a little sugar every now and then doesn't hurt. Playstation 4 trophies Most of the Kingdom Hearts 3 PS4 trophies are unlocked simply by progressing through the story and visiting the various worlds, but for the more challenging trophies you will have to play the various mini-games over and over again, scouring every corner for secrets and completing the various sections of Sora's Gumiphone. First the form of the substance? As we have already said, Kingdom Hearts III is a real feast for the eyes and each fight is so full of particle effects, explosions and animations that even some small slowdowns can occur, although not at all worrying. Nomura was so careful about the look of the product and the spectacularity of each fight that he sometimes forgot about the game. Don't worry, we're not saying that Kingdom Hearts III is a subdued title in terms of gameplay, on the contrary it lets itself be played wonderfully, but it maintains that somewhat ignorant ~button mashing~ component that the franchise has been carrying around for a lifetime. The control system is simple and intuitive: in fact it doesn't even use all the keys on the controller and most of the special actions are activated automatically or by pressing a certain key. Sora can attack enemies in a variety of ways. First of all with his Keyblade: closing a combo triggers a special attack and the transformation of the Keyblade itself into a more powerful variant. Then there are the spells and the Bonds, the summons that are obtained by completing some segments of the story. Special actions, such as Attractions or combo attacks with partymates, trigger randomly as you attack enemies; the Attractions, in particular, almost look like mini-games to be completed in a certain time limit to inflict as much damage as possible on enemies. By leveling up or defeating certain bosses, Sora and his friends learn a bewildering amount of special abilities that allow them to customize theiror repertoire, for example by increasing the range of Sora's shots or the power of his spells. Each skill has a cost in points which is deducted from a cap that increases with the protagonist's level. This would imply a strategic selection of the right skills to use according to the circumstances, but in reality the role-playing component we are talking about is very mild indeed. Sora for better or worse can always equip each skill and since there is none that could be disadvantageous - apart from a couple designed specifically for those who want a more demanding experience - you always end up equipping them all. We played Kingdom Hearts 3 on the Standard difficulty level and completed it in about 35 hours of play, without messing around too much with the optional content that would probably extend its longevity quite a lot, and despite this we never felt the need to increase by level to defeat a certain boss or to put more than necessary hands on the equipment of Sora, Goofy or Donald Duck, if not choosing the best weapons and accessories as we found them or learned to synthesize them. We rarely resorted to Potions and other consumable items or the dishes of the little chef Rmy, limiting ourselves to hitting the enemies hard with the best Keyblades at our disposal. Sora gets a new Keyblade in each world and can upgrade it by consuming some very specific materials. Keyblades are technically divided into three categories: there are balanced ones, those that enhance magic and those that are stronger in hand-to-hand combat. Some Keyblades take the form of ranged weapons, providing an alternative to close combat, and Sora can equip up to three of them at once, switching between them during battle. This game mechanic suggests a strategic element that the player should pay attention to, but in reality it soon becomes just a matter of numbers since it rarely happens to implement particular strategies in the noise of battle. The same goes for the free-flow mechanics that allow Sora to use surfaces and structures as stepping stones. Simply, there are so many mechanics, skills and variables but you don't need to learn any of them to finish the game. Obviously the post-game content - which includes secret bosses and other more challenging fights - require a greater knowledge of the game mechanics, but until the end Kingdom Hearts III remains the chaotic ~button mashing~ that we all expected. From a certain point of view, it's understandable: the simplicity of the system guarantees even the less experienced player a fun and spectacular experience. By repeatedly pressing the attack key, Sora automatically approaches the selected target, chasing him even when he moves. In this way, Nomura at least stems the player's real enemy: the camera. Over time you get used to it, but the way the camera loses sight of the player, forcing us to constantly realign it to look for targets to attack, is extremely frustrating. The lock-on system doesn't help at all: by pressing a controller's back button, Sora locks onto the closest enemy, but this is a function that leaves the time he finds in battles against small fish and even less when the boss to attack it is only one. It seems that the staff behind Kingdom Hearts III have a problem with the cameras, because even in the Gummiship shooter minigame - basically a game within a game - it is quite difficult to align the ship's course with the camera. Fortunately, space combat - let's call it that - keeps a fixed shot and belongs to a ~bullet hell~ genre that requires steady nerves and a little patience. Again we didn't have to commit too much effort to collect components and treasures among the asteroids, but players who want to sink their claws into this content will find bread for their teeth. The Gummiship mode is in fact very rich: the space stages that separate the worlds are full of hidden bosses, enemies to defeat and materials to be obtained to enhance the predefined Gummiships, perhaps by rebuilding them from scratch. In short, on the side activities front, Kingdom Hearts III can boast a disproportionate and unpredictable amount of content. The most important thing is that it can be played by anyone with minimal effort: the series has never had any pretensions to technicality and complexity, but thanks to the power of this generation it seems that Nomura has finally managed to materialize every spectacular idea that whirling in his head and that the old consoles had never allowed him", "date": "2019-01-24", "grade": "9.0"}
