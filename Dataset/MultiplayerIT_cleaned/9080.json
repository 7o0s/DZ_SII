{"name": "Platform al cubo", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/93402-edge-extended-platform-al-cubo.html", "text": "Tested version: iPhoneThose who have followed the indie scene on iPhone and iPad will know it well: the legal dispute between the independent development team Mobigame and the patent-troll Tim Langdell was one of the most talked about and controversial cases of last year, causing the repeated puzzle game EDGE removed from the App Store. Having won the case and obtained the go-ahead for using the name and publishing the game, Mobigame was able to confirm new plans for its small mobile title. So, after the recent release of the PC and Mac version, and while a full-fledged sequel is currently in development, the French team has launched EDGE Extended on iOS devices, an improved edition of the original game. If we exclude a series of totally unpublished levels, there are deliberately few innovations introduced in the aesthetic realization or in the gameplay formula, and at this point we just have to ask ourselves: will it really be worth playing a more of the same? Rolling through edgy levels Reproducing the exact mechanics at the base of the first EDGE, this Extended version puts the player in control of a colored cube which, rolling on its sides, must climb bleachers and move from one platform to another in an attempt to reach the end of each level . The control system allows you to freely choose whether to rely on the motion sensors or on the touch screen controls, while each level becomes more and more complex and articulated, full of switches to activate, platforms on which to climb with timing and, above all, traps to avoid. In fact, it may happen that a moving block pushes the player away from a platform or that the latter crumbles under him, but an interesting novelty introduced in EDGE Extended is the Dark Cube: in some levels a spiteful cube will appear black who will try in every way to activate various traps capable of hindering the player's path; so you will have to hurry, anticipate his moves and try to get to the finish line as soon as possible. Although it does not represent a revolution in the Mobigame series, it is certainly a small idea capable of adding a bit of variety between one level and another in a pleasant way. And, speaking of levels, EDGE Extended offers 44 unpublished ones, although someone reworks in a more or less veiled way ideas and puzzle design choices already seen in the first episode. Once again, the replayability of the experience is ensured by the presence of some prisms to collect along the way: many of these are hidden within a scenario, perhaps behind a column or on an apparently unreachable platform, and it will be the player constantly checks the map for clues as to where and how to move. In addition, and this is another novelty of EDGE Extended, by collecting all the prisms of each level you can access the Ghost Mode, an option thanks to which it is possible to compete in speed challenges against your own 'ghosts', in an attempt to constantly improve the records of each scenario. If the novelties in terms of gameplay stop here, a few more words should be spent on the progress made by the game with regard to its audiovisual component. The optimization of the graphics engine and support for Retina Display are more than evident: in addition to flowing smoothly at 60fps, the puzzle game introduces new graphic effects and camera twists, including the so-called Vertigo Effect, capable of giving more liveliness to a minimalist and simple graphics but at the same time elegant and stylish. However, although the lack of Retina Display may lead one to think otherwise, EDGE Extended gives its best played on iPad 2, thanks above all to the combination of a larger screen and a 4x Anti Aliasing Multi Sampling. Words of praise should also be spent on the new chiptune soundtrack, but by now it should be clear that those who played the first episode cannot expect more than a ~more of the same~ than the original, although this is far from a thing negative: after all, the original EDGE was a considerable success above all thanks to intuitive and apparently simple mechanics, but accompanied by impeccable controls and over-the-top level design. All elements that in Extended are present in great dust. The tested version is 1.0.3 Price: 2.39 App Store links", "date": "2011-09-20", "grade": "8.8"}
