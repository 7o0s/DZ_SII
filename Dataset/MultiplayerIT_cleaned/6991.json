And it is even more surprising to note the effort of Wizard of the Coast, the inventor of the franchise, to try year after year, the path of renewal of his digital project, that Duels of the Planeswalker which, in the 2015 edition, is the protagonist of this review. It is useless to embark on the periodic diatribe of the objective of this video game, its comparison with Magic Online or its nature as a Trojan horse capable of ferrying Magic newbies to the myriad of shops scattered around the world to stimulate them to try the physical card game after gaining experience in peace, in your own home, perhaps hidden behind the virtual anonymity of the Internet with this very Duels. Before getting to the heart of the review, we therefore refer you to the Magic: The Gathering Wikipedia page in case you want to know more about this worldwide phenomenon and its mechanics, otherwise make yourself comfortable and we will try to explain what (doesn't) work in this edition. Duels of the Planeswalker 2015 arrives on the digital market making a sensational misstep Competition is often good... Magic 2015 arrives on the market this year in a decidedly different scenario from that of the previous editions. The competition in the genre of trading card games has increased dramatically and alongside the now mature Shadow Era and SolForge, just to name a couple, we find another ruthless opponent for a few months: Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft by Blizzard who this period is enriched by the first semi-free package of additional content. In short, the situation has changed significantly compared to the period in which talking about card games was equivalent to talking about Magic (and vice versa) and thinking of playing a CCG on an iPad or console meant buying and downloading Duels of the Planeswalker. Also, but not only for these reasons, the 2015 edition is extremely renewed, at least on paper. The first thing you notice, once you enter the game, is the design choice that has led to an extremely minimal cut game board, completely in white, black and grayscale with only the band dedicated to fights, colored with red, which opens and closes during the dedicated phase. All this to give the maximum possible prominence to the cards on the field and to that minimum of effects that populate the playing area during the challenges. The result half convinced us because if on the one hand this simple graphic cut is certainly appreciable, in line with the design choices adopted by programs and operating systems in recent years, on the other hand much more could certainly have been done with the visual. In fact, the playing field continues to be too far away and it is necessary to constantly zoom in on the opponent's cards, interrupting the flow of the game, to read their skills and characteristics. We still don't understand why it's not possible to use a sort of free camera that can be controlled perhaps with the mouse or a much closer view of the opponent considering that in the end we are mainly interested in him, given that we certainly know the cards in our deck Better. And the second view implemented from above, also asymmetrical and too distant, is of little use. The other important restyling concerns the menus and more generally the navigation between the various game options. From this point of view, the work done by Stainless Games, the developer who has always followed the series, can only be criticized. Not so much in the touch environment, where in any case the interface remains quite intuitive, but above all on PC and consoles where both the very long animated transitions each time an item is selected and the arrangement of these menus that force the player to lose a long time to reach some features, sometimes even making a mistake in the selection due to the poor accuracy of the hud. ...but not this time Unfortunately, even on the content front, things aren't much better. Magic 2015 offers the classic campaign divided into chapters, five to be exact, each consisting of four challenges of increasing difficulty against opponents who use specific decks for the tactics adopted. Plus a kind of free mode that is unlocked once the Piano is completed and allows you to participate in a virtually infinite number of random encounters. All this to meet the biggest introduction of this edition of Duels: the free unlocking of cardsthrough booster packs. For each challenge won, we earn a packet that allows us to have access to a variable and random number of new cards that we can immediately insert into our deck or that we can use to set up a new deck. In fact, finally, with this version of Duels of the Planeswalker we are given the possibility to completely configure the deck from scratch. From creatures to spells, including lands, everything is customizable with only the classic rule of the minimum 60 cards. The interface that allows us to do this is probably the most successful thing in the entire game thanks to a whole series of filters that allow us to observe the mana curve, set the division of the lands, filter the cards owned based on the set, to colors and types and invariably to complete the deck automatically with the help of artificial intelligence. Unfortunately, in the face of so much freedom we find ourselves banging our heads against a content unlocking mechanic that is nothing short of unhealthy. In fact, once the initial tutorial is completed, the game will ~give~ us one of the ten pre-built two-color decks included in the game. At that point we will have to go on to the sound of booster packs earned with the challenges won. The problem is that many of the battles in the campaign will put our scarce pre-built deck to the test, forcing us to face random battles or the simplest opponents dozens and dozens of times before being able to unlock an acceptable number of cards to enhance our deck. The only possible alternative is to start ~over~ by unlocking another basic deck that replaces the previous one (obviously we don't lose the unwrapped cards) in the hope that this one fits better with the cards we've managed to win. This mechanic is at the limit of the wildest grinding and in addition to being rather boring, it can be extremely frustrating on some occasions (someone said Hydra?). Obviously there is a solution: pay. Magic 2015 is sold for 9.99 on PC and consoles while on iOS it can be downloaded for free with only the tutorial and the first act unlocked. In addition, numerous microtransactions are offered (not so micro) to purchase sets of cards, their foil versions, the entire collection of almost 1000 cards for the ~modest~ sum of 18.99 (actually they are little more of 300 different cards with various multiple copies) or boosters called premium. Yes, because as if the unlock mechanics described above weren't enough, a group of cards, 43 to be exact, can be earned only and exclusively by purchasing the special packets at a cost of 1.99 each. In short, not only will you have to sweat hundreds of shirts to have a consistent and useful number of cards with which to upgrade or build your deck, but if you really want to complete the collection, at some point we will have to open your wallet. Stainless Games' choice to cut all the multiplayer or additional modes developed and implemented in the past editions is also not very understandable: therefore forget the draft / sealed or the Two-Headed Giant or the challenges Just to name a few; this time the multiplayer is a simple one on one. And obviously we make all these criticisms with great regret in the light of a gameplay, the typical one of Magic, which obviously works and knows how to give enormous satisfaction as soon as you manage to get into the game and hit the right combination of cards with which to put standing your own grimoire. After all, it is no coincidence that this card game has regained so much strength on the market in recent years.", "date": "2014-07-23", "grade": "6.0"}
