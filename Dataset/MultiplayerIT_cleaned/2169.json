{"name": "Lust from Beyond", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lust-from-beyond-recensione.html", "text": "Video games often deal with eroticism in a sheepish and vulgar way. In particular, the admittedly erotic games always seem to want to present themselves as substitutes for pornographic films, as if there weren't infinite possible and explorable nuances between absolute chastity and the detailed representation of sexual relations. Lust from Beyond is instead proposed as an openly erotic adventure, but eager to address the theme in a higher way, so to speak, introducing it into a narrative frame that magnifies it, rather than demeans it, as we will see in the course of the review. History Inspired by the stories of H.P. Lovecraft and the works of H.R. Giger and Zdzislaw Beksinski, Lust from Beyond is set in the present day and tells the story of Victor Holloway, an antiques dealer suffering from a sex addiction who decides to seek treatment so as not to jeopardize his relationship with his current partner, Lily. Victor is also oppressed by strange dreams, which will prove to be more real than he could ever imagine and which will put him in contact with the Cult of Ecstasy, led by the mysterious Amanda Moon, who will make him discover the existence of Lusst'Ghaa, a parallel dimension, domain of the god of pleasure lauv'abrarc, whose inhabitants live perpetually in the throes of sexual euphoria and often take pleasure in the pain of others. All this translates into a horror adventure in which there is no shortage of sexually explicit moments, but all well contextualized by the story and never gratuitous or put so much to satisfy the player's voyeuristic taste, so much so that the story also offers a good dramatic crescendo, which leads in one of two possible endings. Adventure gameplay In terms of gameplay Lust from Beyond offers a good variety of things to do. From the very first chapters, in order to move forward, the player is called upon to solve puzzles, in reality never too complicated, which however require you to explore the length and breadth of the levels, such as finding some objects to complete an order for the Victor or find a flyer to be able to call a certain character. In this sense, the game is quite clear in terms of design and almost never gives precise indications on where to find what, so much so that some may find it almost distracting at times. In reality, that of the developers seemed to us to be a deliberate choice, made to increase the difficulty of the game and to allow users to study each map inch by inch, where hidden details and little secrets are not lacking. However, a real problem is that of the difficulty of identifying interactive objects, which basically require you to get close to every visible thing to verify that it can be useful or not. Fortunately, the adventure phases are quite calm, in the sense that the player is often left free to move, without enemies to oppress him, so you have all the time you want. As the game continues, which in total took us just over eight hours to complete, the puzzles also evolve. For example, having obtained a gun, puzzles are introduced where you have to shoot certain elements of the scenario. Everything is studied quite well, even if we have to admit that many may find the general pace a little too slow, despite the sudden acceleration of some sequences. The worst moments, from this point of view, are the adventure phases that take place on Lusst'Ghaa, much more repetitive in design than those that take place in our world and more focused on environmental puzzles that are not exactly interesting. Perhaps we could have avoided making the world of ecstasy a place where you have to go around hunting for pieces of objects, but we imagine that this would have shortened the gameplay a lot. Survival But Lust from Beyond is also a survival horror... which unfortunately is also its worst side. Whether the enemies on duty are bloodthirsty cultists or lustful monsters who want to enjoy tearing us apart, their artificial intelligence is not very developed anyway. Basically they just look for us around the map and run towards us as soon as we enter their field of vision, without intermediate states. In theory, the game provides a barely sketched stealth system, which however limits itself to allowing us to walk crouched to make less noise and does not provide particular precautions regarding the distance from the enemy or the positioning in shadow or light areas. Be that as it may, Victor soon comes into possession of weapons that also introduce a combat system, unfortunately also sketchy and unsatisfactory. In particular, knife fighting seems like a game of luck, while the gun gives some more excitement (but don't expect Lust from Beyon to beform in Doom), especially due to the slowness of reloading the weapon, which forces you not to shoot wildly. Be that as it may, the stages where there are enemies to avoid or eliminate, set in the real world or in Lusst'Ghaa it doesn't matter, are the least interesting of the entire game, because they create very little tension, especially after understanding the simple mechanics that they regulate them. Graphics From a technical point of view Lust from Beyond is a good title, and made with great intelligence. The environments are generally small, but full of tasty details, a smart choice given that the development team is not very large. Usually the largest and least detailed areas are also the ones that you travel through most quickly, so you don't have much time to observe them. Particular applause goes to the realization of the world of Lusst'Ghaa, which manages to convey a strong sense of distorted carnality, while being a bit repetitive in its general elements. In essence we are faced with an excellent work from almost every point of view. What is less convincing are the human models, especially the faces, which are far too stock, even if dignified (especially those of the main characters). Unfortunately, independent productions always have major limitations from this point of view, because they lack the resources to access the most advanced, often very expensive, modeling technologies. The same goes for the animations, good but not exceptional, apart from those of the erotic scenes which are the most accurate.", "date": "2021-03-14", "grade": "7.0"}
