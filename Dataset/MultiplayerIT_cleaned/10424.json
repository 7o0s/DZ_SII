After all, the Tap Tap Revenge series proves it unequivocally: perfect synchrony between audio and video, an ideal input device for the type of application and excellent support for online features such as multiplayer, chat, friends lists, rankings and obviously DLC (whether free or paid). Tap Tap Revenge 3, the latest episode of the product created by GoGo Apps, constitutes a bit the ~summa~ of the elements developed so far and it is no coincidence that it focuses its attention on online modes, while allowing the player not only some music tracks for single games, but also a nice local multiplayer in which two people can challenge each other by touching the screen of a single iPhone. Being an application with a very low cost (79 cents), the policy of making only four songs by not very popular artists immediately available is clear, leaving the user free to purchase packages signed by the big names in the world charts (at the usual price of 1 euro per song) or to freely download all the free songs still available. And there are so many. Online battles The most impressive aspect of Tap Tap Revenge 3 is undoubtedly the support for online multiplayer modes, which in fact form the core of the game. Once our alter ego has been created, we can in fact select a room from those available, divided according to musical genre and level of difficulty, and find many people ready to challenge us. The waiting times between one game and another are used by the application to download the songs on which notes you will battle, so it's best to play by connecting to a wi-fi network to keep download speeds high. Once on the track, our goal is to tap the screen in the indicated areas, following the rhythm of the song. Depending on the difficulty level selected, the structure of the songs can change radically and produce details that are not shown at the lowest level. Anyone who knows the Guitar Hero or Rock Band series knows very well what we are talking about. The touch screen isn't the only input device to be implicated, however: we're sometimes asked to shake the iPhone up, left, or right. In these situations, unfortunately, the accuracy of Tap Tap Revenge 3 leaves much to be desired: often the ~vertical~ shaking is recognized even if we have not done it, while the lateral ones are really difficult to implement. Nothing to say, however, about taps: the correspondence between image and sound is very precise, almost perfect, and allows us to do real acrobatics with our fingers. Beautiful songs to see In this kind of rhythm game the interface counts a lot, and in this sense GoGo Apps has been able to do great things. Although the mode selection screen appears a bit chaotic at first glance, things become simple in a matter of minutes and matches can be organized quite quickly. The scenario within which the ~strokes~ move, to be touched in rhythm, is characterized by excellent ~readability~ and a good use of colours. The graphics always flow smoothly, which is very important, and the visual rendering of the ~bonuses~ and ~malus~ appears convincing. As in any product of this kind, our precision entitles us to some weapons that we can use to make life difficult for our opponents, as well as the classic ~state of grace~ in which the score is multiplied by a few seconds. In case the songs have been purchased, the background changes accordingly with an image of the band or singer. The tested version is 3.0", "date": "2009-10-30", "grade": "8.0"}
