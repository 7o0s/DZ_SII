We tell you immediately so you get ready to read the review of a game that frankly doesn't even deserve to be evaluated. It is depressing to see the state in which a franchise that in the past has been able to provide so much satisfaction thanks to some brilliant ideas has fallen. A generation of gamers grew up performing tricks on the notes of Rage Against the Machine or Bad Religion, exploring every single pixel to discover all the secrets hidden in the magnificent levels of the first four chapters, in search of the highest possible score; in simple terms, it was pure gaming fun. Today, thirteen years after that distant 2002, many things have changed and unfortunately the developers in charge of the series are the Robomodos, who have amply demonstrated that they are unable to understand the essence of what made the franchise so famous in Worldwide. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 is the final insult to a saga that began brilliantly and ended tragically Horrible gameplay Let's start with the basics. The movements, the timing of the jumps, the complex system of tricks and the clever level design skeletonized an almost perfect experience in (almost) every previous form: unfortunately the same cannot be said of this last one chapter, problematic in practically every basic area. Let's start with the controls, familiar to all those who have already tried any previous episode, which are probably one of the few elements that cannot be criticized if it weren't for the addition of the ~slam~ function, which allows you to quickly fall to the ground from any height you find. In itself it is a novelty that could make the action very interesting, if implemented well, but unfortunately you will have already understood that things have not gone the right way. To activate it you have to press the button that is assigned to the grinds and here we notice the first gigantic problem, given that when the avatar is thrown like a missile on the ground it also interrupts any trick in the execution phase, potentially ruining a beautiful set of combos. This is a change that substantially impacts the game mechanics and is only a half-sketched idea, as if it had accidentally remained in the code and escaped quality control. The missions, another element that made the first episodes masterpieces, are extremely boring and although they appear varied at first glance, it doesn't take much to realize that in reality they are always the same four or five slightly modified in each stage. We talk about things like: pushing balls into the pool, picking up or destroying some objects, performing a certain number of grinds or pushing the balls (the ones from before) out of the pool. By completing the objectives you receive stars that allow you to unlock the next levels, full of the same boring stuff as the previous ones. Too bad that by disabling the notifications for the achievements there is no other visual indicator that suggests that you have gained access to a new area; you must therefore exit the game, return to the main menu and check if there is any news. The system is so cumbersome that it is frustrating to attempt a mission: in the meantime, the indicators on the map most of the time don't work, so you have to access the pause menu, select the challenge, wait for you to be disconnected from the online lobby, wait for the map to is loaded again, wait a few seconds for no apparent reason, wait for the avatar to position itself and finally also wait for the three second countdown. It is practically the festival of waiting and be careful not to make a mistake even once, otherwise you will have to repeat the whole procedure all over again. The functionality has not yet been talked about - even if it would be more correct to define it as a malfunction - online because it is a totally useless feature that adds nothing to the experience: the game is always connected to the internet and during any game other users can gradually appear that roam freely around the level and sometimes, in a completely arbitrary way, can disturb the progress of a combo or a grind, as if the physics engine remembered from time to time that it also had to manage polygonal collisions. Obviously interacting with other people is not possible except by creating a useless party, given that by completing a mission you are catapulted into a totally different lobby from the starting one; moreover, if you are connected to the network during a single player game, the game still tries to access the servers and if there are problems, which practically always happen, you have to wait for the timeout,disconnect the console from the web and connect it again. It is a resounding waste of time. Playstation 4 trophies Tony Hawk's pro skater 5 offers 46 trophies, of which five are silver and four are gold. Most are unlocked by simply completing game levels, while the more difficult ones require the completion of some specific objectives, such as performing a certain amount of grind or a large number of tricks in a single game. Bugs, glitches and crashes If the gameplay is a total disaster, one can only be disappointed by the technical sector as well, a real tragedy that spares no element and only makes the situation more depressing. We start from the graphics and it doesn't take much to notice a slight cel shading effect which, although not evil, cannot hide how poorly cared for the textures and the general look of the product are. As if that weren't enough, sometimes it happens that parts of the level are not loaded in time and therefore walls can be glimpsed in the distance without any element applied to them; moreover, in the maps created by the users this effect is amplified, given that sometimes it is possible to glimpse the ramps and other objects that do not fit perfectly with the setting. Collision handling is really bad and it's hard to believe that no programmer has ever noticed how sometimes the avatar disappears into the ground, passes through walls, is guillotined during a landing or simply takes off for no apparent reason. Frequent crashes and critical bugs complete the picture of a disaster that doesn't deserve to be remembered even for its mediocrity, if it weren't for the fact that we are talking about a brand that is still very loved among fans, despite the fact that the latest chapters have not certainly shone for the high quality of the proposal. Unfortunately Robomodo has already amply demonstrated that it doesn't have what it takes to be considered a good development team, but with this disaster they have completed the circle started in 2009 with Ride. Fortunately, the license to use the name Tony Hawk expires at the end of 2015, but a bitter taste remains in the mouth for this fifth chapter conceived with the sole intention of squeezing every last penny from some nostalgic of past times. To conclude on a positive note of hope, we can at least say that the soundtrack is the only element that is saved thanks to punk and rock songs that deviate from the usual commercial canons. It is still a trifle that does not redeem a product that is simply a great joke.", "date": "2015-10-21", "grade": "2.5"}
