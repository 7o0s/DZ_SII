Capcom 2 and Marvel Vs. Capcom 3 is destined to become just a bad memory: the Japanese company is very fast today and more than determined to invest in the successful crossover that has become a fixed appointment for lovers of fighting games and for those who love tournaments even just to watch them. While it's true that it's hard to beat the technicalities and depth of Street Fighter V, it's equally true that few fighting games manage to excite both players and fans like the latest clash between the parallel universes of Marvel Comics and Capcom. Close to the announcement of Marvel Vs. Capcom: Infinite, the new episode that will arrive in 2017 with many changes to the well-established formula, also comes the conversion for PlayStation 4 of the second version of Marvel Vs. Capcom 3. But this time it will be ~ definitive~ in the truest sense of the word? Capcom moves the Ultimate Marvel Vs. Capcom 3 battlefield to PlayStation 4 Playstation 4 trophies The trophies are the same ones already unlockable in the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita versions, therefore 1 platinum, 2 gold, 11 silver and 33 bronze trophies. You will have to play a lot to earn the points necessary to acquire certain trophies and perform some particular actions in combat. The definition of a crossover One would argue that a universe collision of this magnitude should have a story to give it meaning, but that is certainly not the case with Ultimate Marvel Vs. Capcom 3: Beyond the global threat posed by the gigantic Galactus, the final boss in Arcade mode , there is practically nothing that justifies the meeting of such different characters, if not the evergreen desire to lead hands. Perhaps it is also this that makes the single player sector a bit disappointing, rather monotonous and primitive since the first release of 2011 despite the subsequent implementation of the Heroes and Heralds mode which allows a minimum level of customization relying on a backstory to say the least not very transparent. Ultimate Marvel Vs. Capcom 3 is, in short, hard and pure fanservice in all respects, even if the roster, at least at first glance, gives a totally different impression. Among the fighters chosen by Capcom to represent the two universes are the inevitable Ryu, Iron Man, Dante and Wolverine, for example, to which, however, are added less popular figures such as Tron Bonne and Frank West on the Capcom side or M.O.D.O.K. and the Marvel side Super Skrull. In between, between very famous characters and other practically unknown ones, hovers a gray area in which the most ardent fans of comics or video games will certainly recognize heroes of the caliber of Zero or X-23, perhaps demonstrating that at Capcom some trend. Despite what the roster may convey, there are still fifty different fighters, without the clones or variants that plagued the endless selection screen in Marvel Vs. Capcom 2: the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One version of the game includes from the beginning also the two characters released in the past as DLC, namely Jill Valentine and Shuma Gorath, as well as all the alternate costumes released during the last five years. However, the beauty of Ultimate Marvel Vs. Capcom 3 lies in the diversity and imagination that characterize the movesets of the various characters: they are all different and full of personality, easy to memorize but extremely complicated to master perfectly. In keeping with the fidelity to the original release, there are still some generic imbalance problems that still make us turn up our noses today: in the hands of an expert player, some wrestlers are able to leave no way out for their opponents, harassing them with almost infinite combos without those can react or break the assault if not through the use of the so-called X-Factor, a devastating temporary enhancement capable of reversing the fate of a match. This is a basic problem of the gameplay with which you have to come to terms if you intend to play at certain levels, especially online, and which has basically split the opinion of the public in two, dividing it between those who madly loved this chapter of the saga and who, on the other hand, hated it deeply since the early days: Ultimate Marvel Vs. Capcom 3 is an immediate and highly spectacular title, but also very chaotic. You must first of all learn to read the action in the chaos of particle effects, explosions and cannon shots that fill the entire screen, which probably divides the more casual players from those who seem to win by pressing random keys even though they can actually see a secret order in the heat of battle. This is more than ever true in the PlayStation 4 edition: resolution at 1080p and the frame rate still at 60 frames per second, without hesitation even when pandemonium literally breaks out on the screen, guarantee not only a real feast for the eyes, but also for the fingertips. The reactive and precise control system allows the easy execution of the various special moves with loading and half moons, especially in the middle of the combos that can be extended thanks to the Assist system: in practice, once the three team members have been chosen, we must also choose the type of attack we want to carry out if recalled in battle by pressing the appropriate key. In this way it is possible to decide whether Ryu must appear to throw a Hadoken horizontally or strike upwards with his Shoryuken, for example, and it is clear that the animation will fit in a completely different way in the combination of blows we are performing at the time of the recall. Assists need a short recharge period which limits their use, but players can still switch characters at any time and, with a little skill, weave ground and air combos with special moves, normal attacks and super moves that draw on a specific indicator. Unfortunately, the next-gen release of Ultimate Marvel Vs. Capcom 3 does not seem to have benefited from a netcode that has still proved to be capricious and frustrating today. The game has already run its course and online matches are becoming increasingly scarce, forcing us to repeatedly go through a far from streamlined interface every time we look for a match, without perhaps finding it; as if that weren't enough, the quality of the connections is often questionable, making some matches almost unplayable. No problem locally, however, where Ultimate Marvel Vs. Capcom 3 really gives its best, perhaps also because the possibility of mocking one's friends live is still priceless.", "date": "2016-12-13", "grade": "8.0"}
