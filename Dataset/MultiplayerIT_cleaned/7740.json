Originally, Cryptic Studios was supposed to be working on it and it was supposed to be what became Champions Online when the upper echelons felt that a game featuring Marvel characters could not compete in the MMORPG market of the time. After a few years, the license passed into the hands of Gazillion Entertainment and Secret Identity Studios, when the time was right - thanks also to the success of the Marvel Studios films - for a game like this. But what genre Marvel Heroes, formerly called Marvel Universe Online, belonged to, no one understood for a long time. Gazillion persisted in calling it MMO, limiting itself to presenting, month after month, the various characters that could have been used, from Wolverine to his now arch-nemesis Cyclops, passing through certain Avengers that there is no need even to name. The general idea was that it was a sort of DC Universe Online, but in the end the curtain lifted on what appeared to all intents and purposes a sort of Diablo. Not surprisingly, the head of the project was David Brevik, former Blizzard developer best known for being the birthplace of Diablo and Diablo II. Identity Crisis Interviewed about his new game, David Brevik found himself inevitably having to answer countless questions concerning the Diablo franchise, especially in light of the controversial release of Diablo III. Brevik's perplexities regarding the third episode of the series that had made him famous cost him a brutal tweet from his former colleague - and at the time director of Diablo III - Jay Wilson, the famous ~fuck that loser~ (translated, ~'fuck that loser~) which has practically become a meme. In short, an open war had broken out, albeit unintentionally, and Brevik found himself in the awkward position of having to live up to his illustrious and blamed competitor. Too bad he didn't succeed. Marvel Heroes starts from a different premise, mind you: it's a free title, you don't have to buy it and nobody forces us to spend a penny on microtransactions, but like all games that are based on microtransactions, in the end you stumble across a whole series of pitfalls and find designed specifically to make us hold the credit card as if it were Thor's hammer. This is not only the problem of Marvel Heroes, and we will talk about it later, but there is also that of its identity: what is David Brevik's new creature in the end? It's a hack'n'slash, basically; a real Diablo clone in which the player controls some of the most famous superheroes of the House of Ideas, assigning their powers to the keyboard and mouse keys. There's also a dash of MMORPG in between all of this, with the ability to found guilds (an MMORPG-esque name for private chat channels, after all) and play in instanced maps where others roam players looking for enemies to defeat and loot to collect. There is a story connecting the characters and their wanderings in certain areas that fans of the comics will instantly recognize, such as the Savage Land or Latveria; at the typewriter we have a somewhat subdued Brian Michael Bendis and far from the glories of his Ultimate Spiderman: also the fault of the media, of course, but the visual novel that connects the various chapters proves to be interesting enough in uniting the main Marvel heroes against the evil Doctor Doom and his gang of bad guys. From this point of view, Marvel Heroes would seem to promise well, but the moment you enter a map and find yourself surrounded by characters all the same dressed in all the same ways, the philosophy behind the game collapses and all the defects are afloat in no time. Money Men From a technical point of view, Marvel Heroes makes a good impression: it is certainly not sophisticated or cutting-edge, but the locations are full of details, the character models are well-kept and the animations fluid and spectacular. Behind every costume or skill is a painstaking research and consultancy work that makes Gazillion Entertainment's proposal without a doubt the most precise Marvel licensed game ever made. The heroes and villains are just that; they look like they came out of the pages of a comic book, and this is definitely a plus. The problems, and decidedly big ones, are found, if anything, in a lazy and monotonous level design that relies more on the spectacular than on the intelligence of the challenge and of the player. The gigantic maps are all too full of anonymous enemies to be defeated between one boss and another, boring the player also due to a disappointing balance of powers, skills and characters. Most ofThe game can be completed using no more than a couple of skills, halfheartedly resorting to a trivial and unbalanced growth path. The bosses themselves should be tackled following very specific tactics, but in groups we are faced with a simple caciara of particle effects that hides the boss's model until he is defeated. The heroes themselves do not fully reflect their specific characteristics, and the default ones are few, too few to offer the player a good variety of approaches and strategies. It starts with Daredevil, Storm, the Thing, the Scarlet Witch and Hawkeye; the others are unlocked in two ways: bought or found. The second possibility is remote to say the least: the frequency of finding objects is very low, obviously to convince the less patient player to open his wallet to get his hands on his favorite hero or on the costume he likes best. But even in that sense, Marvel Heroes loses one of the fundamental characteristics of the MMO genre and of what Diablo, Torchlight and company belong to: aesthetic variety. Items and equipment collected during missions do not change the appearance of the heroes in any way, except when they are dressed in one of the various bonus costumes. We'd like to say that it's the stats that matter, but who are we going to fool with? One of the most important stimuli in dungeon-crawlers like this is the desire to change weapons or armor, to show off that extremely rare legendary object that will make all the other players in rags die of envy. In Marvel Heroes this does not happen, and the cost in euros of the characters and their costumes is so prohibitive as to border on the joke: you go from a couple of euros for the less famous heroes to twenty to play as Iron Man or the Spider. Without the guarantee that, in the next game, they won't find themselves defeating yet another boss. Those looking for a deep and long-lasting experience in Marvel Heroes will be disappointed Endgame Once you have completed the main campaign, defeated each boss and cleaned up each map, you have hardly reached the maximum level and obviously obtained the best equipment. At that point the terminals come into play that offer us various daily missions with which to entertain ourselves alone or in company. Again, the structure of Marvel Heroes leans too much on microtransactions, putting a strain on the player's patience. If it is true that one terminal offers a series of fully accessible missions, which will require us to retrace some maps to defeat an enhanced version of the original boss who presided over them, it is equally true that another terminal entices us with the promise of more interesting challenges and then decidedly more tempting rewards only to then throw the need to unlock each mission by consuming a cosmic key. This object is very rare and can be found by completing the basic daily missions, but if you are unlucky - and it happens often - you find yourself faced with a crossroads: twiddling your thumbs or paying a cosmic key in hard cash? And who guarantees that it's money well spent? And if we don't find anything useful, what should we do? Buy another one to try your luck in another daily quest? Just like in a game of chance, we find ourselves bombarding ourselves with questions and answering according to conscience; this is the philosophy that characterizes Brevik's new game, and even if in one of the most recent patches the need to buy a cosmic key has been removed, the fact remains that, if you choose the path of parsimony, you will soon run out of content. The third post-game terminal fortunately offers two alternatives to the insipid grinding of objects in the form of a survival mode, in which you have to survive numerous waves of enemies in the company of other heroes, and a challenge mode in which you have to face enhanced versions of common bosses and enemies with a limited number of attempts available. There would also be a PvP map, but it is an ongoing project at the moment so unbalanced and confusing that we prefer to refrain from commenting on it in the hope that Gazillion Entertainment will clear their minds on the matter.", "date": "2013-07-10", "grade": "6.4"}
