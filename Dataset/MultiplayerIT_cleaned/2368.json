{"name": "Crash Bandicoot: L'ira di Cortex", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/crash-bandicoot-lira-di-cortex.html", "text": "The plot The third chapter ended with Crash's victory over Dr. Cortex and his partner Uka Uka, who here we find both ready to threaten the world with a terrible new weapon. However, the weapon needs four particular stones to work and obviously the purpose of our character is to seize it before the two evil enemies. And the news? Those who know Crash Bandicoot know perfectly well that it is a platform on a ~false~ 3D, because in fact the character moves on already assigned trajectories and the real strength of the game is the precision as well as the fun given by the character himself. Well, the major flaw of Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex is precisely that it is practically the same as its predecessors! Obviously the levels and settings are new but the game structure is almost identical and does not bring any kind of technical innovation, in addition to the graphics. Graphically, Crash has always stood at excellent levels, even in the Psone versions, but now, thanks to the power of the PS2, the details have definitely increased. And so the landscapes have expanded, the textures have improved, the polygons have risen and various effects such as lights and shadows have been added. But as I said before, the secret of Crash Bandicoot's success has always been fun, given by a high playability and an effective control system. Our character will be able to run, jump, slide, rotate on itself to hit objects and enemies and acquire new skills during the levels, in some of which we will find ourselves in the role of Crash's sister, Cocoa, while in others we will also be able to use different means transport like airplanes, jeeps and stuff. The levels are structured in areas and each area has its own final boss to defeat. The thickness of the gameplay is very high even if the difficulty level is decidedly too low making it practically impossible to finish the lives. In fact, you will often find yourself with about 20 or 30 lives available given the ease with which additional ones are obtained. However, don't let that fool you, as many of the levels can be downright challenging. The aim of the game is to recover the diamonds hidden in the various paths in order to then be able to devote oneself to the bosses, as a secondary aim there is instead the usual one of breaking all the wooden boxes that we will find along the way to reach the fateful 100% at the end of the game and for those who intend to reach it, the level of difficulty rises further. It's always the same Crash The control of the character is perfect and after a little training you will be able to master it with great ease. In fact, the joypad commands respond with absolute precision. As for the sound aspect, even if it is well made, it must be said that like the rest of the game, it offers nothing more than the previous chapters but in any case the music is very catchy and the background noises are decidedly spot on. Another sore point of Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex, but this time really frustrating, is given by the really long uploads. You will notice it immediately, from the first time you insert the game on your PS2. Really inexplicable why you have to wait about a minute to go from one level to another, or simply to the main menu. Conclusions Ultimately, Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex is an excellent title, well made, fun and playable but not without defects, first of all that of having the same characteristics it had on Psone. And so one wonders if there was really a need for it and if it wouldn't have been better to add a few more novelties. The game is recommended for avid Crash fans, and is a must for those who have never played it before. While for those who want something new in the platform genre, my advice is to wait for Naughty Dog's next masterpiece: Jak & Daxter. Conclusions Pros: High gameplay Precise controls Variety of levels Cons: Infinite loading Nothing new from the past The return of the mascot One of the most famous titles for Psone was undoubtedly Crash Bandicoot which with 3 episodes has carved out its slice of success. The likeable Crash has thus become not only well known in the world of video games but has also conquered the coveted role of mascot of the old Sony gray box which at the time felt the needto give itself a symbol as Sega did with Sonic. Now that the Psone has been placed in the closet of memories to make room for the more powerful PS2 and six years after its first release, the fourth installment of the Crash Bandicoot series has arrived on time on Sony's black monolith. While the first 3 titles have always been linked to the name of the guys from Naughty Dog, this time the task of making Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex has been entrusted to Travellers' Tales, also because the creators of Crash are currently engaged in the well Jak & Daxter's largest project. However, the change of developer does not seem to have given our friend particular advantages, given that the new chapter does not offer many new features compared to previous versions.", "date": "2001-11-09", "grade": null}
