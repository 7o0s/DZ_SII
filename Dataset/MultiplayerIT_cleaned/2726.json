{"name": "Grindstone", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/grindstone-recensione-nintendo-switch.html", "text": "Grindstone's review for Nintendo Switch relaunches a relationship, that between the Japanese hybrid and the world of mobile productions, which we initially thought would be exploited in a much more convinced way, also given the numerous hardware parallels between the two platforms. As well known this did not happen and there were generally few titles that made their debut on Switch after a release on iOS and Android, most of the time deprived of the original touch control system, which does not work properly on the screen of the Nintendo console . Gameplay Grindstone tries, in his small way, to change things a bit. Available on the eShop at the price of 16.79 euros, with a 25% discount until December 29, 2020, the puzzle game by Capybara Games, the authors of Below, can be played in docked mode on the TV or in portability, but in this The last case also allows you to use the touch screen for commands. A solution that, we say right away, only half works: the original for Apple devices boasted a very fluid and intuitive action thanks to the possibility of being able to ~draw~ with a finger the trajectories of our warrior on the board, but the aforementioned Nintendo Switch touch screen does not lend itself well to this practice, falling back on single touches from box to box which are more immediate than the analog sticks, of course, but they take away fluidity and responsiveness to experience. Fortunately, the value of the original gameplay, with its many strategic implications, is not excessively affected by these shortcomings. Using an approach undoubtedly inspired by the classic Puzzle Quest, Grindstone puts us in command of a powerful Viking grappling with dungeons full of dangerous creatures but also precious loot. The character moves on the board ringing violent eliminations with sword blows based on the color of the enemies, with the possibility of performing spectacular combos and thus producing gems that are used to lengthen the killstreak by switching to enemies of different shades and thus obtaining even more rewards richer. Structure In terms of content, the core of Grindstone is represented by a very substantial single player campaign, consisting of something like 150 increasingly complex levels, in which new elements are continuously introduced in order to increase the variety of mechanics. For example, there are monsters that respond to attacks, mini bosses with high resistance, objects to destroy and chests to open. The latter allow you to obtain blueprints for weapons and skills, which you can unlock between missions, thus adding further thickness to experience. In fact, there are shields to protect ourselves from enemy attacks, arrows to eliminate a single target, area maneuvers that clean up the boxes around our character, potions to teleport to a specific area of the board and of course the possibility of restoring the energy lost in battle. Returning to the campaign, the classic path on which the levels appear leads us to explore different scenarios, which culminate with a fun boss fight in which Grinstone's mechanics are slightly modified, asking us, for example, to push bombs towards the main antagonist at the end of a combo. In this sense, the completion principles also apply: new areas cannot be accessed without the necessary crowns. That's not all: from the main screen it is also possible to access a special mode designed for those who love challenges, with particularly complicated stages, also equipped with movable elements and traps that will not hesitate to drain the health of the mighty Viking we control: the best way to test one's skills, but only after having become familiar with the game and its nuances. Technical realization Technically Grindstone does not go beyond the boundaries of the match-3 style puzzle genre, presenting itself on Nintendo Switch with a modified interface in order to extend horizontally rather than vertically, as happened with the original mobile version. Stylistically, however, the speech is completely different and the guys at Capybara Games have done a great job. Starting from the short but touching introductory sequence, which sees the Viking warrior protagonist of the game coming out of his mountain cabin at night to face the dungeons in exchange of a fee that can support her family, and perhaps give her the longed-for vacation, the authors have included many small touches of class capable of characterizing the experience very well. There are obviously no graphical differences between the iOS edition and the one for Nintendo Switch, both run very well and ifnever an uncertainty regardless of the frenzy and spectacularity of the combos made, but on the hybrid console we were able to appreciate the excellent sound much more, characterized by rather spot-on music and nice effects. After that, obviously, there is the controls speech. In addition to the touch screen it is possible to play with the traditional physical commands, of course, but the return maneuvers carried out with the Joy-Con analog sticks are a bit too often approximate, forcing you to use the B button instead to cancel the last ~stage~ and redraw the path of the character.", "date": "2020-12-18", "grade": "8.0"}
