{"name": "Covert Ops 1943", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/covert-ops-1943.html", "text": "The video game market is full of titles set during the Second World War, and in the mobile sector, things are not very different. With Covert Ops 1943, the developers of the Micazook team put us in the shoes of an American soldier on a special mission, who must wander around sixteen huge locations with the aim of eliminating all the Nazis on his way and talking to some key characters. The game is a classic first person shooter, which closely resembles Wolfenstein 3D and finally gives us the opportunity to try our hand at this type of gameplay on our mobile phone, at any time or situation. Our character starts off unarmed, but is capable of knocking out enemies even by throwing simple punches. The discovery of the gun marks a first change in mechanics, as opponents can also be eliminated from a distance and the ammunition factor comes into play: they are certainly not infinite, but we can collect them from every corpse we find on the ground; just as we can recover vials of vital energy that will replenish the health indicator. The graphical interface shows us precisely the level of our energy, the number of shots and the equipment in use. As in the best FPS tradition, the pistol is certainly not the only weapon that we will be able to use: we will also be able to take up rifles, machine guns, bazookas and explosives, scrolling through the equipped weapon with a press of the 3 key. The settings boast a surface rather large, therefore we will often need to check the map: it can be activated by pressing the 0 key, it will show us in transparency the areas already explored and those that we have not yet reached, representing the doors with yellow segments. We will be able to open them by pressing the 1 key, and very often it will be a door that delimits the end of a stage. The enemies we will be able to face range from the simple soldier to the special agent, with clear differences in terms of the damage they are able to inflict as well as the resistance to our attacks. The game control system allows us to approach firefights in the best way, however: the 7 and 9 keys are added to the basic movements, giving us the possibility of evading sideways while always aiming in the same direction. The game does not have a save system, but unlocks the stages as they are completed, so you can start the game from the last area reached. The classic FPS action has been joined by shooter sections ~with viewfinder~, unfortunately really mediocre in execution: we are faced with a scenario in shades of gray, which ~colors~ only when the viewfinder passes. The aim is to eliminate all moving targets, but unfortunately the inertial movement of the viewfinder and the poor graphic detail do not help in this sense, transforming these variations on the theme into something really frustrating and uninspired. From a technical standpoint, Covert Ops 1943 is certainly a spectacular product, capable of handling fairly detailed 3D graphics (even if not ~true~, in all probability) in a very convincing way, with a good frame rate (mobile phone permitting), without save some interesting lighting effects (the sunlight, but also the flash of our weapon when we pull the trigger). The colors are used very well, the textures boast a fair sharpness (they clearly grain a lot when we get close) and even the enemies, characterized by bitmap graphics, appear well drawn. The vertical development of the screen unfortunately creates a bit of a ~nano~ effect, in the sense that our character's hands are far too low compared to the line of sight. Perhaps one could think of running the game horizontally or cutting the screen, which would also have allowed the developers to add more detail or increase the frame rate. The shooter sections ~with viewfinder~ are a real sour note, and their presence in an otherwise impeccable title cannot really be explained: even on a technical level, they are really scarce. The sound consists of a few pieces of music and many sampled effects of moderate quality, the reproduction of which, however, causes slowdowns on some cell phones. Finally, as regards the control system, a really excellent job has been done: the control of the character is immediate and not too cumbersome, despite the fact that you are practically forced to use the numeric keyboard in full instead of the joystick. PRO Technically amazing Great playability Lots of weapons, very big levels Badly adapted to a vertical screen AGAINST Horrendous alternative sections", "date": "2008-01-18", "grade": "S.V."}
