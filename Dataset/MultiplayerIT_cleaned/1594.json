{"name": "EyeToy", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/eyetoy.html", "text": "The technology behind EyeToy actually, as shown in many demos at the past E3 and ECTS, is capable not only of recognizing and interpreting movement, but also colors (perhaps someone will remember the demo of the colored balls that interact with elements three-dimensional). However, the first series of games available, the Play compilation bundled with EyeToy, does not take advantage of this feature but bases the interaction only on movement recognition. On paper it's more than promising, but how does it actually work? Well very well. The technology developed by Sony is solid, the collision management very precise, the response immediate, thanks also to the stable and high frame rate of the images captured by the camera. The accuracy of the motion detection, a bit approximate in the first tech demos, has gradually improved over the years, and the finished product is of the highest level. And waiting for new compatible games, we just have to amuse ourselves with Play, the compilation of twelve minigames included in a bundle with EyeToy The software The only software currently compatible with EyeToy is the Play compilation, made up of twelve different minigames, sold as a bundle with the device. Games in the name of simplicity and immediacy, twelve variations on the theme that exploit the detection of the player's (or players') movements: nothing prevents two from getting in front of the camera... ). No depth pretensions and nothing aimed at hardcore gamers: the twelve games included in Play offer immediate fun, often brought about more by the novelty and atypical 'control system' than by the actual gameplay. The twelve minigames included in Play are: Kung Foo The ideal game for aspiring Bruce Lee: you have to hit ninjas who attack us from every direction and break the classic wooden tablets to score more points. Slap Stream More or less see above, just need more timing and glance. Ghost Catcher Again, see above. This time the opponents are ghosts and bats. Boxing Chump Another variation on the fighting game theme: this time the opponent is a boxer. Wishi Washi How fun is it cleaning the windows?!? The soundtrack is not to be missed, while moving from one floor of the house to another avoiding sponges soaked in detergent. Keep Ups The longer you dribble the more points you score. Hitting the unwary characters leaning out of the windows increases the score, but watch out for the grumpy old man ready to puncture the ball... UFO Juggler Move your hands with the right amount of time to rotate the UFOs and make them take off. Plate Spinner Same principle as UFO Juggler, with plates instead of UFOs and monkeys to chase away. Mirror Time You have to pop the 'good' bubbles and avoid the 'bad' ones. Watch out for the screen movements Beat Freak and Boogie Down Two different interpretations of the classic rhytm games. Rocket Rumble Missiles to explode with the right timing to get higher and higher scores. As already mentioned, nothing particularly deep and complex and, once the initial novelty has passed, the twelve minigames get boring quite quickly if played alone. However, the music changes if you manage to gather a few people: Play is the classic party-game to be brought out during a party, especially when the alcohol content starts to rise. It is undoubtedly an eye-catcher and thanks to the very simple mechanics, anyone can play immediately. Perhaps there is still a step below the timeless Samba de Amigo in terms of party appeal, thanks to the massive Latin American soundtrack of the Sega title, but we are still at very high levels of involvement. Conclusion EyeToy is an extremely promising technology undoubtedly capable, if well used, of bringing new gameplay elements to games specifically designed to exploit it. Certainly the Play compilation is little more than an appetizer, little more than an elaborate tech demo able to entertain just for a few hours, especially in company, and to show the potential of the product. Now all that remains is to see if EyeToy will actually catch on and wait for the first games of a certain thickness that will take full advantage of the technology (it is already rumored that something is moving in Japan on the development front). The rather low price of the peripheral (EyeToy and Play are available in bundles at 59 Euros in shops), could favor its diffusion. Now we need a killer application. In the meantime, hats off to Sony and its London division for the idea and for the realization, and a good eight on trust. Pros: Innovative and promising technology Great application possibilities Cons: Limited software Fun compilation playbut shallow There are at least a couple of things that don't add up on the EyeToy. At first sight this bizarre peripheral appears to be a first-class Japanese device, and instead it is an all-European invention, straight out of the London studios of SCE. And then for that use of a new technology applied to the (video) game it looks like the classic Nintendo add-on, and instead it is an all-Sony product. The history of EyeToy starts from afar, so much so that a very first demo of the technology, accompanied by some rudimentary software, was even presented at the ECTS three years ago. From fair to fair, we have gone from the simple technical demo to real games, and then to the finished product, which you can already find on store shelves: from an all-European project, EyeToy was dutifully marketed first in the old continent . And what the heck, we must have some primacy too Hardware and technology Yes, but what is EyeToy? Summarizing to the bone, it is nothing more than a USB camera, produced by Logitech, with an elegant design that recalls that of the PlayStation 2. Equipped with discreet optics, the camera offers a more than satisfactory video resolution even in non-light conditions. optimal and a good frame rate. In itself nothing technologically monstrous, but what makes the difference is the astounding software developed by SCEE, able not only to view the images taken by the camera but to interpret the movements that the player makes on the screen, making him actually interact directly with the game environment and making the use of a joypad completely useless in games designed for EyeToy. The player thus becomes the only real control interface, opening up new and interesting gameplay perspectives and making the video game, at least in Sony's stated intentions, even more mainstream, bringing even those who have always been allergic to the pad closer. Everything, from the menus to the actual game, is controlled through the gestures of the player, who physically 'touches' the buttons on the screen to select the various game options and interacts with the three-dimensional objects. Via the joypad then, which may not even be connected to the console: the only physical command on the camera is the manual focus, while to stop the game just put a hand in front of the lens in order to obscure the image .", "date": "2003-07-10", "grade": null}
