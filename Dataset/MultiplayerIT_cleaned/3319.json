{"name": "Mini Motorways", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mini-motorways-la-recensione.html", "text": "There are now several proposals for city builders and urban management on mobile platforms, but if you are looking for an intermediate solution between structural complexity and ease of use, you might be interested in this review of Mini Motorways. Mobile devices have always been faced with a sort of paradox: they are naturally favored in hosting game genres that rely on the use of a pointer, but the greatest difficulty so far has been finding a happy medium between the typical mechanics of the genres more complex and the tactile interface, as well as between the classic use of the title on PC and that on the move, which is often based on very different times, rhythms and concentration possibilities. For this reason, we often find ourselves faced with simplified versions of well-known titles, but the games that work best are usually those designed starting from different approaches, as we have seen with the excellent Pocket City and as in this Mini Motorways, which faced with some defects in use, it presents itself as a title structured around use on mobile platforms, despite its availability also on PC. It starts from a fundamental principle: choose a specific element to manage and build the entire game around that single element. This isn't a question of controlling an entire city in all its different elements, which could become dispersive in a title that aims at a more immediate and compact experience, but we find ourselves dealing exclusively with the construction of roads and the vehicular traffic management. We are also far from a realistic simulation, even if the game obviously relies on some logical and real elements to build its rules. The aim is to connect houses to points of interest with roads, so that cars can go from point A to point B of the same color and back. As the number of houses, the places to reach and the colors in which they diversify increase, obviously the complexity of managing the road network also increases, which will have to respond to simplification logics to avoid traffic congestion but also to follow the imposed needs from the space available. Between puzzle game and city builder It therefore turns out that Mini Motorways is a bit at the crossroads between a city builder and a puzzle game: beyond the relative simplicity given by the fact of having to deal exclusively with roads and traffic, the difficulty of cataloging this game fully within the genre to which SimCity belongs also derives from other factors, which bring it closer to a real puzzle. The constant challenge is given by the fact that its elements emerge randomly and imposed by the game, therefore they do not derive from a planning totally in the player's hands. Once the map has been chosen (which can be free or replicate a real place in a somewhat geometric and stylized way), the buildings appear autonomously and in positions that are completely beyond the player's will and here too lies the difficulty of the game: it is difficult planning a road network in the long term when there is the constant risk that new buildings spring up like mushrooms to be connected to each other in areas that have become impossible to reach and then we are often forced to cancel what has been done and change the traffic on the fly. In short, the degree of randomness is decisive, and the construction of the roads becomes more the solution of an imposed puzzle than a free planning by the player. Once this is clarified, we are able to appreciate Mini Motorways even more if seen more like a puzzle, because it is clear that any precise design intent is knocked down by the contingent needs that constantly emerge. However, this does not mean that there are not different problem solving possibilities, personal approaches and a certain depth in the various choices available for road construction. The game provides bridges, traffic lights, highways in assorted variants to make the road network more complex and you can still indulge yourself in various choices in the configuration of our city, with new pieces that are provided to us every time a week passes in the scan thunderstorm in game. The important thing is that you always keep in mind the need to ensure that the houses of a certain color are put into communication with the buildings of the same color within a certain time limit and that the distribution of traffic is balanced, under penalty of of the match. The final score is assigned based on the amount of days in which we managed to keep the traffic in the city active, so it is a real endurance race with difficulgrowing culture. Mini Motorways has a constantly growing pace and inexorably reaches a level where it becomes somewhat anxiety-provoking, which goes in quite direct contrast with the classic principles of the city builder, therefore also for this reason it is good to understand what we are dealing with in order to do not run into unpleasant surprises. A technical problem detected in the game, which can increase the sense of disorientation that can emerge in certain cases, is given by the shots used: they are essentially two, with a further one that serves to have an overview but does not allow to build the short-distance roads and a close one which is instead the one normally used for construction. Well, the problem is that one is actually too far away and the other too close, which means constantly jumping from one zoom level to another which can get really annoying.", "date": "2019-12-14", "grade": "8.2"}
