We are talking about one of the most problematic launches in memory: a departure characterized by queues of thousands of people even for paying users and more than ten hours of waiting for non-paying ones. Trion did not expect such a success but the biggest problem is that the publisher has shown himself unprepared to fix things quickly, creating major organization problems for the guilds and forcing several players to abandon their character to start all over elsewhere. In short, an experience to forget, which seems to finally be overcome with the introduction of new servers and the expansion of those present at the debut. ArcheAge has good potential and boasts great ideas smothered in a pay-to-win setting A world of possibilities ArcheAge is a free to play MMO that allows us to play a character chosen from four races. Two of these, the Nuian and the Elf, live on the continent of Nuia while the other two available races, the Firran and the Harani, live across a great sea on the continent of Haranya. But it's not just the waters that separate the two populations. A long war has led to a bitter conflict between the two factions, a confrontation without quarter fueled by important cultural differences. The people of Nuia live in harmony with nature while the inhabitants of Haranya use to bend it to their needs. In essence, we are faced with a classic fantasy context that certainly does not stand out for its originality but can count on a rich background narrated in a series of novels written by the author of Jeon Min-hee in parallel with the development of the title. Nevertheless, it is certainly not the story that represents the fulcrum of the experience. ArcheAge has attracted the attention of the gaming world thanks to the ability to incorporate a large number of the features that have made the fortune of the major representatives of this genre by putting together a rich experience characterized by decidedly interesting elements. The growth of the character passes through the classic series of quests, some of which serve as a tutorial while others introduce the game world. This is not a particularly exciting phase of the game, given the repetitiveness and lack of originality of most of the missions, but during the initial path we are illustrated with important elements such as the commercial quests and the rich crafting system that includes cultivation, alchemy and housing. ArcheAge offers something like twenty-one professions, including fishing, which require a huge variety of materials and produce a large number of goods many of which, unlike in other MMOs, are useful for dressing characters. The tutorial, in essence, gives us a taste of the complexity of the game world and also allows us to become familiar with the hero customization system which is based on the possibility of freely mixing a huge number of skill trees. They range from the thief, magician, bard to the summoner, warrior, archer for a total of 120 possible classes. Not all, this is inevitable, are equally balanced but the effective combinations are really many with glaring examples such as the wizard/thief who uses his agility to keep his distance from the enemy or the wizard/warrior who uses stealth and great leaps to dive into the melee. The targeting system is automatic and does not bring any significant innovations but the large number of specializations, which can be selected by resetting the character from the appropriate NPC, guarantees extreme variety and great possibilities for experimentation. Evolving PvP After the initial phase we find ourselves catapulted into a world of possibilities that include research and exploitation of mines, fishing, trade, agriculture and piracy. Many of these activities, by the way, can be carried out at sea and it is no coincidence that many players have taken to the waves which are beautifully made and are enhanced by a wide choice of realistic and well modeled vessels. The navigation is not simulated in detail and is still disturbed by numerous glitches but the behavior of the boats is believable enough to make exploration as exciting as maritime combat. Once you have obtained 50 Guild Stars, a currency that is earned by completing specific missions, it is already possible to buy the catamaran and immediately start group raids, defense of the weakest or trade quests that bestow higher rewards if the destination is far away and the journey is perilous. In some areas, in fact, the law does not exist and it is possible to attack another player without suffering consequences of any kind. And this opportunity is made attractive proprio from commercial quests that see players loading large quantities of goods on their backs that slow them down and make them identifiable by brigands as if they were beacons in the night. For this reason, while the shorter and safer trade runs can also be completed using public transport or powered mounts, the more adventurous ones are usually tackled in groups aboard rapid private boats which increase the possibility of arriving at their destination unharmed. The result is a decidedly exciting open world PvP where defeat not only forces you to respawn at the nearest temple but involves a loss of time and sometimes quite precious goods. In addition, gigantic sea monsters are inserted in all this and the naval cannons make the sea combats even more exciting. There is no shortage, this is obvious even if it is not the core of an experience very different from a World of Warcraft, arenas and classic battles, fought in the dry. But the latter will find a complete sense only when the gates of Auroria are opened, the neutral continent where the guilds will conquer the territories making housing a real adventure for pioneers. For now, many build only in safe areas that do not involve risks while neutral areas are not very popular, not offering intriguing incentives such as a new world to colonize all dedicated to levels 50. Auroria, in fact, will allow you to collect special materials and will allow a guild to establish their own domain. The castle in the center of the domain can be besieged at the end of a timer and in case of defeat all the buildings in the area of influence will be attackable by enemies who will take possession of the territory. In all of this, the guilds will obtain special talents and collect the taxes of those who build under the protection of the castle, making a strategic PvP system that has been quite successful in the Korean version of ArcheAge quite attractive. The shadow of pay-to-win ArcheAge is a pleasant MMO to look at, decidedly rich and not without goodies like the legal system. Crimes, in fact, have consequences ranging from the possibility of being attacked even in safe areas up to real trials whose jury is made up of players. Furthermore, a murder leaves traces that can be identified and reported, giving further credibility to the context. Not bad for a title that, while not revolutionizing the genre, manages to offer an often exciting experience. But not everything, unfortunately, is perfect. The questing phase is the most trivial and boring imaginable, the elite quests demand a higher level mentor and in general the PvE dimension is certainly not a relevant component of the experience. Furthermore, the differences between paying and non-paying users are quite significant and we are not only talking about the bonus to the features reserved for those who have purchased a starter pack. One of the elements of greatest concern is the taxes required to maintain the buildings. Failure to pay leads to the loss of the land parcel which may be occupied by another player. This system prevents the game world from filling up with abandoned houses but allows farmers and guilds to colonize large areas by cutting out solitary players and small groups whose experience is already mortified by the not-so-exciting quest system. But the biggest concern is the crafting system which is based on Labor Points, a resource that recharges over time. The problem is not with the dynamic itself, which is interesting forcing players to carefully plan their activities and makes the possibility of using other players as a workforce important. But Labor Points recharge much more slowly for users without Patron status who are therefore at a huge disadvantage. Furthermore, as if that weren't enough, the possibility of selling items at auction is reserved for players with the Patron status which can be obtained immediately by paying (or in the game but it takes some time to get there) and guarantees a bonus not to be little. Luckily Trion has promised to make the experience less unfair and we obviously hope that those of the publisher are not just words. Meanwhile, waiting for the arrival of Auroria and trusting that the next patches improve the experience for everyone, we can't deny that ArcheAge still manages to surprise thanks to the huge number of contents. The crafting is huge and the trade runs work very well, enticing us to cross a world full of mounts and pets to raise, gliders and steampunk vehicles, boats madeand beautifully and big bosses that go around the world. Finally, the inferface is excellent and fully customizable with markers to distinguish each party member and options that allow you to calibrate the control of the character in every detail. Finally, everything is seasoned with a remarkable graphic design. The maritime one is undoubtedly the most successful setting but the entire visual sector defends itself well thanks to suggestive panoramas, convincing and extremely customizable models, caravans that travel the roads, huge airships that furrow the sky and a large number of non-player characters.", "date": "2014-10-08", "grade": "8.0"}
