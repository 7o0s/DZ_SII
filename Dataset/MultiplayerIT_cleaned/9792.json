This year the puzzle game created by Alexey Pajitnov wanted to try again with a double release on Nintendo consoles, offering fans a rather particular variant. Starting from the basis of the WiiWare game of the same name, Tetris Party Deluxe on paper would have heavily expanded the multiplayer mode and the integration with Wi-Fi Connection, differentiating itself from Tetris DS and becoming a real party game. Immediately after having explored the fluctuating version for Wii we decided to test the portable version as well, in order to verify if a worthy successor to Tetris DS has actually arrived on the shelves. A somewhat listless return On Nintendo's portable console, Tetris Party Deluxe attempts to squeeze the same game modes and options seen on the Wii version onto two small screens. Even the Miis have been replaced by some avatars from which it is possible to choose and which, in a similar way to the home counterpart, will change their expression in case of victory or defeat. There are several modes available and almost all of them playable in both single and multiplayer: in addition to the traditional Marathon, up to eight friends can challenge each other locally in the fun Climbing option, in which you build a stairway to allow a small character to reach the top of the level; there is also the more frenetic Bombliss mode, where the aim is to detonate a bomb in the level, or the one entitled Corridore, in which to guide a tetromino along a path full of curves and obstacles to be overcome by continuously rotating it. The result is obviously an extremely rich and original multiplayer experience, much more varied than that seen in Tetris DS. However, just like the Wii version, Tetris Party Deluxe slips sensationally once connected to the Wi-Fi Connection: although the game options are so numerous and fun, online it is only possible to challenge each other in the traditional way or in the Duel Space mode. As if that weren't enough, the two versions of the game share the same lack of care and poverty in the presentation: both the backdrops and the music can be changed before each match, but many of these are too anonymous, and the impossibility of randomly generating them will lead many to always leave the same background and the same song. There is also an option for beginners which surrounds the classic tutorial and which allows you to play with huge tetrominoes and with simpler shapes. To more experienced users it might even seem like an insult, but it is certainly a welcome addition for the little ones. As for the avatars, although there are fifteen of them and there are some welcome cameos, they cannot be created from scratch: the player can always choose from those available, but it seems that the developers have lost the habit of inserting simple but effective ones icon editor arrived with the first games compatible with Wi-Fi Connection. Let me be clear, the title remains very entertaining and the feeling of playing a real Tetris is palpable; but the developers seem to have lacked the awareness that, for many players, the return of the franchise on portable consoles is always a small event, therefore worthy of due attention.", "date": "2010-09-23", "grade": "7.5"}
