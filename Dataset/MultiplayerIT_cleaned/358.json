{"name": "GTR 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gtr-2-recensione.html", "text": "such competitions offer priceless satisfaction Sound Excellent work also with regard to the audio sector: this time the developers have tried to strongly diversify the noises of each car, in order to make them even more recognizable. The result is excellent, with the roar of the engines dominating. Environmental effects such as skids, accidents, crowds, are all in place and perform their task very well. Note of merit as always to the exceptional accompanying music: although in games like this it is a must to deactivate the soundtrack, if desired, it can still be kept in-game. Even the audio aspect deserves praise for the care with which it was made. The damage model As hardcore gamers know, the car damage issue is about the licenses offered by automakers regarding the safety of their cars. It is not allowed to have cars that overturn or totally disintegrate: not too high aesthetic damages are allowed according to the ~tolerance~ of the requested manufacturer. GTR 2 certainly sees some steps forward compared to the first or GT Legends: pieces that detach from the cars and remain on the road, cars that lift off the ground; but the dents and damaged parts are still quite behind as a visual accomplishment. In this respect Toca 2 is still superior. Let's hope that the future Race, Simbin's next effort, can set a new standard on this age-old issue, the only true shadow of a top series. Mid generation... As already announced in the preview phase, GTR 2 is based on an evolution of the GT Legends graphics engine. Visually, therefore, we find exceptional cars, reproduced down to the smallest detail even in the interiors. And this time they prove to be much more ~solid~ in terms of presence on the track, vaguely recalling the feeling of ~heaviness~ of a Gran Turismo. The already fantastic cockpit visuals of the previous two games gain an edge here, demonstrating the particular care placed by Simbin in the pursuit of extreme fidelity. A sure example is the possibility of even moving the seat forwards / backwards to adjust the view. Oddly enough, all this research into details on cars collides with some false notes in the surrounding environment: some tracks are still rather bare, and the surrounding objects are in some cases a bit too angular (although improvements have been made in this sense compared to the past). Certain environments, in particular the paths surrounded by trees, have an old-gen game aspect as does the rain, visually very banal in its representation of falling. Conversely, the reflections and wet splashes of the wheels are very realistic, almost giving the idea of being really overwhelmed by a downpour! Beautiful as always the transition from day to night, with the sky gradually fading. Too bad there isn't a real HDR effect, which in case of sun makes objects blurry for a moment (those who have seen Project Gotham 3 can see the video rendering of this filter), but only a partial clarification in front of sources of light. Last negative note the usual cardboard cutouts audience, while some characters such as mechanics and race judges are made in a rather crude 3D. Overall GTR 2 is visually pleasing, but not up to par with the latest next-generation titles. [C] Great cockpits! I repeat! [/C] Sunday driver... Finally, the sequel to the acclaimed GTR arrives on our screens, a milestone in the field of hard and pure simulations, the kind that hardcore gamers cannot fail to appreciate! For those unfamiliar with it, the title reproduces the FIA GT championships, where racing cars of over 500 horsepower race, which however can also be purchased by those with a lot of money. Indeed, in competitions we find the most expensive sports cars, from Ferraris to Lamborghinis, passing through niche cars or heavily modified sedans. Among the main novelties of this sequel, we find the driving school and a massive help support even for the uninitiated of the series. In the first you will have to face over 130 tests (!) along the lines of the Gran Turismo licenses, in which all the possible maneuvers to be carried out in the race will be explained. Driving aids have significantly increased, even with the presence of colored stripes for the ideal trajectory. all production is based on obsessive attention to detail Sunday driver... It can even be said that even ~almost~ arcade lovers can try their hand at this title using all the aids but it would be a sacrilege because the simulation realism that only GTR 2 can offer would be lost. In any case, the goal of offering thenewbies a not too frustrating game has been hit! For the fanatics of the saga it must be said that the title has many points in common with the first GTR but the innovations in the field make it much more substantial than a simple update. New cars and tracks, improved graphics and sky-high driving fidelity make this sequel the new benchmark for all future simulations. The shadow of the collision system still remains, improved not as expected Options, options and more options! All the production is based on obsessive attention to detail: every single aspect of the races has been taken into consideration, including the well-tested weather conditions. In fact, one of the strengths of GTR 2 is the advanced time management engine which, in addition to allowing the gradual transition between day and night, allows for variable weather conditions, with races starting in the sun and then ending in a downpour very dangerous! It is possible to face tests, warm-ups, classifications and anything else as in reality, or participate in the ~Sunday races~, the classic fast races in which you can immediately jump onto the track. Once again we find dozens of mechanical parameters to improve the set-up of the cars, with the possibility of also deciding the pit stop strategies and the full tanks. The Motec is also back, the telemetry system that measures every single value of our racing car (and which requires an engineer to be fully appreciated!). In this aspect GTR 2 shows the mammoth work of the programmers to offer the most complete existing simulator: there is really a lot of irons in the fire and enthusiasts will have plenty to enjoy. A quality steering wheel is absolutely necessary to make the most of so much effort; furthermore, not even the really effective Force Feedback was left to chance. The AI is also superb, with the opposing cars more or less aggressive depending on the level of difficulty: in addition to launching into reckless maneuvers to gain positions, you will not rarely see them make mistakes that will even take them out of the race! Truly a quantum leap that brings the human-CPU threshold much closer! Final comment GTR 2 proves to be the new benchmark for the competition: an enormous amount of work to offer a pure simulator, which after several hours of apprenticeship, offers priceless sensations. Lots of irons in the fire, lots of involvement, make it a must-have for hardcore gamers, a niche of people to whom the game is expressly dedicated. The effort made by Simbin to make it usable even for casual players, who however may feel lost in the face of so many game possibilities, is remarkable. The multiplayer is absolutely fantastic, which in challenges with 28 participants is something never seen before! Too bad only for the damage model, still quite behind the competition. Surely the next chapter will compensate for this one blemish for a series that has evolved better and better, and that in the future will surely give more surprises! Pros The real driving simulator Obsessive attention to detail Excellent multiplayer Cons Not quite next-gen graphics Damage model still crude Totally appreciable only by hardcore gamers Rolling Start! Well gentlemen, online and network challenges up to 28 players! Sure, you need a very broadband connection and reliable servers but, if everything goes smoothly, the immersiveness of the competitions is absolutely abnormal! Races like this offer priceless satisfactions, with which the CPU (despite the excellent AI) cannot compare. Against human opponents you will really see everything, also thanks to the difficulty of the game and the fate of a race can change at any time! We can't fail to praise again the obsessive care of SimBin, which also in this respect allows you to change every single game parameter: from the graphics to the weather conditions, it is possible to plan anything for the creation of always different races!", "date": "2006-09-29", "grade": null}
