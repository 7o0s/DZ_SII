Band Brothers, music game appeared in the Rising Sun at the dawn of the history of the DS and then revived with the suffix DX (and a major box office success) a couple of years later. And maybe he will also know that Nintendo of Europe proposed it with great enthusiasm as one of the titles of the European launch, only to then silently hide it under the carpet with great discouragement of those who had already thought of making it theirs. Well, you'll be happy to learn that, after only five years, we have the European version of Band Brothers, precisely entitled Jam with the Band. And one, and two... You are pleasantly surprised by the amount of things that the game allows you to do: you can play a really large number of instruments, divided by type, from percussion to stringed instruments, from wind instruments to various electronic instruments (including NES), you can sing thanks to the DS microphone, you can compose a song from scratch to be submitted to Nintendo for publication, and you can download up to a maximum of 50 songs among those made available by users and by Nintendo itself; however, keep in mind that, once a song has been downloaded, it is no longer possible to delete it. Doing some math, we have 50 songs on the cartridge among various international pop and rock hits, soundtracks from Nintendo films and video games and historic classic compositions, 50 to download and up to 100 slots for songs to compose, for a total of 200 songs, which ensures a certain longevity. For many, playing will be the soul of the game: apart from the various guitars and pianos, which can be played via the touch screen that reproduces the instrument, everything else is done with the buttons, and if at the easiest level of the four available you have to take into account only the rhythm, already at the second things start to get complicated, with four buttons to manage. On the third we use all the front buttons and on the fourth, in addition, also L and R to change the tone: Jam with the Band is in short a difficult game in its ~Career~ mode, here called ~Concert of the Day~, which offers you objectives and judge your performance, less intuitive and more ~game~ than any Guitar Hero precisely because playing with the buttons is certainly less immediate and natural. It's a question of training, of course, but someone could lose patience already at the second difficulty level: persevering, however, as in all difficult games, the satisfaction of reaching heights of Paganini virtuosity will be high. Singing, on the other hand, is a completely different story: here the program seems much more permissive, as demonstrated by an analysis of the voice, which should theoretically tell you which style is more appropriate for your timbre, not exactly punctual. Anyone who can't stand the too narrow limits of playing and the too wide ones of singing can however quietly give themselves up in the Music BB mode to improvisation, to the freedom to choose in which piece, and possibly which part of the piece, and with which instrument to try their hand at the level of difficulty he prefers; or multiplayer, for up to eight players with or without as many cards, in which Jam with the Band finds its true gaming essence, truly transmitting the feeling of being part of a band - even if it is made up of only ~DS players ~ - with all the fun or, depending on the spirit in which the session is approached, the seriousness that this sensation involves and implies. There is also the possibility for Wii owners to download a special channel thanks to which they can listen to their multiplayer performances on the TV instead of through the small DS speakers. Lennon/McCartney/Mr. Rossi However, what, in our humble opinion, clearly distinguishes the present title from the various Guitar Hero, Elite Beat Agents and Rhythm Paradise, probably all preferable to Jam with the Band as ~pure~ Music Game, is all the customization component that rotates around the possibility of composing your own songs. Once in ~Studio~ you can choose whether to approach the composition from an amateur point of view or as an expert, and if in the first case it will be enough to choose a backing track and hum the melody over it (with questionable results given the aforementioned imprecision of the vocal recognition ) or strum a virtual keyboard, as an expert you will see your game transform into a real software for composing songs in MIDI. In fact, you have to try your hand at writing a real score, each with the peculiarities of the chosen instrument (up to a maximum of eight for each piece), complete with subtleties such as the choice ofkey, tempo and volume change, and so on. A real little paradise for budding musicians, as demonstrated, a few days after its release, by the dozens of songs already made available by users, some of which are maniacally precise and devilishly difficult. It will be so pleasant for a certain type of player to compose their own pieces and listen to those of their colleagues, that they regret the limits imposed by the space available on the card: to remedy even a little to this Nintendo has seen fit to at least allow you to listen songs online, also through a nice radio broadcast that broadcasts the ten most downloaded songs. Little to say remains on the graphics, pleasant and nice at the right point, if it weren't for the strange presence of Barbara the Bat, the owner of the place where you perform and work, who is strangely, for a Nintendo game, perturbing and sexy and could quietly haunting the dreams of all those users in age, let's say, particular...", "date": "2010-05-31", "grade": "8.3"}
