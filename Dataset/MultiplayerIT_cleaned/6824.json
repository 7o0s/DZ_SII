{"name": "Skylanders Trap Team", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/139368-skylanders-trap-team-il-tablet-in-trappola.html", "text": "We recently talked about the fourth chapter of the Skylanders series in its classic home console version, appreciating its qualities to the point of defining it as the best episode produced so far. However, Trap Team is not only a ~simple~ new version of the highly successful Activision franchise, but coincides with a real turning point in the development of the brand and in the attempt to involve an ever wider audience. All this starting from the sacrosanct and incontrovertible awareness that for many people, the so-called ~casual~ audience, the video game is synonymous with smartphones and tablets, since it is precisely through these tools that they use them. Beyond the nostalgic speeches of the irreproachable users unable to accept the dignity as play platforms of the devices in question, the numbers show that touch screen video games are by now a reality not only consolidated, but towards which many developers have already moved or at least they are watching with increasing interest. If Skylanders is therefore a product (above all) for kids, and if these kids were born and raised with a tablet in hand even more than with a joypad, and if maybe there isn't even a console in their homes, what solution can be found ? Skylanders Trap Team on tablet is a real little revolution for the mobile gaming market Activision has therefore decided to bring Skylanders Trap Team to tablets as well. You will say nothing new, on the other hand the App Store and Google Play are full of companion apps and reduced versions made above all to stimulate the purchase of the ~real~ game or to offer accessory functions. In this case, however, things are different, because Skylanders Trap Team on tablets is exactly the same game intended for home consoles. Identical content, levels and characters, all the same. A miracle? No, rather an awareness of the capabilities - even technical ones - that have reached this type of device. Obviously all this has a price, or rather a limit: the game is in fact compatible with a rather small circle of tablets, all recent. We therefore speak of Apple iPad from the third generation, iPad Air or iPad Mini 2, Amazon Fire HD 6, HD 7 and HDX 8.9, Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014), Note Pro 12.2, Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4, 10.1 and 12.2, Galaxy Tab S 8.4 and 10.5, Google Nexus 7 (2013) and Nvidia Shield. A rather limited list, probably destined to grow with the release of new devices and game updates, but which still gives an idea of the technical requirements required. To be able to play it, you must first download the game from the store on your tablet: the app is free, and requires at least 3 GB of free space, which becomes 6 in the full and optimized version. Very important dimensions, but proportionate to the contents. At this point you can try a taste of the product, in the form of what is to all intents and purposes a short demo including the first chapter, two characters and two traps in digital form; obviously in this case it is necessary to accept the idea of using the virtual controls. Wanting to ~be satisfied~, you can unlock the entire game through three level packs costing 14 each. The second solution is instead the decidedly more interesting one, and passes through the purchase of a special Starter Pack containing a portal, a controller, two Skylanders and two ~real~ traps: it is a ~unique~ version, compatible with all device listed above, since it simply uses the connection via the Bluetooth 4.0 standard. And by buying the Starter Pack you obviously get access to the full game, without having to go through any in-app purchases. Both accessories are powered by mini stylus batteries (3 for the portal, 2 for the controller), so as to ensure maximum portability, and connection with the tablet is immediate. The portal is excellent, robust and made in an intelligent way: with this adjective we intend to underline the commitment made by Activision even in so-called ~marginal~ aspects, a further sign of the importance of this version in the plans of the American giant. For example, the lower part of the portal conceals a housing for the controller, so that it can be stored allowing both peripherals to be easily transported together. There is also a groove on the edge, able to keep the tablet upright in an optimal position for viewing; however, the integrated speaker present in the home console version was excluded. Needless to say, all the statuettes on sale in shops are perfectly compatible and usable, including those of the previous episodes. As for the controller instead, the definition morecorrect is ~functional~: despite being built with somewhat light plastics and despite the non-extraordinary response of buttons and sticks, it proves to be more than satisfactory within the gameplay of a game like Skylanders, obviously making the experience much more rewarding than touch controls. However, those who were considering the hypothesis of using this controller also in the other games installed on their device will have to put their hearts at rest, since the operation is allowed only and exclusively within Trap Team. Therefore, having concluded the extensive analysis of the peripherals accompanying this tablet version, let's move on to the technical component: our test carried out on an iPad Mini Retina returned a high quality product, undoubtedly far superior to the standards of mobile gaming. In an absolute sense we are roughly around the old gen console versions in terms of image cleanliness, texture quality and frame rate, but with the advantage of higher resolution and pixel density: therefore an extraordinary result, unthinkable just a few years ago. and which lays the foundations for further development of the sector. Finally, a note on the sale price, about ten euros higher than the Starter Pack for consoles. Considering the hardware included in the box, this seems like a fair figure to us. We have chosen to focus this article on the specific features of this tablet version of Skylanders Trap Team, avoiding the description of the contents because, as already mentioned, they are identical to the console edition already reviewed and to which we refer you for further information.", "date": "2014-10-21", "grade": "8.5"}
