Ice Age 2 is a platformer starring Scrat, a squirrel whose adventures, despite being in the background, often ended up stealing the show from the protagonists of the film; if you have seen the feature film - and if you have not done so, we advise you to remedy it - you cannot fail to remember the misadventures of this character, constantly in search of his acorn which, in one way or another, always ends up escaping him. The tutorial is quite long, but you will immediately notice two positive things: the first is that the foundations on which the game was built are solid, the second that the features of the Wii have not been implemented with approximation. When the structure of a platform is praised, its engine is implicitly praised, which is essential for making a fun platform game: Scrat follows the undulations of the terrain well and in general interacts with most of the elements that surround it, a characteristic that consequently increases freedom of action. The controls themselves are simple and intuitive, but above all precise and reactive enough. Ice Age therefore opens the door to the player in a polite and welcoming way, making him sit in the house without pushing. Targets The only real criticism that can be made of the control system lies in the impossibility of changing the shot, although it tends to accurately follow Scrat's movements; in a platform, however, even a minimal inaccuracy can affect the gaming experience, and in some moments the Ice Age would have needed a maneuverable camera. Since this is a porting, of course, the peculiar features of the Wii could not be expected to be exploited in depth, but fortunately they were not even forced into the game mechanics. With due proportions, Vivendi's approach was similar to that adopted by Nintendo with Twilight Princess: the parts that would have been more engaging and precise with the Wiimote were entrusted to him, the others remained as they were. The general feeling is very positive, and the remote control does nothing but make the experience of the title more pleasant and engaging. What prevents Ice Age from becoming a game to remember is its very physiognomy, i.e. doing what it was designed to do without aiming for anything else. This platformer has clearly been limited by the childish target it is aimed at, and for which, as you may have understood, it is almost perfect. The tutorial is slightly longer than those we are used to, it lasts approximately three quarters of an hour, but above all it is difficult to define as such, despite having all the characteristics: this is because the Ice Age, provided that one has a minimum of experience with games like this, it is completed in about five hours. Not only is it short-lived, but it is also extremely forgiving: falling into the void takes little energy from Scrat, the enemies don't pose a real danger (both because they inflict minor damage and because of the poor AI), the puzzles and objectives inside the individual zones are short, simple and fairly obvious. This isn't to say that the game isn't fun, because it is, or that it isn't done well, because it is, but simply that by its very nature it couldn't have been what it was anymore. Graphics and Extras Technically the game is the same as the one for the old generation consoles, so don't expect any improvements compared to the Play Station 2 and GameCube versions, except for the full support of the 16:9 mode. Despite this, the graphics are very pleasant, a commendable job has been done: the animations are many, valid and fluid, the polygonal modeling is accurate and the frame rate constant. All this shouldn't come as a surprise, both because about half the team took care of this aspect, and because many of the buyers will have the primary desire to see the characters they admired in the cinema on screen. The sound naturally takes up some of the melodies also present in the feature film, and although it cannot count on the same quality of the aesthetics, it does its job very well; the reverse dubbing was crudely done, with characters too often speaking with their mouths closed. Comment Ice Age is a platform built by a good craftsman, who, however, had been commissioned from the outset a work with very specific boundaries: the engine and the controls would have been able to support a title of a very different caliber, but the infantile target to which the game is addressed prevents him from rising as he could have. Some chats needed to be perfected, like the chamber, but what actually keeps Ice Age grounded is its brevity and simplicity: out of necessity, not out of incapacity, but short and simple it remains. A nice gift for novice players, a wonderful gift for first-time fans of the film ... the others better orient themselves on different productions. Pros Precise control system Excellent engine Well-kept animations ... Cons ... but technically it is the same as the GC It lasts very little Extremely simple Tie-ins and good games are two almost antithetical concepts these days, but that wasn't always the case. At the time of the NES and the Master System, for example, many valid titles were made using a license, which over time has become increasingly rare: among the latest striking cases we cannot fail to mention Goldeneye for Nintendo 64, dated 1997, which, however, was already then a pearl submerged by a sea of anonymous tie-ins (at best). From then on, the situation deteriorated further, and unfortunately right now the load of prejudices that a licensed game carries with it is very heavy: even those few titles that could entertain often end up being downgraded and ignored by the most savvy players .", "date": "2007-04-16", "grade": null}
