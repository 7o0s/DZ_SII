The aforementioned miniature toys had new and pulsating lifeblood - unfortunately it definitively ran out in 2006 - with the videogame transposition by Codemasters, capable not only of capturing the very essence of the lucky toy cars, perhaps favoring collecting, but also of producing a one of the funniest atypical racing games ever, especially if played in company. Although other developers have tried to clone the same recipe of the British software house, created for the first time back in 1991, practically no one has managed to replicate its success and charisma. A speech completely similar to what happened with the Mario Kart series; although there are worthy competitors such as the fascinating Diddy Kong Racing and LittleBigPlanet Karting, or the recent and very good Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed, none of them has managed to oust the Nintendo best seller from the hearts of fans. Well, if you are among those who have spent hours and hours of very healthy fun in the company of friends - strictly locally - with one of the many versions of Micro Machines, released for practically every system, from Super Nintendo to PlayStation 2, Codemasters has decided to give you a gift (so to speak): quietly landed on Steam in recent days at around 15 Euros, Toybox Turbos is in fact the only true worthy heir to the hilarious racing series, of which it completely translates the spirit and the incredible addictive power. Toybox Turbos takes us back to childhood with a solid and fun racing experience Size doesn't matter It's true, the official license has disappeared and we don't know the reasons - let's assume the will to keep costs low, also considering the budget price - nevertheless Toybox Turbos is in all respects a ~new~ chapter of the famous saga, simply an orphan of the relative registered trademark, although somehow it echoes in the logo that mimics the original. The game, for the uninitiated, is a classic top-down arcade-style racing game, as you see so many on iOS and Android devices today, however the most savvy and experienced players will immediately recognize the style and verve unmistakable features of the inspiring muse. What characterizes Micro Machines and its (il)legitimate son, in addition to the iconic power-ups which we will discuss later, is undoubtedly the ~suitable for children~ setting where the small cars battle it out: from the school desk to the desk for homework, passing through the table set for breakfast, the bedroom with toys, the science counter and the billiard table, each scenario is transformed into the seat of bizarre fantasy tracks, where obstacles and sui generis traps are represented by everyday objects. Just think, for example, of the drippings of syrup and chemical compounds that stick tires, or toasters and blenders capable of projecting cars, to understand the carefree and childish - but not banal - spirit of the product. In Toybox Turbos there are a total of 18 tracks divided into the aforementioned settings, where 35 toy cars of different categories can whiz at full throttle, although from this point of view the developers could certainly have done a little more. The single player mode, in fact, is a rather short campaign that offers seven distinct cups linked to the various categories; in ~Targa Trasporti Pubblici~, for example, taxis, buses and school buses compete, while in the ~Coppa dei Cilindri~ racing cars compete, passing through challenges with construction, emergency, off-road vehicles and so on. Unfortunately, the variety that characterized the old Micro Machines is missing, where for example it was possible to challenge each other in the garden aboard motorboats and helicopters, and the feeling is that the number of vehicles - and probably also that of circuits - will be expanded with future DLCs. The tracks, although quite varied and full of shortcuts, as well as dynamic elements capable of influencing the course of the races (such as car-crushing billiard balls, dangerous toy trains and erupting volcanoes), are quite short and for the most part of cases the single lap is completed in less than a minute, suggesting that a little more variety would not have hurt. Despite everything, play the Toybox Turbos campaignit's still very fun and rewarding, also thanks to the presence of online rankings and the three gold stars to be conquered in each competition. We also remind you that six distinct types of races must be addressed in it, namely the classic race, two challenges against time, overtaking a total of vehicles within three laps, escaping from a tidal wave that overwhelms the entire level and finally the combative ~Elimination~, a challenge dedicated to the fight with the bosses - at the end of each cup - in which to get points it is necessary to leave the opposing car behind on the screen, exactly as it happened in the past. Furthermore, the latter mode represents the only game variant available for local and network multiplayer, and can be considered the real beating heart of Toybox Turbos. The challenges with the other players, in fact, offer the same and intense emotions of the old Micro Machines, incredibly competitive and damned fun also thanks to the use of the inevitable power-ups, ranging from wooden hammers capable of crushing the toy cars opponents to devices that release mines, passing through electric shocks, magnets to attract the pilots in front, machine guns, turbo boost and so on. A pinch of variety and more courage, even from the point of view of gadgets, would certainly have been welcome, above all because they completely follow what has already been tried in the past. To unleash further tussle during the races, it is also possible to activate the so-called ~Air Attack~ mode for players eliminated and awaiting return, thanks to which, with a special viewfinder, a rocket can be aimed at the chosen victim. The 35 cars available, to be customized with three paint levels and unlockable in the shop by spending the inevitable gold coins, are equipped with specific weight, maneuverability and speed characteristics, making them all different from each other. Some are much more difficult to control than others, and considering the frenzy of the challenges with the other players, made up of free counters and bad things of all kinds (the ~spintarelle~ in the precipices are a classic), very often the choice falls on the more balanced means present in each category. However, skill, reactivity and an accurate knowledge of the tracks play a determining role in the final victory, and it is not uncommon to find the best pilots at the wheel of the most complex vehicles to drive, such as hovercrafts for example. Breakfast is served If the playful spirit of the original work has remained practically unchanged, the same can be said for the visual and artistic component, enhanced by the high resolution and a granite fluidity at 60 frames per second at maximum detail. In fact, Toybox Turbos, despite the levels being very rich in details and animated objects, sometimes also involved in the physics engine - such as paper clips, sharpeners or marbles in the dedicated scenario - can also be enjoyed on not particularly performing configurations, although there are only three graphic settings that can be adjusted, i.e. the aforementioned resolution, depth of field and anti-aliasing filter. The cel shading-like graphic style also gives a discreet personality to the Codemasters work, where there is no shortage of extremely pleasant scenarios to observe. Even the interface, the simple menus and the catchy tunes - by Mark Knight and Mark Willott - fully follow the spirit of Micro Machines, in a fan service context that covers the entire production. The netcode is good and the samples of the sound effects are pleasant, completely in line with the boyish soul (only in appearance) of Toybox Turbos.", "date": "2014-11-26", "grade": "8.0"}
