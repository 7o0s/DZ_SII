{"name": "Gladiator", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gladiator_a.html", "text": "With five Oscar wins and a total gross of over 450 million dollars, ~Gladiator~ is probably one of the most successful ~historical~ films in the history of US cinema. Anyone who has seen it knows well that its plot is highly fictional compared to reality, but undoubtedly the idea of a Roman general who is forced into slavery and thrown into the arena like a gladiator, looking for an opportunity to take revenge on the Emperor, is fascinating. As written at the beginning, despite the enormous success, the film has not produced the usual multiplatform video game, and has remained without a tie-in until today. To be honest, the Fishlabs product had the numbers to emerge regardless of the ~Gladiator~ license, but anyhow... the presence of the characters seen in the film will only increase the attraction towards the game. There are four modes selectable from the start screen: ~arcade~, ~survival~, ~fast fight~ and ~bluetooth~. The last two allow us, respectively, to play a quick game, with random values, or to challenge a friend who owns the game. The ~survival~ mode is a classic for fighting games, and sees us face an infinite number of opponents relying on a single energy bar, with the aim of lasting as long as possible. Finally, the ~arcade~ mode is the most substantial and represents the fulcrum of Gladiator: you choose a difficulty level between ~slave~ and ~gladiator~ (the latter must be unlocked), you select one of the eight available characters (also 'they subject to gradual release) and we launch into the fray. Each gladiator boasts profoundly different characteristics: there are slow but powerful ones, fast ones and balanced ones, with the gaming experience drastically changing depending on who you choose. The control system tries to combine simplicity and depth, with the character moving forward and backward, moving away from or approaching the screen, using the d-pad. The 5 key is used to attack: pressing it quickly starts a devastating combo, while keeping it loaded allows you to deliver a more powerful blow. Moving forward results in a charge on the opponent, while retreating allows us to parry his attacks. Within a fight we will also be able to sidestep and therefore dodge the blows, putting ourselves in an advantageous position to fight back. The action changes a lot depending on the level of difficulty: we will be able to solve the first clashes by pressing the buttons in bulk, but subsequently we will inevitably have to arm ourselves with patience and a pinch of strategy to win. Fishlabs has done a great job with the technical development of the game: there aren't many three-dimensional fighting games for mobile, but without a doubt this one is the best. The polygonal models of the characters manage to be less angular, boast a good level of detail and excellent animations. The scenario, as expected, is not very rich in elements but rotates and moves smoothly, without any problems. Some moves also produce spectacular effects, including zoom and kinetic lines. For once, the sound sector manages to accompany the action in the best possible way, with sampled and non-MIDI music, the volume of which can be adjusted independently from the terminal.
