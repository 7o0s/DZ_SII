{"name": "Rollerdrome", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rollerdrome-recensione.html", "text": "It's 2030 and a mega multinational known as Matterhorn controls and manages the entire economy with an iron fist. To make sure that the population doesn't realize the situation, this company has created the Rollerdrome, a very violent sport-spectacle in which the best athletes fight to get out alive from arenas full of fully armed opponents. Modern gladiators who, instead of chariots and gladi, use roller skates, pistols and rocket launchers. This is the review of Rollerdrome, the new effort by Roll7 (do you remember the fun and cute OlliOlli? It's them, but a little meaner), even if it could seem like the sequel to classics like Rollerblade or the Runaway Man. What is Rollerdrome Rollerdrome's style is unique If we wanted to categorize Rollerdrome we could say that it is a third-person arena shooter in which the main task of the gamer is to pass unscathed levels full of enemies by scoring the highest possible score. The classic hi-score is achieved by serially killing opponents, which improves the points multiplier, and skating in style around arenas crammed with ramps, half-pipes and railings. Faithful to their workhorse - the OlliOlli series is the one that brought them to the fore - Roll7 has decided to spice up its formula by providing Kara Hassan, the protagonist of the game, with skates with which to dart around the arenas. However, this is not a simple visual or narrative tinsel: in order to do well in Rollerdrome you must first of all master Kara's movements, so as to keep her alive, but also be able to perform tricks and evolutions, essential for recharging the four mouths from fire designed by Roll7. These special weapons, in fact, automatically reload with shots only by performing grabs, somersaults or wall runs. All while lead and other bullets whistling all around you. Fortunately it is also possible to slow down time so as to be able to aim in the most agitated situations, an almost fundamental element, given that shooting in mid-air while performing a somersault and after having dodged day. Difficult, but with makeup Things in Rollerdrome will soon get more complex Managing evolutions isn't as demanding as it could be in the best skate games, but it's still intriguing enough to make the gameplay very technical and sometimes quite complex. Despite a genre-standard control layout and the addition of a couple of keys for grabs and flips, it's the number of inputs to handle simultaneously that is the real hurdle to overcome. From the beginning we will have all of Kara Hassan's moves and abilities available, apart from the most powerful weapons, to be unlocked throughout the campaign, and it will therefore be the mastery of all these variables that will give a sense of progression. After banging your nose against tanks, guided missiles and teleporting enemies, it will be fun to go back and test yourself in the first arenas to find out how in the meantime you have mastered the mechanics of combos, dodging and the ability to exploit levels to jump up, reload your weapons or evade enemy shots. The cutscenes of Rollerdrome are simple, but well done The hard and pure will be able to try to climb the Rolledrome rankings (even online) with their own strength, the others will be able to decide to activate some additional help to allow Kara to save the fur and put a spanner in the works of the Matterhorn. These aids range from a more permissive management of the progression in the story, eliminating the minimum access requirements to the next chapter, to making the protagonist immortal, so as to kill everyone without great effort. It is a forcing to make the game usable by everyone, without bastardizing the balance (upwards) found by Roll7. The more gifted or those who are looking for a challenge will have all the tools to master Kara's movements and the gameplay of Rollerdrome, the others will have a rock to hold on to not give in to frustration. Once you reach the end of the short campaign (the total number of hours, however, depends very substantially on your skill and the activated aids) not only will the bloodthirst mode be unlocked, but the developers promise post-launch content to keep you always fresh the offer. Retro style The level design of Rollerdrome also becomes more complex What is immediately striking about Rollerdrome is its retro graphic style. In fact, the English developers have obtainedto the most scenic effect possible while maintaining the very low technical specifications required. If on PlayStation 4 and PS5 the game shouldn't have any problem running at a rocky 60 frames per second, on PC this goal is reached quite easily even on configurations with a few years on their shoulders or not designed for gaming, such as the AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 4750U used for testing. As we said, all thanks to the artistic direction since, if analyzed in a more scrupulous way, Rollerdrome is not a miracle of technique: the models of the enemies are identical to each other, they are almost stationary and must not show off who knows what artificial intelligence, since they have a single moveset and only target Kara. On the other hand, the protagonist shows off many different movements, well animated and fluid, apart from sometimes when the system forces the animation to ~hook~ her to a railing or a ledge. The controls are usually quite precise and responsive. The fact that Kara is on skates and always continues straight sometimes makes it a bit complex to change direction and turn in the strait, and there is always the risk of getting stuck in some corner or with bigger enemies. It rarely happens, but in the midst of confusion it could be lethal stumbles. The cover of Rollerdrome The design of the levels fluctuates: some arenas are fun and complex enough to guarantee speed in movements, jumps and evolutions, while others are more anonymous. Furthermore, we weren't crazy about the idea of putting chasms in the center of some levels, since in our opinion they add little, since they don't interrupt combos or matches. We also would have liked a little more variety: the types of enemies are always the same and behave in a standard way, and we would have preferred some more unconventional combat.", "date": "2022-08-16", "grade": "8.0"}
