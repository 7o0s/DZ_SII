The new tie-in of the series, developed especially for Nintendo DS, is called Dragon Ball Z: Goku Densetsu and is a card role-playing game. Once one of the available characters has been chosen (initially Goku, Gohan and Piccolo, to whom Vegeta is later added), the plot of the comic is retraced starting from the arrival of Raditz up to the clash with Cell. The levels vary according to the character, and tell the story from his point of view, including fights; and there is no shortage of additions, in order to ~stretch the broth~ as happens in the very slow cartoon. Each stage contains a squared board, and you have a deck of five cards for each turn. The cards each have an attack (top left) and defense (bottom right) value ranging from 1 to 7, with Z acting as a ~joker~ (worth 8), and are divided as follows: Attack (gives the possibility to land a blow, different depending on the image depicted), Energy (increases the attack value of the cards remaining in the deck), Training (increases the defense value of the cards remaining in the deck), Character (yes can attack with another character, depicted on the card), Object (one of the objects collected on the board can be used), Invert (modify the outcome of a play, inverting the attack value of our card with that of the opponent), Hide (allows us to escape from combat) and Z (which can become the card we want). We have to play our cards to move on the board, in which case the attack value indicates how many squares we can move (in a predefined direction, which can only be changed in the presence of crossroads) and the defense value is needed at the end of each movement, to see if we will be attacked or not by a lurking enemy (the clash occurs if our card has a lower defense value than that of the opponent). Each fight won raises the level of our character, and a higher level corresponds not only to a greater number of hit points, but also the possibility of using a hoipoi capsule to increase the possibility of drawing one card instead of another. At the beginning, only one card can be played at a time, but after a few levels, a system of both attack and defense combos becomes accessible: it is possible to associate cards with the same attack value (attack combo) or defense value (attack combo). defense) so that very high numbers are reached, therefore attacks of exceptional power and defenses solid as steel. Goku Serves Poker! But how exactly does the fighting work in DBZ: Goku Densetsu? Our opponent has the same number of cards per turn as us (five). We must select a card (or more than one, if the combos already work) and play it, then compare it with the card played by the enemy: if we have a higher attack value, we win the hand and therefore the card will be activated (depending on whether it is an attack card or of a different type, see above). In case of attack, this will have a power equal to the attack value of the card, and the opponent will be able to defend himself according to the defense value of his card. It goes without saying that if our attack has a value of 7 and the enemy's defense has a value of 2, we will inflict a full 5 damage. All this will have more or less marked implications depending on the difference in level of the two contenders. Explaining how the game works in words is not easy, but two games are enough to understand everything perfectly and also notice the numerous strategic implications of this videogame genre ... you can throw yourself into the attack or take advantage of ~light~ fights to make ~ grow~ your deck, for example, or play cards with low attack value just to move around the table. The movement and fighting routine is repeated in each of the numerous stages available, which, as mentioned, take up the story of Dragon Ball from the arrival of Raditz up to the clash with Cell, in a long adventure that will not fail to thrill fans of the series. Technical realization Games in which fights take place automatically, through animated sequences, now belong to a very successful genre, especially in Japan. Since the time of the first Super Robot Wars, however, things have changed a lot and now watching the clashes hardly becomes boring, due to the numerous animations with which the characters are equipped and the various actions available. The same goes for Goku Densetsu: despite having characters without animations, the game's graphics manage to express an out of the ordinary dynamism and complete the picture with an excellent use of colors (which stand out more than ever on the Nintendo DS screen, especially if in Lite version). The show for the eyes is really top notch, and although the sequences cannot be skipped, they are hardly boring. The sound sector contributes in an important way to the atmosphere of urgency of the fights, with very rhythmic, catchy and engaging music, together with some good voices (in Japanese, fortunately, where the game is completely localized in Italian in the numerous texts on the screen) . It is played using the stylus and the touch screen, in a very intuitive and comfortable way, although it is also possible to use the normal buttons and the d-pad. Both screens are exploited in the best way: the board appears in the upper one (which can be moved below if we want to explore the paths of the boxes), the cards at our disposal in the lower one. During the fights, we will see the opponent on the upper screen, while the attack sequences will develop on both displays. In addition to the single game mode, Goku Densetsu also offers local multiplayer, up to four players (all in possession of the cartridge) or for only two participants (with only one cartridge - but this was not handled exceptionally) . Unfortunately, there is no online multiplayer via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, which is really a shame. Comment Dragon Ball Z: Goku Densetsu is undoubtedly an atypical video game, very ~Japanese~, but it is incredible how it is capable of involving and exciting even those who do not know Akira Toriyama's manga. This is both for the goodness of its structure and because it is completely localized in Italian, which really makes it a product accessible to everyone. Technically excellent, with graphics that are far more than functional (although it offers room for improvement on several fronts), sound up to par and an almost perfect control system, this new Dragon Ball Z tie-in stands as one of the products on most successful license for the DS, especially since it was designed specifically for the Nintendo handheld. Pros: Equipped with a surprising thickness Lots of stages to face with different characters Technically excellent Cons: It is not possible to move freely on the board Some stages are perhaps too long There is no online multiplayer Dragon Ball Z: Goku Densetsu is available on Nintendo DS. It's truly amazing how certain ideas can not only influence the course of one's life, but also arouse the keen interest of millions and millions of people around the world. Perhaps this is what Akira Toriyama thought to himself when he realized the extent of the success of Dragon Ball, a manga published for the first time in Japan in the now distant 1984. At a time when the story became less focused on humor and more on fighting, which in the cartoon occurs in conjunction with the birth of the Z series, Dragon Ball has automatically become the proverbial goose that lays golden eggs... a huge hen, given that more than twenty years later the phenomenon shows no signs of stopping and cyclically gives life, among other things, to very successful video games.", "date": "2007-09-26", "grade": null}
