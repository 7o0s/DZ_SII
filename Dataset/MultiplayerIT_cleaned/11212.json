{"name": "Soul Calibur Legends - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/soul-calibur-legends-recensione.html", "text": "Legend Soul Calibur for Dremcast, released in 1999, is perhaps the last great traditional fighting game to have marked an era: not only did it exalt the capabilities of the platform on which it was developed like few others, but it catalyzed the attention of players from all over the world. world as a fighting game, in fact, would no longer do. The work done by Namco was exceptional: solid, deep mechanics, superlative graphics, a unique style and an enchanting atmosphere, as well as a characterization of the characters - and related inventory - studied in detail. In Soul Calibur every gear worked perfectly and was placed in the right place; in the various sequels, despite the high quality, that balance was no longer achieved. From the game that generates the legend, we passed to the legend that feeds, nourishes and sustains the game, a process that is all too well known in this branch of entertainment. Soul Calibur Legends has nothing to do with the charisma of its progenitor: the characters included in this spin-off are many, Siegfried has assumed the leading role, there is no shortage of Ivy, Taki, Mitsurugy or Sophitia, they are useful for attracting the attention of fans, but introduced without too much respect for the past, with specious motivations to say the least, relics that have lost their symbolic connotations, residues emptied of meaning and badly assembled. Stripped of their background and placed in a poorly crafted fantasy-historical context, in a plot with almost comical developments - whose negative peaks come with the witticisms of Leonardo Da Vinci in the manga version - these characters represent a bait for fans , but also the reason why we are reminded at all times of how far Legends is from Soul Calibur. Shake, sink and cut The controls via Wiimote are one of the best aspects of the game: Namco has made good use of the sensitivity of the movement detection, which, at least for once, are not a simple substitute for buttons. We are far from the dreamed of 1:1 movements  and, given the presentation of the Motion Plus, probably not Namco's fault  but the various actions are well studied: lunge, horizontal slash from left to right and from right to left, vertical from bottom to top and from top to bottom, are all performed by making an equal move using the remote control (same thing for the sudden shots of the character, which are formulated in the same way but with the help of the Nunchuk). In addition to the emulation of the movements, which implicitly increases the involvement (as well as the sweat), the controls work very well because, through the simple movement of the Wiimote-Nunchuk pair, they guarantee a quantity of moves that is difficult to compare with buttons. Exploiting the Wii's potential, however, fails in the next step: the rigid schematism imposed over the years by the old pads has been partially overcome, but the playful impact of this evolution is minimal. Paradoxically, the depth made possible by the Wiimote proves useless, because, if not in some simple puzzle, it is completely indifferent to perform one stroke rather than another. Path of health The characters, on a playful level, are well differentiated: the statistics heavily influence the actions, although the formulation of the moves is common to all. The fighters, as well as their skills, are therefore made with care: they seem not to be only because there are no enemies capable of enhancing their qualities, thus flattening what could have been interesting diversifications. The various stages are as anonymous as the opponents, unfortunately without exceptions: schematic paths that vary from one to the other only in length and visual aspect. Corridors and arenas are artificially regular, yet extremely simple and linear; going forward in the adventure they must also be retraced several times, and not getting bored before the end is very difficult, also because the development of weapons, interesting in theory, has few repercussions on a practical level. Poor customization of the characters, discounted routes, minimal diversification of enemies, little charisma: Soul Calibur Legends does not shine in any of the fundamental aspects for a hack'n'slash. Only the multiplayer is saved, which allows you to revisit certain stages in the company of another fighter, and, as you know, sharing the experience is so magical and subjective that it could, depending on the needs, dramatically lengthen the playful experience. In this field, which has always been fertile ground for scrolling fighting games, only the clash between player and player appears out of place, which highlights how the characters were not designed for duelingking among them. Technically the game does not excel, it appears flat both visually and sonically, except for the good polygonal models of the protagonists. Comment In Soul Calibur Legends the most refined aspect is the control system: the commands via Wiimote and Nunchuk are easy and intuitive, they introduce a playful stratification unfortunately poorly exploited by the game, which presents little differentiated enemies and schematic settings. A flat hack'n'slash, in which the personalization of the protagonists is limited, the technical component is unsatisfactory and the only element that animates the action is the cooperative multiplayer.Pros Well diversified characters Fun cooperative multiplayer Excellent controls...
