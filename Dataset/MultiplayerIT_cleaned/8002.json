{"name": "Dungeon e dintorni", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/114668-dungeonland-dungeon-e-dintorni.html", "text": "There are hundreds of fantasy titles on PC. Many different settings within the limits of clichs and a plot that, despite everything, hardly manages to deviate from pulling the usual rabbits out of the hat. Dungeonland goes no further, indeed it goes back to its roots in every sense. An immediate and basic gameplay, a concept of variety based on the replayability of the environments themselves, enrichment of the inventory and a humorous side that intelligently makes fun of itself. The fantasy irony that permeates Dungeonland is its most characteristic element, certainly the one that saves it from anonymity and allows you to look at it for what the title wants to be: a fun pastime for an afternoon with friends. The first work of Critical Studio refers to the afternoons spent role-playing Dungeons & Dragons and those are the moments that it tries to reduce to a minimum, providing a hack and slash of the early days that finds its soul in multiplayer. Trio of heroes Seeing a company of fantasy stereotypes venturing out and supporting each other with their own abilities immediately makes one think of products that are much better known to the public, but the structure of Dungeonland, although it does not add major innovations, in its own way provides the elements to spend pleasant hours in company . Magician, warrior and thief are the three classes available, which can be combined at will according to how you want to tackle the map, with the aim of defeating the enemies who will arrive in waves, summoned by specific creatures who will have to be the first targets of the advance. The colorful and very cheerful graphic style - almost sarcastic towards tradition - awkwardly hides a game difficulty visibly set upwards, with the nice idea of indicating Hard as the minimum available and increaseable challenge level, in addition to the obvious steps, also with other handicaps for the players. The difficulty factor must never be overshadowed, since this is what the advice is based on to tackle Dungeonland with the help of a joypad, the real support on which the gameplay has been studied, and to be in the company of sentient humans that replace an AI that is sometimes very deficient, which makes single-player progress never taken for granted. Unfortunately, the cases in which once you have fallen lifeless to the ground are not rare, no one will come to get you up again before the counter reaches zero, with the consequent loss of a group life. To dress the backbone intervene destructible map elements, checkpoints that will restore energy and objects to collect. It's a small world It seriously is, especially after noting that the levels in which to venture to accumulate money can be counted on the fingers of one hand, and not even all are needed. The three initially explorable maps (a fourth that can be unlocked later) do not shine in terms of length or level design and the plus point is certainly given by the complexity factor. Increasing the difficulty of the game will result in a greater number of enemies on the screen and an increase in damage suffered, with the consequent need for the group to better manage the synergy. We return again to the core of the product: Dungeonland gives its best in multiplayer with friends, and this is the aspect that gives the most fun and balances the obvious dungeon building flaws. The fact that the title online is not properly structured, with frequent hosting falls, damages the attempt of those who, having no playmates available, would like to find them around the globe. Putting aside the graphic glitches present, it is undeniable how pleasant it is to advance in a quest devoid of any plot, to remark that Dungeonland points the finger at its immediate and direct hack and slash gameplay. Accumulating money to buy better weapons, magic and equipment is the right end to push you to retrace the arenas several times, hoping that this or that detail of the scenario becomes a cornucopia of gold coins. Master of the underground If after a few hours of one-way sessions boredom occurs in reviewing the cyclically repeating mechanics, Dungeonland takes out its best trump card. Dungeon Maestro is the ideal way to reshuffle the cards on the table and allow a player to be the architect of the trio's misadventures, drawing cards with a simple timed deck reset system. The variables of the cards, which can be purchased in the usual internal shop, are different: they range from simple enemies to traps to attack and defense spells, all with the sole purpose of prematurely stopping the race of heroes. The mode shines especially if all four pawns in action are players, so as to make the challenge between the two sides interesting andcapable of giving beautiful emotions for several hours of play. The sound accompaniment deserves a separate mention, which supports the small playful production with unexpected courage. The tracks have a very jovial and cheerful flavor, without recalling sacred monsters of the genre but referring to a festive fantasy that approaches the game action with dignity.", "date": "2013-02-15", "grade": "7.0"}
