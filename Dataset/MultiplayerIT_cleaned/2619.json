{"name": "Point Blank 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/point-blank-3_a.html", "text": "Shoot what happens to you Point Blank 3 is (if possible) even nicer than its predecessors, with a graphic design, always in Japanese cartoon style, very demented, a mix between two and three-dimensional drawing (practically identical to the coin-op), seasoned with the usual ~funfair~ themed tunes and really crazy sound effects, which make you smile with every shot fired. The missions to be accomplished are, as always, very many, some similar to those of the previous episodes but others totally new; for example, you will find horror houses infested with little monsters, friendly aliens, herds of running buffaloes to stop, an internship inspired by Tekken (with Mokujin!) and many other bizarre adventures, more or less hostile, which must always be faced in a different way. Before each mission you will in fact always be informed (in Italian) on what to do, on what to hit and what not, and also on particular game rules to respect; for example, there is the mode with time running out but unlimited ammunition or its opposite, i.e. ~calmly but.. only one shot available~! Bang! Bang! ..hit! Playability is the real strength of this product, raised to the power of the faithful Namco light-gun, with its good aiming system, a fundamental characteristic for making a game of this type successful. In the absence of the weapon you can still play with the agile analog lever of the pad, with the possibility of also setting the acceleration of the viewfinder in relation to the increase in the speed of your movements. In the whole days that you will be holed up at home to hit all the targets, you can, as always, have fun as a couple, even more! up to a maximum of eight players, who shoot alternately, in the fun ~Fiesta~ mode, and we can assure you that playing a gun game in pairs, on pson, is a unique experience (in the true sense of the word). Other fun variations on the ~Arcade~ theme are ~Training~ or ~Resistance~ mode but in the end they are just an excuse to add longevity and shoot again and again!! Final duel This umpteenth Point Blank (which apparently will also be the last) is ultimately a really well done product, with a very high gameplay, capable of driving away thoughts, but don't expect a total revolution .. in short, consider it more as ~extra levels~, almost an extension of the previous chapters in short. Certainly this is not a real defect, given that it is like this in the arcade too, but if you have not yet finished the previous episode (hard to believe ..) then postpone the purchase, while if you have never tried any game in the series, start quietly at the end, and SHOOT your copy of Point Blank 3 immediately ... you will inevitably be IMPRESSED! pro: it's too much fun! high longevity perfect conversion cons: few innovations without the Gun-Con45 not quite the same Music not exciting Namco pulls the trigger again The third ~perfect center~ from Namco arrives with the excellent conversion of the new chapter of the adventures dedicated to the two funny gunslingers Dr.Don and Dr.Dan. The formula is the well-known and tested one: face myriads of absurd tests, shooting like madmen but with a smile on their lips, without the shadow of bloody scenes, in a game capable of gluing users of all ages to the screen ... and beyond masculine. 1", "date": "2001-03-15", "grade": null}
