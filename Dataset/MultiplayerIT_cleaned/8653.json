With the exception of BiteJacker and Galactic Commandos 2, all the games made by the Singaporean developer for PC and Xbox Live Indie Games have always featured his mascot with Nino D'Angelo hair, most of the time grappling with daring escapes from ready caves to collapse at any moment. In fact, two Flash spin-offs were born from the more elaborate and full-bodied Tobe's Vertical Adventure: on the one hand Great Escape, a running game in the style of Canabalt but with some small original ideas, and on the other Hookshot Escape, a vertical scrolling platform in which, similar to Doodle Jump, you have to jump from one platform to another trying to get as high as possible. The positive comments received by the latter convinced the development team to deepen and enrich the game to re-propose it on mobile devices under the name of Tobe & Friends: Hookshot Escape. Higher and higher Those who have tried the original version of Tobe's Hookshot Escape will not find big differences in the first minutes of the game: while the screen moves inexorably upwards, Tobe must find a way to jump onto the platform above him, but the only way to to do so is to use the harpoon at one's disposal. This idea translates into a continuous move in search of the best grip or the highest point before coordinating the protagonist's jump with the use of the harpoon, a routine that the player takes a while to metabolize also due to the bad Tobe's acrobatic skills. As you go up, things get more and more interesting, you will encounter enemies to eliminate or avoid, dangerous traps, bubbles to jump on and small elevators. This simple and successful mix between Doodle Jump and Gravity Hook would be more than enough to make Tobe and Friends: Hookshot Escape a pleasant pastime to keep on your iPhone while waiting for a queue at the Post Office or a tram ride, but for this conversion Secret Base has really rolled up its sleeves, introducing a long series of power-ups and new equipment. The former can be collected and used during a game, perhaps to eliminate all enemies on the screen or save one's skin on the most desperate occasions; the latter, on the other hand, must be unlocked by completing some objectives (usually of the type ~kill X enemies~ or ~jump Y times~) and can enhance the skills of their alter-ego, for example by improving their jump or increasing the number of objects they can bring with you. In this case, to avoid making the records in the online rankings too unequal, the player receives penalty points for each equipped item. In the same way, reaching ever higher heights it is possible to unlock three new settings which, despite being simple alternative templates, add more variety both visually and sonically. However, the biggest novelty is represented by the three hidden characters, who are not limited to a small aesthetic change or a few differences in terms of speed and jump, but completely distort the way in which to approach the game through completely unique skills. If Tobe can use the harpoon to reach the platform above him, Nana is able to hammer his way through, while Aero can flutter around for a bit and cling to walls, making it necessary to flank platforms instead of standing underneath. They. It is precisely this large amount of irons on the fire, combined with simple to assimilate but extremely fun mechanics, that makes the Secret Base endless game a small magnet for the user, who can continue playing, unlock and experiment with new characters and strategies to maximize your score and climb the different rankings present. Like many games of this type, the platforms that appear on the screen are procedurally chosen from a series of pre-existing patterns so that the player is always able to continue, but in this case there are small flaws in the design: albeit on rare occasions, for example, it may happen that unstable ground collapses by mistake or inattention, only to then discover that it was the only point from which it was possible to reach the next platform. Furthermore, if the landing on mobile devices has enriched Hookshot Escape with a whole series of unpublished contents, the transition to the touchscreen interface has not been painless at all. Since it is only possible to play by holding the iPhone in a portrait position, the proximity and small size of the virtual keys force the player to hold their hands in an unnatural way, although you can easily do the calafter a few games. A curious note, on the other hand, interests iPad owners: although it doesn't have a native version for the Apple tablet, Hookshot Escape allows you to activate a different control scheme designed specifically for playing on the iPad with resolution expanded to 2x. This solution is certainly inelegant, but luckily the excellent and accurate pixel art of the backdrops and characters loses little or nothing of the original quality.", "date": "2012-03-22", "grade": "8.3"}
