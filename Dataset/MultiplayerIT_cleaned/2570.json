There is no real reason behind the existence of this title: paradoxically, it might be more understandable, however, to attempt to write an article that illustrates it to you. We will therefore explain to you what PUSS! is, how to play it and for what heck of absurd reason there is already a small sect of enthusiasts on Steam who have made it reach a ~very positive~ overall rating in two years. More is not permitted for a human being: we are imperfect. Ah, now it's coming to consoles, presumably at a budget price. Plot Beyond the fact that PUSS! seems (deliberately) the result of a creative cocktail of various acids and LSD, the game also has a story. The story goes like this: A cat owner falls asleep while watching television. His watchful four-legged companion then picks up a call for help coming from the TV: the forces of evil have awakened, and only a cat will be able to save the world, completing a dreamlike and hallucinogenic journey between various dimensional planes. This, at least, is what we were able to understand. PUSS! it demands that you understand something of what you are seeing. It's not easy. Try to isolate Spongebob's exquisite nonsense, the more refined one, then season it with elements from Christian mysticism and typical objects of consumer society: this nice milkshake forms the context of PUSS! For some reason, the cat in question will continue to travel from world to world (each of them is a level) looking for (unlikely) allies with which to challenge Satan and the forces of evil, which have also brought several felines to their side. PUSS! Creepy enough, right? And you have yet to see the rest. When we talk about unlikely allies you can well understand that we don't choose random adjectives. To help this blessed feline there will in fact - among others - a stereotypical sensei, a dolphin and Jesus. The basic problem is that at a certain point the confusion also begins to seem credible, in its absurdity. Gameplay PUSS! and the management of the lights: be careful if you are photosensitive Let's move on to the gist of the matter, i.e. the gameplay of PUSS! The definition of those pranksters from the teamcoil developers is particularly useful: ~A crazy, absurd and intense game starring a cat, whose aim is to avoid obstacles!~ And in fact, any attempt to explain the game formula better than that would be unrealistic. Passino ~crazy~ and ~absurd~, of which we have already given the idea; PUSS! then it's really a very frenetic title that requires the player to move a cat (a cat avatar, to be more precise) from point A to point B of each level; that is, you have to take it to the exit. This isn't simple. The fifty levels proposed are actually tiny: the problem is that from point A to point B an entire universe of surreal situations passes us by. You will find all forms of problems to get around or overcome: the basic element of the gameplay is that the cat can only pass on certain luminous surfaces, ~channeled~ between other patterns that cause instant death once touched. So it's super easy to die at any moment, just from a little ~slip~ of the left trigger, which takes care of the movement. PUSS! Sensei help us What about the thousand thousand elements on the screen that shake, move, move, twist in a blaze of annoying and senseless lights. Starting a level is like finding yourself in a disco, in pajamas, with all the lights flashing at you, intermittently. Nothing is understood - in certain moments all this really hurts the eyes, so much so that several times several warnings on the screen require photosensitives to keep away. They would remain dead in place, for sure, right away. Playstation 4 trophies Yes PUSS! it also has the trophies on PlayStation 4: presumably it's a really hard Platinum Trophy to get. Why do we talk without offering you certainties? Because we tried the title well in advance, when it wasn't even possible to sync trophies on PlayStation Network. Who knows where they ended up. But they should be there, somewhere. We will update this window when we know more. And anyway you have to play for the title itself, not for the trophies. Although perhaps, in this case, it is better to do it for trophies. Progression PUSS! is divided into five different worlds (plus an initial set of levels): to complete the game you will have to go through them all, yearsentering the bosses on duty. We don't want to talk to you about these, so as not to deprive you of the surprise in the progression; in the trailer, however, a demon-possessed three-headed chihuahua appears to be beaten in a colossal boss fight, and this should be enough for you to get an idea of the rest as well. Each world is divided into about ten levels that are only vaguely themed: these stages are proposed procedurally, which probably appeared to the developers as the revolution of the century. This means that it is always those ten that make up the given world, but in case of death you could also deal with them again in a completely different order; this should ~prevent~ you from overtraining at any given point. The overall sense of frustration of the production is remarkable: the users will therefore be divided between those who will immediately trash everything, and those who will instead idolize the developers. Both, however, the brain will be burned in a short time. PUSS! One of the many, unlikely bosses of PUSS! It should be some kind of putto / Eros / winged demon It's not worth commenting on the graphic and technical sector: in themselves drawings, illustrations and models are laughable, but put all together they celebrate the triumph of nonsense; and given that nonsense is the very heart of the production, we understand how, finally, the desired result is achieved. Therefore, it is not clear how, to see PUSS! it's also pleasant. Equally crazy, between meows, barks and techno music, the soundtracks. Some levels of PUSS! they are intricate, labyrinthine.
