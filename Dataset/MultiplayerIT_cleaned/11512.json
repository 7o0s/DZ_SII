Anticipating a little what you will read in the course of the article, you must know right now that it leaves something to be desired, more or less heavily, in various sectors, but nevertheless it possesses in good doses a characteristic that should be fundamental in criticism and in the judgment of a video game: it's fun. And then, ~gameplay comes first~, as Shigeru Miyamoto likes to repeat, or in 2008 is it absolutely vital to present a product with attention to every detail? To the review the arduous sentence Slicer in first person Koei has made a name for itself for years, and not always a positive one, for its hack 'n' slash series characterized by historical settings, tons of enemies on screen and one or more heroes with almost supernatural fighting skills. Given the good success achieved especially in Japan by each title, we now have many products to be included in this particular sub-genre scattered more or less on all systems; but, whether the game is set in ancient China (Dynasty Warriors) or in medieval Japan (Samurai Warriors, to be precise) rather than in improbable crossovers of sci-fi universes as has recently been done for Gundam, strategic components must be inserted and/or from more or less accentuated RPGs, it is a fact that the evaluations and enthusiasm have gradually diminished for a simple reason: the gameplay is always basically reduced to a frenzied button mashing interspersed from time to time by clashes more demanding and from the occasional tactical decision. This may be fine once, maybe twice if you were particularly satisfied with the experience, but already at the third time you begin, and rightly so, to want something different. Taking advantage of the transition to Wii, the parent company has therefore thought well of making a significant change: however, far from creating something new, Katana differs from the other titles in the series because more than a classic ~slice & cut~ it resembles the classics in terms of system ~railgun shooters~ from the hall, like, to be clear, a House of the Dead or a Time Crisis. The view is therefore in the first person, the freedom of movement is extremely limited, and the enemies appear only when and do only what the script they are equipped with provides. Katana differs from the other titles in the series because more than a classic ~slice & cut~ it resembles the classic arcade ~railgun shooters~ in terms of system Slicer in first person An important point, however, is that your main weapon will be a white weapon (especially swords, but also more particular weapons such as spears and heavy war hammers), and a throwing weapon (bows and firearms), although always at your disposal, it will be better called upon to perform rather specific tasks. With the Wiimote, control the viewfinder on the screen and each enemy is marked with a blue circle, which will turn red when it is within reach of your weapon, to be activated by simply pressing the A key. Only when you have given one or more simple shots, you can ring a combo using a devastating attack via Wiimote, which recognizes (not always well) horizontal, vertical and diagonal movements, plus the one in depth for certain weapons such as the spear. The ranged weapons work as in a very classic arcade shooter, while still worthy of note are the possibility of defending oneself using the Z key, for a limited period of time by a special bar, and the Musou, i.e. the possibility, always after the filling of the usual bar, to make completely random movements with the Wiimote having the certainty that they will get rid of all the enemies on the screen, bosses aside. The latter represent, with good reason, the toughest obstacles: you will have to make good use of the defense and take advantage of the rare and very fast moments in which they will expose their weak points to be right, their attacks are more varied and dangerous than those of normal enemies and often in the later stages you will need more than one attempt to defeat them. You can then, by pressing C, hook the viewfinder not to an opponent but to a single point on the screen, but it will probably be the least exploited possibility given the mobility of the enemies. feudal structure All this paints the picture of a frenetic gameplay that will see you taking care of several things simultaneously on the screen, which causes a certain addiction especially if you want to get the highest ratings for each stage, but which does not hide its main flaw evident after just a few sessions : the monotony. It is a typical feature of the series and that this new variation has not managed to eliminate, by virtue of the fact that we are always talking about an arcadee: in Koei they must have noticed it and have tried to introduce numerous elements of variety, from particular missions (we have timed ones, those that allow a certain freedom of movement, those focused more on ranged weapons and so on) to a structure strategic / RPG that sees us busy collecting money during missions to spend to improve both the equipment and our basic characteristics, as well as to buy items that are sometimes essential for the success of a stage. All of this paints the picture of a fast-paced gameplay that will see you multitasking on screen at the same time feudal structure These are in good number, and in total the longevity of the main story settles on ten / fifteen hours, a respectable number for an arcade. Moreover, there are also other game modes such as the Trials, five particular missions in which you will have to help the legendary thief Goemon Ishikawa (the historical one, not the famous friend of Lupine III...) to carry out his misdeeds and then be able to keep a part of the loot to spend as you see fit: Trials are useful for accumulating a little money, given that the game is rather stingy with it and in general the enhancement, unless you undergo the repetition of the same level over and over again, it happens rather slowly throughout the storyline. Then there is also a Vs. mode for two players in split screen, not very incisive. Medieval technique? We find the major flaws in terms of technical realization and presentation in general: the title is set during the epic story of Oda Nobunaga, the legendary daimyo who in the 16th century undertook a work of unification of Japan which would later be completed by his successors. You play an obscure soldier of his army committed to making his way through the enemy ranks and creating a name for himself in history, and all the characters you will meet, halfway between history and legend starting from Nobunaga himself, are outlined in a superficial and stereotyped way. The story is interesting and takes up real historical events, such as the betrayal of Akechi Mitsuhide and the Honno-ji incident, which if well investigated would have given rise to a strong and committed narrative, but the opportunity was lost, the cut scenes linking the various stages are few and far from exciting, and the numerous dialogues spoken in English are sloppily acted. The major flaws are found at the level of technical realization and presentation in general Medieval technique? The situation is better if you select the audio in Japanese, although here we suspect that at least some of it is due to our very little knowledge of the language. In any case, the original interpretation respects that somewhat naive emphasis that anyone who has seen an anime in the language might expect, and it is pleasant. Of the graphics it can be said that the engine certainly does not have any of those next-gen features that the Wii, at least in part, is able to offer, and indeed we are constantly faced with monotonous settings, dirty and faded textures, graphic bugs repetitions that are not serious but noticeable, and characters characterized by a very low polygon count. This is partly justifiable given the large number of enemies that the game occasionally puts on the screen, and without losing, which is extremely good, a frame of fluidity. Also missing, in the European edition, the possibility of exploiting 16:9 and, if experience does not deceive us, the display at 60 Hz. Finally, the sound experience, if we have already spoken of the dialogues, can count on special effects anonymously average and on musical pieces that mix contemporary electronica and Japanese tradition, for a result that, if in some cut scenes and in the title screen can also be very pleasant, in game it does not give rise to anything memorable, while remaining acceptable for the arcade standard, a genre to which, ultimately, this Samurai Warriors Katana is closest. As critics, we have to evaluate the product in question as objectively as possible, and the vote you find on the side, slightly above the sufficiency, seems to be the best compromise between the design of the game, full of cues and ideas, and its negative realization in some points. But never as in this case is the classic ~try before you buy~ valid, because in spite of everything Katana is fun and you could find it a perfect purchase, if the monotony inherent in the genre doesn't scare you. And if you find it at lower prices, run the risk: a few hours of healthy fun this game will certainly give you!
