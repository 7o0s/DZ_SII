{"name": "Totally Reliable Delivery Service", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/totally-reliable-delivery-service-la-recensione.html", "text": "If your dream has always been to be a delivery boy and have free access to any possible vehicle, in a world free from standard rules, then you should follow this Totally Reliable Delivery Service review with interest, but keep in mind that the leeway offered from the game must be subject to a particular rule. The world of the tinyBuild game is in fact subjugated by intentionally bizarre physics, which in fact make any slightest movement difficult and any attempt to perform a minimally complex movement totally laughable. In this way, even the simple fact of carrying a package from one point to another on a map that in itself has no threatening element, being instead characterized by a joyful and tender atmosphere, can become an adventure on the edge of survival We can see it this way: let's take the concept of Death Stranding and put the physics of Goat Simulator or Human Fall Flat into it, drawing from the latter the nonsense tone that here overflows into the wildest demented. The renewed epic light with which the role of the courier in Hideo Kojima's game has been invested remains somewhat intact here, because even the mere fact of arriving unscathed at the end of a straight road surrounded by cheerful little trees is practically a feat, but the human drama is accompanied by loud laughter in this case. The problem is that these can easily be overwhelmed by colorful curses in the long run, when the contrived cumbersomeness of the controls starts to become more of a hindrance than an amusement. It could be said that, at this point, Totally Reliable Delivery Service has essentially fulfilled its mission, and this is precisely the biggest problem of the game: this saturation phase can be reached very soon, unfortunately. We must also consider the different possible ways in which it is possible to access the title in question: on mobile platforms it is free-to-play with additional in-app purchases, on PC it could initially be downloaded as a free offer and on Xbox One it is included in the within the Xbox Game Pass catalog. These possibilities of free access make it easily appreciable initially, but also difficult to consider a title fully worthy of purchase at its standard price, also considering that the additions (skins and new explorable islands) are in any case paid and the complete package raises the price from 14.99 euros standard to almost 24 euros. Deliveries everywhere and in any case The mechanics of Totally Reliable Delivery Service are extremely simple: it is a question of collecting the packages from the vending machines scattered around the map and taking them to the established objectives, nothing else. All very simple except that, beyond the objective difficulties in reaching some delivery points (which can be on top of towers, on the roofs of buildings and in general in places that are not easily accessible), the characters and vehicles respond to laws quite special physiques. The dynamics of movement are complicated by an exaggerated inertia, an input lag calculated to complicate things and a response to the physics driven to paroxysm, so much so that even moving on foot carrying a crate in hand is a real feat , not to mention using the various vehicles scattered around. The control system includes the classic movement with the analog stick, the lats to raise the arms and the triggers to grab, independently, with the right and left hands. This already generates a series of crazy situations for which it is possible to find yourself dangling from the fuselage of an airplane at crazy heights, with one hand on the yoke and one trying to hold on to the package to be delivered. This difficulty in completing any standard action with measured and coordinated movements continuously triggers more or less involuntary gags, which are the soul of the game. For its part, the surrounding world does everything to further amplify this general humor: from the cartoonish representation to the arrangement and constitution of the missions, up to the type of vehicles to be used, everything is built like a huge playground to give life to the most absurd evolutions and laugh at it. Thus we find ourselves having to launch fish through a mobile ramp, trying to hit a target at a height of meters (usually ending up being launched ourselves into the stratosphere, together with the poor fish), flying with a rocket attached to a fire extinguisher or at low altitude with a uncontrollable plane, trying to crash a package with surgical precision on a control tower. These and many other situations come to life on the islands that make up the game world, witha free approach to the various missions that can be undertaken in any order. The gameplay emerges from the individual situations that the players themselves find themselves creating, so the early stages of the game are probably the most fun ever, because they are a continuous discovery of new vehicles to use (there are really many , air and aquatic) and disparate settings around the islands. After these first hours, interest physiologically drops drastically, once you have tried more or less the different variations on the theme proposed by the game. A world of gummy ragdolls The technical poverty and the control system bordering on the bug are clearly elements studied in terms of game design, within that philosophy of ~ugly~ games based on ~crooked~ physics that have had great success in recent years such as Goat Simulator and Humans Fall Flat. It must be said that Totally Reliable Delivery Service is characterized by a slightly more refined style, deriving from a certain experience of TinyBuild in creating games with a particular appearance, although its arrival on the market probably coincides with a decisive phase tired for this type of titles. Stylistically, however, it has a certain coherence and the characterization of characters and settings manages well to amplify the humorous effect of the whole package. It's obviously goofy, coarse-grained humor, as evidenced by the characters' looks, and their attire, which reaches maximum impact with younger audiences. The writer has played Totally Reliable Delivery Service especially in multiplayer with split-screen together with his two children aged 8 and 5 and found himself having sincere and big laughs, but this is probably the condition in which the game expresses the best of self. Everything is built to give the maximum in multiplayer, even more if offline and with an ~inter-generational~ user base, because this triggers a circuit of reactionary laughter that is actually worth experiencing. In other cases, the attraction progressively diminishes, passing through online multiplayer with friends and unknown players and arriving at the single player that has practically no reason to exist, unless the user is just young enough to being able to quietly roar in front of the crazy evolutions of the little men in their underwear, but also in this case the lifeblood to make the fun last is always the multiplayer. On mobile platforms, the frustrating effect of the deliberately complicated control system is amplified by the distortions of the touch screen, becoming a real nightmare. Everything is solved using a controller and tested with that of Xbox One on a 2018 iPad, Totally Reliable Delivery Service represents an experience precisely in line with that offered on consoles, but relying on the touch screen alone we are truly at the limits of unplayable.", "date": "2020-04-09", "grade": "6.5"}
