{"name": "One Piece: Romance Dawn", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/126370-one-piece-romance-dawn-mai-fidarsi-di-usop.html", "text": "A very curious thing happened last year. A little man from Namco Bandai, at the end of an unlucky week, went for a drink in a seedy Japanese place and then, returning home a little tipsy, he bumped into a light pole (yes, like in a manga) . The blow was like an epiphany and at dawn, after waking up in a puddle of rainwater mixed with gastric juices, the little man from Namco Bandai realized that not all manga spin-offs for boys must necessarily be a fighting game or a ~musou~ type action game. Back in the office, then, while his revelation shook the very foundations of our planet causing earthquakes and tsunamis, he ordered the development of One Piece: Romance Dawn for PSP. And there would already be some questions to be asked, but never mind. Today that little man probably lives under a bridge; in his place another Japanese man was hired who, a year later, thought well of bringing that same game to Nintendo 3DS and authorized its export to a West that One Piece has known - and loved - for years now. And so here we are, talking about a jRPG inspired by the events of Eiichiro Oda's manga, and wondering if another musou hadn't been better... One Piece: Romance Dawn is a lazy port of the game of the same name already released in Japan for PSP. Sin! The Pirate King! Mind you, One Piece: Romance Dawn's problem isn't that it's a jRPG. Indeed, the idea is excellent and One Piece lends itself particularly well to that type of structure. For the uninitiated, One Piece is a ~shonen~ (for kids) manga that tells the story of Monkey D. Luffy, an incurable optimist who one day decides to leave his little island to explore the world and become the king of pirates. Anyone who reads the comic or follows the animated series knows that Luffy's story becomes a succession of more or less fortunate encounters: our young hero manages to appropriate a ship and put together a crew of increasingly bizarre characters, living incredible adventures on and under the sea, facing ever more powerful and fearsome enemies. Luffy, in fact, is not the only one to have eaten a magical fruit that gives real super powers: he, in particular, has become a real rubber man. The process is typical of Japanese action-adventure comics: the group reaches a new land and must contend with one or more opponents who will often force our heroes to fight unleashing incredible special shots, to lose, to get up and defeat the bad guy with the power of tenacity, friendship and/or desperation. Rinse and repeat for over seventy volumes. This pappardella for better or worse also summarizes the structure of One Piece: Romance Dawn, which slavishly follows the story of the manga from Luffy's departure to the battle of Marineford, thus covering the first sixty volumes of the manga. In theory, for a fan, this would be a real treat. In practice, the way in which the One Piece plot is exposed risks not only boring those who already know it, but also alienating newbies, who will find themselves overwhelmed by very long and mediocre dialogues associated with simple portraits and interspersed, occasionally, from static and badly compressed images of the cartoon. Fans will certainly want to skip a story they already know and which is mortified here, especially in the highlights, by such a poor presentation; newbies will wonder what's so interesting about rosewater dialogues that don't convey any emotion, especially after watching the introductory cartoon sequence that traces the most important moments in Luffy's story with emphasis to say the least excessive on the tears of our heroes. One Piece, over the years, has been able to move us like few other comics, but this video game transposition is just a very boring summary. The 3D effect Not received. No, we're not being sarcastic: it really isn't! The King of Pilates! And so we start from the Foosha village and a new island appears on the world map; completed that portion of the story, another will appear, then another, and so on until the end. Each island represents a new setting and a new chapter in the story, but if you think you can freely explore Skypiea or Alabasta you are in for a severe disappointment. Each island corresponds to a single area, made up of a certain number of ~floors~, each made up of a tangle of corridors that are all the same and poor in detail. Thrown into the fray, our aim will be to find the exit of the floor in turn, dodging or fighting against the enemies who walk through the various corridors. Occasionally dwe will have to face a simple ~quick time event~, pressing the key corresponding to the direction we want to take when Luffy runs alone like crazy. Exploration, if it can be called that, is certainly not the strong point of the game, and if it weren't for the spartan map displayed on the lower screen it would even be difficult to navigate in every maze of deja vu. Interaction with the environment is limited to opening chests that contain healing items, pieces of equipment, but also treasure maps and projects: the former unlock optional ~mini dungeons~ in which it is possible to train our heroes and find a few more objects; the latter, on the other hand, allow us to build accessories and protections by combining the required materials through a not particularly intuitive system. Having chosen the island where to land, we must also form a team which will therefore be composed of three of our crew members. To be honest, the combat system proposed in One Piece: Romance Dawn is not bad at all and is full of interesting ideas that would be worth exploring. Once you've made contact with an enemy, there's virtually no gap between exploration and combat. When the turn of one of our characters comes, you can move him freely on the battlefield, bringing him closer or further away from the enemies we are facing: however, you must bear in mind that if you move too far from the starting point, you will face penalties on damages we may inflict and receive. Once a target has been chosen, the player performs real combos, almost like a fighting game, thus performing the typical attacks seen in the comic or cartoon. Each successful shot charges an indicator which, once a certain amount is reached, can be consumed with a particularly spectacular special shot. It is also worth underlining that pinch of strategy offered by the fact that each attack knocks enemies away, perhaps crashing them into a wall with a lot of bonus damage or placing them near their cronies, so that you can hit them all with a possible area attack. The fun, however, ends here, because the variety of enemies is almost nil (and even from island to island they don't differ that much) and the difficulty is practically non-existent. We rarely had to rely on healing potions or defensive abilities, and most of the fights were resolved with a mixture of combos and special attacks. Only the bosses give a hard time, mostly due to their impressive amount of life points. Also from this point of view, in short, One Piece: Romance Dawn proves to be a half-successful product, also thanks to the lack of care placed in the audio sector (enriched only by an sporadic dubbing in Japanese) and in the graphic one, where only the models polygonal shapes of the main characters and bad guys stand out in the general flatness of textures and chromatic solutions. After all, we're talking about a title released for PSP over a year ago, but on the other hand, it's sad to see that the developer Three Rings hasn't put much effort into the transition to Nintendo 3DS: suffice it to say that the stereoscopic effect is completely absent.", "date": "2013-12-10", "grade": "S.V."}
