They certainly don't lack either the background or the experience to produce a fighting game that deals with big robots against giant monsters, basically it's almost just a question of replacing them with the muscular wrestlers and the game would almost be done. The opportunity to create this kind of title came with the official license of the film Pacific Rim, a highly successful film in cinemas these days. Pacific Rim: The Video Game, this is the unimaginative title, is basically a fighting game that takes place in three-dimensional arenas set in some locations from the film. We recall, for those who have not seen even a trailer, that ~the story~ basically deals with the dream of every otaku and robot enthusiast, that is to finally see in a major Hollywood production what we have always appreciated in the dedicated anime of the 70s and 80s to the clashes between humans and aliens. Giant robots controlled by humans who collide with giant lizards in Godzilla style, around dozens of special effects, explosions and Yankee dialogues. What more do you want? A video game that follows the same lines and perhaps exalts us just as much? An atypical fighting game that has some problems As soon as you start the game you immediately realize that something is wrong: on the other hand the 200 MB download wasn't encouraging. The menu is quite spartan but includes single player mode, multiplayer with online and an option to create our own custom mech. Obviously we start with the first one and throw ourselves into the fray, but not before having tasted a confusing tutorial in which the artificial intelligence has not been deactivated and therefore prevents us from reading the instructions by attacking us endlessly. With a little effort we are able to complete what is required of us and after having learned all the available moves of Pacific Rim: The Videogame we are ready to leave for the missions. Unfortunately, we immediately point out that there are only five selectable characters, a bit few for a fighting game with any ambitions. Just like in every game of this kind we start, stage after stage, to meet opponents to face. Our character does not affect either the story or the enemies encountered, so it will be normal that sometimes we will have to clash between Jaegers (the allies) or between two Kaiju (the giant lizards), without an apparent reason or a plot. The ~story~ is simply a succession of encounters without a minimum of variety, with a decidedly high progression of the sense of difficulty. You go from absolutely stupid and easy to take down opponents to really tough ones, and vice versa. The game arenas are really small, too. The developer should have focused more on the environments, their size, the interactivity (since they are still giants that destroy everything that happens around them), the scenography which could have been decidedly more inspired and instead limits itself to proposing some burning city or a spartan glacier at the north pole with very little on-screen elements. Pacific Rim: The Video Game is not a fighting game that takes place on a hypothetical two-dimensional plane like any Street Fighter, for example, but has a Virtual On-style 3D setting, with the characters moving in every direction regardless of the opponent. By attacking or defending, we engage directly with the enemy, but while on the move we are free to wander around the narrow stages. Well yes, because the latter are also very small and cramped, compared to what could be done and how little was enough is a big disappointment. So often and willingly we find ourselves on the ropes, cornered and retreating to look for an escape route. Maybe it's some leftover from the UFC and WWE series, made by the same developer, but here we are faced with giant characters in confined spaces and the final result does not pay off. Bots and action fans, stay away! The Pacific Rim film is of another substance Xbox 360 goals Pacific Rim: The Video Game offers 400 points through 20 objectives to be unlocked as follows: a third by overcoming the levels in single player, a third by going ahead with the survival mode, the rest by playing online. The progression of the release is linear and gives satisfaction because it is quite simple. 90's gameplay Playing Pacific Rim: The Video Game the first thing that comes to mind are those now two fighting gamesages ago that depopulated on Playstation and Sega Saturn. Immediately remember, for example, D-Xhird and Virtual On, the first negative for the woodiness of the control, the second for the 3D movements around the enemy. The animations are absolutely slow and not very responsive to commands, for example by performing a ~super attack~ this takes place only several seconds after pressing the dedicated back button: an infinite time for a fighting game. In reality, the combat system would not even be thrown away. There are many moves to perform between normal shots, powerful, super attack, dodges, parries, melee shots to the white weapon and energy projectiles from a distance. At the bottom, on the game HUD, we find the energy bars that indicate the state of health, and a ~power~ bar that is discharged by performing attack moves, but also dodging or defensive shots. This last bar recharges itself and serves to not allow players to abuse attacks and not perform a senseless furious button smashing. In this sense, the experiment is perfectly successful and justified by the fact that the big robots have a certain operational autonomy to respect, while the monsters have to catch their breath after each attack sequence. And it is for this reason that every move will always be thought out and decided in a very rational way, in stark contrast to the speed and need to have irrational reflexes of any ~normal~ fighting game. One of the biggest problems of Pacific Rim: The Video Game, regardless of the extreme slowness that makes it extremely frustrating and unmanageable, is that once you learn how to cheat your opponent you no longer encounter major difficulties with anyone and the technique is always the same itself, i.e. dodging an attack, turning around and hitting the rump. There are problems with some bosses, but everything can be solved after a break-in game useful to understand ~how~ to go around them and catch them from behind. The classic 1 vs 1 multiplayer mode is also accompanied by a survival mode, which, as per the title, sees us face enemy stage after stage in an infinite sequence until we find the game over, obviously trying to defeat as many as possible and share the results in the appropriate rankings of Xbox Live. The last option, the one most appreciated during our test, is that of customizing your own mech: it is possible to create and mix each of its parts, from the shape to the color up to the strengths and weaknesses. On the other hand, we do not like that access to certain objects is inextricably linked to the in-game purchase through a dedicated shop; an unforeseen outlay of money is therefore required, even if limited. Pacific Rim: The Videogame is a title worth 800 Microsoft points, or about ten euros, and the entire technical sector is affected by the fairly limited dedicated budget. The characters are drawn in a very meticulous way and with pleasant special effects, in contrast with the decidedly bare and not very incisive stages. Just as the soundtrack is not very memorable, composed of military march-style tunes, all similar to each other and never with a great personality. Pacific Rim: The Video Game is a mediocre title that reeks of a commercial operation aimed at riding the wave of the success of the film, as well as a missed opportunity to create something valid.
