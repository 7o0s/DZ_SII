Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a Nintendo Switch exclusive and considering its sales records it is probable that a large part of the users of the console in question have already made their entry into their own island paradise, but this still leaves a lot of room for any competitor who is located outside of that platform, especially if it also has something peculiar to bring to the table beyond the usual sum of the parts taken from the Nintendo blockbuster. It is clear that originality is not Cozy Grove's strong point, which we could define as ~derivative by design~, as it was conceived and developed precisely in response to Animal Crossing and perhaps even Stardew Valley, but the team still managed to instill a bit of soul and identity to this title, making it an alternative experience and not necessarily superimposable on the others. Cozy Grove takes us to a fascinating and mysterious island populated by cute ghosts It starts from the same premise: initially finding ourselves alone on an apparently uninhabited island, to gradually discover new inhabitants, expand the map and take care of it in many respects, just like in Nintendo's ~life simulation~. The biggest difference is given by the fact of being faced with a more structured game, which can represent a point in favor or not, depending on how you prefer to undertake the experience, but it is ultimately a characterizing and identifying element for Cozy grove. The protagonist of the story is a ~spook scout~, sent to the island to help the various ghosts that populate it: although the premise may seem gloomy, the style is extremely tender and facetious, even if there are more melancholy moments especially in the memories that each character carries with him. Beyond the crafting and customization of the island, the interaction with these spirits is the engine of the game, since each of these has tasks to be assigned to the protagonist, which once completed ensure shackles of the spirit with which to feed the hearth in the center of the map and an advancement in the ~story~, coloring portions of the island and increasing the knowledge and relationship with the various inhabitants. An island to heal and spirits to help By completing the various tasks we can color new portions of the island The mission of the protagonist, as a good spiritual scout, is to help the various animal ghosts that appear around the island, completing the assigned missions and making sure they can finally reach peace. You start from the base camp in the center of the map, where there is an omniscient (or almost) hearth capable of providing information and expanding the camp and the entire island if fed with ~spirit logs~, precious objects that can be conquered answering ghost requests. The progression is based more on this mechanism than on the accumulation of money, although this is also a central element in the gameplay, but Cozy Grove manages to pace the progress in the story and the evolution of the island by imposing pauses on the player : every day it is possible to carry out only a certain amount of quests valid for progression, then requesting to wait for the next day. This does not prevent us from dedicating ourselves to all the extra activities relating to the customization of the camp and the island, but imposes breaks which, if on the one hand they can be respectful of the players' time, on the other they can seem expedients to artificially lengthen longevity diluting it in a somewhat forced way. Giving the spirit shackles to the hearth of the base camp gives various progress in the game The quests proposed by the ghosts are almost always related to the recovery of particular objects scattered around the map or to the creation of new ones, therefore it is above all a question of exploring and finding hidden treasures, crafting objects or interacting with other NPCs to receive them or trigger the classic chains of exchange, but the fact of being able to unlock new story elements linked to memories and of being able to color various portions of the map provides a significant push to move forward, beyond the intrinsic repetitiveness of the game action. There is talk of a good 40 hours only with regard to these elements of the ~story~, therefore there is plenty of content also in this respect. For the rest, the other predominant factor of the gameplay are the alternative activities such as fishing and resource gathering and above all the pcustomization of the island, which goes through crafting. This is based on the discovery of projects (conquered through quests or received in various other ways), which can be implemented starting from the collection of raw or processed materials within the island and the processing on the appropriate bench, building new objects with which enrich the camp and the scenario in general. Always in line with Animal Crossing, it is also possible to reserve collected objects, fish and so on for a collection managed by a sailor spirit positioned on the beach, which in this sense assumes the role of the mythical Blathers of Animal Crossing. Among the alternative activities of Cozy Grove there is also fishing, clearly inspired by Animal Crossing Beyond the structural differences, it must be said that Cozy Grove manages to stand out with its own characterization thanks above all to the graphic style adopted. The graphics drawn in 2D are extremely rich and detailed, perhaps even too much, considering how often it is possible to confuse the elements of the scenario due to the quantity of objects present and due to the particular perspective adopted which forces to hide trees and structures in the foreground so not to block the view. You may or may not like it compared to the clean and essential style of the game that inspires it, but there is no doubt that Spry Fox has been able to infuse a remarkable identity into a title that is even so derivative thanks also to a great job done on the aesthetics, which is truly very particular.", "date": "2021-03-31", "grade": "8.0"}
