Among them we number series welcomed by critics and the public like Torchlight and The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing, which is about to be joined by the very latest effort by Haemimont Games, a Bulgarian software house known to most above all for the work conducted on the appreciated Tropic saga. Arrived on Steam in Early Access for a few months, Victor Vran has been constantly updated by his passionate developers, up to the final version just released on the Valve platform at a price of around 20 Euros. We had appreciated its peculiar characteristics since our previous tests, and now we can confirm that it is a very good product. Here because. Hunt for monsters with Victor Vran, the tormented new hero of Haemimont Games A cursed kingdom Victor Vran is the classic charismatic monster hunter with a dark past who has to face yet another demonic invasion, although the incipit and some plot twists leave room for twists and interesting solutions in the script. Everything revolves around the enigmatic Queen Katarina of Zagoravia, an imaginary kingdom set in a corrupt Victorian era that our hero will have to cross far and wide, going from rich and elegant neighborhoods to the most gloomy and remote areas, such as cemeteries, villages abandoned and old mines. Overall, the game world is made up of over forty maps, where some of them, much larger than the others, act as real ~hubs~, from which it is possible to reach the most dangerous dungeons. The story, in addition to the dialogues in the game, is told through simple well-designed but not particularly original and inspired artwork, although they carry out their task with dignity, even in light of the not exactly pharaonic budget. During the long main campaign, which can also be played in online cooperative up to a maximum of four players, it is necessary to often visit the Zagore Castle, a sort of headquarters where it is possible to interface with the other protagonists of the story, deposit the accumulated objects, make purchases and access the global map, which allows fast travel to previously visited dungeons. In the castle, once you have reached level 16 of experience, you can also try your hand at crafting, through the operation called ~Transmutation~. Despite being quite traditional in action RPG dynamics, Victor Vran also has a strong personality, for two main reasons. First of all, there are commands dedicated to jumping and dodging, which give the protagonist an unusual mobility useful both for wriggling out of the hottest situations and for reaching secret areas, using map rotation and leaping against walls. Secondly, we do not find the traditional skill tree, and the growth of the character is completely delegated to his equipment and the so-called ~Cards of Destiny~. Similar to the perk originally introduced in Call of Duty, these cards do nothing but equip Victor Vran with specific passive skills, such as higher vitality and armor, greater attack power for ranged and melee weapons and so on. To support the sinewy hero there are also the so-called Demonic Powers, which offer a vast package of particularly devastating and useful special skills; among them we find meteor showers to hurl on enemies, protective shields, columns of fire, shock waves and even a huge purple boomerang that does a lot of damage by hitting twice. The use of these powers is linked to the consumption of the so-called Rage bar (Overdrive), which is recharged by killing enemies, automatically or by performing critical hits based on the three types of clothing available, namely Hunter, Gentleman and Vigilante. We also recall the presence of slots to equip various objects, such as bombs and a series of potions with various effects, from restoring health to resetting the cooldown of skills. Victor Vran can equip two weapons at the same time and the arsenal is quite rich and varied; in fact we find war hammers, swords, scythes, shotguns, grenade launchers, ray rifles and so on, all to the advantage of the tactical approach to battle. Like any self-respecting action RPG, there are more or less powerful and rare weapons, which can be further enhanced through the simple crafting system adopted by Haemimont Games. The combat is very dynamic and requires a certain amount of strategy due to the attack patterns of the enemies, often committed to attacking en masse by combining their skills. In the game we find several bosses and there is no shortage of the so-called ~Champions~, whose defeat is sometimes linked to an interesting system of challenges which significantly increases the already excellent longevity of the title. In practice, five secondary missions are offered in each map dedicated, for example, to killing a certain number of enemies in a certain time interval or perhaps to using a specific weapon. To further increase the level of challenge, in addition to the two selectable difficulties after the prologue, we also find the so-called ~Hex Effects~, which allow you to obtain more experience by applying a series of advantages (buffs) to enemies and debuffs to the protagonist, consequently tightening the hardness of the fights. Victor Vran is perfectly playable both with the classic keyboard and mouse combination and with the joypad, although in certain circumstances it may happen that the character ~gets stuck~ in some element of the scenario. Whether you follow the plot or dedicate yourself to challenges, treasure hunting or the search for legendary equipment, the title developed by Haemimont Games is always fun and satisfying, whose only real stain is represented by a pinch of basic repetitiveness in the action, which however is intrinsic to the genre. Geralt of Zagoravia While not crying out for a miracle, Victor Vran offers a good technical profile thanks to clean graphics, the many details on the screen and the large number of advanced options, which make the work particularly scalable. The light and particle effects are good, while the animations are generally scholastic and sometimes woody, despite being adequate for an isometric action RPG. The level design is valid and is enhanced by the numerous settings to explore, ranging from urban areas, with an architecture clearly inspired by Eastern European styles, to the inevitable crypts full of skeletons, ghosts, giant spiders and amenities of the Slavic popular tradition . In this regard, the bestiary does not appear particularly inspired from the point of view of design, although as specified it offers good care for what concerns the variety of attack patterns. The audio sector is also good, with a nice surprise revealed at the last minute by the developers: Victor Vran's voice is in fact the same as Geralt of Rivia, or that of the forty-four-year-old American actor and voice actor Doug Cockle. The netcode is solid overall, and even if at the moment there are not many games to participate in, the online sector is well-finished and perfectly integrated with the main campaign. There are subtitles in Italian, added with a patch a few hours after launch.", "date": "2015-07-24", "grade": "8.2"}
