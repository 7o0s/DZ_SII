The first-person action of One More Level has always had a series of tricks up its sleeve that immediately made it interesting and engaging, aimed at finding the perfect game thanks to a continuous level of challenge and replayability - o at least these were the premises it seemed to offer. Now that we have been able to play it from start to finish, the excellent impressions expressed in the demo phase are confirmed but some edges are also added which at times hindered the experience: it remains a captivating debut title, well done overall and of the right duration, embellished with a narrative at the base of which our deeds revolve, however we do not deny that certain exaggeratedly frustrating phases have slowed down the continuity of the action by pushing for excessive live-die-repeat. So let's take a closer look at all the strengths and weaknesses of Ghostrunner in our review. History As anticipated, Ghostrunner enjoys a fairly simple but well integrated narrative sector with the gameplay, told mainly through the voice of its protagonists: in the role of the owner Ghostrunner, a cyber ninja who has no memory of who he is or what his job is, we will have to follow the Architect's directives after freeing him from his captivity. Thus we learn that humanity, already on the verge of collapse due to a global cataclysm that has decimated the entire population, survives inside the Dharma Tower, an immense tower that contains the last people left on the Earth and, through a system of social classes, regulates its life. Twenty years before the current events, the Architect was betrayed by his colleague and friend Mara, who killed him to take possession of the city and rule it with an iron fist. Our mission should have been to protect it but we failed, being defeated and thrown off the Dharma Tower: having survived the fall, we were recovered by a group of rebels known as the Climbers, repaired in some way and put back into action, before being contacted by the 'Architect and be led against Mara, now known as Keeper of the Keys, to bring justice. Being Ghostrunner, we can move both in reality and in the so-called cyber vacuum, from which we will operate to circumvent the limits of the physical world. The goal is, of course, to get to the top of the Dharma Tower and kill Mara while trying to find out more about the current situation. The gameplay Ghostrunner has always presented itself as an adrenaline-pumping first-person action game made up of parkour, dodging, slashing, bullet dodge and lots and lots of speed. As the protagonist gains self-awareness, his skills and possibilities for interaction both with the world around him and with enemies increase; to surprise us, positively, was the presence not only of additional techniques to make life easier but also of a real upgrade system that we can manage at will based on need. Called Subsystems Calibration Panel, it is made up of thirty-six square slots that can be filled with power-ups that we will unlock as we progress in the game, while four fixed blocks will act as an obstacle to our personal tetris. Although its presence is not to be considered essential to complete the adventure, there is no doubt that the quality of life suffers a lot in the positive and, above all, it is a mechanic that contributes to personalizing one's style of play . In fact, Ghostrunner will be able to rely not only on basic skills such as dash and deflection, but also on four special techniques that will help you both save time and come out clean from challenging conflicts. Defined Lightning, Storm, Tide and Supreme, each have a certain number of power-ups (different from each other in terms of effects and quantities) and expand the style of play, allowing the user to approach the situation as he prefers, but to be used they require concentration, therefore they cannot be exploited lightly: this it recharges over time or by killing enemies and is an element that, in turn, is linked to the Subsystems Calibration Panel since a section is dedicated to skills and how to best facilitate them. While I haven't used them often - more from being too busy figuring out what's going on around us to find the time to devise a strategy other than dodging and attacking - they're really useful and never left feeling like a trivial fillers put there just to give thickness to the gigoof. On the contrary, they manage to convey even more the idea of being in the body of someone superior to the normal human being and, in the end, it is a way to respond blow by blow to any attempt by Mara to stop us: both because the level design is often thought to be a combination of parkour and clashes, and because there are many enemies, different and well equipped. We go from the simple soldier to the one armed with a machine gun, equipped with a shield, cyber-enhanced to attack us hand to hand making inhuman leaps, armed with a katana so we don't even miss the parry... up to drones. There really is something for all tastes and we really appreciated the variety offered by the developers, both in terms of design and in the approaches to get out of every situation. Speaking of design, let's focus for a moment on the structure of the levels into which Ghostrunner is divided: first of all, there are more of them than we would have expected and from time to time they offer increasingly demanding challenges, combining different elements of the setting together to give life literally to last breath sequences, where you often act more by instinct than by planning - and it is then the heart of the game, although you can often take the time to look around. However, it must be said that, in some cases, we found the complexity of certain sections excessive, beyond the limits of the frustrating thanks to sometimes a certain imprecision in the hooks both in flight and in the run on the walls, and the checkpoints do not always come to our aid: there have been all too complex moments in which even a single mistake was enough to crash and have to start all over again. A boss fight specifically - because yes, Ghostrunner also includes these - it seemed decidedly more prohibitive than the others, even more so considering that it is the first and acts as a barrier, if not insurmountable, all too jarring on our nerves. The same criticism, albeit for different reasons, can be leveled at the sections in the cyber vacuum: they are key segments designed to let us obtain the much desired techniques but they are undoubtedly the least impactful part of the game, often tedious and, even in this case, developed in a too confusing and irritating way especially towards the end. Overall, they are the parts that we least preferred, in spite of an overall pleasant visual realization. Still in the aesthetic field, Ghostrunner has a visual impact and for better or worse tries to vary the settings as much as possible, only partially succeeding: some sections have presented themselves quite repetitive not so much in the performance, which always remains fresh and original even despite his frustrations, how much in the presentation. Having said that, for being the first work of a studio made up of just thirty-two people, its obvious merits cannot be denied: you breathe cyberpunk at every step, like being immersed in a Blade Runner video game and which for this very reason deserves to be thoroughly examined, taking due time before returning to our mission. The sense of decadence that Mara's tyranny has brought is well represented in a city now in disarray, at the mercy of its minions and where people do not want, or cannot, leave their homes for fear of never returning. There are even moments that we could define as horror, if only the adrenaline of the game allowed us: nevertheless, the developers did not miss the opportunity to dye the Dharma Tower with madness, making explicit the point of no return in which now there is the Keeper of the Keys. Technical compartment Ghostrunner runs smoothly at 60fps on PC, the minimum wage to fully enjoy its unbridled and adrenaline-pumping action, and has exceptional graphics also enhanced by ray tracing - unfortunately we were unable to verify it but its presence has been confirmed. In addition to being visually excellent, it presents a dubbing that we found spot on for all the characters (in particular the protagonist) but above all applause goes to the soundtrack: the Danish artist Daniel Alexandrovich - aka Daniel Deluxe - known for his compositions of electronic and retrowave music inspired by video games, horror films and old Japanese cartoons of the 80s and 90s, he took care of the music that accompanies us in our crazy ride, creating tracks that blend perfectly with the 'atmosphere. You may not notice it, busy evading bullets and grabbing that handhold at the last second, but if you take a few seconds to listen you'll discover a synth symphony that couldn't fit better. In short, except for some imperfections on the gameplay side, Ghostrunner is an experiencewhich must absolutely be lived but do not forget: it is above all a challenge against yourselves where you will be put to the very hardest test.", "date": "2020-10-26", "grade": "8.2"}
