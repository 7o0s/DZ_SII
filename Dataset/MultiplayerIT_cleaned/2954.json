{"name": "EA Sports UFC 4", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ea-sports-ufc-4-recensione.html", "text": "With the review of EA Sports UFC 4 we find ourselves telling the most classic of situations, that of a sports title that is improved but not revolutionized compared to the previous edition, however placing itself as an excellent starting point for those who want to get closer to the franchise. simulation produced by Electronic Arts could in fact already count on a very solid base and a fair amount of content, and the changes made to this new episode must be seen in the perspective of a general simplification of the controls which, however, does not sacrifice the thickness of matches. In fact, it somehow makes them more fun. Gameplay The most significant innovations of EA Sports UFC 4 concern the gameplay, which has been made substantially more immediate than in the previous episodes of the series. The goal that the developers have set themselves was in fact to simplify the execution of the numerous maneuvers available to us, so as to be able to even increase them, and to do this they have seen fit to include the time for pressing the buttons among the variables. new setting works very well and is very intuitive, but above all it allows you to drastically reduce the amount of commands that you need to memorize in order to access our fighter's entire repertoire. That's not all: the clinch has also been improved and made more dynamic, the submission holds have been rebalanced (with completely different controls, more in the WWE 2K style) and it has been decided to increase the animations during the ground and pound, thus multiplying the hits that can be performed. The final result is excellent and brings together two very important needs: on the one hand, as mentioned, to simplify certain mechanics that made the previous chapters woody in certain situations; on the other, preserving the strategic depth that characterizes each match, yielding very little from this point of view and indeed gaining in spectacularity thanks to the greater speed with which certain situations evolve. As per tradition, relating to the gameplay starting from the Career mode, which we will describe shortly, is very different compared to doing it through the fast modes, given that in the latter case we will be dealing with already mature, fast and powerful fighters, equipped with own style and well-defined set of strokes and moves. Microtransactions have also been introduced, but don't worry: they are used only for the purchase of cosmetic items. Career Mode Undoubtedly the core of the EA Sports UFC 4 experience, the Career mode is the one that welcomes us as soon as we launch the game, catapulting us into the atmosphere of the independent circuits, commanding an unknown fighter but determined to make a name for himself, earn a contract with the UFC and maybe, who knows, become a champion. Our character, created through an editor that allows you to quickly choose his appearance and his abilities, and then perhaps return later to refine everything, in fact starts from the bottom and is discovered by a coach looking for new talent, who decides to take him under his wing and progressively teach him new techniques to ensure that he can count on something different than simple willpower. The experiment is successful and the player can experience it firsthand, identifying himself with the avatar and retracing sequences such as those in the film Warrior... or perhaps in the comedy Colpi da Maestro, in which an overweight and middle-aged teacher tries to name in the world of mixed martial arts under the supervision of crazed ex-wrestler Bas Rutten. However, the narrative contaminations that can be found in the preliminary stages of Career mode run out quickly, giving way to a traditional structure characterized by a slow but exciting progression, in which every training session and every meeting turn into opportunities to improve the character by unlocking evolution points from spend to upgrade its strikes and physical abilities. There is an emphasis on the role of social networks, which fall within the methods of promoting matches and are also invoked when we decide to broadcast our sparring sessions live to trigger the curiosity of enthusiasts and ensure that they can follow our next match, then perhaps trying to win it clearly and quickly to impress them and gain fans. In hindsight, there is nothing revolutionary in the main mode of EA Sports UFC 4 and the novelties ultimately boil down to tricks, but the substance is absolutely there and so are the facets of a system that weaves rivalries and alliances, friendships and provocations, giving us the possibilityto make choices and therefore to shape our path as we see fit. The other contents EA Sports UFC 4 boasts a large amount of content, designed for both single player and competitive multiplayer. By selecting the ~fight now~ item from the main screen, you access three different modes: Fight Now, in fact, which is the classic quick match and is also available in a customizable variant; Stand Up and Strike, which does away with grappling and ground fighting in favor of fast, spectacular rallies; and Knockout Mode, basically an arcade interpretation that refers to the film Without Holds Barred and immediately proves to be very fun: a nice way to mix up the cards of the experience a bit. There are also two training modes (practice and tutorial), as well as customizable events and tournaments: a rather complete set. As for the online, you can try your hand at the World Championships and therefore with challenges classified on the basis of a global leaderboard; with Blitz Battles, which change rules and modifiers from time to time to increase the variety of matches; and finally participate in a Quick Encounter by relying on matchmaking or by inviting a friend to be able to fight in the more traditional way. Well, during our tests we found solid netcode, fast associations and virtually no latency episodes - which was comforting considering the amount of beatings we took from almost everyone. The available roster counts something like fifty athletes divided by gender and weight category, with a quick selection of the most important wrestlers of the moment as well as stars of the recent past such as Conor McGregor, Ronda Rousey and Jon Jones: even from this point of view there is no can complain. Playstation 4 trophies There are twenty-eight Trophies that can be unlocked in EA Sports UFC 4: less than usual, but to obtain them you have to dissect the experience not only by performing a series of actions for the first time, but also by achieving specific objectives and not always within reach, such as becoming GOAT, defend the belt twelve times in his career and so on. Technical realization There have been some refinements, some modifications in the shots and the effects are in some ways different, giving the athletes' skin a more realistic appearance, if we want, but in general the technical realization of EA Sports UFC 4 appears perfectly in line with the previous episode. The bulk of the work has been done on a few new movements and in terms of glance there is no revolution. It is not necessarily a bad thing, mind you: although some visual aspects of the series can be improved, the rendering of the action in general is good and above all a more precise correspondence between input and animations has been introduced which is reflected in the gameplay mechanics. The signed soundtrack is nice, even if the bulk of the songs included in the package do not exactly correspond to our tastes, while the commentary in English is confirmed as functional to the experience.", "date": "2020-08-18", "grade": "8.0"}
