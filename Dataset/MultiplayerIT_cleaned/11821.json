{"name": "Pop Superstar", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pop-superstar.html", "text": "Just like in the previous Miami Nights, also in Pop Superstar you start with the phase of creating your own digital alter-ego: in addition to conventional factors such as the color of your hair or clothing, you can also choose the musical genre you belong to, which it will be reflected in the final look. The actual game instead begins with the protagonist's dreams of celebrity, interrupted by a rude awakening (also already seen in Miami Nights) by an eccentric mother figure who will also act as a tutor. From here begins a sort of ~social adventure~, in which the user will be engaged in interacting in various ways with objects and NPCs in order to obtain psycho-physical benefits from the former and attention and friendships from the latter. Exactly, like in Miami Nights. If you hadn't understood yet, the two Gameloft productions initially resemble each other in a truly embarrassing way, but the danger of a sort of internal plagiarism is fortunately foiled by a whole series of characteristics that finally manage to distinguish Pop Superstar from its ideal prequel. Starting from the graphics, of decidedly higher quality in relation to the ten months that elapsed between one title and another: Pop Superstar therefore shows off a two-dimensional cosmetics framed by an isometric view, very colorful and detailed like few others, whose flower the cap, however, is represented by the animations of the various characters, extremely varied and often quite funny. Another distinctive element is clearly represented by the purpose of the adventure: the declared objective of the protagonist is to participate in the auditions of the Pop Superstar singing program, win the competition and thus achieve worldwide fame. However, the road to success is long and tortuous, and our hero will initially be forced to perform decidedly menial tasks in order to build himself a small fan base, such as updating his MeandmyLife (the MySpace of the Pop Superstar world), making jobs to earn a few dollars and challenge street artists in improvised competitions. Similar events are often proposed to the player in the form of minigames, not always very successful but still capable of breaking the actually somewhat bland rhythm of the adventure. In fact, on a strictly playful level, it certainly cannot be said that the Gameloft product is particularly compelling: all you do is go through scenarios and interact with objects and people using a special menu, a habit that tends to lose its edge very soon . The commendable variety of the situations proposed and the tasty sense of humor that pervades most of the cutscenes and dialogues, however, compensate for a large part of this shortcoming, prompting the user to continue in the rather frequent moments of tiredness. PRO Excellent graphic design Great variety of scenarios and events Quite long-lived AGAINST Very slow pace of play Limited gameplay It risks becoming repetitive soon", "date": "2007-11-16", "grade": "S.V."}
