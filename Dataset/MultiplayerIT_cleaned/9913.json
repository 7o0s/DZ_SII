Published in 2000 by Hans im Glck, it takes its name from a French town famous for the fortifications built by the Romans in 100 BC. which are still part of the defensive walls. The mechanics of the board game are quite simple and easily approachable: it is basically a matter of placing tiles in turn on the table, in a sort of domino. The tiles show the representation of roads, fields and parts of the fortified city and must be laid so as to be compatible with those already on the ground to form entire geographies. Each player can then choose to place their ~followers~ on the tiles, again in turn, i.e. puppets that will help us accumulate points at the end of the game, ~marking~ areas that will be worth as much as their state of construction. This, in very brief substance, is the core of the game which, however, in its various versions has introduced rules that have significantly increased the degree of complexity, while leaving the players, as always, the freedom to write their own. What is the most beautiful tile in the realm? The iPhone version of the game appears extremely simple to play, with really elementary rules to master, even simpler than those of the original base game which, for example, saw the pawn assume different roles with respect to where it was placed, becoming a knight in the city, a farmer in the field and so on, with reflections in their possibility of reuse. Scoring for elements contested by multiple players also appears simplified. The game thus becomes rather immediate and easily approachable for anyone. The normal mode which is also the central one of the game allows us to choose whether to play against opponents managed by artificial intelligence or against other players, whether they are random or in our contact list, up to a maximum of four participants per game. We have 71 tiles available, to be placed on the table in turn and 7 followers per player. The skill obviously lies in being able to put followers on roads, fields or cities that we can then somehow complete, guaranteeing us a higher score and the reuse of the servant. Of course, when possible, it helps to place our tiles in a way that makes it more difficult to complete the area that our opponents have marked with their minions and for this purpose, roads are always great allies. The graphics of the game appear clean and very easy to read on the screen of Apple devices and the soundtrack is pleasant and entertaining. The touch screen does its job very well and does not create any difficulty in positioning the tiles and in their orientation on the game table. Furthermore, in addition to the classic mode, a single player variant has been added which challenges the player in the construction, with the usual 71 tiles, of a world in which all the roads and cities are perfectly connected and completed. It is a puzzle, in fact, which appears anything but simple and adds considerable longevity to the title. At the moment the version of the game available includes the base set although it seems that expansions may be released as DLC in the future. An iPad version is also expected in the next few months, which can be downloaded free of charge by those who have purchased the iPhone/iPod Touch version. The tested version is 1.1 Apple Store Links", "date": "2010-07-09", "grade": "8.2"}
