{"name": "Build-a-lot", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/build-a-lot_a.html", "text": "Crisis or no crisis, there are always those who manage to make a lot of money by investing in real estate: the years go by and house prices rise more and more, so even just buying and reselling houses turns into a very profitable profession. The famous wrestler Mark Calaway, aka ~The Undertaker~, knows something about it, who between one meeting and another is dedicated to buying and selling houses and it seems that it is literally making him a fortune. If negotiating with such an imposing and menacing-looking guy is probably not easy, it is also true that the real estate market is full of ~normal~ entrepreneurs who, despite not being able to count on such great physicality, manage to conclude excellent deals and have the ability to reawaken the economy of cities otherwise little considered. Build-a-lot, the new title developed by HipSoft for Glu, puts us in the shoes of an entrepreneur who goes from one city to another and has to build houses and buildings according to the instructions of the mayor on duty. The game's startup screen allows us to try our hand at the ~career~ mode or the ~occasional~ mode (which is unlocked after completing a certain number of stages), and the first which represents the most substantial part of the Glu product. In fact, we will have to face more than thirty internships distributed within various cities, with the difficulty that grows hand in hand with our skills. From time to time we will have to deal with a mayor who will ask us to complete simple missions, in this case building a certain number of houses, earning a certain amount of money or renovating the buildings up to raise the value of their rents. Everything takes place through a very simple interface, with a pointer that is controlled via the d-pad and which, by pressing the 5 key (or the * key), opens a menu divided into four parts: one relating to construction, sales and the destruction of buildings; one that concerns the purchase of materials; one that allows us to hire new workers to speed up operations; and one, finally, which shows us the level of available money, the increase of which is represented by a bar which rises more or less rapidly according to the number and extent of the rents we are collecting. The first part of the menu is the most multifaceted, since we will be able to select the type of building to build (the various types are unlocked as the internships are completed) but also renovate an existing one three times (increasing its value) or put it on sale. The resale of houses, as in reality, represents in Build-a-lot an easy way to increase your nest egg quickly, perhaps because you need to build many buildings and you need to have some liquidity. The construction phases take place as in any real-time strategy game, so we will see our house born from nothing and completed in seconds. Turning to the technical aspect, it must be said that the developers have done a great job. This kind of product never boasts spectacular graphics and we are certainly not dealing with an exception, but we can see the care that has been placed in the construction phases of the buildings. Furthermore, the interface is always very clear and legible. Navigation within the menus is intuitive and fast despite using the d-pad and not a mouse, and the only price to pay is represented by loading times that are a little longer than the average for mobile games. Too bad for the anonymous sound. PRO Original and fun Great interface Good number of internships AGAINST The mouse is missing Sometimes slow and repetitive action Anonymous sound", "date": "2009-02-27", "grade": "S.V."}
