Available on Steam Early Access since June, the game was in fact strongly desired on PlayStation 4, so much so that the authors were able to use a free development kit and received all the necessary support to complete the conversion in the best way. The first impact with this curious MOBA-style multiplayer shooter is a bit rough, in the sense that there is no accompanying plot or tutorial, you are simply thrown into the action and you have to learn on the field how the gameplay works, which differences there are between the characters and what you have to do in the available modes. The small number of options actually makes it quite simple to get an idea of the product, but then facets take over that at first it is not possible to grasp, to the full advantage of the depth and an interest that can last for more than a handful of hours. In Secret Ponchos you shoot, of course, but not like in a normal twin analog shooter: each character projects a shadow and in the same way the pointer of the weapon (which we control using the right analog stick) marks the trajectory and range of action of the our attack. However, in order for the shot to be successful, it is necessary to actually ~aim~, i.e. press the trigger taking into consideration the distances and the inclination of the view. It is a device capable of guaranteeing the necessary complexity in order not to trivialize the experience, even if in some cases it goes wrong with the frenzy of certain situations, with the risk of making us often shoot empty. The Magnificent Five The Secret Ponchos roster is made up of five different characters: The Killer is an elderly but infallible hit man, equipped with a six-shot revolver and a throwing knife, he represents the most balanced choice of the lot; The Matador, as her name suggests, is an expert in bullfighting and swashbuckling, making her a lethal opponent but only from close range; Kid Red is a young outlaw armed with two pistols, capable of firing shots in rapid succession and throwing sticks of dynamite to inflict massive damage on enemies; The Deserter is a big guy, the ~tank~ of the situation, who wields a powerful rifle and knows how to resist the attacks of his opponents, also thanks to the supplied medical kit; Finally, Phantom Poncho is a mysterious warrior who hides his identity behind a disturbing skull mask, and can strike with a shotgun and a whip. As mentioned, each fighter has two weapons and two or three attack combinations for each of them, to be activated using the R1 and R2 back keys. In the lower part of the screen, under the vital energy bar, there is also an indicator that marks the rapid dodges that we can perform, which recharge over time and constitute a maneuver of fundamental importance to increase the distance between us and our eventual pursuer, or to reach a potential victim more quickly. Already after a few games this type of system takes on precise connotations, given that all the characters have strengths and weaknesses. Through a growth system, however, it is possible to improve their characteristics, spending the experience points earned to increase the ability to inflict damage, regeneration of stamina, speed, rate of fire and health. This progression works in watertight compartments, in the sense that it is separate for each character and therefore pushes you to play a lot of games with each of them to pursue their growth, to the benefit of longevity. Secret Ponchos is an original and fun arena shooter, albeit poor in terms of modes Playstation 4 trophies The thirteen Secret Ponchos Trophies are obtained mainly with constancy, given that many of them concern the degree of progression achieved, the number of kills made and the total number of matches won. There are, however, a couple of slightly more complex achievements, such as the one that requires not taking damage in ten one-on-one duels. Shooting in the sand If the cast of Secret Ponchos can count on a certain degree of variety and an undoubted balance, unfortunately the same cannot be said of the available modes. The choice to reduce the number goes hand in hand with the desire to never miss participants, and the relatively fast matchmaking testifies to it, especially for unranked matches. However, the almost zero differences between deathmatch, free-for-all and domination (questhe last with the simple variant of the number of kills, you have to do five more to win) make the experience inevitably repetitive, with perplexity peaks when you try your hand at one-on-one duels, really too limited and devoid of biting in order to be a valid alternative to group matches. The four maps currently present are characterized by different dimensions, but all manage to offer a good mix between shelters and open field, giving us the possibility to avoid direct clashes if we have little energy. The peculiarities of the characters are therefore mixed with those of the maps, adding a very pleasant strategic substrate, which makes the difference in the medium term. And then there's the technical sector, which is not surprising for its numbers or for a sound accompaniment that we found a bit repetitive and devoid of high notes, but which has style to spare. In fact, Secret Ponchos boasts an excellent design for its protagonists (who also have an extra skin, albeit only for a fee), angular for a precise stylistic choice, really beautiful to look at. The same goes only partially for the scenarios, which use interesting solutions (the shot from a distance which includes objects placed higher up, which however disappear when necessary - except in some problematic cases).", "date": "2014-12-19", "grade": "7.0"}
