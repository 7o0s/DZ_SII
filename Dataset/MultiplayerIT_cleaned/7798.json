And the success was such as to justify a new foray into the multiplayer tactical FPS genre with a product based on the good work done to date. Rising Storm, a hybrid between a new multiplayer chapter and a stand-alone expansion, takes us into the midst of the great battles of the Pacific. A distant front, the one disputed between the Yankees and the Japanese, which has not touched us like the clash that took place in Europe, but which hosted some of the most impressive battles of the Second World War. The spirit of Japan against that of the United States, pressed against each other until the final explosion sadly consumed the people of Nagasaki. Wonders of the Pacific Rising Storm evokes the atmospheres of wide-ranging titles such as Medal of Honor: Allied Assault by translating everything into a multiplayer context made up of objectives, positions and large fronts to be broken. The formula is that of Red Orchestra 2 and does not have the breadth of Iron Front Liberation 1944, but aims to create a more structured and close experience with the classic objective modes that are the most popular in the field of military FPS. The result is a sort of cross between Enemy Territory and Battlefield with the implementation of all the typical options of modern shooters and with large maps, full of buildings and objectives to defend and attack, which can be fought in an action key, with soldiers more resistant to blows, or in a simulation key, with an extreme mortality rate. The scenarios that make up the front in which we find ourselves engaged are six, but four more will arrive after the launch. They range from fortified coasts, with strings of bunkers to be conquered, to small villages, where throngs of Japanese soldiers are waiting for the American invader to take the wrong step. All interspersed with large expanses of sand, with patches of florid vegetation and illuminated by a decidedly hotter sun than that of the western front. Colors and texture of the shadows, combined with good quality post-processing effects, give Rising Storm a convincing look enriched by appreciable details such as the dynamic shadows of the clouds and the deformation of the viewfinder lens. However, this is not a ~jaw-breaking~ title and for this reason the sound effects, the complex towns, the credible vegetation, the numerous animations and the good management of the focus that balance most of the shortcomings in terms of quality stand out of textures. And the maps are also rich in detail from the point of view of design with dozens of positions to defend, trenches, swamps, bridges, height differences and structures of all kinds. A decidedly high level of detail that generates a large number of different situations and for this reason it is not only functional to the aesthetic sector but also to the playful one. The final result, even if as we have anticipated many textures do not shine in quality, is decidedly pleasant and is more than enough to give life to credible and compelling battles. Breathing is everything Much of the charm of Rising Storm is linked to the historical context with great landings underlined by suggestive soundtracks, in a mix that enhances simulation-style matches. Companions fall around us like flies and our own death comes suddenly, without giving us time to react. But the atmosphere and the mechanics dampen the potential frustration as the sudden end does not depend on futuristic all-seeing devices, but on the luck or skill of a soldier who can rely solely on the mechanics of his weapon, on the calculation of the physics of the projectiles , on a Spartan viewfinder and on one's own peace of mind. In fact, breathing can be controlled at any time with the appropriate key which also activates a slight zoom. In this way the feature does not have a function limited to precision shots but also becomes relevant during the slow exploration of buildings potentially occupied by enemies. Breath, however, is always important regardless of our soldier's ability to hold it. In fact, this has a regular cadence that makes it possible to shoot in the juncture that separates exhalation and inspiration, without having to hold your breath. In this way the first shot fired from a sniper rifle can be detonated calmly, reserving breath control quite naturally for the most agitated situations. The second peculiarity provides for the display, through a transparent indicator, of the generic area where the weapon we are shooting with will strike and this inThe addition, which allows you to aim without having to lift the weapon, is very useful both in agitated situations, which are not few, and in the event that an enemy appears at close range while we are holding a rifle. In some cases, however, given the lethality of the blows, the only possible option is to find refuge behind cover hoping that the front will move or in any case that the comrades will be able to divert attention from our position. Unfortunately, human players don't always resort to cooperation, even if the Rising Storm formula, which includes a useful integrated voice chat, rewards and enhances this approach in an incredible world. But in the most desperate cases there is still a resource, at least when the enemy is at close range. We are talking about blind fire, often superfluous in those titles in which the soldiers have many life points, which becomes an option not to be underestimated when a single hit can make the difference between living and dying. Beta Rising Storm also includes bots that can fill the spots left by players by filling the maps with those 64 players which makes it more believable. Unfortunately the artificial intelligence does not shine and does not distinguish itself from that of dated titles such as Battlefield Vietnam. Sometimes the bots riddle us with bullets as guided by a single hive mind, other times they look at us dazed waiting for an inevitable end. For this reason it is always preferable to choose full servers, also given the breadth of the maps, with any bots and related shortcomings reduced to a minimum. However, this is not the only problem left from the beta even if most of the visual defects have been fixed in the final release. In any case, taking for granted the arrival of substantial Tripwire-style patches, we are faced with an interesting title that cleverly mixes simulation and fast pace, in a credible context. The relative precision of the weapons leaves room for the imagination by preventing a single man from massacring the enemy and the high mortality, especially in the simulation mode, makes a too light-hearted approach inadvisable by enhancing the tactical side of the title. Side that is also exacerbated by another element of the gameplay. In fact, to enrich the variety of the action, the developers have decided to attribute some peculiarities to the two sides, while keeping an eye on the balance. The Japanese, for example, can charge with the Katana, becoming immune to suppression for a few seconds thanks to their warrior spirit and indomitable imperial inspiration. Obviously it is not always the case to charge, especially in simulation games, and when the front becomes impenetrable, the small and lethal mortars supplied to the Japanese defenders become very useful as they can also use the tool as a grenade launcher or transform explosive ammunition in improvised mines. But the most devastating weapon is in the hands of American soldiers and allows you to clean up a bunker in seconds. We are talking about the flamethrower, a terrible and powerful but at the same time rather balanced tool. In fact, the wearer finds himself extremely slowed down in movement and with only 7 seconds of fire available before the reload phase which exposes the soldier to enemy return fire. In these situations, in the most balanced and populated games, it happens that many soldiers concentrate on the same key point, giving life to close battles for the conquest of a bunker or a building. Clashes that allow greater freedom than that of an Enemy Territory, but which at the same time enhance the importance of the front as a tool to centralize the action and increase the tactical tenor of a game.
