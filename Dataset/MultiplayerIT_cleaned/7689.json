The coupling of feudal Japan and Devolver Digital was sufficient for many to keep the antennas up and we have now arrived at the moment of the final judgement. We played (and replayed) this little gem to better tell you about it in this Trek to Yomi review. Despite some obvious and inevitable production limitations, Leonard Menchiari and the Flying Wild Hogs have managed to showcase their passion and attention to a culture that is as particular as it is fascinating. Walking around the Yomi Trek to Yomi: truly suggestive views Trek to Yomi makes the narrative component its greatest pride, not so much for the complexity of a plot that looks quite simple and banal, but for its ability to respect and honor the stories from which it takes shape and inspiration. Just a few days ago we had the opportunity to have a virtual chat with the game designer of the game. We advise you to go and retrieve the interview dedicated to Leonard Menchiari, certainly important for understanding some dynamics in the development process. In short, the story puts us in the shoes of a man, raised and trained by his mentor who, out of the blue, finds himself having to put his youth aside to face the invaders of his own people. In fact, the brigands are tearing apart the peaceful inhabitants of some villages. Everything goes for the worst and the protagonist finds himself dead, trapped in this nature of the eternal damned destined to dig into his own personal and sentimental ghosts, so as to finally understand what happened to his own people and his presumed loved one. Classicone, as already mentioned, with the desire to draw from the great tradition of Japanese cinema of the 50s and 60s. It is in fact here that all the aesthetics are based and also to a large extent the choices that will lead to clear and marked gameplay dynamics. Everything about Trek to Yomi focuses on the hero, his journey and his responsibilities, without forgetting the choices, which can change the entire vision of the story. The four or five hours needed to finish the game turn out to be the right ones, without going to exaggerate and dilute the experience more than necessary. However, it is precisely in the aforementioned choices that a first particular short circuit of Trek to Yomi is generated. The choice to include multiple endings and important personal choices should consequently generate the will to try to understand how it could have gone. The ~What If~ effect in Trek to Yomi, on the other hand, is not very effective. Also due to the impossibility of replaying the individual chapters, but forced each time to start over from the beginning. To tell the truth, it was revealed to us during our interview that the choices are there precisely to allow us to direct our journey towards the path we prefer. All this without necessarily inducing the player to relive all the different possibilities. As far as the intention can be understood, there is no doubt that more could have been done to better manage this crucial aspect. Clash of honor Trek to Yomi: 3D exploration when you're not fighting for your life Trek to Yomi is undoubtedly a work that tries to overcome the barriers of its production value. While self-aware and clever in avoiding overdoing it, Menchiari's game is also damn inspired. Trying to better frame the experience, one could say that Trek to Yomi is a scrolling action adventure, which mixes three-dimensional backdrops with a hybrid progression. The combat phases alternate with others of pure exploration, all seamless . When fighting, the camera freezes, perspective fakes, and movement becomes purely horizontal. When, on the other hand, you sheath your katana, the environments become freely explorable and this generates both variety and estrangement. The collectibles think about pushing this aspect even further. Very beautiful in the realization and in the texts that accompany them, capable of deepening Japanese culture and mythology, they often require to be recovered in alternative ways which, however, are not always easy to identify. This doesn't represent a problem in itself, but when you choose a road that seems to be the right way to continue and you find yourself stuck a few meters ahead without being able to go back then you turn up your nose, for obvious reasons. And this is where the schizophrenia generated by the impossibility of reliving the individual chapters returns, especially considering the division of the collectibles into pages dedicated to the various portions of the adventure. Trek toYomi: honor and respect Obviously Trek to Yomi is also combat, not just with white weapons, and this is where he tries to show his cards. The whole game is based on the idea of one-on-one (or almost) confrontation. When opponents meet, they position themselves in front of us or behind us, setting in motion a dance that loudly recalls fencing and its ~two-dimensional~ development. Even when the opponents appear in groups, the game tends to keep them in the background, almost as if they were spectators, waiting for one of the two positions to be empty again after the death of one of the enemies. Parry and counterattack: a technique that in Trek to Yoki takes on a double value, also given the presence of a stamina and the speed with which it is possible to capitulate. The team's desire to make the clashes brutal and fast is also found in the variants of opponents that it is possible to meet. At least until you get to the final stages, when alongside the simple brigands who move within a couple of blows, more resistant and aggressive versions or real elements from the afterlife are added. To try to generate a sense of depth, albeit without really succeeding to the end, the skills and the unlocking of some new combos take care of it, which can be recovered in the form of scrolls. Whether it's the katana, the bow or a sort of arquebus, everything in Trek to Yoki remains at the continuous service of narration and staging, sacrificing the playful part here and there in order to give value to the journey. All legitimate, albeit plagued by some small command response problems, which have sometimes left us helpless, but which we hope can be resolved with a few patches. The bosses take care of closing the content package, the only enemies to have their own stamina bar. health and which are also present in a good number, without however almost never representing a real threat. If we really wanted to be picky, we didn't understand why to insert an additional difficulty that allows you to kill and be killed in a single hit, however leaving the bosses out of this dynamic, almost completely losing the balance of the experience. Technique and style Trek to Yomi: Yomi is a particular distorted view of reality Trek to Yomi is an independent product and as such attempts, in our opinion, to overcome the technical limits with a delightful research and stylistic code. Forget large polygonal models or triple A motion capture, but the fact remains that the work of the Flying Wild Hog is an expressive jewel. The architectures, the backdrops, the attention to detail and the soundtrack ooze passion from every pore, amusing the palate of Japanese culture enthusiasts. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for what concerns the care in the texts and dialogues, which, although they also follow the stylistic features of the genre, fail to really leave their mark. It is precisely here that all of Trek to Yomi's reality itself is played out, for better or for worse. What works always goes hand in hand with some less successful and inspired element, finally generating a minimum of regret for a small rough gem that fails to turn into a diamond.", "date": "2022-05-05", "grade": "7.5"}
