We started off with encouraging sufficiency despite the doubts that hovered like crows around the screen. But Assembly Required, the second episode of Minecraft: Story Mode, made us lose hope. Perhaps it will recover, perhaps not, but for the moment we can only advise you to stay away from what appears to be a sinister marketing operation to pocket easy money thanks to the appeal of Minecraft. However, duty requires us to tell you what happens in this very short episode, so let's go back to Jesse's adventure, committed to gathering the group of heroes known as the Order of the Stone. In the previous episode we had to make only one significant decision (at least from the perspective of a protagonist that we imagine is still a teenager) and that is which of our friends to follow on a mission. Clearly the excluded one would have been disappointed. Since one of the two friends has a single eyelash that looks like an XL version of Elio, we chose to start with the other, a fearful little girl with nice afro braids. This choice led us in episode two to hunt down Ellegaard instead of Magnus. Unfortunately, even if you decide to make the opposite choice, the result will always be the same, because at the end of the episode the whole group is reunited. Our decision affected the story less than anything. There's a passage where Magnus asks us why we chose to go on the mission with our friend, and we told him that we just went with it. Magnus understood the depth of our decision and that was it. Now, it's okay to keep it light-hearted, but this is school trip level. And that negates that little emotional investment in Jesse that we were able to make in the first episode. On the other hand, it is significant that Assembly Required came out weeks rather than months after the debut chapter. The haste in publication is reflected in the haste with which the story rushes forward, as if it had to reach as soon as possible a narrative junction that cannot wait. Unfortunately it ends without any surprises, and any curiosity about how Jesse's story could continue collapses miserably under a pile of pixelated cubes. Assembly Required raises suspicions that Minecraft: Story Mode is only about making easy money A nice promo for Minecraft Ellegaard's story is very similar to that seen in the first episode, when the adventure introduced Jesse and his friends. Once again we find ourselves caught up in a building contest, and that in itself is a sign that the effort put into this game has been minimal. To make the situation worse is the absence of those nice gags that had given the first chapter a bit of panache. The feat to be done to talk to Ellegaard is in itself silly, solvable in a couple of clicks. The decisions to be made contain no thorns and the dialogues are even more boring than the timed events thrown here and there throughout the story. Almost always the game saves us anyway, so we could also avoid making the effort to press the required keys. Only two things shine in Assembly Required. The first is voice acting, music in the player's ears. Sadly with no decent lines of dialogue, the great performances only make us suffer from the wasted talent of the actors involved. The second point in favor of the game are the fascinating constructions made with the Minecraft graphics engine. The good news is that you can make even more beautiful ones yourself with Minecraft.
