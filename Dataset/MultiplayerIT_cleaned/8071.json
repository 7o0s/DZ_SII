{"name": "Un tocco orchestrato", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/112767-symphonica-un-tocco-orchestrato.html", "text": "Despite a soundtrack composed by exceptional names, such as Yoko Shimomura and Keiichi Okabe, the first collaboration between Square-Enix and iNiS turned out to be half a hole in the water. Between questionable design choices and an overly intrusive in-app purchase system, with Demons' Score the authors of Gitaroo Man and Elite Beat Agent have bungled a hybrid between rhythm game and rail shooter that has never conquered iOS users. Symphonica, on the other hand, is proposed as a decidedly less experimental musical game, both in terms of the selection of songs and the mechanics, but which through a solid structure and enormously simplified gameplay is able to conquer anyone who loves classical music. Music master! One of the few things in common between Demons' Score and Symphonica is the presence of a narrative component that gives the player a sense of progression and allows him, level after level, to unlock new content and access unreleased songs. In this case the plot is dotted with clichs of Japanese origin: in fact, you take on the role of Takt, an aspiring conductor who wants to follow in the footsteps of his older brother and become the best in the world. To do this he decides to bring together the members of a talented orchestra and participate in a series of exams, but between haunted dolls, conspiracies and mysterious prophecies, the story of Symphonica takes a particularly strange and not always sensible direction. The need to carry on the narrative highlights what is probably the least appreciable aspect of the game: the various challenges are interspersed with full-bodied dialogues between the characters, and despite some successful jokes and a handful of pleasant artwork, the temptation remains strong to skip all cutscenes to go directly to the next song. However, it is only when the baton touches the music stand twice and the music begins that Symphonica finally comes alive. As per the tradition of iNiS games, in each level you have to follow directions by tapping or rubbing to the rhythm of the music, but unlike Elite Beat Agents and Demons' Score, where you chased icons around the screen, in this case the game is much less hectic and simpler. Similar to Theatrhythm Final Fantasy, all indicators scroll in a single horizontal line until they reach a hotspot, but inputs can be entered anywhere on the screen, making for a much more comfortable and effortless experience. The development team has done an absolutely brilliant job of helping the player feel like a conductor, with the hand moving across the touch screen, creating arcs and diagonals. Predictably the selection of some of the most famous pieces of classical music has helped a lot, and even those who are not a fan of the genre can immediately enjoy the more familiar pieces. From the powerful and dramatic notes of Dvorak's From the New World to Tchaikovsky's timeless Waltz of the Flowers, passing through cheerful marches and slower themes, the well-tested game mechanics adapt perfectly to each song, even if giving the best with the music more lively and dynamic. As you progress in the story mode, new music is unlocked to play freely at any time, and through a system of experience points and votes you can access further compositions and higher levels of difficulty. In addition, each song can be listened to in a sort of media player that allows you to create a playlist or a music loop. Again the influence of Square-Enix is evident in the free-to-play model adopted for the game, although it is far more permissive and acceptable than that of Demons' Score: players can try a couple of chapters for free and decide whether to buy all the remaining ones or only a part; through the Story mode you can get to unlock about twenty music, but to get all the missing ones you need to resort to two other packages that can be purchased separately. The total expense is decidedly higher than the average for iOS games, but for those who love orchestral music Symphonica is undoubtedly one of the most successful gaming experiences among those published so far on the App Store.", "date": "2013-01-02", "grade": "8.0"}
