{"name": "Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic_e.html", "text": "The Genesis In the mid-2000s, Lucas Arts (a subsidiary of Lucas Films) decided to develop a role-playing game based on the world of Star Wars. Instead of developing it internally, Lucas Arts decided to propose the project to one of the most famous and awarded RPG developers on the square: Bioware. Bioware welcomed the idea with great enthusiasm, many things played in favor of that union, first of all the great appeal that Star Wars has on video game enthusiasts, then the experience gained by the Canadian software house in creating RPGs based on the d20 ruleset and finally the great freedom granted by Lucas Arts in the choices of plot and historiographical implementations. Freedom that immediately materializes in the possibility for Bioware to choose when to set the story of the game between various temporal eras proposed by Lucas Arts. The choice fell on the temporal era which ensured greater plot autonomy as well as having a sure evocative appeal: the war between the Sith and the Republic in the remote past of the Star Wars galaxy, or 4000 years before the events narrated in the two film trilogies. Once upon a time in a distant galaxy John Williams' unforgettable melodies resound powerfully in the surround sound while the golden words on a black background begin to flow on the video, which have become the classic incipit of any film set in Star Wars. At the end of the introduction, the camera rotates slowly to frame a planet against the background of a spaceship which is slowly approaching treacherously attacked by alien fighters. Immediately one would expect to recognize the immortal Tie-Fighters, one unconsciously sits comfortably in the chair almost about to see one of the 5 Star Wars films released so far, but this is not the case. Yes, because Star Wars: Knights of the old Republic (Kotor from now on) is not a film, it is the admirable result of the effort of a great producer and a great developer to give the viewer, now as an active player, a unique and unforgettable experience set in the Star Wars galaxy. RPG? In our three-part preview and coverage of Kotor we talked extensively about the story, the graphics engine, the interface and much more. In this review we will draw the strings of the whole discussion focusing above all on the most abstract and elusive concept of each game, namely playability. To do this we have to define what a role-playing game is in order to explain why Kotor falls into this category to all intents and purposes and why it represents sui generis one of the most interesting exponents of the entire genre. RPG means role-playing game, or a category of games where the player assumes a role and through this lives the adventures proposed in the proposed setting. Thus said, Max Payne could also fall into the category, since what really distinguishes an RPG from any other game is that the role is not predetermined by the developer, but rather is created by the player himself. In fact, every self-respecting RPG initially has a character creation phase where, right from the start, the player can forge his favorite avatar. Once this phase is over, the player assumes the chosen role to experience the adventures proposed through that role, with actions, facts and words that reflect acting according to the chosen role. To give an overused example, if a paladin is created in a role-playing game with Dungeons&Dragons as a set of rules then the player will have to behave like a paladin, he will have to save the helpless, not lie, not steal etc... This is of course only true for some types of games, in this case those having Dungeons & Dragons as a set of rules, but what is generally valid is the absolute freedom of interpretation that the game must give to the player. To go back to Kotor, freedom of interpretation is absolutely respected and it is the cornerstone, the real central pivot, around which the entire game revolves. A world full of opportunities It is understood from the very first bars that Kotor is not a classic RPG. Although it is a role-playing game based on the use of the party, we will not consider the members of the party as player characters, but rather as companions on adventures. Each of them has its own backstory, experiences, opinions and small tasks to complete. Among them there will be bickering or nice exchanges of jokes and they will address the player as an entity in their own right. Even during the fight we will be able to direct them individually one at a time by listing only a maximum of four actions to be performed in sequence, for the rest they will be governed by theartificial intelligence filtered by excellent scripts that will make their contribution to the fight more similar to a single combat with valid supports to cover the player's back. Furthermore, although our companions are nine, there is a limitation of a maximum of three party members at the same time, including the player. This means that in the end only two and three favorites will be used among all nine, thus deepening the knowledge of only these. The rest will remain in the shelter, which from the second part of the game onwards will be a spaceship, a Corellian transport forerunner of the glorious Millennium Falcon with which we could freely move throughout the galaxy. In fact, the game is ideally divided into chapters, preceded by a prologue which serves more than anything else to introduce the story and act as a tutorial. After passing the first chapter, the free exploration of the galaxy opens up before us, in this case embodied in different planets that can be visited. Some of them are old acquaintances like Tatooine, others a little less like Manaan. However, the freedom given to the player to explore any planet at any time should not be misleading since in Kotor the concept of freedom of action goes beyond the conception that we all usually attribute to this important component of role-playing games. Unique or atypical? Kotor is a decidedly atypical game in the RPG scene. While it has a strong storyline and thus disembowels the traditional RPG player's hunger for free exploration, it allows for an authentic role-playing experience rarely found in other RPGs. Kotor doesn't even place the accent on the further classic cornerstones on which almost all of the existing RPGs are based, or rather the tactical finesse of the party's strategic arrangement and maneuverability and the painstaking attention to statistics and above all to the inventory. The combat phase is as spectacular and immersive as ever, but it is essentially a single player experience. Inventory management is decidedly cumbersome due to the limitation of the party to three which forces the player to leapfrog in order to be able to remove a weapon in use from a member of the party, choose another member, select the weapon just discharged and so on. Street. Furthermore, at a certain point in the game you will not care about the ~blaster +1~, you will dress the sober clothes of the Jedi or the Sith and as a samurai you will only care about your lightsaber while tons of objects accumulate in the inventory which in the end you will ever use. But in conclusion it doesn't matter since Kotor is a unique and at the same time atypical gaming experience which in the end turns out to be closer to the authentic meaning of role-playing than one might expect. Since isn't the development of our avatar and the ability to play it to the fullest what makes an RPG what it is? The freedom of how, not where Kotor has a rich, gripping and nothing short of cinematically spectacular storyline. It could not be otherwise from a game produced by Lucas Arts. As in all games, this is even more true for RPGs, when there is a strong story, the freedom of action is penalized and vice versa. Role-playing games may or may not offer the player free-to-explore areas in search of quests and adventures that go beyond the main plot, even preferring freedom of action and exploration to the narrative itself, as for example in the saga of The Elder's Scrolls by Bethesda . Kotor, on the other hand, has for its part a plot that is master of the times of the game, through the narration the player is always clear about the primary objectives to be completed and the freedom of exploration is severely limited precisely by the urgency of the facts and events that they follow each other brilliantly. This is not to say that the game is devoid of optional side quests, there are many, extremely diverse and very interesting, just that you will not be able to spend months exploring the sand sea of Tatooine, or get lost in exploring the islands of Manaan since the game for plot needs does not allow it. Freedom of action in Kotor is not expressed through the square kilometers of explorable territory, it is not expressed in the number of soles consumed by our avatar but it is expressed through what authentic role-playing should be or through the absolute freedom of interpretation of the role . The Force, shaper of destinies The Force in the imagination of Star Wars is that energy that pervades and unites everything, a sort of breath of the Dragon for those who have seen Excalibur, an energy that when appropriately channeled provides those whon degree unwonted and terrible powers. But like all things there is the other side of the coin, the use of the Force conditions the fate of the user based on the use made of it. If you use the Force to create and not destroy to redeem and not crush, for the common good and not for personal good then you will pursue the bright side of the Force whose belief is expertly enunciated and pursued by the Jedi Order. If, on the other hand, the Force serves only to crush to give voice to anger, envy and jealousy in order to obtain one's own interest only, then the Force will become a Dark and evil one. The Sith theorize this personal and destructive use of the Force. The clash of these two philosophies of thought is not only physical, it does not transpire only from the all-out war between the Republic defended by the Jedi and Darth Malak, dark lord of the Sith, but it permeates every moment of the game, every action of the player, every word spoken, ultimately everything. The player initially assumes a neutral role, but through his own interpretation, through every single action, every single word his destiny as a character, as a Jedi or as a Sith as a savior and as a destroyer is determined. Every single quest in the game can be solved in two different ways, almost every fight can be avoided, through the attention to be placed in the dialogue and in the actions we are going to perform. Whether our interpretation will lead us to the light or dark side of the Force will only be up to the player to determine. This attention to dialogue, this continuous possibility of solving the quests differently, this authentically forging the destiny that one prefers within the story narrated is the true freedom proposed by Kotor. It's not a freedom of ~where~, in the miles and miles of free exploration, but it's a freedom of ~how~, i.e. how I want to solve a situation, how I want to experience the story, that makes Kotor an authentic RPG. In conclusion In conclusion, Kotor is set in the Star Wars galaxy which, for those who are fascinated by it, is already wonderful in itself. Add to this the variety of areas we're going to visit, planets we're going to explore, races we're going to interact with, nothing in the Star Wars universe has been denied. Being able to apply Force Believing like Obi Wan, being able to swing a lightsaber and deflect laser beams, being able to play as Jedi or Sith, dealing with Hutts, Rodians, Twi'leks and Sandpeople is a dream come true for anyone have devoured the films of the saga over and over again. Outwardly it is supported by a respectable graphics engine and a sound department which, being made directly in the Lucas Arts laboratories, is the best for sound spectacularity and adherence to the setting. Finally Kotor offers a fascinating gaming experience, through the narration of an immersive and spectacular storyline we will be able to play as we please by playing the role we prefer for the salvation of the Republic or for the glory of the Sith. You won't get tired of Kotor soon, although the game is relatively short: about 45 - 50 hours which can be reduced to about thirty without doing the side missions you will soon want to replay it again and again. Finally, let's add one last note for non-purists of role-playing games: you can easily raise the final vote to 9 because Kotor, in its broadest sense of video game and not role-playing game, is worth it. To be able to hear again the menacing musical sound that a lightsaber emits when drawn, but above all to relive the adventure by behaving differently, acting differently, changing the ~how~ we intend to live this unforgettable videogame experience. Pros: Set in the Star Wars galaxy. Unique interpretation possibilities. Use Force powers, as well as lightsabers. Cons: Not suitable for those who want free exploration. Too short Fragmented and confusing party management. The opinions of the editorial staff Daniele ~Falcocadarn~ Falcone's opinion I've played and finished the Xbox version of the game and now I'm practically at the final stages of the PC version. In my view Kotor is a rather disappointing RPG. We often hear about the dichotomy between plot and freedom of exploration present in an RPG. Typically a story-driven game has little freedom to explore and vice versa. Kotor has taken this dichotomy to excess. The plot is undoubtedly good and compelling as well as the reconstruction of the Star Wars universe but the player has no freedom to move during the game. He has the power to choose HOW to solve a mission but he does not have the power to choose WHEN. Playing", "date": "2004-01-21", "grade": null}
