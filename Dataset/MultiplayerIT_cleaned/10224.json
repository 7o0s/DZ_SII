Sword of Fargoal, in this case, was a fascinating mix of action, adventure and RPG. Developed in 1982 by Jeff McCord, the game was released first for the VIC-20 and then for the Commodore 64, gaining enormous popularity among hardcore gamers due to the far from friendly difficulty level, especially in the more advanced stages. The protagonist warrior had to wander through a series of ever deeper dungeons, in search of the mythical Sword of Argoal, and face all the perils of the case. The locations were initially dark, covered by a mist that only cleared as the character passed, and the fog could hide both chests and gold coins as well as traps and enemies to fight. The big novelty of the game consisted of the level-up of the warrior, who as he progressed in the adventure and passed the clashes unscathed became stronger and more cunning. The fights were regulated by a very simple and almost automatic system, but were enriched by the presence of spells that could be used to escape from a potentially deadly situation (teleportation) or to take advantage in various ways (increasing the visible area while moving, creating barriers, making the character invisible, etc.). Thirty years and not hear them Sword of Fargoal, in its version for iPhone and iPod Touch, was born from a project involving Jeff McCord himself and some of his collaborators. It is undoubtedly a tribute to the original video game, made with respect and passion, which, however, right from the start is the classic product for nostalgics only. The reason is simple: the developers have revived the original gameplay and game structure, without modifying them in any way and thus offering users an experience that smacks of retrogaming and has very little to do with the most recent video games available on the market. 'App Store. Our warrior (male or female) explores dungeons, collects treasures, faces enemies and avoids traps just like almost thirty years ago on the Commodore 64. And although the possibility of saving the game between one expedition and another has been introduced, in the same way, the stages must be restarted from scratch as soon as the game over occurs. Exploring the scenario, in short, is a practice that requires care and strategy, because there are traps that can kill us instantly and some difficult opponents that it would be advisable not to face right away ... better to do a little ~leveling up~ first ~. The list of available spells has remained the same: drift (to overcome a trap unscathed), light (increases the character's ~field of vision~), invisibility (makes us invisible to enemies), regeneration (makes us recover vital energy), teleport (the aforementioned teleporter) and shield (a shield that, in the iPhone version, remains active until destroyed). The enemies are also the same, always very varied between archers, mercenaries, trolls, rangers, assassins, etc. The control system does not use the classic virtual d-pad, but rather sees us ~indicate~ our character the direction in which we want to move: as a solution it is not very immediate or precise, unfortunately. A double tap on the touch screen results in a zoom of the map. Technically a complete restyling has been carried out, but graphics and sound appear very dated in any case: the sprites are practically devoid of animations and move around the scenario like pawns on a chessboard, the effects closely resemble those of the original version.
