Finally arrives in digital format, thanks to the hands of DoubleSix Games and distributed by Deep Silver. This version faithfully follows the TV show, for better or for worse as we will see later. Where's Gerry? Broadcast for more than ten years and distributed all over the world, the quiz presents an extremely simple and effective formula, a spectator chosen after a special test called ~fastest finger~ is asked to answer fifteen questions, to win the equivalent final figure , in fact, at one million Euros. The questions are of increasing difficulty, have four answers of which only one is correct, and embrace the most disparate topics, from general culture, history and geography. In the intrepid ascent to riches, the competitor can resort to three aids that have characterized this transmission. The first is called 50:50, where the computer is asked to eliminate two of the wrong answers, thus increasing the player's chances. The second directly asks the audience to respond, however it is a suggestion that always leaves the final choice to the contestant. The third represents a timed phone call, which can be made to acquaintances to get help in answering. The latter is rather unique, as there are no impositions on the means possibly used by the appears to solve the question, even if the randomness of the phone call and the limited time usually play against the competitor. Each correct answer increases the prize money, and it is possible to abandon by obtaining a large sum even without having completed the game, provided however that one of the three stages is reached every five questions. The various anecdotes about aids in the real game are hilarious, such as the competitor John Carpenter, who in the 1999 US edition used the phone call only to inform his father of the imminent win, which actually happened! Packages for everyone Who wants to Be a Millionaire? The special editions faithfully simulates the rules listed above, relating to the classic edition, in the context of a video game with rather impressive graphics. Unfortunately, the conductor is not our beloved Gerry Scotti, who with his undoubted talent has given so much to the show, but should we be satisfied with the polygonal version of a generic presenter, a rejuvenated Chris Tarrant? Up to four players can participate in the race, with the significant advantage of being able to use the same controller for everyone, as the game is basically turn-based. The technical realization, as we said, is of an excellent level, and once again demonstrates the validity of the Unreal Engine used here. Even more impressive is the rendering of the atmosphere of the transmission, replicated to near perfect levels. From the various musical motifs that mark the phases of the game to the endless pauses between the chosen answer and the final response (the famous ~shall we turn it on~?), which greatly increase the involvement. This digital edition also offers the possibility of purchasing additional packages to customize the games, the dlc dedicated to South Park and the world of cinema are already available online. South Park in particular, in addition to being based on questions related to the cartoon, also brings the same graphic style, a feature that will surely be appreciated by fans. Xbox 360 goals The game features the classic 200 player points, typical of Live Arcade, divided across 12 objectives. This is one of the titles where achieving the perfect score takes time more than skill. Only half of the objectives are achieved by reaching the finish line of the fifteenth question, the others underline easily replicable possibilities and conditions of the game, especially with the aids already described in the review. Good answers everyone! Better accompanied Unfortunately, some nodes begin to come home to roost by playing alone. The database follows the high quality level of the real format, with questions ranging from disarming banalities to really challenging questions, but the presence of pitfalls is often excessive and it is not uncommon to find them even among the first questions, which are theoretically easier. The aids lose something of the original charm, if they can go 50:50 and public response, the phone call home is not reasonably replicable and leaves the player with a somewhat annoying false feeling. Playing single, even the initial test of the fastest finger makes little sense, if not for a specific objective, and the impossibility of jumpingthe scenes make the games tedious in the long run. The biggest problem is represented by the lack of a real time limit to give the answer, which is also the prerogative of transmission, but actually in this way it is difficult to resist the temptation to consult the Internet to solve the question. A significantly different speech in the company, where the competition between players manages to make up for, even if the absence of any online mode, probably legitimized by the reasons mentioned above, represents a serious shortcoming in terms of the longevity of the product. Network support is limited to scores and nothing more. Who wants to Be a Millionaire? The special editions is therefore a pleasant version of the program, especially enjoyable for those who love the atmosphere, faithfully replicated, and for those who want to spend a few hours in company with friends or family. Unfortunately, the title is much less enjoyable alone, and if it is understandable that this is not the ideal context for using the product, the absence of any online mode implies that, in the absence of human opponents, boredom risks taking over once all objectives have been achieved.
