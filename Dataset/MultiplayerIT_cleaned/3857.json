Mobile gaming is no exception and so, after the Russian open world driving game CarX Street, which managed to consolidate that kind of structure on iOS and Android, here comes Static Shift Racing.Of course, it is a project with prerogatives substantially different: made by a tiny Australian team, Timbo Jimbo, the title includes a freely explorable but small map, as well as a limited fleet of cars, but at the same time tries to manage progression so that you are unable to unlock everything the package has to offer after just a couple of hours. Is this a guessed approach? We tell you about it in the Static Shift Racing review. Structure: a small open world Static Shift Racing, our car in the middle of a challenge Static Shift Racing is an open world driving game, as written at the beginning, with a very small map, which can be explored freely, but only at night. Progression is managed through series of events: those marked with a yellow indicator are particularly quick to complete and consist of short sprints or drift challenges, while those with a blue indicator involve greater effort and consume a ~ticket~. Yes, the Timbo Jimbo title uses the now traditional freemium mechanism which provides for the consumption of tickets for each major event and their recovery over time or with the rewards obtained upon completion of each series. Many users are annoyed at similar solutions, but it must be said that during our tests we never ran out of tickets, for one reason or another, and therefore we believe that the system has been well implemented. It is possible to experience the open world of Static Shift Racing and physically reach the starting point of each individual challenge, or simply open the map, tap a marker and make a quick transfer (and free, unlike the aforementioned CarX Street - here the review) to substantially speed up operations and proceed more quickly, so as to ring together different series and level up: you need to reach at least the fifth level to start talking about upgrades. Here, this progression sipped on the one hand enhances the small rewards that are obtained from time to time, starting with the aesthetic objects that can be used to customize your car and that do not require an outlay of credits such as to affect the nest egg that we are setting aside to buy a new car; on the other it appears in clear contrast with what usually happens in the mobile sector and is confirmed as an expedient capable of masking the few contents of the game. Gameplay: drift mon amour Static Shift Racing, a race based on drifts In terms of gameplay, there is no doubt that Static Shift Racer manages to convince: vehicle control is oriented towards an arcade approach but not too marked, the use of the brake remains essential and in drift-based challenges you have to act continuously on the controls to avoid crashing into a wall, an eventuality that not only resets the score relating to the maneuver but often forces you to start the race all over again. Of course, it is strange that the controls are only touch, without resorting to the accelerometer or at least to a automatic acceleration system that would have made some situations a little less cumbersome. The layout from this point of view is very clear: two arrows on the left side of the screen to steer, while on the right we find the accelerator, brake and handbrake. As it is easy to imagine, the latter triggers the skid which must then be controlled with the steering wheel. Static Shift Racing includes several very nice cosmetic customizations The game supports Bluetooth controllers and it goes without saying that in this way everything changes: although some elements of the interface are still managed via touch, once on the track it is possible to use the triggers to accelerate and brake (unfortunately without any vibration), the left stick to steer and the main buttons to operate the handbrake and any nitro, which is loaded as usual by performing acrobatic maneuvers. Unfortunately, even in terms of variety, the experience of Static Shift Racer proves to be limited: the types of events available are repeated again and again, which inevitably creates a bit of fatigue at some point. Multiplayer is coming in an upcoming update, as well as new cars and hopefully an expAnxiety of the scenario that drives us to explore it with enthusiasm instead of falling back on fast travels. Technical realization: a beautiful sight Static Shift Racing, our car launched in a gallery There is something in the visual style of Static Shift Racing that really convinces: although many of the assets used for the scenarios are generic and already widely seen, the general rendering of the graphics appears excellent and on the iPhone 14 Pro it moves at 60 fps without causing the overheating of the device, which is very important these days. It's just a pity that slowdowns occur in some situations. It's probably the design of the cars, so few but so damned Japanese and from the 80s, that makes the difference. As you drift along those ring roads it seems a bit like being on the pages of Initial D, accompanied by a soundtrack composed of songs by emerging artists, ranging from metal to hip hop: the selection isn't particularly rich, but listen to it it is very pleasant.", "date": "2023-01-29", "grade": "7.0"}
